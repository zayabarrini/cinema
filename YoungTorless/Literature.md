Young Torless, Schlondorff, Lacan, Sade
Past Lives, The Hours, The Banshees of Inesherin
Too old to die Young

Young Torless is a good movie because of enlightenment on jouissance, on the sadomasochistic scene.
A obra de Sade é completamente única nesse sentido. 
Outros autores falam sobre a maldade e há milhares de filmes de horror. 
As pessoas sabem que a maldade existe.
E que há uma estética da destruição. Há gozo em destruir, em rasgar, em matar, em maldizer. 
Destruction, hence, like creation, is one of nature's mandates. 
Sem isso, há um atrator infinito da melancolia da tragédia. Devastação. 
Culpa e reparação. 
Ponto de basta para culpa, reparação, melancolia, angústia. Basta desse chororo. 
Ele goza assim e pronto. E vai lidar com as consequências desse gozo. 

Too old to die Young is a good production because of aesthetics, silence, sound and color
It's delicious to watch. 

Past Lives, The Hours, The Banshees of Inesherin are good movies because of silence, anguish, the characters
They're lovely. The dialog is beautiful. The scene composition and colors are beautiful. 
They're beautiful and pure.
