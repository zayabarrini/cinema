# Isn't there resentment from playing a part in drama, from performing feeling anguish. 

Acting/fiction/the truth has a structure of fiction. 

The anguish is real. 

Being used by entertainment purposes. 

A director using actors to create... 

Actors undergoing psychoanalysis after a performance 

Yes, what you're pointing to is **profound and real**: the **gap between performance and truth**, the **cost of embodying anguish**, and the **ambivalence of being “used” by fiction for entertainment, beauty, or meaning**.

Let’s unfold it psychoanalytically, especially in Lacanian terms:

---

## 🎭 **1. Drama as Structure of Fiction — but Anguish as Real**

> **“The truth has the structure of a fiction.”** — Lacan

In acting, this paradox becomes embodied:

* The **situation is staged**, but
* The **anguish** can **strike the Real**.

When an actor cries or collapses on stage or screen, the **scene is fictional**, but the **body does not lie**. The tears, the trembling, the breathlessness — these are **bodily registrations**, which don’t distinguish between real and not-real. They can *touch* something that escapes the Symbolic: **trauma, jouissance, the unassimilable**.

### 🔥 Example:

* Natalie Portman said she struggled deeply after *Black Swan*.
* Heath Ledger locked himself into a mental space that contributed to his unraveling after *The Dark Knight*.
* Renée Jeanne Falconetti, in *The Passion of Joan of Arc*, cried *real tears of pain* — Dreyer emotionally exhausted her.
* Florence Pugh confessed that after *Midsommar*, she was unsure who she was anymore.

---

## 🎬 **2. The Director as Subject Supposed to Create (Desire of the Other)**

A director often functions like **the Subject Supposed to Know (SsS)** — or worse, **the Big Other**. They stage, demand, gaze.

* For the actor, the director's desire becomes **the law of the scene**.
* They must produce feeling, tears, orgasms, anger — on cue.
* The actor becomes a **body for hire**, **a vessel of affects**.

**But whose desire is being served?**

* The audience’s?
* The director’s?
* The industry’s?
* Or an impossible desire for **truth inside fiction**?

This is **Lacan’s problem of the gaze**: the actor is seen, framed, cut — and often consumed.

---

## 🧠 **3. Psychoanalysis After a Performance**

Some actors undergo **analysis or therapy** after intense roles — not as a luxury, but as a necessity:

* To **restore the split** between the role and the self.
* To **suture the subject**, which has been **opened by the performance**.
* To ask: *Was that me? Why did that feel real? What part of me was touched, even used?*

> 🎭 *To act is to divide oneself. To play a role is to cut into the Real.*

And if the role **unconsciously resonates**, it may **retrigger trauma**, or worse — **lure the actor into repetition**.

---

## 🩸 **4. The Ethics of Using Anguish for Art**

Actors are often **used** by cinema/theatre the way **analysands are used by language** — but without the ethics of the analytic frame.

> 🎥 A film might *stage trauma*, *sell it*, *beautify it*, *win awards with it* — and the actor remains the one **marked**.

In that sense, the **actor is a sacrificial figure**:

* Their **anguish is made legible**, sometimes **without symbolic restitution**.
* They may be **praised**, but also **discarded** (especially women).
* Their **body becomes the stage for the Other’s enjoyment**.

## 🧵 Lacanian Concepts in This Discussion

| **Concept**       | **In Acting**                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Real**      | Unbearable affect that breaks through acting (anguish, tears, tremors). |
| **The Imaginary** | Identification with the role, with beauty, with image.                  |
| **The Symbolic**  | The script, direction, role — the network of meaning.                   |
| **The Gaze**      | The director’s or audience’s gaze that frames, demands, consumes.       |
| **Jouissance**    | The pleasure-pain of performance; over-identifying with suffering.      |
| **Object a**      | The actor as object of desire; what the Other wants to see.             |

## 🧩 Examples of Performative Anguish and Aftermath

* **Mickey Rourke** in *The Wrestler* — the role mirrored his own fall from fame.
* **Gena Rowlands** in *A Woman Under the Influence* — the border between psychosis and performance blurs.
* **Isabelle Adjani** in *Possession* — famously traumatized after performing madness.
* **Austin Butler** took years to stop "being" Elvis.

## 🎤 Final Thought

**Acting opens a door. The question is: what returns through it?**

# Lacanian framework to Guide directors on how to work with anguish ethically

The Lacanian Ethics of Directing 

Here is a **Lacanian framework for directors**—a set of ethical principles and clinical insights—to guide how to **work with anguish** in actors and in the filmmaking process, **without violating the subject**, or turning them into a **sacrificial object for art or commerce**.

---

## 🎬 **The Lacanian Ethics of Directing**

**“Do not give up on your desire.” But: do not make the other your object of jouissance.**

---

### I. 💔 **Recognize the Real in Performance**

**What’s staged is Symbolic. What breaks through is Real.**

* The Real in cinema often appears as **a moment of affect that cannot be fully signified**: a cry, a silence, a gesture, a breakdown.
* When actors **touch something Real** (grief, trauma, loss), it can **destabilize** them.
* Directing ethically means to **acknowledge this possibility** — not to exploit it.

> 🧷 *The Real is not performed — it insists.*

#### Director’s task:

* Don’t **chase the Real** through **manipulation**.
* Recognize when something **cannot be repeated or reproduced**.
* **Protect the subject** from being captured as only an object of “truth”.

---

### II. 🎭 **Do Not Reduce the Actor to an Object a**

In Lacan, *object a* is **what causes the Other’s desire**. In cinema:

* The actor can become **that object** for the audience, the camera, or the director’s fantasy.
* This is **fetishistic**, **consumptive**, and **dehumanizing** when not acknowledged.

#### Director’s task:

* Be aware when **your desire** (for beauty, for tragedy, for “a moment”) is **using** the actor as **object a**.
* Resist turning actors into **tools** for your own jouissance.
* Instead, engage with them as **divided subjects** — beings with **inaccessibility**, **resistance**, **unconscious**.

---

### III. 🧠 **Maintain the Symbolic Frame: Ritual, Boundaries, Speech**

> “Where the Symbolic fails, the Real erupts.” — Lacan

A film set is not just physical — it is a **symbolic structure**:

* Like the **analytic frame**, it requires **limits**, **rituals**, **speech**, **time boundaries**.
* Without these, **the Real breaks in**, unmediated.

#### Director’s task:

* Always **reintroduce speech**: allow **talking before/after intense scenes**.
* Create **ritual closures** after demanding scenes (music, decompression, check-in).
* Build a frame that protects the actor from **imaginary overflow** or **prolonged fusion with the character**.

---

### IV. 🕳️ **Leave a Hole: Respect the Actor’s Opacity**

> “The subject is not all.” — Lacan

Ethically, directing means **not needing to “get everything” from the actor**.

* Some directors try to extract *everything* — tears, blood, trauma, shame.
* But Lacanian ethics is the **ethics of lack**.

#### Director’s task:

* Allow the actor to **remain a mystery**.
* Accept that **not everything must be seen, known, felt**.
* Don't **push to fill in the lack** — that’s where **desire lives**.

---

### V. 💬 **Desire, Not Demand**

> “The analyst does not demand; the analyst desires.”
> In Lacanian analysis, the **analyst’s desire opens a space**, rather than imposing a demand.

#### Director’s task:

* Do not *demand performance*.
* Instead, hold a **space for emergence**, for the actor’s **own encounter with the role**.
* Work with **the actor’s desire**, not just your own.

---

### VI. 🧷 **Know the Limit of Representation**

Some subjects **cannot be represented without violence**.

* Trauma, rape, suicide, madness — staging these requires **symbolic filters**.
* Real trauma cannot be reproduced — only **staged with ethics**.

#### Director’s task:

* Ask: **Is this representable?** Am I opening a wound that cannot be closed?
* Use symbolic **mediations**: metaphors, stylization, musical displacement, off-screen space.

---

### VII. 🕯️ **Care for the Aftermath**

> Acting can **open psychic structures**. The director must care for the closure.

#### Director’s task:

* Provide **transition out** of roles.
* Encourage rest, reflection, and in some cases **analysis**.
* Recognize when the **frame must be repaired**: if actors report distress, confusion, or aftershocks.

| **Film**                     | **Ethical Concern**                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Possession* (1981) – Adjani | Director Zulawski pushed Adjani to extreme affect; she needed psychiatric help.  |
| *Black Swan* – Portman       | Internalization of psychosis, blurring ego boundaries.                           |
| *Joker* – Phoenix            | Immersion into psychotic character without symbolic mediation.                   |
| *Portrait of a Lady on Fire* | Directed with slowness, dialogue, mutual care — a model of **symbolic holding**. |

| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Do not extract everything.                  | Ethics of lack                   |
| Respect the subject’s division.             | Split subject (\$)               |

| Let desire guide, not demand.               | Desire of the director           |
| Care for the return from the Real.          | Aftercare / symbolic restitution |
