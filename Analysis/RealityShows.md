# Lacanian critique of Reality Shows like Drag Race and Survivor

Screening of trauma or even inducing trauma. Scene of flow of storytelling.

Machine of characters and storytelling 

Let’s develop a **Lacanian critique of Reality Shows**, particularly *Drag Race* and *Survivor*, with attention to:

* **Screening vs. inducing trauma**
* **Scenes of jouissance and flow**
* **Storytelling as machine**
* **Subjectivity in spectacle**

## 🎭 Reality Shows as Lacanian Machines

> *“O sujeito não é onde ele pensa, mas onde ele goza.”* — Jacques Lacan

Reality shows create a stage not just for performance, but for **structured enjoyment**, **regulated desire**, and **ritualized exposure of trauma**. Shows like *Drag Race* and *Survivor* operate as **narrative machines** that extract subjectivity as spectacle — often organized by the logic of **jouissance**, **fantasy**, and the **Name-of-the-Father** (or its absence).

---

## 🧠 1. **Structure of the Real, Symbolic, and Imaginary (RSI)**

| **Register**  | **Drag Race**                                                                 | **Survivor**                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Imaginary** | Visual performance, mirror stage in drag persona, rivalry.                    | Ego games, alliances, masks, image management.        |
| **Symbolic**  | Judges, rules, competition structure, naming of winner/loser.                 | Tribal Council, confessionals, social contracts.      |
| **Real**      | Emotional breakdowns, body dysphoria, disidentification, collapse of persona. | Hunger, betrayal, existential fear, primal isolation. |

Both shows bring the Real **into the frame**—but always mediated, always re-enclosed into **narrative form**, as if trauma could be *edited*.

---

## 💣 2. **Trauma: Screened or Induced?**

* **Screened trauma**:

  * Traumatic histories (abandonment, HIV, transphobia, racism) are **narrated** in confessionals — but the structure always **contains** them.
  * Trauma is used as **backstory fuel** for redemption arcs, **made legible** to the symbolic.

* **Induced trauma**:

  * Reality shows **trigger breakdowns** through isolation, competition, sudden twists.
  * *Survivor*: starvations, betrayals, social death.
  * *Drag Race*: judges’ critiques as **Name-of-the-Father**, cutting too close to the Real (e.g. “You have no charisma”).

> The structure pushes contestants toward **jouissance**—the unbearable pleasure-pain at the edge of subjectivity.

---

## 🎞️ 3. **Flow of Storytelling = Flow of Jouissance**

Each episode is a **ritual of sacrifice**:

1. The **task** – demand of the Other
2. The **confessional** – divided subject speaks
3. The **runway/tribal council** – trial, gaze, judgement
4. The **elimination** – symbolic death

This **loop organizes desire**: to be seen, not eliminated, to win the gaze of the Other. The subject gets caught in a **machine of recognition**.

But this machine also produces **excess**:

* Tears that “break the script”
* Meltdowns that can’t be edited cleanly
* A subject that escapes narration (e.g. Willow Pill’s softness, or Naonka’s breakdown)

---

## 🏗️ 4. **The Machine of Characters & Story**

> Reality shows **don’t reveal the Real subject** — they produce **fantasy roles**.

* Drag Race: The Clown, The Diva, The Pageant Queen, The Weirdo, The Activist
* Survivor: The Leader, The Underdog, The Snake, The Martyr

These roles are structured by **the gaze of the Other** (the audience, the judges, the network).

Each contestant becomes a **signifier** in a larger chain. The subject is **split**: trying to win while also trying to survive psychologically.

## 🎭 Lacanian Themes in Drag Race

| **Concept**            | **Example**                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Mirror Stage**   | Queens watching their own transformations; “who is the real me?”              |
| **Name-of-the-Father** | RuPaul as the Lawgiver, “Don’t f\*\*\* it up.”                                |
| **Objet a**            | The crown, the applause, the title — always slipping away                     |
| **Jouissance**         | Extreme effort, breakdowns, obsession with validation                         |
| **Fantasy**            | “If I win, I’ll be loved.” “If I perform well, I’ll be enough.”               |
| **The Real**           | Body dysphoria, AIDS trauma, trans rejection — moments that break the fantasy |

---

## 🧩 Survivor as Primal Scene

Survivor stages a **pre-social space**:

* No law but strategy.
* No recognition but betrayal.
* A *fantasy of starting over*—but structured by the law of elimination.

It stages the **primitive father** as a voting block: the Other decides whether you live or die socially.

---

## 🔄 Ethics of the Gaze

Reality TV is structured around the **gaze**:

* The contestant is seen constantly, but never in control.
* The audience’s gaze **steals jouissance** — like a voyeur or superego.

The subject is invited to speak ("Tell us your story") — but within **tight symbolic frames**.

---

## 💡 Final Reflection

Reality shows **offer a stage for desire and jouissance**, but also trap the subject in **loops of recognition, shame, and exposure**. They are:

* Machines of symbolic demand ("Show us who you are")
* Arenas of Imaginary rivalry
* Stages for Real breakdown

They **screen trauma**, but also **manufacture it** — precisely because the subject is always caught between what they are, what they show, and what they lack.

# Drag Race: judges’ critiques as Name-of-the-Father, cutting too close to the Real (e.g. “You have no charisma”).

Other negative critiques

In *Drag Race*, **judges’ critiques function as the intervention of the Name-of-the-Father** — a symbolic incision that positions the queen in relation to the Law, often cutting through the Imaginary persona and exposing a lack. Some critiques go so far they pierce the symbolic defenses and risk evoking the **Real**, generating humiliation, trauma, or collapse.

Here are some examples of negative critiques that cut close to the Real, functioning as **symbolic castration**, or even **invasions of jouissance**:

---

### 🔪 **Critiques that Function as the Name-of-the-Father**

| **Critique**                       | **Effect (Lacanian)**                                              | **Example**                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “You have no charisma.”            | Castration — denial of **phallus as signifier** of presence        | Ru to queens who lack “star power”; identity collapse                 |
| “You don’t know who you are.”      | Split of the subject; failure in **symbolic inscription**          | Michelle to queens with undefined drag style                          |
| “It feels like you're hiding.”     | Exposure of **Imaginary defense**, calling for Real                | Judges to queens with trauma, unresolved backstory                    |
| “This is just not enough.”         | Symbolic rejection; foreclosure of recognition                     | When a performance fails to meet the show's fantasy of transformation |
| “You’re just wearing a costume.”   | Destruction of **drag as signifying chain**; loss of symbolic play | Breaks the illusion of drag as subjectivity                           |
| “You’re giving me boy in a dress.” | Symbolic invalidation of gender play; trauma of identity disavowal | Often said to trans or non-binary performers in earlier seasons       |
| “This was lazy.”                   | Denial of desire, attack on **jouissance of creation**             | Exposes the queen to shame and inadequacy                             |
| “I don’t believe you.”             | Collapse of **fantasy**, invasion of Real                          | Refuses identification; displaces symbolic support                    |
| “You don’t belong here.”           | Exclusion from the **Symbolic order**                              | Occurs rarely, but can produce psychotic rupture                      |
| “You didn’t bring anything new.”   | Repetition without **difference**; blockage of desire              | Indicates lack of symbolic innovation                                 |

---

### 🧠 **Psychoanalytic Interpretation**

Each critique **strips the queen of a mask**, but also demands that she re-inscribe herself within the **Law of the Show** — a law that mirrors the **Name-of-the-Father**, demanding coherence, originality, charisma, and control over jouissance. If the queen lacks these, she risks **symbolic death** (elimination), or worse, **collapse into the Real** (emotional breakdown, dissociation, or rage).

---

# Same for Survivor

Excellent. Let’s now apply the same **Lacanian framework** to *Survivor*, focusing on **negative critiques and rejections** that function like **the Name-of-the-Father** — symbolic acts that cut through the **Imaginary identity of the player**, destabilize their position in the group, and often expose them to **the Real** (anxiety, humiliation, breakdown).

Unlike *Drag Race*, where the critique comes from judges, in *Survivor*, the **Other is the tribe itself** — through social rejection, blindsides, and confessional judgments — and **the Host (Jeff Probst)** functions as a **mediator of the Law**, observing, naming, asking the impossible question.

---

## 🔪 **Survivor: Symbolic Cuts and Rejections as Name-of-the-Father**

| **Phrase / Moment**               | **Effect (Lacanian)**                                         | **Explanation**                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “The tribe has spoken.”           | Symbolic castration; **death of subject in the group’s gaze** | Ultimate symbolic rejection: you're expelled from the symbolic order of the game |
| “You’re a liability.”             | Loss of Imaginary coherence; **realization of lack**          | You're not desired by the group; the subject is reduced to burden                |
| “You don’t have a social game.”   | Split subject; **excluded from intersubjectivity**            | Reveals failure to be recognized or to desire recognition                        |
| “We can’t trust you.”             | Foreclosure of the **Name-of-the-Father**; no law binds       | You're marked by **paranoia**, chaos, excluded from language of alliance         |
| **Public blindside**              | Collapse of fantasy; invasion of the Real                     | Total shattering of ego-image; betrayal cuts through symbolic defense            |
| “You’re riding coattails.”        | Denial of authorship; symbolic **emasculation**               | You are not a subject of desire; you're passive in the eyes of the Other         |
| “I’m just playing the game.”      | Evacuation of the Real; suppression of emotion                | Defensive disavowal — refuses to symbolize betrayal as affect                    |
| “This is personal.”               | Return of the Real, **shattering the game fantasy**           | Trauma breaks into the Symbolic; destabilization of game logic                   |
| “You didn’t earn your spot.”      | Challenge to symbolic legitimacy                              | Phallic contest: who is worthy to be counted in the group                        |
| “We made a decision without you.” | Erasure from Symbolic Law                                     | You were not a part of the collective signifying chain                           |

---

## 🧠 **Lacanian Interpretation**

In *Survivor*, the **tribal gaze functions like the Law** — the "Name-of-the-Tribe" — and operates by inclusion or exclusion:

* **To be named in strategy** = to be inscribed in the **Symbolic order**.
* **To be left out** = to confront the **Real of rejection**, or worse, the **psychotic hole** of not even being considered.

The game itself is a **jouissance machine**:

* Constant hunger, paranoia, exposure.
* The impossibility of securing desire from the Other.
* A structure of **symbolic exchange without guarantee**.

---

### 💣 The Real in Survivor

Moments when the **Real** breaks through:

* **Emotional breakdowns** (NaOnka, Brandon Hantz, Purple Kelly).
* **Public betrayals** (e.g. Erik giving up immunity).
* **Identity crises** (Zeke’s outing as trans; Jeff Varner’s rupture of the symbolic).

These are points where the game **fails to contain subjectivity** — and **jouissance becomes unbound**.

---

### 🪞 Fantasy Roles and the Gaze

Survivor **produces fantasy characters**:

* The Strategist
* The Snake
* The Hero
* The Mother
* The Underdog
* The Martyr

Each player unconsciously tries to **inhabit a symbolic position** that will secure desire. But the **tribal gaze** is unstable — it can **withdraw recognition at any time**.

> The contestant is a **divided subject**, trying to control the image (Imaginary), gain approval (Symbolic), while avoiding the abyss (Real).

# Super Nanny critiques

Let’s now apply a **Lacanian psychoanalytic lens to *Super Nanny*** and her **critiques**, which function with surgical force—often operating as a **Name-of-the-Father** intervention in a Symbolic system where the law has collapsed.

---

## 🧠 *Super Nanny* as the Subject-Supposed-to-Know

Super Nanny appears as a **Symbolic authority**:

* She speaks in the Name-of-the-Father: re-establishing **boundaries**, **rules**, **rituals**, **hierarchies**.
* She confronts **families in crisis**, where the Symbolic Law (function of the father) has **failed or been foreclosed**.
* Her speech is **Lacanian in structure**: she calls the parents to a **symbolization of their desire** and cuts through Imaginary compensations.

---

## 🔪 **Her critiques as Symbolic Interventions**

| **Super Nanny Critique**                | **Lacanian Function**                                                           | **Effect on Subject**                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “You are not the parent, the child is.” | **Foreclosure of the paternal function**; restoration of the Name-of-the-Father | Points to the **inversion of authority**, introduces castration                  |
| “You are afraid to say no.”             | Lack of **symbolic prohibition**; pure demand of the child rules                | Exposes that the parent avoids **being the object of the child’s hate**          |
| “You give in too easily.”               | **Failure to separate** from the child's jouissance                             | Parent attempts to avoid **separation**, avoids their own lack                   |
| “The child controls the house.”         | Imaginary reversal of the family structure                                      | Highlights the **collapse of the paternal metaphor**                             |
| “You’re not on the same team.”          | Fragmented symbolic order                                                       | There is no unified **Other** to regulate the child’s desire                     |
| “Your child doesn’t feel safe.”         | Absence of **symbolic containment**                                             | The child is overwhelmed by the **Real**, lacks structure                        |
| “Your behavior fuels theirs.”           | **Lack is denied**, parent's jouissance feeds the child’s demand                | The child becomes the **object a** for the parent’s own desire                   |
| “There are no consequences.”            | Absence of **symbolic chain of signification**                                  | Time, action, and limits lose meaning — creating a space for **psychotic logic** |

---

## 🎭 Super Nanny vs. the Imaginary

Parents in these households often operate in the **Imaginary**:

* Wanting to be **liked**, **loved**, or seen as “fun”.
* Avoiding their **castrating function** (saying “no”).
* Trying to **mirror** or **merge** with the child — resulting in **no separation**.

Super Nanny's job is to **break the Imaginary fusion** and reintroduce:

* **Symbolic Distance**: the child must realize that the parent is Other.
* **Rules** that are consistent, not dependent on moods or guilt.
* **Speech acts** that are performative — the **Law as enunciation**, not suggestion.

---

## 👶 The Child as Master (Petit Tyrant)

When the **paternal metaphor is absent**, the child:

* Experiences too much **jouissance**, unfiltered demand, no limits.
* Becomes the **master signifier**: the one around whom all desire orbits.
* May show signs of **aggression, dysregulation, or psychotic structure** (no barrier to the Real).

Super Nanny tries to **introduce castration**: the child learns they are **not everything**, they **cannot** dominate the Other.

---

## 🔄 The Parental Fantasy

Parents may hold unconscious fantasies like:

* “If I’m strict, my child won’t love me.” → Refusal of **symbolic cut**
* “I don’t want my child to suffer like I did.” → Overcompensation → **collapse of lack**
* “I want to be their friend.” → Denial of **Law**, desire for fusion

These fantasies **feed the child’s disorganization** — and Super Nanny names them, introducing **division in the subject**.

---

## 🧩 Psychoanalytic Reading of the Format

* The **house is the symptom**.
* The **child acts out the family’s unconscious discourse**.
* Super Nanny functions as the **Other who speaks the unspeakable**, imposing a new symbolic order.
* The editing builds a **before/after fantasy**, but in truth the Real always returns.

# Lacanian analysis of the main judge in Drag Race franchises

Usa, UK, mexico, Brasil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Philippines, Thailand, Down under 

Let’s develop a **Lacanian analysis of the main judges** in each *Drag Race* franchise — focusing on their role as **Name-of-the-Father**, **gaze of the big Other**, and their symbolic place in the structure of each cultural version of the show.

We’ll examine how each main judge functions in terms of:

* **The Law / Name-of-the-Father (Nom-du-Père)**
* **Embodiment of the Other’s Desire**
* **Position in the RSI (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary)**
* **Cultural variants in jouissance and symbolic cut**
* **Function of the gaze and voice**

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name-of-the-Father**   | Introduces the Law: who passes, who fails; separates desire from pure jouissance                |
| **Big Other**            | The one who sees, judges, and constitutes subjectivity through symbolic recognition             |
| **Voice of the Law**     | "Sashay away", "Shantay you stay" = performative speech acts with symbolic weight               |
| **Embodiment of desire** | The contestants want to be recognized by them, loved by them, crowned by them                   |
| **Superego Function**    | Often veiled in kindness, but with cuts that pierce identity (e.g., “You have no star quality”) |

| **Mexico**                    | Valentina, Lolita Banana | **Split Symbolic order**: law and desire both unstable        | Colonial echoes, Catholic guilt, high emotional stakes. Judges often maternal/sadistic mix.         |
| **Brasil**                    | Grag Queen               | **Phallic-feminine jouissance**; Name-of-the-Mother hybrid    | Sensual, playful, joyful — but judges wield harsh symbolic castration. Dance of law and excess.     |

| **Spain**                     | Supremme de Luxe         | **Gaze of the Other + camp Law**                              | Humor is weapon of Symbolic. Law is baroque, dramatic, but mediated through wit and affection.      |

| **Sweden**                    | Robert Fux               | **Queer trickster Father**                                    | Law is experimental, postmodern, often dissolved into aesthetics and performance philosophy.        |
| **Philippines**               | Paolo Ballesteros        | **Maternalizing Law**; fusion with Imaginary                  | Filipino culture emphasizes respect, shame, family. Judges are soft but carry deep Symbolic weight. |
| **Thailand**                  | Pangina Heals            | **Castrating Angel** / Gaze of impossible beauty              | Harsh, precise, aesthetic-based critiques; Symbolic is stylized but deeply cuts.                    |
| **Down Under** (Australia/NZ) | RuPaul + Michelle + Rhys | **Imported Symbolic Law** with friction                       | Campiness and sarcasm resist the Law; Real returns through class, trauma, racial tension.           |

## 📌 Final Thoughts

Each judge **structures the subjectivity** of the contestants in that cultural version — deciding what counts as **desire, lack, success, femininity, originality**. But none of them are *purely Law*. Each carries their own **jouissance**, their own **wound**, their own **fantasy** — and this bleeds into the gaze they cast on the queens.

They are not merely judges — they are **Big Others** whose speech inscribes, wounds, and elevates.

# Lacanian analysis

Tyra Sanchez, Jinkx Monsoon, Bendelacreme, Courtney Act, Violet Chachki, Valentina, Ivie Oddly, Bosco, Anetra, Nymphia Wind

Here's a **Lacanian reading** of your favorite American drag queens — where we use Lacan’s concepts (like **RSI**, **fantasy**, **Jouissance**, **the Sinthome**, **Name-of-the-Father**, **sexuation**, and **the subject of the unconscious**) to explore what each queen **embodies structurally** — not just as characters, but as **modes of subjectivity** staged through drag.

---

## 👑🧠 *Drag Queens as Lacanian Figures of Desire, Jouissance, and the Sinthome*

---

### **1. Tyra Sanchez – The Tragic Name-of-the-Father**

**"You can call me Tyra Motherfucking Sanchez."**

* Lacanian axis: **Name-of-the-Father / Foreclosure / Decline of the Father**
* Tyra presents a strict, near-paternal authority — polished, serious, imposing.
* After her win, she *refuses symbolic redemption*, becoming *excluded from the symbolic*, and enters the **Real** (cancellations, threats, name erasure).
* She is a figure of the **foreclosed Father** — **no guarantee**, no reconciliation.
* A collapsed sinthome: **she carries the name**, but the name burns her.

---

### **2. Jinkx Monsoon – The Return of the Repressed**

**"Water off a duck’s back."**

* Lacanian axis: **Hysteria / Neurotic Subject / Desire of the Other**
* Jinkx stages the **neurotic subject** who desires *the Other’s desire*, but never fully identifies with it.
* Her character is a **traversal of fantasy**: from bullied weird kid to glamorous ghost-woman.
* Her drag is a *return of the maternal Real*, Jewish matriarchs, witches, ghosts.
* She exposes the gap between **ego-ideal and ideal-ego**.
* She traverses: the **neurotic question becomes performance**.

---

### **3. BenDeLaCreme – The Barbie-Sinthome**

**"Terminally delightful."**

* Lacanian axis: **Sinthome / Jouissance of Meaning / Forced Cheerfulness**
* BenDeLa is a *caricature of the Imaginary*: excessively cute, perfect, peppy.
* But under this is **melancholia** and a refusal to enter the Symbolic fully (she eliminates herself).
* A clownlike **Sinthome** — stabilizing the subject’s structure by repeating cuteness until **jouissance breaks through**.
* She plays the part of the **barred subject (\$)** *writing* her own departure.

---

### **4. Courtney Act – The Seamless Surface**

**"She’s fishy, she’s real, she’s Australian."**

* Lacanian axis: **Imaginary Identification / Gender as Costume / Veil of the Phallus**
* Courtney is a **perfect Imaginary ego** — her beauty is the **veil over lack**.
* She brings up the *problem of the Real of sex*: “Is she a woman?” is asked to avoid asking “What is a woman?”
* **She plays the sexuation game to the edge**: no surgery, no hormones, pure surface.
* **Beauty is her defense against castration** — and her torment.

---

### **5. Violet Chachki – The Superego Body**

**"You wanted fashion? Here it is."**

* Lacanian axis: **Superego / Phallic Jouissance / Fashion as Torture**
* Violet pushes her body to extremes (corsets, pain, aesthetics).
* Drag becomes a **discipline of the body** — the **Real piercing the Imaginary**.
* The Real of the body is **not erotic**, but **impossibly demanding**.
* She is the **Superego queen**: “You must look stunning. You must never fail.”
* The **fashion fascist** that punishes the self through the ideal.

---

### **6. Valentina – The Mirror Shatters**

**"I’d like to keep it on, please."**

* Lacanian axis: **Imaginary Mirror / Disavowal / The Fall of the Mask**
* Valentina lives entirely in the **mirror stage**, fully identified with beauty.
* But when she refuses to take off the mask, the **Symbolic demand (language)** breaks through — she **fails** to speak.
* This moment is *traumatically Lacanian*: the **barred subject** (\$) is exposed.
* She wants to remain image — **but the body betrays her**.

---

### **7. Yvie Oddly – The Real Returns**

**"Oddly specific."**

* Lacanian axis: **Real / Body-as-Knot / Disability and Excess**
* Yvie performs through **contortion**, illness, instability — her body is **non-normative** and cannot be idealized.
* She doesn’t veil the Real — she **exposes it**.
* Her drag is **non-reconciled**, mutant, glitchy — a **crack in the Symbolic order**.
* The pain of her body is *not hidden* but **turned into jouissance**.

---

### **8. Bosco – The Devil’s Ambiguity**

**"Hell yes."**

* Lacanian axis: **Androgyny / Phallic Signifier / Enjoyment of Ambiguity**
* Bosco plays the **phallic trickster** — seductive and unknowable.
* She makes ambiguity **erotic** and refuses to resolve.
* Her devilish persona invokes the **Jouissance of transgression**.
* She plays **between S1 and S2**, never letting the signifiers stick.

---

### **9. Anetra – The Drive Body**

**"Walk that f\*cking duck."**

* Lacanian axis: **Drive / Body in Motion / Fusion of Phallus and Object a**
* Anetra embodies the **drive that doesn’t stop** — punch, duck-walk, split.
* Her drag is not about **identity**, but **movement**, force, rhythm.
* She is a **living desiring-machine**, producing pure **libidinal jouissance**.
* Her drag **operates Real-to-Real**: the audience is pulled into her pulse.

---

### **10. Nymphia Wind – The Sinthome of Joy**

**"Banana is my safe word."**

* Lacanian axis: **Sinthome / Sublimation / Art-as-Breath**
* Nymphia **makes nonsense sublime** — she **writes joy as art**.
* Her drag doesn’t seek recognition but **stability in absurdity**.
* Like Joyce, she makes a **name of her art** to hold the world together.
* She is a **sinthome**, not a symptom: **creative, queer, sovereign.**

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts: The Subject of Drag

In drag, we witness **multiple structural positions**:

* Some are **neurotic** (Jinkx),
* Some are **psychotic** but stabilized (Tyra, Nymphia),
* Some embody the **perverse function** of the Superego (Violet),
* And many work through the **sinthome** (BenDeLa, Anetra, Yvie).

> In Lacan’s terms: **Drag is not illusion — it is Real.**
> A Real that **forces us to look again** at what we think femininity, sex, identity, and art are.
