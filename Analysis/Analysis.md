 '1961 The Children'
 '1962 Whatever Happened To Baby Jane'
 '1987 The Witches Of Eastwick'
 '2019 Bombshell'
 '2021 Dont Look Up'

Here’s a **Lacanian psychoanalytic breakdown** of your requested films, focusing on the **main actors, symbolic tragedies, and endings**, with insights into desire, the "Big Other," and existential lack:

---

### **1. *All About Eve* (1950)**
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Bette Davis* (Margo Channing) – The fading star (ego dissolution).  
  - *Anne Baxter* (Eve Harrington) – The "empty" mimic (mirror-stage parasite).  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **The Gaze**: Eve’s obsession with Margo reflects the *objet petit a* (unattainable ideal).  
  - **Tragedy**: Margo’s fear of aging exposes the *Symbolic Order’s* cruelty to women.  
  - **Ending**: **Cyclic** – Eve’s reign is usurped by a new Eve (desire is infinite).  

---

### **2. *Suddenly, Last Summer* (1959)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Elizabeth Taylor* (Catherine Holly) – Traumatized hysteric.  
  - *Katharine Hepburn* (Violet Venable) – The *Phallic Mother* suppressing truth.  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **Real vs. Symbolic**: Catherine’s repressed memories rupture the *Symbolic Order*.  
  - **Tragedy**: Sebastian’s cannibalization literalizes *jouissance* (excessive enjoyment as self-destruction).  
  - **Ending**: **Traumatic Revelation** – Truth is spoken, but at the cost of sanity.  

---

### **3. *The Children’s Hour* (1961)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Audrey Hepburn* (Karen Wright) – The repressed lesbian (denied desire).  
  - *Shirley MacLaine* (Martha Dobie) – The hysteric who internalizes societal shame.  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **The Big Other’s Law**: The child’s lie destroys lives (social *Symbolic Order* as tyrannical).  
  - **Tragedy**: Martha’s suicide = failure to reconcile *Imaginary* (self) and *Symbolic* (society).  
  - **Ending**: **Tragic** – Karen is left alone, desire forever unfulfilled.  

---

### **4. *What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?* (1962)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Bette Davis* (Jane Hudson) – The *objet a* of childhood fame (lost ideal).  
  - *Joan Crawford* (Blanche Hudson) – The *Symbolic* rival (disabled but "winning").  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **Mirror Stage Gone Wrong**: Jane’s infantilized ego refuses the *Real* (aging).  
  - **Tragedy**: Sibling rivalry as failed *dialectic of desire*.  
  - **Ending**: **Grotesque Liberation** – Jane dances on the beach, trapped in delusion.  

---

### **5. *The Witches of Eastwick* (1987)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Cher* (Alex), *Michelle Pfeiffer* (Sukie), *Susan Sarandon* (Jane) – The *hysterical triune*.  
  - *Jack Nicholson* (Daryl Van Horne) – The *perverse Father* figure.  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **Perverse Enjoyment**: Daryl embodies *jouissance* (chaotic desire).  
  - **Tragedy**: Women’s empowerment through the *Phallus* (Daryl) is illusory.  
  - **Ending**: **Pseudo-Utopian** – The women gain power but remain bound to patriarchal fantasy.  

---

### **6. *Bombshell* (2019)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Charlize Theron* (Megyn Kelly) – The *split subject* (career vs. ethics).  
  - *Nicole Kidman* (Gretchen Carlson) – The *hysteric* demanding recognition.  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **The Big Other (Fox News)**: Women’s bodies as *signifiers* for male desire.  
  - **Tragedy**: Complicity in the *Symbolic Order* even when rebelling.  
  - **Ending**: **Ambiguous "Victory"** – Ailes falls, but the system persists.  

---

### **7. *Don’t Look Up* (2021)**  
- **Main Actors**:  
  - *Leonardo DiCaprio* (Dr. Mindy) – The *neurotic* seeking the *Other’s* approval.  
  - *Jennifer Lawrence* (Kate Dibiasky) – The *radical hysteric* (truth-teller).  

- **Lacanian Themes**:  
  - **The Real of Climate Change**: Ignored because it disrupts *capitalist fantasy*.  
  - **Tragedy**: Society prefers the *Symbolic* (media spectacle) over the *Real* (death).  
  - **Ending**: **Apocalyptic** – The *Real* annihilates the *Symbolic*.  

---

### **Comparative Analysis**  
| **Film** | **Lacanian Concept** | **Tragedy** | **Ending Type** |  
|----------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|  
| *All About Eve* | *Objet petit a* (Eve as unattainable ideal) | Fame’s emptiness | Cyclic (new Eve) |  
| *Suddenly, Last Summer* | *Phallic Mother* (Violet) | Cannibalized desire | Traumatic truth |  
| *The Children’s Hour* | *Big Other’s Law* (homophobia) | Forced repression | Tragic suicide |  
| *Baby Jane* | *Mirror-stage collapse* | Arrested development | Delusional "freedom" |  
| *Witches of Eastwick* | *Perverse Father* (Daryl) | Empowerment as fantasy | False utopia |  
| *Bombshell* | *Signifier of desire* (female bodies) | Systemic complicity | Ambiguous reform |

---

### **Conclusion**  
These films expose how **desire, the Big Other, and the Real** govern human tragedy. The endings range from **cyclical farce** (*All About Eve*) to **apocalyptic literalism** (*Don’t Look Up*), all reflecting Lacan’s axiom: *"Desire is the desire of the Other."*
