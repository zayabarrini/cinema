1
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,880
You'll get offended if I tell the truth

2
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,759
Rich people live in palaces

3
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,880
With a shining chandelier hanging
From their roof

4
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,560
We live in a hut

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
It's just a small hut

6
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,920
Just a storm is enough to blow it away

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Rich people enjoy delicious food

8
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
They even buy mineral water

9
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,800
We make do on chutney and bread

10
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
We drink unfiltered water

11
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Rich people's kids go to big schools
And colleges

12
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,360
They also take extra classes

13
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
While our kids toil hard

14
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,440
They say studies won't help them

15
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,200
You'll get offended if I tell the truth

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,720
You'll get offended if I tell the truth

17
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,240
When Lord Rama was
journeying back to Ayodhya

18
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,000
the villages on the way were lit
with lamps to welcome Him.

19
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,200
Except one village. It was dark.

20
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,160
My mother told me
that Lord Rama did notice it.

21
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,760
He stopped and asked the villagers:

22
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,560
"Why is it so dark?"

23
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,440
The villagers replied:
"We lit lamps to welcome you.

24
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,520
There was a sudden storm
and all the lamps went out.

25
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,120
We noticed
how Your palace shone in the dark.

26
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,640
So we embraced the darkness."

27
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,640
The Indian countryside
is beautiful, Aditi.

28
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Perhaps it's sucked
all the oxygen in Delhi.

29
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Pull over, Chandrabhan.

30
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,760
Get me a bottle of water.

31
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,240
This is a Pasi village, sir.

32
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
-So?
-They're lower caste, sir.

33
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
They breed pigs.

34
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,520
We don't drink water they touch.

35
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,960
We can't touch them.
Even their shadows can't fall on us.

36
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
Nihal Singh, get me one.

37
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,200
My driver says even their shadows
are forbidden to fall upon us.

38
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
A scheduled caste village.

39
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
What's funny?

40
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
Our moms had separate dishes
for the maids not so long ago.

41
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
They're looking at me
like the British are back.

42
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Yes, page 7.
But it's just a slice of India.

43
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Here we go again!

44
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,280
The right turn takes you to Ayodhya.

45
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,280
Lucknow is straight ahead.

46
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
Turn left at the freeway
and it's straight on to Kolkata.

47
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,880
A lot of development here.
Are they building a mall?

48
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,880
No, it's for Mahantji's ashram.
A multiplex ashram!

49
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,840
Circle Officer Brahmadatt.
In fact, Brahmadatt Singh, sir.

50
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,080
This way, sir.

51
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,280
Hail India, sir.

52
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,960
SI Kisan Jatav, sir.

53
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Ajay Singh, sir.

54
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
Rajesh Mishra.

55
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Pramod Yadav.

56
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,240
She's Nihal Singh's younger sister.

57
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
A great cook.

58
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,360
If you don't mind, sir,
she'll serve you.

59
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,800
He is... Yadav. And he is--

60
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Greetings, sir.

61
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Welcome to Laalgaon.

62
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Anshu Naharia, sir.
He's a respected contractor.

63
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,800
Your toilet needed repair.

64
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
I suggested we should get a new one.

65
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,280
He does a lot of work for us,
government roads, railways, etc.

66
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,400
Anshu has built many nice
public toilets for us.

67
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
The SP has a party planned
for you this evening.

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,720
Why not freshen up, sir?

69
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,120
You'll get to meet everyone
before he leaves Laalgaon.

70
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,280
I do declare

71
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,680
the Neem tree is no less than
the sandalwood tree.

72
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,120
Our Laalgaon police station is
as good as the city of London!

73
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,000
-Nihal Singh, is this party for me?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Welcome, Mr. Ayan Ranjan.

75
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm Mayank.

76
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,640
He got the idea of buying single malt
from your Facebook page.

77
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,400
-Instagram.
-Same thing.

78
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,920
This way. Come, come.

79
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,920
Sisters and brothers,

80
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
we have with us our new

81
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,120
upper, upper police officer.

82
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Mr. Ayan Ranjan.
Ranjan. Ranjan. Ranjan.

83
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Applause!

84
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,760
I declare...

85
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,440
The moon shines after years.

86
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
The fun starts
now that you're here.

87
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
Cover it properly.

88
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm a fan of his book.

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
Is your father a writer, sir?

90
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,240
A very senior IFS officer.

91
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,200
He wrote a book after he retired.

92
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Ayan, you must've studied abroad?

93
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,400
No, sir. I graduated in Delhi.
St Stephens.

94
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,080
I was in Europe and then Dad ordered
me to return. So I came back.

95
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,000
Your first posting? Laalgaon!

96
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,800
-Sir, it's a punishment.
-Punishment?

97
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,080
-Did you fall out with someone?
-No, sir. It was out of affection.

98
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,640
I said: "Cool, sir" to Shastriji.

99
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,520
Madanlal Shastri.

100
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,120
The Home Secretary in Delhi.

101
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,600
You said: "Cool, sir" to him?

102
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,320
He said something
at the graduation party

103
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,640
and I replied:
"Cool, sir."

104
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,800
What did he say?

105
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,800
He paused for two seconds then said:

106
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
"Cool!"

107
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Here's 20 rupees from Bachchu Rai
for our singer Amitji.

108
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,520
I thank you all.

109
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,520
There's a canteen behind the station.
They serve amazing food.

110
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,520
SP Subodhji never needed food
to be sent from home.

111
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Your office is over there.

112
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,880
Is that Satyendra Rai?

113
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes, sir. Do you know him?

114
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,720
Of course. He's a good friend.
We studied together in Delhi.

115
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Was he in the IAS too? He's an officer
of the Pollution Control Board.

116
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,720
-Shall I call him?
-Let's go.

117
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,120
Satyendra.

118
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,880
Don't you recognize him?

119
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,520
You should thank him for the drinks.

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,680
I recognized him, sir.

121
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,640
Congratulations, Additional Commissioner.

122
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,520
How are you?

123
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
He is talking to you.

124
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
I'll be back, sir.

125
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,120
-He's had one too many.
-He was a good friend.

126
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh no, they're back again.
Excuse me, sir.

127
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,720
-What?
-You will find them if you try.

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,120
-You mean right now?
-At least lodge our complaint.

129
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
What's going on?

130
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,760
I must work on Shastri.
It's like Bollywood in 1980s.

131
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,520
Wait for a couple of days.

132
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
If you could talk to the CBI...

133
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,240
Buzz off! You don't belong here!

134
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,960
Okay, Ayan.

135
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm off. My flight's at 5 tomorrow.
Laalgaon is in your hands now.

136
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll do my best, sir.

137
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,760
Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,320
All the best.

139
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,440
Look after Mr. Ayan.
Oh, Brahmadattji!

140
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,280
-Who are they?
-They're from a nearby village, sir.

141
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,040
They skin animals and sell the hides
to the tannery.

142
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,360
What's the problem?

143
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,800
Nothing. It's the usual, sir.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,880
They say three of their girls
have been missing for two days.

145
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
-Have you filed a report?
-We're making enquiries, sir.

146
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
Happens all the time.

147
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
Their girls run away
and then come back.

148
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,320
-What's their nearest police station?
-Ours, sir.

149
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,920
Not from my dish, sir.
I'll get you another dish.

150
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Bring some "mangauri" for sir.

151
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Hurry up!

152
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,040
This fool, Satyendra.

153
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm fine.

154
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Let me drop you.

155
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,240
I haven't driven a bike in years.

156
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
Jatav, look here!

157
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
-Don't you go!
-Tell Chandrabhan to follow them.

158
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
Make it quick!

159
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,360
He's leaving on the motorcycle.
Follow them!

160
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,760
Hurry!

161
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,440
I worked very hard too.

162
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,280
But you did better.

163
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,120
I knew you'd clear the tests.

164
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Stop!

165
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
Where are you running away?

166
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,440
Hey!

167
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,400
-He's drunk.
-Stop!

168
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Stop!

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Rascal, come here.

170
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,440
Are you Bulan's son?

171
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
What's this?

172
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
Go on! Squat!

173
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,000
It's nothing, sir.
He's the confectioner's son.

174
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
He had a kitchen knife on him.

175
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,720
-Let's go, sir.
-Okay.

176
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,840
I didn't think you'd recognize me.

177
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,680
Why wouldn't I?

178
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,880
We're home.

179
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
How is Aditi?

180
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,280
Does she still call you a foreigner?

181
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
She doesn't say it, but thinks it.

182
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,440
She does good work.
Gender equality, human rights.

183
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,440
Her articles get published.
We talk often.

184
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,680
Talk often? What do you mean?

185
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,560
These days,
we argue more than we talk.

186
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
She still thinks of me
as her college boyfriend.

187
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Listen. Don't let Aditi go.

188
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,280
You'll never find another girl
like her in your lifetime.

189
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,880
Here we go!

190
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
Greetings, sister-in-law.

191
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
-I'm Ayan.
-Greetings.

192
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,160
She knows you.

193
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
Archana, you heard us?

194
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,000
-Please come inside.
-Some other time.

195
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,080
See you later.

196
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,080
Listen, sonny!

197
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,480
We haven't even hugged!

198
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,680
Oh, shucks!

199
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Sorry to wake you up so early, sir.

200
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,920
You must've slept late last night.

201
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,560
We've photographed them.

202
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,640
The missing girls?

203
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
They've been missing for two days,
since the 12th.

204
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
They were cousins.

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
The third girl was a friend
from Laalgaon.

206
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,880
The villagers said
the cousins were intimate.

207
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,120
Lesbians.

208
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
-Their fathers hung them.
-Where are the fathers?

209
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
We're investigating.

210
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,160
-Has anyone given a statement?
-No, sir. But they will.

211
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,760
-The third girl?
-No sign of her, sir.

212
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
We've called an ambulance.

213
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,480
We'll send the bodies
for the postmortem and file a report.

214
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,840
-Nihal.
-Sir.

215
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
Careful, sir!

216
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,720
Jatav, can't you untie the knot?

217
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,200
Pull the body up and undo
the knot around her neck.

218
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,080
If you pull her up,
you can't untie the knot.

219
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,560
Shall I cut it?

220
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,080
Then she'll drop to the ground.
Don't you know physics?

221
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,960
What shall we do?

222
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,400
Shit. They were children. Only 15.

223
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,920
One girl is still missing.

224
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,840
It's just like the wild, wild west.

225
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,960
Hello, are you there?

226
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,040
Yes. Last week a girl's body
was found in Rajasthan. In Sikar.

227
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,360
Looks like rape, but they claim
it was a case of honor killing.

228
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,680
-Are these girls Dalits?
-Yes.

229
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,480
Why isn't this news reported
with the GDP headlines?

230
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,080
It does get reported.
Remember the Nirbhaya outrage?

231
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
But why can't the Laalgaon
or Sikar cases hit the headlines?

232
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,560
Why should you decide about Laalgaon?

233
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
We'll only know
after the investigation.

234
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,880
You can't just publish
that it's rape based on rumors.

235
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
That's not what I was saying.

236
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,800
You're defending the system.

237
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,720
Don't honor killings happen?

238
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,120
I thought I could share it with you.

239
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,280
But you don't believe in moderation.

240
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,120
You want me to be an activist,
but law-abiding.

241
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,720
You want a hero, Aditi.

242
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,240
No, Ayan. I want someone
who doesn't wait for a hero.

243
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,960
Glory to India.
Sir, will your lunch come from home?

244
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,120
We've ordered something
from the canteen for you.

245
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,440
Pramod and Mishra want to see you
for a briefing, sir.

246
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,120
Mayank!

247
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Chandrabhan, hurry up.

248
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,000
-Mayank!
-Sir.

249
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
Why is the fan so noisy?

250
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,360
I'll get it fixed, sir.

251
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,080
Why didn't you register their complaint?

252
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
-It didn't seem serious, sir.
-When is it serious?

253
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,560
These people keep reporting
false cases.

254
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
In January a boy ran away

255
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,600
and we had to report it
as a kidnapping.

256
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,880
-Then these people...
-"These" people?

257
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,200
File the missing girl's report. Now.

258
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,480
Yes, sir.

259
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,640
-Ask Pramod and what's his name?
-Mishra.

260
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
Send them in.

261
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
Move back!

262
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,160
She was from Laalgaon.

263
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Step back!

264
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Move!

265
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,720
Move it! This isn't a circus.

266
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,480
-Get Dr. Awdhesh on the line.
-He's down with malaria, sir.

267
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,320
Who'll do the postmortem? You?

268
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,040
His assistant Dr. Malti Ram will do it.

269
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,760
Oh God! Long live
the reformer Dr. Ambedkar!

270
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,160
-Mr. Navin of Prabhat News is waiting.
-OK. Go.

271
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,560
By hanging the girls
he's just attracted the media.

272
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,840
Come!

273
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Good boy.

274
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,440
There you go.

275
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,600
My sonny!

276
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
Write.

277
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a case of honor killing.

278
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
The girls were cousins.

279
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,680
They were too close.

280
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,200
Bad influences everywhere these days.

281
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Their fathers found out. They could not
take it, so they hung them.

282
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Listen.

283
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,640
I'm not saying this.
Other people have made statements.

284
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,600
Get it?

285
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Got it.

286
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,160
Very well.

287
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
The village is calm, sir.

288
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
Tomorrow's papers will say
it was a case of honor killing.

289
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,880
-You talked to a journalist?
-No, sir.

290
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,400
-What about the postmortem report?
-Soon, sir.

291
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,800
But it won't tell us anything new.

292
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,120
I want to avoid delays, sir.

293
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,680
Or their leader, Shanti Prasad,
will start a strike.

294
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,920
In power, they build statues
of themselves.

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,240
Out of power,
they turn into lower caste Dalits.

296
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,000
-Tell me when you get the report.
-Okay, sir.

297
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
-We must find that girl.
-What girl, sir?

298
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,320
How many villages besides Harimanpur
are there near the tree?

299
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,760
Two, sir. Bichhiya and Chhatni.

300
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,760
Find out if anyone saw anything.

301
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
You two meet me at home.

302
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,800
Stop the car.

303
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,960
Nihal Singh, listen.

304
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
I can't get through to Satyendra Rai.

305
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,560
Go to his house.
Phone me when you know what's going on.

306
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,520
Okay, sir.

307
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,680
Come on, move back!

308
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,360
Sir, the older girl, Shanu,
was my daughter.

309
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,640
And the younger girl, Mamta,
was Mahendar's daughter.

310
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Our daughters were killed, sir.
And they're framing us.

311
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,840
-I'm sorry.
-You should be, sir.

312
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,160
What's your name?

313
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
Gaura.

314
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,800
Pooja is her sister, sir.

315
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,640
Please find Pooja.

316
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,360
We beg you.

317
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
Don't we have a glass?

318
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,560
They won't drink from a glass
in your presence, sir.

319
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,280
Had they kept our girls all night and...

320
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,760
freed them later, it would've been okay.

321
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But they hung them from a tree.

322
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,440
If someone had listened to us,
our girls would still be alive.

323
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,720
Let me see the postmortem report first.

324
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
Anshu Naharia slapped Pooja.

325
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,800
That's why Brahmadatt
didn't file a report.

326
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,760
Shanu and Pooja were working
on a road construction project.

327
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,200
They asked for a three-rupee raise.

328
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
-How much?
-Three rupees.

329
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
The daily wage was 25.
They wanted 28.

330
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,640
The other children then refused
to work for under 28 rupees.

331
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,280
When Anshu slapped Pooja,
the others stopped working.

332
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,840
They worked at the tannery instead
for 28 rupees a day.

333
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,880
Did any kids work for 25 rupees?

334
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,920
After he slapped her, a few kids left.

335
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,280
Amali.

336
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,960
The curtain's the wrong way round.
The print should face the room.

337
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,120
Everything will look
white in the office.

338
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
Yes?

339
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,120
Gaura used to study at our school.

340
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,600
I studied in Harimanpur till class 9.

341
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,440
My father worked at the school.
That's how I know her.

342
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,320
-And yet you didn't report it?
-I was busy with the Kanpur case.

343
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,840
-And Brahmadatt told us...
-Is it filed now?

344
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes, sir.

345
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
Jatav, we must find the missing girl.

346
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,040
Get the details from Gaura.
Check Pooja's phone records.

347
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,680
Take statements from her neighbors
and family.

348
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,560
Talk to the tannery supervisor.

349
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,440
What time did she leave work
on the 12th? Who with?

350
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,600
Where was Anshu on the 12th and 13th?

351
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,480
These girls and boys
return home sometimes.

352
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,000
To be honest, sir, whatever
we do for these people...

353
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Who are "these" people?
Are they from Jupiter?

354
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,080
"They" this, "they" that.

355
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Who are "these" people who come and go?
Or hang themselves from trees?

356
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,320
Sir, I was...

357
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,960
Come. Let's go.

358
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,080
What did he say?

359
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,040
-Was he swearing at us?
-No. He asked us to go.

360
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,840
Let's go to the tannery. It's late.

361
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,920
Please come.

362
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,920
Put it on the table.

363
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes, brother.

364
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,640
Shall I make okra tonight?
Or marrow? Cottage cheese?

365
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,400
-Make whatever you cook well.
-I cook everything well.

366
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,400
-Are you Nihal Singh's sister?
-Yes.

367
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,400
-Did you go to school?
-Till class 8.

368
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,920
Now I'm learning Inglish.

369
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
Not Inglish, it's English.

370
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
Call it what you want, brother.
Understanding is what counts.

371
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,040
Anshu Naharia has sent
a mutton curry for you.

372
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm making marrow with parathas.

373
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,920
Yes, Nihal Singh?

374
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,920
Satyendra is out, sir.

375
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,960
His wife is here. Shall I put her on?

376
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,720
Okay.

377
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,480
Hello! Where's Satyendra?

378
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,160
He left home early.

379
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,760
His phone is switched off.

380
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,320
-Did he say anything before he left?
-No.

381
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,840
He got up at 4 a.m. and just drove off.

382
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,160
-But I dropped him home at midnight.
-He slept for awhile.

383
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,000
He got a call and then he was gone.

384
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,240
Long live India!

385
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,840
Nihal Singh

386
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,840
What are you doing here?

387
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,080
The boss sent me to Satyendra's house.

388
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,400
And?

389
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,640
He hasn't returned home.

390
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
I see.

391
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,000
How much longer for the
postmortem report?

392
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,800
The Addl. Commissioner keeps asking:
"Where's the report?"

393
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,680
-Not long now, sir.
-It doesn't look like it.

394
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
-It'll get done, sir.
-Come on!

395
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,480
Doctor, the CO.

396
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,040
Mr. Brahmadatt Singh.

397
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm making a provisional report.
The final one will take time.

398
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,400
What's in the report?

399
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,960
Rape, gang rape.

400
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,320
They were raped repeatedly for days.
Two or three days.

401
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Then hung alive.

402
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,080
Have you spoken to Dr Awdhesh?

403
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,360
-Yes.
-And?

404
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,680
I can't do what he's asking.

405
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,440
You're reacting emotionally, Maltiji.

406
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,400
I advise you to write a few poems
on your Facebook page.

407
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,520
You'll feel better.
But don't write anything here.

408
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
I'm just doing my job.

409
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,040
-Your work is amazing.
-Dr Awdhesh on the line.

410
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Doctor, what's this?

411
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,680
The women's movement
has taken over here.

412
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,720
Now will you write up
the postmortem report?

413
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,000
How will we control this district?

414
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,000
If the Additional Commissioner
sees the report,

415
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,840
your malaria will be replaced
by jaundice.

416
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,440
You'll die a mysterious death.

417
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
Understand?

418
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,600
Get up! Enough of your malaria.
Get well soon.

419
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,520
This is the quota system for you!

420
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,840
The girls were from scheduled caste.
And so is the doctor.

421
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,040
Our taxes paid for her education.

422
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,240
-Yes.
-Get it?

423
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,760
I told you to disappear
for a while.

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Come back in four months
when all is calm and the case is closed.

425
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,000
But you people never listen.

426
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,880
Okay.

427
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,760
Come.

428
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,000
You kept me away from you, my love

429
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,400
What mistake did I commit?

430
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,520
You know the trouble
with the lower caste?

431
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm an insider.
I've watched them for 40 years.

432
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,560
As soon as one of us becomes a cop,

433
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,120
they take us for their
action hero, Ajay Devgan.

434
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,280
"The rascal cop will help us now."

435
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,920
Gaura's got it in for you.

436
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,120
If you live in the slums where you shit
and eat in the same place,

437
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,280
where animal hides rot

438
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,719
-can girls be safe there?
-No way.

439
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,920
Look at history.
Have girls ever been safe?

440
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,880
These people never change.

441
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,560
Must I risk everything and become
a reformer like Raja Ram Mohan Rai?

442
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,400
Mayank, you know how I've struggled
to get anywhere in our society.

443
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,639
Yes, I know.

444
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,840
You saw me sweeping the school floors.

445
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,199
Jump, Jatav!

446
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,719
You scum!

447
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,400
Who is it? Come out.

448
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
Nokhai! You dare attack the police?

449
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,600
Now you're the big cop!
Not one of us now?

450
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,520
-There's been a murder.
-So you want to kill me?

451
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,240
We don't believe in killing.
And you won't kill me.

452
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,640
Put your gun down.
Take the shortcut through Bichhiya.

453
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,360
The bridge has been reopened.

454
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,120
Sir, Pramod said you wanted
to see the old police files.

455
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
Who's Anshu Naharia's friend here?

456
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He's rich and the councilor's friend.

457
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,640
So he's everybody's friend.

458
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
His father was a politician.

459
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
He's powerful, sir.

460
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,200
He was close to Subodh Lal,
the officer before you.

461
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,760
And Brahmadatt?

462
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
-Him, too.
-And Jatav?

463
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Jatav!

464
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,280
He's a zero.
He doesn't count for anything.

465
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,360
He may not do the right thing,
but he won't do anything wrong.

466
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,320
I'm sorry. I think I was overreacting.

467
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,800
You wear fancy clothes,
speak good English, traveled the world

468
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,960
maybe that's not the real you.

469
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,920
You became a civil servant
because of your Dad.

470
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,560
You may become an activist
because of me.

471
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,520
You don't want to discover
your true self.

472
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,320
If you don't know yourself,
how can you know me?

473
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,080
You were right.
I will do my best.

474
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,360
I look at everyone's face

475
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Hoping someone will call out to me

476
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,040
Don't leave me
My little girl please come back

477
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,040
To your father

478
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,360
Your fight is over
Oh, lord

479
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,320
Your father is crying his heart out

480
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,840
Nanku!

481
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,800
Mahendar! Let's go.

482
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
Your mother is stunned

483
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,200
Like she lost something precious

484
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,480
Let's go.

485
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,760
-Let's go.
-Where are you taking them?

486
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,960
What have they done?

487
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,840
What have they done?
Where are you going?

488
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,880
We were returning from the tannery
after enquiring about the missing girl.

489
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
When suddenly a fireball made of jute...

490
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,920
No, no, write:

491
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,560
We were bombarded by fireballs
and the jeep caught fire.

492
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,520
So we jumped out.

493
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,280
I told Mayank to run.
We ran in all directions.

494
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,160
Who was the rascal? Sorry.

495
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,360
We looked everywhere. It was dark.

496
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,040
No one was there. We saw no one.

497
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,400
We kept running through the fields.
We had no torch.

498
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,480
I reached for my cell phone.

499
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,440
If the fireball was thrown at the jeep,
they must've been very close, Jatav.

500
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,840
But you saw no one?

501
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Sir, their faces were covered.

502
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,720
So?

503
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,840
You had a gun.

504
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,240
They had a gun, too.

505
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Did anyone fire?

506
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,320
No one fired, sir.

507
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,720
Why not?

508
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
You've made a false statement.

509
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Sign it.

510
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,920
Sign it.

511
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,880
Go on!

512
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,040
One minute.

513
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,600
-Anything else?
-That's all.

514
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,000
-Sir, Nishad...
-Shut up!

515
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,480
They were Nishad's men, sir. BSS.

516
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,400
-Who's Nishad?
-A member of the Bhim Sangharsh Sena.

517
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,520
They said the police
asked the villagers

518
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,800
to make false statements
against the girls' fathers.

519
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,160
Did you have a hand in this, too?

520
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,360
Which side are you on, Jatav?

521
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,320
Whichever side you choose for me.

522
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,360
Bhim Sangharsh Sena, sir.
They were Nishad's boys.

523
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,040
He's their leader, sir.

524
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,920
He thinks he's the Dalit Robin Hood.

525
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,200
He was jailed last year.

526
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,640
There's a national security case
against him. He's on bail.

527
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,560
He's gone underground.

528
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's close the case, sir.

529
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,720
The girls' fathers have been
granted custody for seven days.

530
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,200
Four villagers have made statements.

531
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,680
The fathers beat the girls.
That's why the case closed, sir.

532
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
-Where's the postmortem report?
-Coming, sir.

533
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,840
-The bodies have been buried.
-Buried?

534
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,320
Yes, sir. They usually bury girls
if they are minors.

535
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,480
I'll bring you the report this evening.
Case closed, sir.

536
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,240
Who is Anshu Naharia?

537
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,640
You've met him, sir.
He built the bathroom.

538
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,600
Call him to the office.
I want to talk to him.

539
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,080
You want to talk to Anshu?
About what, sir?

540
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,400
Let it go, sir.
Why get mixed up in all this?

541
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,360
If Anshu is implicated,
it'll lead to Ramlal Naharia.

542
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,480
The government's in his pocket, sir.

543
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,960
I beg you, sir,
don't disturb the balance.

544
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,720
Till I see the postmortem report,
I won't sign this.

545
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,360
I'm your well-wisher.
I beg you, sir.

546
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,720
I'm your well-wisher, sir.
It's like quicksand.

547
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,040
Don't probe too much, sir.
If you probe too much...

548
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,320
If we stir things up,
we won't be spared. I beg you, sir.

549
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,640
They won't spare us.

550
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,080
Are you crazy?

551
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,640
You really enjoy playing
the detective, don't you?

552
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,720
You didn't think you should
clear it with me first?

553
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,120
Why didn't you ask me?

554
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,120
He'll leave.

555
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,440
He'll be here for
a few months then he'll leave.

556
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,000
But you and I?
We have to live here. Survive!

557
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,320
Do you get it?

558
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,560
Haven't you heard of Ramlal Naharia?

559
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,120
Do you know what'll happen
if he's implicated?

560
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,200
Want to play the honest cop?

561
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,280
-Go, stop him!
-How can I?

562
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,840
If he questions me,
I'll have to answer him.

563
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,080
Did I speak to his predecessors?

564
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,200
I've stood by you all my life.

565
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,120
How can I say no to him?

566
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
You talk to him.

567
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,160
Take me to Harimanpur.

568
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,680
My mother used to say...

569
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,400
our society is built upon certain laws.

570
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,760
There's a king and his subjects.

571
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,200
Attendants and servants.

572
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Society has a balanced order that was
created by Lord Brahma. In Sanskrit.

573
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,960
We have no right to upset
this balance.

574
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,480
And, sir if everyone is equal,
who'll be the king?

575
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,280
If everyone is equal,
who'll be the king?

576
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,400
Why have a king at all?

577
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,680
Who knows Nishad?

578
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,160
Maatadeen, Shishupaal,
Lachcha and Deenu Daama.

579
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,840
They have all given statements.

580
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Where are they?

581
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,280
We haven't seen them since yesterday.

582
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,760
Stop!

583
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,640
I know Nishad.

584
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,560
Mayank and Jatav could've been killed.

585
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,520
They didn't mean to kill them.

586
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,160
Do you work with Nishad?

587
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,360
I was going to marry him.

588
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,280
If they didn't mean to kill the cops,
why attack them?

589
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,680
"It takes a loud voice
to make the deaf hear."

590
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,800
Bhagat Singh said that in 1929.

591
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,200
I studied civics till ninth grade.

592
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,480
Nishad understood it better
than he should have.

593
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,480
We're looking for your sister Pooja.

594
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,920
The police don't even have her photo.

595
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Morning, sir.

596
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Sorry, sir.
They'll fix it tomorrow.

597
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,880
Satyendra's wife is here, sir.

598
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,240
-Has he left home like this before?
-No.

599
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm very worried.

600
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,440
Any friends or family nearby?

601
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,560
He hardly meets anyone.

602
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,080
And Anshu Naharia?

603
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,880
They meet sometimes

604
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,400
for some work or other.

605
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,920
Mayank, take her number.

606
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,920
Find out who called at 4 a.m.

607
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,840
Tap the caller's number.
Find his location.

608
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,680
You'd better go home.

609
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,800
I'll call you.

610
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

611
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,440
Easy.

612
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,280
Tap her phone as well.

613
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
It happens every day, sir.

614
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,120
Brahmadatt's at the hospital now.
He can take care of it.

615
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,720
Good excuse to go to the hospital.

616
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,040
Meet the doctor too.

617
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,840
Did you perform the girls' postmortem?

618
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,120
Yes.

619
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,280
Dr Awdhesh will write the report.
I'm going on leave.

620
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,720
Were they raped?

621
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,480
It was a gang-rape.

622
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,480
Over two or three days.

623
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,880
What difference does it make?

624
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,920
It makes a difference,
but if you go on leave.

625
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,480
Have you the courage to stay?
I'll stand by you.

626
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,200
Give me a provisional report.

627
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,560
Keep the girls' DNA samples.
We'll have them tested.

628
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,280
You'll come to no harm.

629
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,480
It hurts!

630
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,960
Shut up!

631
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,320
Why are you shouting?

632
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
-So you dare sit and eat in the temple?
-We did not eat there, sir.

633
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,000
It's the truth, sir.
We did not eat in the temple.

634
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,320
Sir!

635
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,320
Any names?

636
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,320
No, sir. But they described
the boys who hit them.

637
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,120
-Round up the suspects.
-Sir.

638
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,040
Take their statements. I'm coming.

639
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,760
Too sweet! Chandrabhan has diabetes.

640
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,760
-It burnt my tongue.
-Sir.

641
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,160
Sorry, sir.

642
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,720
What about the temple?

643
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,840
-Aren't Dalits allowed to enter?
-Right, sir.

644
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,680
Who beat them up?

645
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,720
-Boys from Mahantji's ashram.
-Who is Mahantji?

646
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,280
Mahantji is Mahantji.

647
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,280
-He's upper caste?
-A Brahmin, sir.

648
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,560
-And those young men?
-Scheduled caste, sir.

649
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,760
-What caste is Brahmadatt?
-Thakur, sir.

650
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,440
So are Thakurs considered to be
Brahmins, Kshatriyas or Vaishyas?

651
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,760
They're Kshatriyas, sir.

652
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,200
What are you?

653
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,320
I am a Jat.

654
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,080
Now called OBC, "Other Backward Class."

655
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,760
So why are you still protesting?

656
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,240
I'm not, sir.
The Haryana Jats are protesting.

657
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,880
They're still considered Jats.

658
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,480
-Jatav, aren't you a Dalit?
-Yes, sir.

659
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,120
-Same caste as the injured boys?
-No, sir.

660
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,520
I'm a Chamar. They were Pasis.

661
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,720
We're much higher than them.

662
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,360
We have nothing to do with them.
We don't eat the food they touch.

663
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,840
-And I can't eat the food you touch?
-Right, sir.

664
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,120
Right?

665
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,200
-And what caste are you?
-A Kayasth, sir.

666
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,320
What's a Kayasth?

667
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
We're different. We don't fall into
the four main castes.

668
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,400
-And me?
-A Brahmin, sir.

669
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,440
-So am I Mahantji's equal?
-No, no, sir.

670
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,760
He's a Kanyakubja Brahmin, a top Brahmin.
You're a Saryuparin.

671
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,720
-What the fuck is going on here?
-Okay, sir.

672
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,280
Just a second!

673
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,560
Jatavji, what's wrong?
Why did you leave?

674
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,840
-Didn't he tell us to go?
-When did he say that?

675
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,960
Didn't he say "fuck"?

676
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,280
-Doesn't that mean "go?"
-Come on.

677
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,080
Jatav!

678
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440
How far is Harimanpur?

679
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,120
There, sir. About two kms.

680
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,600
And the tannery?

681
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,960
Just beyond Chhatni village.
About 5 kms away.

682
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,600
What's that?

683
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,840
Ignore it, sir.

684
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,360
Sir!

685
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,720
Dead animals are brought here,
skinned and sold to the tannery.

686
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,040
Their work used to run smoothly
but now there's the strike.

687
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,560
Because those boys were beaten,

688
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,080
Nishad has stopped the men
from his caste from working.

689
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,600
They've alerted everyone on WhatsApp.

690
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,600
You and I are invisible to them.

691
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,440
Though they depend entirely on us.

692
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,120
We work on their farmlands.
We clean up their shit.

693
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,680
We deliver their babies.
We burn their corpses on funeral pyres.

694
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,480
Now we're done with begging
for justice.

695
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,520
Stop working now!

696
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,320
You won't find her in the fields, sir.
It's been three days.

697
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,080
The fields may look big,
but a farmer knows every foot of his land.

698
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,960
Will we ever find her?

699
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,520
We must keep looking.

700
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,600
That's the tannery.

701
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,440
The girls went home this way.

702
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,720
This is called the "pig swamp."
It's filthy.

703
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,960
Pigs used to wallow in it.

704
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,680
They were three girls.
Why kill only two?

705
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,480
Pooja!

706
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,440
Pooja!

707
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,280
Pooja!

708
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,680
A pink slipper was listed
in the report.

709
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,960
Can the swamp be crossed barefoot?

710
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,600
It's deep in places, sir.

711
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,760
No one would dare cross it
at night.

712
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,160
What's on the other side?

713
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,280
What's on the other side?

714
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,040
Fields are on this side.
Jungle's on the other.

715
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,880
-How big is the jungle?
-About three or four kms, sir.

716
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,040
How does one get there?

717
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,520
Why go there, sir?

718
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,400
-How does one get there?
-We don't go there, sir.

719
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,360
Long live Bhim!

720
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,280
Who did this?

721
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,520
Glory to India.

722
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,960
The cleaner didn't show up.

723
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,760
They're on strike, sir.

724
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,920
They're dumping waste
outside government offices.

725
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,720
Yes, sir. He's here.

726
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,560
I'll put him on.

727
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,360
Ramlalji!

728
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,640
Himself, sir!

729
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,440
Sir?

730
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,360
Yes.

731
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,560
Of course, sir.

732
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,880
So shall I close the case, sir?

733
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,720
How are you?

734
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,680
You're up early.

735
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,840
I couldn't sleep.

736
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,800
Did you feel again
that you had landed on Mars?

737
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,320
What do three rupees buy, Aditi?

738
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,480
What?

739
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,440
Can three rupees buy anything?

740
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,600
What's wrong, Ayan?

741
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,200
The girls were raped
and murdered for three rupees.

742
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,080
When I was growing up in Europe,
people would say:

743
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
"India, India, India."

744
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,760
I'd sell the Taj Mahal or Khajuraho
as though it was my family property.

745
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,240
Two girls are dead. One's missing.
No one's bothered.

746
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,720
People here think it's happening
in some other country.

747
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,760
Everywhere, on TV, in cities,
life goes on. We ignore reality.

748
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,400
We must find new words, new ways.

749
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,440
Because this mess is ancient.

750
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,960
As per the Indian Constitution,
Article 15

751
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,520
the State shall not discriminate
against any citizen

752
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,560
The Constitution of India, 1950

753
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,200
on the grounds of religion, race,
caste, sex or birth place.

754
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,280
The use of wells, tanks,
bathing places, roads

755
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,320
and the access to
any public property

756
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,720
will not be subject to any disability,
liability, restriction or condition.

757
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,160
Mother, I bow to thee!

758
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,760
Rich with thy hurrying streams

759
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,800
Bright with orchard gleams

760
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,000
Cool with thy winds of delight

761
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,440
Dark fields waving Mother of might
Mother free

762
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,680
Mother, I bow to thee!

763
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,240
MISSING

764
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,960
GIRL MISSING

765
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,080
The three girls used to take
this road from the tannery.

766
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,960
They stopped at the shop,
bought some snacks

767
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,000
and left.

768
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,440
Did you see anyone after that?

769
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:16,200
-A bus drove by later.
-What bus?

770
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,680
A yellow bus, sir.

771
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,920
Which bus line's yellow?

772
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,360
No buses come here, sir.

773
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:58,040
Brothers and sisters, everyone!
Join us at the Brahman-Dalit Unity Rally.

774
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,520
And you will hear Mahantji
and Shanti Prasad

775
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,800
share their thoughts about this unity.

776
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,120
Mahantji is doing it
for his personal interests.

777
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,760
Nishad opposes this rally.

778
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,240
These girls have become
the main issue in this election.

779
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
-May I?
-Go ahead.

780
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,040
Hello. Yes.

781
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,640
Yes, all right.

782
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,160
Okay, okay.

783
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,560
It was Bachchu Rai
who called Satyendra at 4 a.m.

784
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,640
-He repairs bikes.
-Get him in at once.

785
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,320
-Mahantji!
-Long live!

786
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,200
This is the new Uttar Pradesh. A Brahmin
and Dalit eating off the same plate.

787
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,360
I bow to you, Goddess of Plenty.

788
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,120
It helped heal the village's grief
when Mahantji shared a meal

789
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,560
with the Dalit leader
Shanti Prasad in Harimanpur.

790
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,680
He ate with the girls' family
and reassured them.

791
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,400
The rapists are being protected
by the politician Ramlal Naharia.

792
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,880
Instead of arresting the culprits,
our government

793
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,040
is framing the girls' fathers.

794
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,520
Because they're Dalits
and the government is against Dalits.

795
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,760
If we are to save
Hindu traditions and religion

796
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,520
and save Hindus, we must unite.

797
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Dalits and Brahmins must unite as one.

798
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,880
This is just the start.

799
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,120
-To our union!
-Long live!

800
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,880
-Jatavji!
-Sir.

801
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,400
-How long will it take?
-They've been working for two hours.

802
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,000
The more we drain the gutter,
the more filth pours out.

803
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,480
-How many men work here?
-Here, sir?

804
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,160
How many men work for us?

805
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,640
With the cleaners, we're 20.

806
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,800
-And at the Haulpur police station?
-About 12 or 13 men.

807
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,320
-In Chhatni?
-About 20, sir.

808
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,480
-Tomorrow at 6 a.m.
-Yes, sir.

809
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,400
-I want to see everyone at the swamp.
-Yes, sir.

810
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,920
We'll make our way into the jungle.

811
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,600
We'll search from the tannery
to Harimanpur.

812
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,800
Yes, sir.

813
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,640
Anshu Naharia is here, sir.

814
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,480
Sir, you guys get transferred,
but we get killed.

815
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,520
All we need is your signature.

816
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,680
Are all the Delhi files above board?

817
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,960
Ramlal Naharia asked for your number.
He'll be calling you.

818
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,880
Why did you hit the girls?

819
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,200
They wanted a raise.

820
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,320
So you hit them?

821
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,360
First, I refused them.

822
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,880
So why hit them?

823
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,960
They were going to quit working.

824
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
So you hit them?

825
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,440
The others would've demanded
a raise or stopped work too.

826
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,320
All work would stop.

827
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,920
Your milk would not get delivered.

828
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,080
You'd have to clean the sewers.

829
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,360
Cobble your own shoes.

830
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,520
If we didn't keep them in their place,
no work would get done.

831
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,640
What is their place?

832
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,000
The place we give them, sir.

833
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,840
And what I earn tells you
my place in society.

834
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,480
Everyone has their status, sir.

835
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,360
Where were you on the night of 12th?

836
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,920
At home. The 12th, 13th, 14th.

837
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,800
I'm home every night, sir.

838
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,040
Friends drop by.

839
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,400
I have many friends.

840
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,880
Everywhere.

841
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,680
Malti, examine this man.

842
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,720
We need a medical report.

843
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,760
Or Ramlalji might claim
we beat Anshu. Right?

844
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,160
We must maintain the balance. Right?

845
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,560
Very well, sir.

846
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,880
Please go to Lucknow.

847
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,040
Test the girls' DNA samples.

848
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,960
My man will accompany you.
Will you go?

849
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,120
Yes, sir.

850
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:04,800
Call me, no one else.

851
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,359
Jatav, do you know any journalist
who'd write against Ramlal Naharia?

852
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:22,319
Yes, sir.

853
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,800
Leak some news to the press:
"Anshu is our prime suspect."

854
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,640
The headlines tomorrow must say
Anshu is Ramlalji's close ally.

855
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,600
Doable?

856
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,040
It'll be done, sir.

857
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,279
The local papers are publishing
an article tomorrow.

858
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,319
Try and get it published wherever you can.

859
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,680
Are you okay?

860
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,560
Sir, Bachchu Rai.

861
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,280
Come inside.

862
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,960
You called him at 4 a.m?

863
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,000
He owed me money, sir.

864
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,960
Satyendra used to get his bike
repaired by him.

865
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,000
He owed Bachchu money.

866
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,840
So you call him at 4 a.m?

867
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,520
My family was leaving for Lucknow
on the 6 a.m. train.

868
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,960
He promised to pay me
the night before, but didn't.

869
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,120
That's why I called so early.
But there was no sign of him.

870
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,800
Keep an eye on him.

871
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,880
-There must be CCTV in Anshu's house.
-No CCTV in Laalgaon, sir.

872
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,160
-Only banks have it.
-Is there one near his place?

873
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,200
-I'll check, sir.
-Get me the footage if there is.

874
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,800
Amali, can you make me some tea?

875
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,040
Amali!

876
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,520
Tripathi.

877
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,160
-Tripathi!
-Yes, sir.

878
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,120
Where's Amali?

879
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,280
Out shopping, sir.

880
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,840
-Where?
-At the market.

881
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,320
-Vegetable market?
-Yes, sir.

882
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,240
Phone her.

883
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,760
-I tried. She didn't answer.
-Why didn't you tell me?

884
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,120
I thought she'd be back.

885
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,680
Don't you know what
this place is like?

886
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,120
Call her brother Nihal.
Ask if he's heard from her.

887
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,640
Call Nihal Singh. Now!

888
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,400
Get the car out.
I'll look for her.

889
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,720
-I'll go, sir.
-No, I will.

890
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,520
Where were you?

891
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,120
Sir, we had to submit
a form for her exam.

892
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,840
Today was the last day.
We went to get a photo taken.

893
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,400
Will anyone show up?

894
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,320
The upper caste will never
step into this swamp, sir.

895
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,280
And Nishad has asked the lower caste
workers to go on strike.

896
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,400
I thought the villagers would come.

897
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,640
-Are you all scheduled caste?
-No, sir.

898
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,000
I'm a Yadav. We await your orders.

899
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,760
No orders. We need your help.
We need many men.

900
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,720
We must break the strike.
I want to meet Nishad.

901
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,560
Nishad? He's gone underground.

902
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Find him.

903
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,640
I've swept this place for ten years.

904
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,960
When we were 11,

905
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,320
the principal caught Jatav
with a love letter.

906
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,360
We kids watched as Jatav's father
ran after him with a stick.

907
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,640
I'll never forget that day!

908
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,560
It was a just a plot!

909
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,080
But his father made delicious porridge.

910
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,600
It's Malti, sir.

911
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,520
Anshu raped the girls.
His DNA is a match.

912
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,760
I'll be back tomorrow with the report.

913
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,640
Send it to me on WhatsApp.
Call when you're here.

914
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,120
Let's go to bus station.

915
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,040
We were taught a bunch of lies.

916
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,640
Maybe that's why the school
didn't last.

917
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,360
Here I am, sir.

918
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,240
Send the men back to work, Nishad.

919
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,320
We need people to look for Pooja.

920
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,120
Why bother looking for her?

921
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,080
Just find Pooja's father and frame him.

922
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,680
Nishad, aunt has sent halwa for you.

923
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,240
It was his birthday the day before.

924
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,080
The boy was a gem, sir.

925
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,240
No one would believe it if Nishad
was given 90 out of a 100.

926
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,120
Because Nishad could never score
below 100.

927
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,040
If he was a gem of a boy,
why he's rebelling now?

928
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,720
You've become so negative.

929
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,200
If you were negative,

930
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,600
would they accuse you of being
a threat to national security?

931
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,560
There's a right way of doing things.

932
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,280
Jatav's father was a sweeper
in our school.

933
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,080
And my father was a teacher.

934
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,720
Today we're equals.
We earn the same wage.

935
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,800
Hasn't Jatav made a place for himself?

936
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
-Has nothing changed in 70 years?
-Yes, it has.

937
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,720
Sometimes we're called Untouchable
citizens or scheduled caste citizens.

938
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,640
But we're never counted as just citizens

939
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,840
so we would be counted as equals.

940
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,040
You've studied too much.

941
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,480
I may not know a lot.

942
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,760
But every community
has its problems, Nishad.

943
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,480
Gaura was hired to cook at a school.

944
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,160
The very first day the kids refused
to eat the meal she made.

945
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,240
Food for 150 kids was thrown away.

946
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,400
Did anyone throw away the food you touch?

947
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,720
Or wash their hands
after they shook yours?

948
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,960
Every community has its problems,

949
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,720
but your bones aren't broken
if you enter a temple.

950
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,920
Mahant was invited by Shanti Prasad
to eat with all the villagers.

951
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,120
But the food and plates came from
his home. They didn't say that on TV.

952
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,640
Does Shanti Prasad do nothing
for you all?

953
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,840
He did once. That's why I worked
with him for so many years.

954
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,760
But I soon realized
power is a creed in itself.

955
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,480
He rose in politics by stepping
on our shoulders.

956
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,800
Now he thinks of us as dirt.

957
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,520
So I started to rebel.

958
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,560
Last year,
Shanti Prasad's men attacked us.

959
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,960
My guru's return gift.

960
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,880
This rally is to manipulate our votes.

961
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,520
I won't let that happen.

962
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,320
Nishad, I'm doing my best.
At least as much as I can.

963
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,960
-Will I win or lose? I need your help...
-They won't let you succeed, sir.

964
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,920
They ignore the Constitution
though they swear by it.

965
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,560
That's the fight, Nishad.

966
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,520
They must follow the Constitution.
That's the only way.

967
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,480
That's what Dr Ambedkar said.

968
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,200
Dr Ambedkar also said:

969
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,760
"If I find the Constitution being misused,
I shall be the first to burn it."

970
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,320
We found Pooja's slipper
near the swamp.

971
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,960
I've got to find her.

972
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,400
We won't stop the anti-rally protest,

973
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,600
but your men will be there.

974
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,400
Look at this filth.

975
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,680
-Glory to India.
-Glory to India.

976
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,360
She must've eaten something bad.

977
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,960
Animals don't understand.
Give her an injection.

978
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,920
Jatav, we're going to arrest Anshu now.

979
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,920
Excuse me?

980
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Mayank! Get me the warrant.

981
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,480
If you don't mind, sir.

982
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,040
We just heard from Lucknow. The case
has been transferred to the CBI.

983
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,440
Good, sir. You'll be rid of it.

984
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,320
-They'll manage the case.
-The warrant, sir.

985
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,560
Let's manage it ourselves first.

986
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,120
He's not at home, sir.

987
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,560
Search the house.

988
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,200
Yes, sir.

989
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,200
He's gone, sir.

990
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,640
What's that?

991
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,880
A school, sir.

992
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,480
-Who does the school belong to?
-Anshu Naharia.

993
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,760
-Come on.
-It's vacations, sir.

994
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,360
The school reopens in two weeks.

995
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,600
Here.

996
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,920
Unlock all the doors.

997
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,160
The keys to this room?

998
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,560
Sir has them.

999
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,480
-Who's got the keys?
-Mr. Anshu.

1000
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,480
-Break it open!
-Sir.

1001
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:18,120
Ten men will cross the swamp
and search the fields.

1002
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,200
Ten men will search the jungle.

1003
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,560
And the others will comb
every inch of the swamp.

1004
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,840
Not so fast!
Some villagers are coming to help.

1005
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,320
Come on! Let's start.

1006
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,880
Get on with it.

1007
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,160
Anshu has been named prime suspect
in the Harimanpur case

1008
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,440
I've seen it.

1009
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,880
Ramlalji must be angry.

1010
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,480
He won't spare him.

1011
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,440
Suspending him isn't enough.
We'll have the rascal arrested.

1012
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,960
-Have you spoken to Ramlalji?
-No. His phone is switched off.

1013
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,840
The CBI is involved now.

1014
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,240
Yes, that's to be expected.

1015
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,080
-Have you had your breakfast?
-No. They're making parathas for me.

1016
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,280
The wheat crop is fantastic this year.

1017
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,640
-You didn't have to kill them, Anshu.
-What?

1018
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,040
You could've let the wretches go
after ten days.

1019
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,080
They were causing trouble, sir.

1020
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,920
Remember how the girl struggled
when Brahmadattji lay on her?

1021
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
He dared to say I was on top of her!

1022
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:18,800
I'll be finished if you get arrested.

1023
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,360
We must close the case.

1024
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,480
-Ramlal won't spare you.
-But he's let go of you.

1025
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,640
You don't get it, do you?

1026
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,520
Let's do it, Anshu.

1027
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,480
Long live India!

1028
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,160
-Mr. Panicker from the CBI is here, sir.
-Get him some tea.

1029
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,480
Yes, sir.

1030
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,960
Central Bureau of Investigation
Mr. Panicker

1031
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,880
Dr Awdhesh?

1032
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,040
Dr Awdhesh Laktakiya.

1033
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,480
Dr Awdhesh, how long has Malti
worked as your assistant?

1034
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,960
She's not an assistant, sir.

1035
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,240
-Meaning?
-She's an assistant.

1036
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,240
Though I'm in charge, sir.

1037
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,320
You speak Hindi and English.

1038
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,760
She has to type everything twice.

1039
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,320
I went to arrest Anshu, sir.

1040
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,320
He was hiding in his farmhouse.

1041
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,680
He took a shot at me.

1042
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,920
You were right, sir. He's a bad sort.

1043
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,880
How are you, Mr. Ranjan?

1044
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,520
It's been chaos since you arrived.

1045
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,720
You are not familiar with our
complicated Indian customs, are you?

1046
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,520
Are you uncomfortable in Hindi?

1047
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,840
You prefer English.

1048
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,800
In Hindi-speaking states

1049
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,680
it would be preferable if you could
speak the local language.

1050
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,720
You'd understand local customs
better that way.

1051
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,320
A girl is still missing, sir.

1052
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,600
Every minute's important.

1053
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,320
The prime suspect is dead.

1054
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,920
-Are you on meds?
-Sorry, sir?

1055
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,720
Are you on medication?

1056
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,880
You seem agitated.

1057
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,760
-Sir, young girls were raped.
-Raped?

1058
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,720
What makes you think that?

1059
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,240
The doctor's first postmortem report.

1060
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,360
The senior doctor's report
does not mention rape.

1061
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:00,720
She did the postmortem
and the report says rape.

1062
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,920
The girls' DNA samples were tested
and they matched the suspect's DNA.

1063
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,720
Anshu Naharia's, sir.

1064
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,520
The DNA test results
are not in my report.

1065
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,200
Sir, I had the samples checked
personally.

1066
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,040
WhatsApp messages can incite
lynching and riots too.

1067
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,960
They say you're biased against

1068
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,720
the scheduled caste.

1069
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,000
When you arrived you asked
about everyone's caste.

1070
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,400
Sir, I was trying to understand

1071
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,360
why we follow a 2000-year-old system
in 2019?

1072
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,200
Asking people their caste is an
offence under the SC/ST Act.

1073
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,560
-You must know that?
-Yes, sir.

1074
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,000
I suspect, Mr. Ayan Ranjan,
you're motivated by a personal agenda.

1075
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,680
You want to disturb the peace here.

1076
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,320
What do you think of the
Brahmin-Dalit Unity Rally?

1077
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,840
Upper caste and lower caste

1078
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,160
standing together against
the state government?

1079
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,840
Do you want them to succeed?

1080
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,680
The rally has nothing to do
with these people.

1081
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,560
It never has.

1082
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,600
They're very innocent, simple people.

1083
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,680
They get influenced by sloganeering and
become part of the crowd in rallies.

1084
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:46,200
Okay. Stop working on this case.

1085
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,480
At once.

1086
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,520
Anything you wish to say
in your defense

1087
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,040
you may tell me tomorrow.

1088
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,440
I know where Satyendra is.

1089
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,800
I'm going to see him.
I'll stop after that.

1090
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,480
Ayan, you've only just started.

1091
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,600
-Are you arresting me?
-I must talk to you.

1092
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,520
-Don't lie! You want to arrest me.
-No, I want to talk, Satyendra.

1093
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,880
Let go. Leave me alone!

1094
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,080
I just want to talk.

1095
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,600
Why were you at Anshu's house
on the night of the 12th?

1096
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,720
Do you know a IPS officer was beaten
to death in this very state?

1097
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,560
I saw the CCTV footage from
the bank opposite his house.

1098
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,480
You arrived first,
followed by a police jeep.

1099
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,520
-What happened that night?
-You want to be Superman?

1100
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,080
Where did you go at 4 a.m?

1101
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,560
Why did Bachchu call you?

1102
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,360
Why are you hiding now?

1103
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,720
I'm being suspended,

1104
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,560
but I'll do what I can now.

1105
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,600
If that means arresting you

1106
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,400
or shooting you.

1107
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,320
I got a call at 4 a.m.

1108
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,680
Anshu's car broke down.
He needed booster cables.

1109
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,200
When I got there, they had just hung
the two girls from the tree.

1110
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,680
I was told to lie low.

1111
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,400
And on the 12th?

1112
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,080
There was a party at Anshu's house.

1113
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,080
I was there.
So were Brahmadatt and Nihal.

1114
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,400
The girls were there, too.

1115
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,440
They went into the school,
one by one.

1116
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,360
Anshu raped them. So did Brahmadatt.

1117
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,000
Rape.

1118
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,240
Nihal Singh did, too.

1119
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,360
I left.

1120
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,120
Where's the third girl?

1121
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,960
I don't know.

1122
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,800
I thought maybe the three girls
had escaped that night.

1123
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,880
Ayan, I won't make a statement.

1124
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,440
Ask me in front of anyone
and I'll deny everything.

1125
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,560
You'll stand witness.

1126
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,600
You'll soon be suspended and sent away.
They'll kill me.

1127
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:48,080
That's the way it is here.
And always will be.

1128
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,600
You don't get it.

1129
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,720
I'm leaving.

1130
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,720
Shoot me in the back if you want to.

1131
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,000
Finish it for me!

1132
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,120
Where's Pooja, Nihal Singh?

1133
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,440
I don't know, sir.

1134
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,200
You did it, too?

1135
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,640
He got us very drunk.

1136
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,480
I was with Brahmadatt.

1137
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,360
I did a bad thing, sir.

1138
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,440
I sinned, sir.

1139
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,960
I committed a shameless sin, sir.

1140
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,200
Did Brahmadatt rape them?

1141
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,960
Yes, sir.

1142
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,520
Where's Pooja?

1143
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,000
There were three girls, sir.

1144
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,800
It's the truth, sir. I don't know.

1145
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,680
-Where's Pooja, Nihal Singh?
-I don't know, sir.

1146
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,680
Please forgive me.

1147
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,800
I made a terrible mistake, sir.

1148
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,240
Please forgive me.

1149
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,160
Forgive me, sir.

1150
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,640
Don't tell Amali.

1151
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:05,360
If there's news of a rape that's
taken place in Badaun and Buland,

1152
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,080
it feels far away from us.

1153
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,280
But distance means nothing, sir.

1154
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,480
Nihal used to...

1155
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,440
sit a foot away from me.

1156
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,560
For 12 long years.

1157
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,600
Arrest Brahmadatt, Jatavji.

1158
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,360
The Lucknow officers are waiting
with my suspension orders.

1159
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,160
If I accept them,
my hands will be tied.

1160
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,080
Mayank will bring the arrest warrant
to your house.

1161
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,640
Sign it before you go in
and I'll manage the rest, sir.

1162
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,720
I make a great potato curry.

1163
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,240
And bitter gourd,
but it won't taste bitter.

1164
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:19,680
My brother Nihal thinks
I make better kheer than our mother.

1165
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,880
Tell me what you'd like to eat.

1166
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,320
I'm not really hungry.

1167
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:29,240
You and sir are never hungry.
Who can I cook for?

1168
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,800
Sir does not sleep.
And what about you?

1169
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,040
Brother's here.

1170
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,960
I thought you might need me.

1171
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,080
I do. A lot.

1172
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,280
One minute.

1173
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,680
Amali.

1174
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
Do you know what rape is, child?

1175
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,280
Ayan.

1176
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,400
You know Shanu and Mamta were
hung from a tree?

1177
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,760
Your brother Nihal raped them too.

1178
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,360
He told me.

1179
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,240
He's not coming back.

1180
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,520
He told me not to tell you,
but you would have found out.

1181
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,360
I don't know if it makes
any difference

1182
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,200
but your brother knew
he'd done a bad thing.

1183
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,480
We're here for you.

1184
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,560
They can't stomach
our anti rally protest.

1185
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,920
They're capable of anything.

1186
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,520
I have to go away for a few months.

1187
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:28,680
Before leaving, I'd like to see you.
Can you come?

1188
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,880
Long live Bhim, Brother Binayak!

1189
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,040
Nishad just got here.

1190
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,400
Nokhai, take him to Patna
for a few days.

1191
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,000
They're sending me to jail again.

1192
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,360
They'll wear you out, Nishad.

1193
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,800
They wear everyone out.

1194
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,480
Sometimes I think it's hopeless.

1195
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:18,040
But you can't admit that.
Because so many get strength from you.

1196
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,040
But you can tell me though.

1197
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,160
Sometimes I think about all the things
I wanted to do.

1198
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,440
I wanted to bring you flowers.

1199
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:40,080
But such terrible things
were happening around us.

1200
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,920
It felt like a sin
to even smile at you.

1201
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,160
There were so many terrible things
going on around us. I never got

1202
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,360
five minutes to sit quietly near you,
with our feet dipped in the river.

1203
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,120
I've never stared at the moon
for five minutes.

1204
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,840
Or known five minutes' peace.

1205
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,200
-Sir!
-Stop!

1206
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,320
You've shown
where you truly belong, Jatav.

1207
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,680
You're wearing a uniform
and working in an office because of me.

1208
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:21,960
Scum! You should've stayed a sweeper.

1209
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,840
You should collect garbage instead.
Move back!

1210
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,760
How long must I be a sweeper?

1211
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,560
Take him away.

1212
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:17,320
Whenever Gaura speaks of Nishad,
there's a glint in her eye.

1213
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,800
I felt sure

1214
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:24,000
I lacked something because you
did not look at me like that. Ever.

1215
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,040
Drive.

1216
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,280
Move.

1217
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,800
MISSING

1218
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,200
-Mahantji!
-Long live!

1219
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,520
This is the land of Shabri's Lord Rama.

1220
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,120
This is the land of Kevat's Lord Rama.

1221
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,920
I wanted to be a writer.
And a scientist.

1222
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,400
I thought I'd write about science.
But it came to nothing.

1223
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,760
Because the place I was born into
was a terrible accident.

1224
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,080
Whatever caste you belong to,

1225
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,720
it's time for Hindus to unite.

1226
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,720
Time to recognize the true enemy.

1227
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,680
Men martyred at the border

1228
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,200
are outnumbered by those
who die cleaning the sewers.

1229
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,800
No one mourns for them.

1230
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,400
We made a terrible mistake, sir.

1231
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,720
Our daughters became wayward.

1232
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,920
We tried explaining to them but they
didn't listen to us, so we killed them.

1233
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,360
If anything happens to me,
it'll enrage you.

1234
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,360
Make that anger your weapon.

1235
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:43,360
But make sure you use
no other weapon.

1236
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,560
Because the day we take
the path of violence

1237
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,520
it'll be even easier to kill us.

1238
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:55,400
Friends! A few young anarchists
in our own community

1239
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,920
are spreading fake rumors
on WhatsApp and Facebook

1240
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,160
in order to malign our unity.

1241
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,000
We must be alert.

1242
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,000
If anyone tries to raise their voice,

1243
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,360
they're accused of being
a threat to national security

1244
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,360
and killed.

1245
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,080
The poet Paash once said:

1246
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:18,560
"We all stand in danger
from this kind of threat."

1247
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,680
Pull over.

1248
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,760
We are not the last ones.

1249
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,840
Many will follow.

1250
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,280
-Mahantji!
-Long live!

1251
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:22,600
Long live Shanti Prasad!

1252
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,200
-Mahantji!
-Long live!

1253
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,400
I beg your forgiveness, Gaura.

1254
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,640
I'll ask you again and again.

1255
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,160
But don't forgive me.

1256
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,640
If there's more violence,

1257
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,160
they'll be the ones to pay for it.

1258
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,120
Who is being violent, sir?

1259
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,120
You must've heard their slogans.

1260
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,600
Long live Bhim!

1261
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,560
Sometimes the quiet persistent violence
behind such violence is overlooked.

1262
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,120
It becomes part of our culture.

1263
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,920
We don't call it violence then.

1264
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:11,400
We call it law and order.

1265
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,360
You can't be neutral, can you?

1266
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:20,040
Staying neutral when a fire is raging,
is standing with the ones who lit it.

1267
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:23,400
Who has lit the fire?

1268
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,040
The man who's been calling you
repeatedly for the past 12 hours

1269
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,680
he has lit the fire.

1270
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,080
Your phone records.

1271
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,680
Anything else to add?

1272
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,440
Otherwise it's an open-and-shut case.

1273
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,520
A clear-cut case of honor killing.

1274
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,960
Sir, the three girls were only asking
for a three-rupee raise.

1275
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,680
Three rupees.

1276
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:02,560
Enough to buy you...
a couple of sips of mineral water.

1277
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,240
That's all they wanted.

1278
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,080
They were raped because
of this mistake.

1279
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,600
They were not mature enough
for sex.

1280
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,560
They were gang raped to remind them
of their place in society.

1281
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,680
Their bodies could've been hidden.

1282
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,200
Instead they were hung from a tree to
remind the scheduled caste of their place.

1283
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,960
I've got the evidence, sir.

1284
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,680
Their feet were tied with this rope.

1285
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,280
They were gagged with this cloth.

1286
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:39,440
The stained bed sheet found
at Anshu's school.

1287
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,800
Anshu, Brahmadatt and Nihal
raped the girls.

1288
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,480
Anyway, sir.

1289
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,400
I'll submit the additional evidence
in due course.

1290
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,400
In the near future,

1291
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,440
I shall present all the hard evidence
in court, sir.

1292
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,640
This case could've been dealt with
by my police station.

1293
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,440
But no.

1294
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,600
They said: "This is what happens
with these people. This is just them.

1295
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:19,280
"Don't touch the food they touch.
Don't let their shadows fall on you."

1296
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:23,360
In English,
they're called the scheduled caste,

1297
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,000
scheduled tribes,
Other Backward Classes.

1298
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,760
But in Hindi, their caste names
are used as swear words.

1299
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,280
These castes, OBC, SC, ST represent
70% of our population, sir.

1300
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:37,920
They've been marginalized and regarded
as minorities for eons, sir.

1301
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,400
And we, the 30% of the population,
regard them as lesser in status.

1302
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:44,560
We let them do
the jobs we don't want to do.

1303
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,840
Nowadays our toilets have jet sprays.

1304
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:52,360
But even now they still go down naked
into filthy sewers to clean them.

1305
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,920
Unprotected and naked.

1306
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:58,480
We know all this, we see it every day.
We just ignore it.

1307
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:04,040
Sir, this is the ninety-pager.
My report.

1308
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,600
I know you'll bin it.

1309
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,200
I became a civil servant for my father.

1310
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,160
You love Hindi so much.

1311
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,600
I'm sure you love India very much.

1312
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:26,600
But in all these years you haven't seen
what's happening. When in two days I have.

1313
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,640
Or maybe "these people" do not exist
in your idea of India.

1314
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,160
In Delhi, instead of saying
"Yes, sir" every time

1315
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,160
if you just once said "No, sir."

1316
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,960
What's the worst that could happen?

1317
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,960
You'd be done for, right?

1318
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,840
That's already done.

1319
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,080
You just don't know it.

1320
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,400
Handle the case and the rioting.

1321
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,560
I'm going to look for the missing girl.
She's waiting for us.

1322
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:10,440
I hope you remember you're suspended.

1323
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,280
No one remembers anything here.
Except for one's power.

1324
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:18,480
I'll do whatever it takes to save Pooja.
If it's illegal, arrest me.

1325
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:24,800
In life, there's a 50-50 probability
between yes or no.

1326
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,560
And a positive outcome of 50% is a lot.

1327
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,840
Long live India!

1328
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,720
-Careful!
-Mind your step.

1329
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,760
She's not in the fields, sir.

1330
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,320
They're giving up the search
in the jungle.

1331
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,960
You're entering the swamp, sir?

1332
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,800
Someday even Brahmins have to descend
from on high.

1333
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,040
Your clothes will get soiled, sir.

1334
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,640
Has your mother any tips
on washing dirty clothes?

1335
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,680
Not my mother, sir.

1336
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:01,640
But the ads on TV say
stains are a good thing.

1337
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,720
Let's go.

1338
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,200
Careful!

1339
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,320
She's not in the fields, sir.

1340
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,520
They're giving up the search
in the jungle.

1341
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:15,760
She must've crossed the swamp.
That's our only hope.

1342
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,160
Let's search beyond the swamp.

1343
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,080
We'll find her, Jatav.

1344
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,280
-Chandrabhan.
-Yes, sir?

1345
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:25,760
Aren't you a Rajput?

1346
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,680
But I'm not brave like Rajputs.

1347
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,760
I'm in the Ahir caste
because of my job, Yadav.

1348
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,320
I have the same job as Lord Krishna.
Driving, I mean.

1349
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,200
Who do you vote for?
The Bicycle Party?

1350
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:40,120
No, sir. Before dying, mother said
always vote for the Flower Party.

1351
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,640
-And you, Jatav?
-The Elephant Party, sir.

1352
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,600
But once Flower and Elephant
joined hands.

1353
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:47,520
-Then who did you vote for?
-The Bicycle Party.

1354
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,120
Sometimes the Bicycle Party backs
someone from the scheduled caste.

1355
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,240
And the Elephant Party backs Muslims.

1356
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,760
-It gets so confusing, sir.
-So then?

1357
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,360
We don't vote, sir.

1358
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,560
I always vote for the Hand Party.

1359
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,880
Madanlal wasn't
their candidate this year.

1360
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,480
So I voted for the Candle Party.

1361
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,360
Hi, Ayan. Shastri here.

1362
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,480
Sir, I've been suspended,
in case you didn't know.

1363
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:19,800
Just carry on.

1364
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,280
Continuing, sir.

1365
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,280
Are you deep in mud?

1366
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,560
Many people are helping, sir.

1367
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,560
Sir!

1368
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,640
I've found the other slipper.

1369
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,760
Pooja! We're here.

1370
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,400
Pooja, the police are here!

1371
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,680
It's the police, Pooja.

1372
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,200
Pooja!

1373
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,720
There's an old pump house ahead.
It's been shut for years.

1374
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,840
-How far is it?
-A couple of kilometers.

1375
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:00,560
Pooja!

1376
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,960
It's me! Pooja.

1377
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:10,000
Jatav, I want an ambulance here
in five minutes.

1378
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,120
Following Pooja's statement

1379
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,440
Brahmadatt was found guilty and
sentenced to 11 years imprisonment.

1380
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:42,080
The court found the girls' fathers
had confessed under pressure.

1381
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,440
They were exonerated
and released at once.

1382
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
Mahant won the election hands down.

1383
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,760
But for irreconcilable differences
over Ministerial berths

1384
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:54,240
the Brahman-Dalit coalition
is in danger.

1385
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,320
What have you cooked?

1386
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:30,720
Bread and vegetables.

1387
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,680
-Give it to everyone. We're starving.
-Yes.

1388
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,320
Here you are.

1389
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:54,160
-What caste are you, mother?
-I am...

1390
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,040
My India is great

1391
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,800
