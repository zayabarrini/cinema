1
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,505
October 11, 1931, Los Angeles.

2
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,098
A conflagration of biblical proportions

3
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,344
incinerates nearly everything
and everyone inside

4
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,346
what was once the city of angel's

5
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,564
most celebrated medical facility:

6
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,433
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute

7
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,025
For The Criminally Insane.

8
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,145
But the secret this inferno burned free

9
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,943
was far more frightening than any picture

10
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,907
Hollywood could produce.

11
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,871
A sanitarium of slaughter
supervised by a surgeon gone mad:

12
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,292
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

13
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,161
Doctor Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

14
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,503
Little known today, but
likely the most prolific

15
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,047
mass murderer of this century.

16
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,090
He out-butchered Bundy.

17
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,963
He made Manson look meek.

18
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,058
And the site of his
carnage still exists today,

19
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,019
restored almost to its original state.

20
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,607
But it has yet to be
inhabited because some say

21
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,942
the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims

22
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,560
still live within the walls

23
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,062
of The House On Haunted Hill.

24
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,900
- I'm Peter Graves,
- No shit.

25
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,573
We'll be back with more

26
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,162
Terrifying But True in just a moment.

27
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,623
No need, baby.

28
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,583
You just gave me everything I needed.

29
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,094
Price.

30
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,641
Evelyn, how nice.

31
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,937
Yeah, well that is so
totally fucking fascinating,

32
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,435
but I've gotta get back to you.

33
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,726
They're trying to shoot me here.

34
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,116
What is it, Mr. Price,
business or pleasure?

35
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,404
Neither, my wife.

36
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,993
We were talking about
your roller coaster

37
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,831
that is quote, "unlike any
that has come before it."

38
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,574
Absolutely, no cheap thrills.

39
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,623
A genuine journey to the brink of madness.

40
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,586
Sorry, but it just looks like

41
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,500
a generic roller coaster to me.

42
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,380
What's the gimmick?

43
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,547
Ever seen one that starts at the top?

44
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,265
20 stories worth of top?

45
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,146
Sources have told this
reporter that the real reason

46
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,018
your park's opening has been delayed

47
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,567
was a near-fatal accident
on one of the rides here.

48
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,529
I wouldn't be opening
this place tomorrow

49
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,494
if every single thing down to
the beheaded beanie babies,

50
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,863
hadn't tested 100 percent safe.

51
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,414
What the hell was that?

52
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,877
Growing pains.

53
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,586
New steel's gotta bend
and stretch a little

54
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,955
before finally settling in.

55
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,842
Don't worry.

56
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,586
In the 15 year history of Price Amusements

57
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,508
we've yet to lose a single customer

58
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,381
I've designed and built
six of these places.

59
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,133
Take my word for it.

60
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,145
Everything's fine.

61
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,241
Well, God forbid, if something
unexpected should happen

62
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,281
there's aways the safety cable.

63
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,617
That does what?

64
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,742
It keeps the cab from just...

65
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,754
Oh!

66
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,589
Do something!

67
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,457
Like what?

68
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,961
This isn't supposed to be happening!

69
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,678
Oh, Jesus!

70
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,762
Oh, God!

71
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,383
- Oh God!
- We're all gonna die!

72
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,146
You survived Terror Incognita,

73
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,485
please exit the elevator now.

74
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,663
From here on, it gets really scary!

75
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,274
Oh!

76
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,541
All right, Princess.

77
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,832
Now, what were you babbling?

78
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,293
Congratulations.

79
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,261
On a scale of one to 10
on the perversity meter,

80
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,722
you just hit a 73.

81
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,724
Why don't we go and celebrate

82
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,193
at some nice, quiet little restaurant?

83
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,899
Houston, I think we've got a problem.

84
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,526
Evelyn, Evelyn, go stir your cauldron

85
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,653
or something for a sec.

86
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,295
Oh, shit!

87
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,920
We're gonna fall, we're gonna fall!

88
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,924
Oh, my God!

89
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,177
Oh, my God!

90
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,961
Problem where?
Looked good to me.

91
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,510
Passenger six, he keeps losing his arm.

92
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,633
So, disengage the
flailing limb mechanism,

93
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,554
make him into a screamer.

94
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,110
Ah, okay.

95
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,891
Stephen!

96
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,141
Here, dear, with a
suggestion: Forget it.

97
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,187
Haunted Hill is exactly where

98
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,030
we're having my party this year.

99
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,194
Now, you'll find the guest list

100
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,443
on your desk when you get back.

101
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
I got your guest list
right here, Princess.

102
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,667
Shredded.

103
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,717
I'm gonna pull out
all the stops.

104
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,468
Excuse me, Mr. Price, the people

105
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,313
from HRS Entertainment are
getting a little antsy.

106
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,773
Tell them I'm right there.

107
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,867
Okay, hi, stop the car, get out.

108
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,157
Please, stop the car and get out.

109
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,156
Stop it, will you stop your car?

110
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,998
Stop your car and get out of the car!

111
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,870
Please sir or ma'am,
whoever's in the car, get out!

112
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,956
Hi, hello.

113
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,045
We're gonna have to
walk the rest of the way

114
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,213
because the driveway's out, okay?

115
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,551
So, let's, let's go.

116
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,555
Quickly.

117
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,547
Even quicker.

118
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,388
Did I say quicker?

119
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,302
I think I did.

120
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,345
Hi, hi, I'm sorry.

121
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,593
I'm Pritchett, I'm Watson Pritchett.

122
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,719
I own the house, okay?

123
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,766
So let's move, if we could.

124
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,390
So is this dump really haunted?

125
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,189
Uh, yeah, it's, yeah, it's pretty scary.

126
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,233
Uh, let's have a good
time, let's, let's go on...

127
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,231
Hold up, I got one question.

128
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,072
What's up with this?

129
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,319
Like why is this Price dude
inviting us to a birthday party?

130
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,536
I never even heard of him.

131
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,120
Neither have I until he
wanted to rent the place.

132
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,284
But right now I just have

133
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,078
to get you love people inside, okay?

134
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:38,916
Please?

135
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,280
This million bucks each, though.

136
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,087
That's for real?

137
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,956
Uh, good question.

138
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,082
Don't have a clue.

139
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,504
You might wanna ask Price that.

140
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,719
Is there a reason why we're
not moving forward at all?

141
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,552
Do you wanna?

142
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,966
Let me get a light, here a flashlight,

143
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,089
and that way we can
all see what's going on

144
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,637
and no one'll trip or anything.

145
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,303
Come on, come on, little piece of shit.

146
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,564
There, that's better.

147
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,401
Oh.

148
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,692
The lights are a nice touch, Pritchett.

149
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,529
Subtle.

150
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,865
Yeah, thanks, worked hard on it.

151
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,779
Uh, could we uh, move?

152
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,573
Guess we know where the Prices are.

153
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,123
Okay, let's go up further.

154
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,254
Hi.

155
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,436
Goddamn, this place is scary, yo.

156
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,940
Where's the party?

157
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,440
Looks like we're it.

158
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,439
Me and y'all three?

159
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,904
Ooh, let's boogie.

160
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,820
Where's our host,
the fabulous Mr. Price?

161
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,534
Fuck him, what in the
name of Christ is that?

162
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,413
Oh, it must be more of Price's

163
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,957
spook-house bogeyman bullshit.

164
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,082
Uh, actually that's always been there.

165
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,755
Back when this was an asylum,
uh, the guy running the place,

166
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,879
Dr. Vannacutt found it inspirational.

167
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,010
It's from the middle ages or something.

168
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,383
Driving demons from the mind.

169
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,807
Kinda scared me as a kid.

170
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,774
But uh doesn't really scare
me that much now, though.

171
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,781
So.

172
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,569
It's touching.

173
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,403
Are you gonna come in?

174
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,410
No, I'm good.

175
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,996
Mr. Price?

176
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
Mrs. Price?

177
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,083
Any Price person?

178
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,827
I don't think anybody's here, man.

179
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,331
So maybe it was ghosts.

180
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,510
Uh, I knew this whole
place would be pure goid.

181
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,800
If I can just get something
bizarre enough on tape

182
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,015
I think I can parlay it into
getting myself some sort

183
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,440
of a wackiest home videos gig.

184
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,346
Wait, you got your own TV show?

185
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,473
Had, sweetie, past tense.

186
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,770
Currently looking for the right angle

187
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,235
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

188
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,830
Looks like someone's
trailer park is showing.

189
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,023
I wouldn't worry, I'm
sure by the end of the night

190
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,993
we'll be hacked up into
little pieces by something or...

191
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
...somebody.

192
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,634
Who the fuck are all of you?

193
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,406
Oh, shit.

194
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,414
Wow!

195
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,993
I thought you were dead.

196
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,912
Not even fucking close.

197
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,955
Get off of me, you pervert.

198
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,749
Congratulations.

199
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,089
I don't think Evelyn's said those words

200
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,428
to anything with testicles.

201
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,215
Ever.

202
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,012
Very funny, Steven.

203
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Have you?

204
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,683
I think you're taking this awfully well

205
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,102
for a woman who was just nearly killed.

206
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,646
Yeah, well, I guess you'll just have

207
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,521
to try harder next time.

208
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,987
That is, if you can get it up.

209
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,284
Not me, tulip.

210
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,655
The house.

211
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,903
I think it's marked you to be the first

212
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:25,914
to die this evening.

213
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,415
Isn't that how the story
goes, Mr. Pritchett?

214
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,917
You could say that, sure.

215
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,036
Isn't that how both your father

216
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,662
and grandfather met their demise?

217
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:43,133
Uh, well, uh, my grandfather
did build the place

218
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,177
but he actually died
in his sleep in Miami.

219
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,096
My father did get killed here

220
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,890
but that was during a
construction accident

221
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,559
while he was restoring interiors.

222
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,526
But I'm fine and I'm
still alive and I feel good

223
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,750
and I'd love to get paid now.

224
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,151
And on that mercenary
note, dear friends,

225
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,902
let the games begin.

226
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,075
Yeah, well, call me clairvoyant,

227
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,198
but haven't they already?

228
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,870
Finding that out is just one

229
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,084
of tonight's many amusements.

230
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,255
Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?

231
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,836
Let's have a word, sugarpuss.

232
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,222
Oh, I think we oughta have several.

233
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,886
This'll just take a moment.

234
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,934
You'll find food and
booze in the main salon.

235
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,102
Knock yourselves out.

236
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,252
I gave you a guest list two pages long.

237
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,466
Where the hell are they?

238
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,550
Shredded.

239
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,589
Sorry.

240
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,383
Decided to whip up one of my own.

241
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,550
A group so hungry for money

242
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,139
they'd be willing to do anything.

243
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,974
I thought you'd be more
comfortable with your peers.

244
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,185
How stupid of me not to expect something

245
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,304
this twisted from you.

246
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,772
Congrat-ufucking-lations.

247
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,108
Round one, you win.

248
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,021
Not quite.

249
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,111
See, those people down there,

250
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,820
they're not the ones I invited.

251
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,030
Yeah, then who are they?

252
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,034
You tell me.

253
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,317
I don't know how you managed to hack

254
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,786
into my computer, but bravo!

255
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,576
Oh, come on.

256
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,574
You think I'd invite that
bunch of social rejects?

257
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,576
Sure know it wasn't
me, and if it wasn't you

258
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,327
then who the hell did, Evelyn?

259
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,829
Ghosts?

260
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,250
Ooh, spooky.

261
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,925
You know, if you really
loved me, you'd find a way

262
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,420
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

263
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,671
Finding ways for me to die

264
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,547
is really your deal, isn't it, Evelyn?

265
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,476
Let's not forget the O.J. knife

266
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,436
with the not quite retractable blade.

267
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,520
Or your Jim Jones kool aid
that was exactly that.

268
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,061
Accidents.

269
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,654
All accidents until proven otherwise.

270
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,320
I'd be so happy if that
were really true, Evelyn.

271
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,156
And positively goddamned delirious

272
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,200
if you weren't fucking every
living thing in our area code.

273
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,876
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

274
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,837
Me with other men, or just the other men?

275
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,502
Everything you do gets me hot,

276
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,875
just not in the sexual sense.

277
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,467
You're hurting me.

278
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,471
I know.

279
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,508
Ow!

280
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,098
Well, there's the simple
country gal I married.

281
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,972
Let's go back down and greet your guests.

282
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,686
Show them the real you.

283
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,976
Corny as Kansas on the fourth of July.

284
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,520
My guests were shredded.

285
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,438
It's your sick little scene now.

286
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,445
Enjoy.

287
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,942
I'm gonna run scalding water on the place

288
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,283
you just touched me and
then I'm calling a cab.

289
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,039
That there're more people.
I don't even know.

290
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,122
What was taking
these guys so long?

291
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,333
How do I know, okay?

292
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,336
Don't talk to me.

293
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,754
Mr. Price?

294
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,880
I think I've done a great job
of getting your guests up here,

295
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,217
and I think I deserve my money, now.

296
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,586
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

297
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,759
As well as five other bonafide bank drafts

298
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,852
for one million dollars each.

299
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,722
Made out to cash.

300
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,520
Ah, that's what I'm talking about.

301
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,314
And we get paid this money when, sir?

302
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,983
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning

303
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,448
assuming you've stayed the entire night.

304
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,909
And that you're still alive, of course.

305
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,995
What are you talking about?

306
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,408
Oh, sorry.

307
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,998
Detail I guess I forgot to mention.

308
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,458
You die, you lose.

309
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,497
Your check gets divvied up

310
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,086
by those still amongst the living.

311
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,205
But look at the bright side,

312
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,003
if there's only one of
you still upright at dawn

313
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,798
you'll be leaving here with
$5,000,000 in your pocket.

314
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,504
This is crazy.

315
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,972
Yeah, but hey, anybody
who's not comfortable

316
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,433
with the rules, you're
free to walk any time.

317
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,268
Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

318
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,186
I'm ready. I'll walk. Now.

319
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,019
All right, Mr. Pritchett,

320
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,645
just let me sign the damned thing.

321
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,855
Oh, just for the record,

322
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,198
what are the rest of your names?

323
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,364
Donald W. Blackburn, MD.

324
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,748
Melissa Margaret Marr, celebrity.

325
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:26,378
Eddie Baker, pro, uh,
former pro baseball player.

326
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,338
And you, young lady?

327
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,961
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,

328
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,634
Lathrup International Pictures.

329
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,950
Very good.

330
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,640
Well, I think I can say
with compete honesty

331
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,723
I've never heard of any of you.

332
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,146
Great, then why are we here?

333
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,145
Then how did you make
the guest list, Price?

334
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,692
Throw darts at a phone book?

335
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,815
I'm sure the unexplainable

336
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,239
will probably explain
herself before too long.

337
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,076
Jesus Christ.

338
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,820
That's it, I'm sorry to interrupt here.

339
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:00,662
Goddamn it!

340
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,250
You give me my goddamn check, right now!

341
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,459
Because I want it!

342
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,462
So you give it!

343
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:08,965
Now!

344
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,170
I'm serious!

345
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,383
I'm sorry, Pritchett.

346
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,263
Here you go.

347
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,432
I think you're gonna miss
the bash of a lifetime.

348
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,270
My loss.

349
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,639
Even if I give you a million as well?

350
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,231
I wouldn't know what to do with it all.

351
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,235
Thank you.

352
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,157
I think I gotta go now.

353
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,585
Interesting.

354
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Fuck!

355
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,586
Now that's enter-fucking-tainment!

356
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,921
This ain't moving, man.

357
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,171
Is this your idea of a joke?

358
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,393
Pritchett's not laughing.

359
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:53,275
Open, open, open, you
stupid, asshole bitch!

360
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,519
- Open!
- What's going on?

361
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,896
What's going on?

362
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,410
Oh, doctor.

363
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,949
What happened here?

364
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,783
Lockdown.

365
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,617
What is that?

366
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,031
It's a machine from the old asylum.

367
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,370
It seals everything shut.

368
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,739
It's how they burned to death in '31.

369
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,411
Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

370
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,534
If he was gonna die,
they're all gonna die.

371
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,747
Well, no wonder
they're still pissed off.

372
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,718
Well, let's go to the other room

373
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,382
and I'll take care of your hands.

374
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,800
The only ones that survived were five

375
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,548
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

376
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,471
Why hasn't that machine been disabled?

377
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,718
It was on my dad's list of things to do,

378
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,559
but the house did him first.

379
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,270
Wait, you said that was an accident.

380
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,313
I lied.

381
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,399
The house is alive, we're all gonna die.

382
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,608
Wait, why doesn't just
one of us call out for help?

383
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,110
There aren't any
working phones in the house.

384
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,032
- Oh, I've got my cell phone.
- I've got my cell phone.

385
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,039
That won't do any good.

386
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,866
It's the metal plates.

387
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,877
It's not the plates.

388
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,417
It's the house!

389
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,880
Why is no one listening to me?

390
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,047
Did you just turn deaf all of a sudden?

391
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,883
It's alive!

392
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,549
We're not going anywhere!

393
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,556
That's it!

394
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,219
So what, we're stuck here forever?

395
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,056
No, a cleaning crew's supposed to come

396
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,766
in at 9:30 in the morning.

397
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,101
Jesus!

398
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,891
Oh, so then we'll just
stay here till morning.

399
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,059
Yeah, I'm sure we'll be mutilated

400
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,227
beyond recognition by then.

401
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,726
Why do I feel like this is
some sick joke to scare us

402
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,945
out of our wits and a
hell of a lot of money?

403
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,656
You got that right.

404
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,400
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

405
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,278
You've outdone yourself tonight.

406
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,406
Scared the shit out of even me.

407
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,452
You've had your fun.

408
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,500
Open this place up.

409
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,619
Asking the wrong guy.

410
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,212
Wasn't me who closed it.

411
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,547
Sure it wasn't.

412
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,006
Uh, anybody else here make a living

413
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,092
with thrills and chills for the kiddies?

414
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,551
Don't all raise your hands at once.

415
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,920
You're that Stephen Price?

416
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,593
As in Price Amusement Parks?

417
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,559
Bravo.

418
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,645
All right, Pritchett,
this lockdown thing,

419
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,811
there's gotta be like a main control room

420
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,898
in this place, right?

421
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,019
In the basement, but you're
not gonna wanna go down there.

422
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,770
No, you don't want to go down there.

423
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,318
- No, I don't.
- We will both go down there

424
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,657
and try to put a reverse on this thing.

425
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,901
You're not gonna
wanna go down there.

426
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,410
It's a maze down there.

427
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,580
Then that leaves you with two options.

428
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,950
Either show me where and
maybe we get out of here

429
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,748
or it's spend the night, sleep tight.

430
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,051
Fine.

431
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,670
Uh, a word of advice, kitten.

432
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,095
God knows what kind of freak-outs

433
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,440
Stephen's got set to spring in this place.

434
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,688
If I were you, I'd bring
something to protect myself with.

435
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,852
Baby, don't you think now's the time

436
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,945
to break out your party favors?

437
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,280
What are you talking about?

438
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,820
Same exact setup you used back

439
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,533
in '94 for the son of Sam hunt.

440
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,200
Hilarious.

441
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,700
Firearms this time.

442
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,910
Jesus Christ.

443
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,120
The clip's been welded shut.

444
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,840
On all of them, probably.

445
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,712
So how's a girl to know if
these things are loaded, puff?

446
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,214
Only one way I can think of.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,500
Woah.

448
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,310
No.

449
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,013
I think I'll let the
virgin have first crack.

450
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,440
I don't want a goddamn gun!

451
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,564
I'll take it, shit.

452
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,308
Let's just go.

453
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,526
I'll meet you all down there.

454
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,565
Uh, and where are we off to, Mr. Price?

455
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,064
Checking the wiring on
the animatronic mummies?

456
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,692
Just taking a leak
if it's okay with you.

457
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,781
Oh wow.

458
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,713
Careful.

459
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,049
I gotta say, coming down
here's a really good idea.

460
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,878
I know I'm having a great time.

461
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,005
Yeah well, you're
not helping matters much.

462
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,883
Smells fantastic.

463
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,515
Ain't you handy to have around.

464
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,828
I love how nothing works.

465
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,250
Let me get you some light.

466
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,262
Oh yeah, these things.

467
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,107
I knew I shoulda kept my ass at home.

468
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,013
Damn.

469
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,557
You're pretty handy yourself.

470
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,395
Take us where this thing's at.

471
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,064
- Come on, man.
- All right.

472
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,528
Thank you, got it.

473
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,495
Hey, Schecter!

474
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,202
At least give me a few of seconds notice

475
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,579
before you pull a stunt like that.

476
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,454
The lockdown thing?

477
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,706
I mean, very impressive,

478
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,752
scared all the right
people, but you know...

479
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
It wasn't me.

480
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,256
What do you mean?

481
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,878
I mean I was just sitting
here and it happened.

482
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,221
I had nothing to do with it.

483
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,556
Then who did?

484
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,516
No idea, maybe it was
just the thing's time

485
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,681
to finally fall apart.

486
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:51,193
Somehow, I don't know how, she did it.

487
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,274
You should really open up this place

488
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,790
to the public, Pritchett.

489
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,830
A spa for people without
enough stress in their lives.

490
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,870
That's funny, sharp.

491
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:04,914
Look, I'm the one who didn't

492
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,409
wanna come down here, remember that?

493
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,036
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house

494
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,790
since, I don't know, 1931.

495
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,042
Is that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

496
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:15,883
Oh shit.

497
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,010
- Sorry.
- That's a good way

498
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,716
to get your head blown off, man.

499
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,179
I'll recommend it to Evelyn.

500
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,600
What's in there?

501
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,020
Someone sure went to a lot of
trouble trying to seal that up.

502
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,189
I don't know, I've never been in there,

503
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,690
but it's not the way out.

504
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,688
Let's go down here and take a right.

505
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,318
This is electroshock therapy.

506
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,040
There's several of these
rooms hooked together.

507
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,333
Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his
patients in multiples of 18.

508
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,419
More energy efficient, I guess.

509
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,920
Isn't that pleasant?

510
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,810
How about we go?

511
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,310
- Agreed.
- Yeah.

512
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,820
Oh, shit.

513
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,840
Guess we shoulda made a left.

514
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,380
What is this?

515
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,458
This is the saturation chamber.

516
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,480
What's a saturation chamber?

517
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,970
It's Vannacutt's
treatment for schizophrenia.

518
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,430
What would drive a sane man mad
would drive a mad man sane.

519
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,090
Something like that.
I don't know. Whatever.

520
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,020
It's supposed to bombard 'em with images

521
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,607
and weird noises and
scare 'em back to normal.

522
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,528
Lot of fun.

523
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,030
Did it work?

524
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,770
I don't know.

525
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,280
Did it work?

526
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,530
Oh, fuck.

527
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,080
Guys?

528
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,243
Hey!

529
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,750
Guys!

530
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,210
Pritchett?

531
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,580
Oh, I do not wanna be lost down here.

532
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,570
Price!

533
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,780
Pritchett!

534
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,076
This is not cool.

535
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,380
Let me try something.

536
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,640
Can you get me up?

537
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,720
Here, watch out.

538
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,770
Hey, pal, that wasn't code for...

539
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,320
For what?

540
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,894
Could you just shine the light here?

541
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,410
Absolutely.

542
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,152
Absolutely.

543
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,696
All right.

544
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,284
What are you looking for
up there, what are you doing?

545
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,950
This whole place can't be
wired to just one circuit.

546
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,660
Careful.

547
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,380
Oh!

548
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,171
- Better than nothing.
- Not bad.

549
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,218
Down, big guy.

550
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,359
Thanks.

551
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,185
That was the most fun I've had all day.

552
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,816
You need to get out more.

553
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,831
So who are you really?

554
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,659
What?

555
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,081
You mean like deep down inside?

556
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,374
Well we can start with the name

557
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:05,340
you were given at birth, then
we can take it from there.

558
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,549
I told you already.

559
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,509
Jennifer Jenzen, executive vp...

560
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,719
You're lying, all right?

561
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,087
And I don't think so.

562
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:11,929
Why not?

563
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,924
I've never in my life met an executive

564
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:14,924
who could tie their shoes

565
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,723
much less rewire an entire building.

566
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,391
Well, there's always exceptions.

567
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,229
No.

568
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,268
Come on, what's the truth?

569
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,766
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,

570
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,768
we're gonna have end up where we started.

571
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,356
Look, we're all gonna be
outta here in a little while

572
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,574
and go our separate ways
a million bucks richer.

573
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,162
So what does it matter
who I am or who I'm not?

574
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,870
Okay, so let's say, hypothetically,

575
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,332
I'm not exactly who I said I was.

576
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,326
Okay, so you're right, you're a genius.

577
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,124
I don't know anyone that could've
seen through me like that.

578
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,047
All right, look, my real name is Sara,

579
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,464
and I'm an assistant.

580
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,384
Was, anyway, to the real Jennifer

581
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,848
bitch that was invited here.

582
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:59,436
And now you know and I'm begging
that you don't tell anyone

583
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:03,640
because I'm out of a job and
could use even a tenth of that money.

584
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,540
Eddie?

585
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,630
You know, if this is your
idea of funny, think again.

586
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,350
You know, in fact, you're
really starting to piss me off.

587
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,060
Eddie!

588
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,750
Eddie, wait!

589
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,270
Eddie?

590
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,790
Eddie?

591
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,130
Hey!

592
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,270
Hey!

593
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,227
You know, for a second I actually

594
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,941
thought that you were a decent guy.

595
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,823
What is your problem?

596
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,169
Eddie?

597
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,423
Okay, you win.

598
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,431
You've successfully creeped me out.

599
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,198
Eddie?

600
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,044
What are you doing?

601
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,017
Eddie!

602
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,478
Eddie!

603
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,066
Eddie!

604
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,531
Eddie!

605
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,656
Eddie!

606
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,070
Come on!

607
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,569
Take my hand!

608
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Eddie!

609
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,332
Eddie!

610
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,370
Come on, no, Eddie!

611
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Eddie!

612
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,337
Eddie!

613
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,956
What the hell are you doing?

614
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,430
Eddie!

615
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,620
No!

616
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,067
Well, looky.

617
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,818
Looks like the games have begun.

618
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,161
Where is he, where's Price?

619
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,080
What happened to you?
Are you all right?

620
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,500
No, I am so fucking far
from all right it's not even funny.

621
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,170
Someone or something just tried

622
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,260
to drown me in a tank of
blood the size of a Buick.

623
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,962
Uh, let me give you a hint.

624
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,677
His initials are S.P.

625
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,138
All right, S.P.

626
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,054
As in sorry, Petunia
because I was with Pritchett

627
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,302
the whole time looking
for the master control.

628
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,809
It doesn't seem to exist.

629
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,320
Look at this, huh?

630
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,740
What is this?

631
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,566
That? What just happened to you there?
That's nothing.

632
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,689
You've just been playing
around with a ghost,

633
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,486
wait'll somebody lets out
the darkness in this place.

634
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,825
That's a whole, that's a
whole new bunch of crazy shit.

635
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,410
That's, you'll hate that shit.

636
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:28,020
What is this darkness?

637
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,340
It, the thing, the evil!

638
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,076
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this place!

639
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,668
The thing that's going to kill us all!

640
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,548
Death by corrosion, that thing!

641
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,010
Pritchett.

642
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,881
Are you currently under
the care of a physician?

643
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,175
No, I'm not, no, no I'm not.

644
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,722
Well, either we spend the
night and collect our money

645
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,812
or we try to find a way outta here.

646
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,728
Either way, I think we
should all stick together.

647
00:44:56,736 --> 00:45:00,103
But maybe that's not gonna
fit in with your plans, baby.

648
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,445
You know me.

649
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,565
The more, the merrier.

650
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,452
I guess somebody better go
find the old game-show hostess.

651
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,946
Where is she?

652
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,471
Oh.

653
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,973
Oh, this is weird.

654
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,550
I guess old Melissa found
what she was looking for.

655
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,520
Jesus, she's dead.

656
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,603
She was cute too.

657
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,897
God, I'd love to get laid before I died.

658
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,695
How you doing tonight?

659
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,446
Yeah, I'm all right.

660
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,704
Is she all right?

661
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,125
I don't know.

662
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,601
What the hell is this?

663
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,856
It seems to just stop here.

664
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,689
Shit, she's gotta be somewhere,

665
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,033
because she couldn't have just
disappeared into thin air.

666
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,500
No.

667
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,534
Not air.

668
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,630
Into the house.

669
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,100
There's gotta be a
way out of this house.

670
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,104
Some way.

671
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,471
Pritchett!

672
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,312
What?

673
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,556
I'm talking to you! Whoa!

674
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,603
Look, if you're easy, easy.

675
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,271
- Damn, that wasn't nice.
- Easy.

676
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,190
Hey, if everybody's
gonna scream at each other,

677
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,188
could you do it in another room, please?

678
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,063
Watch it!

679
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,406
I'm about to
figure out exactly what,

680
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,116
or who, Melissa was taping.

681
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,452
What, then where will we be?

682
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,788
Out of scotch, thanks to you, ass!

683
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,917
Hey, I think I got something.

684
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:58,912
Bravo.

685
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:00,955
Bravo.

686
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,456
I know it's not good manners
to ask the magician how

687
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,623
he did it but inquiring
minds are desperate to know.

688
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,962
Just what did really
happen to little Miss Marr?

689
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,959
Asking the wrong person.

690
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,005
I mean, did she stage it
all for you and then go hide?

691
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,767
Or did you just flat out
kill the little bitch?

692
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,385
I pose you the same question.

693
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,636
Who's next on your list?

694
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,602
If I had one, Evelyn, whom do you think?

695
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,521
Oh for god sakes, we all know that

696
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,485
knocking me off is the bottom line here.

697
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,650
You know I'm not gonna
make it easy for you.

698
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,662
You think that's gonna do
the trick, do you, tulip?

699
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,281
I would never give you a loaded gun.

700
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,170
Jesus!

701
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,045
Funky old house, ain't it?

702
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,051
Friends, your hostess is now going

703
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,546
to retire for what's left of the night.

704
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,015
If you need me, I'll be
upstairs in the bedroom.

705
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,269
And if anyone so much
as peeks in the keyhole

706
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,764
I'm gonna empty this thing
into their fucking head.

707
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,362
Oh, come on.

708
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,906
I loaded them with blanks.

709
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,829
And even if I were gonna,
you know, murder my wife,

710
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,455
I don't think I'd do it in a locked house

711
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,331
with quite so many witnesses.

712
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,550
Hey, take this.

713
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,091
What good is a million
dollars if you're dead?

714
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,020
Okay.

715
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,139
Let's find a way to get outta here.

716
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,482
Right.

717
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,021
I'm gonna try to find Ms. Marr.

718
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,778
I'm gonna go find me something to drink.

719
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,540
Shit!

720
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,190
How is she pulling this off?

721
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,667
Ms. Marr?

722
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,560
You son of a bitch, I know you're here.

723
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,618
What is happening?

724
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,940
Electroshock!

725
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,732
Oh, Jesus.

726
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,312
No, God, no!

727
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,184
No! - Don't touch her!

728
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,811
Well, turn it off!

729
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:49,283
For God's sake, somebody do something!

730
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,744
Come on, somebody turn the damn thing off!

731
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,920
Pritchett, somebody, do something!

732
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,620
Turn it off!

733
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,875
There's gotta be a switch or something!

734
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,861
I'm sorry.

735
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,900
She's not dead, we just gotta

736
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,024
get her heart pumping again.

737
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,320
It's too late.

738
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,630
Oh no.

739
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:45,842
Oh.

740
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,716
Baby, I'm so sorry.

741
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,101
I swear to God, it's this house.

742
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,346
Fuck the house!

743
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,860
It wasn't the house!

744
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,350
It wasn't Goddamn ghosts!

745
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,443
This is, plain and simple,
good old-fashioned homicide.

746
00:56:11,586 --> 00:56:15,323
Is it too complicated for you?
Let me spell it out for you then, kids.

747
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,787
A - Evelyn sure as hell
didn't kill herself.

748
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,871
B - I know I didn't do it.

749
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,616
Which just leaves us with C.

750
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:24,119
One of you motherfuckers murdered my wife!

751
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,837
You're talking crazy, Price.

752
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,100
Who's gonna tell me
about the strange guy

753
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,626
with the mustache and the lab coat

754
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,253
who I've been chasing all
over this goddamn house?

755
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,422
Vannacutt.

756
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,549
Jesus.

757
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,060
Oh no.

758
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,477
Some little shit working for one of you

759
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,392
with the hopes of pocketing
several million bucks.

760
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,606
Now I want some answers.

761
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,273
Oh, put that away.

762
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,450
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

763
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,450
Back up, honey.
There's a one in four chance it's you.

764
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,990
Put the gun down!

765
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,840
Well let's see who blinks first.

766
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,530
What do we do with him?

767
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,366
Open this fucking door!

768
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,582
You sure this thing will hold him?

769
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,200
Oh, I don't think it'll be a problem.

770
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,130
Come on.

771
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,585
So, you gonna stay and
make sure he doesn't get out?

772
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,086
I'll stay and keep an eye on him.

773
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,929
You gonna be okay by yourself?

774
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,430
I hope.

775
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:04,602
I have to tell you,

776
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,018
I'm just a little bit
uncomfortable with this.

777
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,140
I'm sure you are.

778
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,198
Open the Goddamn door!

779
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,530
What?

780
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,707
Open the Goddamn door!

781
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,379
I can't, I'm sorry, I can't.

782
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:37,805
What's this?

783
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,891
This!

784
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,435
Anything?

785
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,180
Open this fucking door!

786
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:53,151
How about this?

787
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,159
Come on, what are you doing?

788
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:01,993
Better?

789
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:02,997
Blackburn!

790
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,440
Great party!

791
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,800
I gotta go!

792
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,790
Blackburn!

793
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,510
Blackburn!

794
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,100
Blackburn!

795
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,398
All right, I think we shoulda
taken a right back there.

796
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,405
Back where?

797
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,359
Damn it, good point.

798
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,950
Let's just try down here.

799
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,364
All right, come on.

800
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,372
Okay.

801
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:54,872
Yo, Sara, look.

802
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,001
Vannacutt's office.

803
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,037
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

804
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,413
And what do you think, Dr. Vannacutt?

805
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,436
Hey, look it here.

806
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,897
What do you got?

807
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,061
Class of 1931.

808
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,934
That's a cheery-looking bunch.

809
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,858
Better living through electricity.

810
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,245
I think...

811
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,583
Oh, my god!

812
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,874
I know how the guest list was made.

813
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,373
Look at these names.

814
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,212
Head nurse, Ruthe Ann Stockard.

815
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,207
Electroshock, Adolphus Jenzen.

816
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,424
Franklin Baker.

817
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:09,338
Thomas Steven Price.

818
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,132
Jasper Marr.

819
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,299
They're all here!

820
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,717
Who's all here, I'm missing something.

821
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:17,058
Everyone that was invited
is related to one of the staff

822
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,768
that was here when the place burnt.

823
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,267
There was five of us.

824
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,063
And five that didn't die.

825
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,071
Booga-booga.

826
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,189
What are you saying?

827
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,816
Price didn't make the list.

828
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,827
The house did.

829
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,706
Because she's a vengeful, stupid whore!

830
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,292
Ow.

831
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,709
Wait, how's the house
gonna send out invitations?

832
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,297
There's a lotta energy in here.

833
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,505
It likes to travel through light beams

834
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:55,506
and sound waves, electricity, whatever.

835
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,007
A phone line?

836
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,851
Yeah, sure, now that we're
in the twilight zone, mhm.

837
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,139
Into an online computer
through the Internet?

838
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,390
No, no, no, stop.

839
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,267
Wait, this is crazy.

840
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,983
You don't get it, do you?

841
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,617
This house is pissed.

842
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,034
It has no morals.

843
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,252
Because it's a fucking house!

844
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,712
- This is insane.
- All right, calm down.

845
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,876
All right, I'm sorry, sorry about that.

846
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,678
All right.

847
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,471
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

848
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,520
How come Blackburn's name's not on here?

849
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,320
The late Mrs. Steven Price.

850
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,050
Tragic.

851
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,430
Tortured.

852
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,890
Lovely.

853
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,193
And suddenly very cooperative, Mrs. Price.

854
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,420
Cool.

855
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,220
What do you think you're doing, mister?

856
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,232
Easy, easy, lie back, be still.

857
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,732
Last thing we need is for you
to have a real heart attack.

858
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,275
You're the doctor, kid.

859
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,942
I guess that atropine crap worked, huh?

860
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:20,783
Yep.

861
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,527
Convinced all those
that needed convincing.

862
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,121
You are officially one dead lady.

863
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,910
Trust me, I've been dead for years.

864
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,869
Speaking of which, what's Steven's status?

865
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,340
Well, he's still alive but it's
just a question of moments.

866
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,176
And then your miraculous resurrection.

867
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,014
Oh no, officer, I'm very much alive.

868
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,598
Just a little joke to beat my husband

869
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,967
at his own clever game.

870
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,095
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
your husband's dead.

871
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,642
What do you mean, he's dead?

872
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,310
Oh, no, it's all my fault.

873
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,854
I may as well have killed him myself.

874
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:54,850
No, no, not at all.

875
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,444
We have all these witnesses that saw.

876
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,950
Well fill in the blank,
whoever it's gonna be that shoots him.

877
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,120
I don't know.
Puff Eddie?

878
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,740
You know, this could be a big surprise.

879
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,408
I think the Jenzen girl.

880
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,156
She's got the right stuff.

881
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,704
Did you ever find out what
happened to that little TV reporter?

882
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:15,459
No, we never found her.

883
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,421
So we don't even know if

884
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,087
the little bitch is dead or alive.

885
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:22,303
Well, but I think
Price must've killed her.

886
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,672
There's no other explanation.

887
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,844
There's plenty, you moron!

888
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,059
For all we know Stephen's got
her spying on us right now!

889
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,560
Oh, bullshit.

890
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,646
God, this whole fucking
thing's falling apart.

891
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,981
It's not, baby, it's not.

892
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,021
Somebody's gonna pull the trigger.

893
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,361
But nobody has yet, Donald.

894
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,979
They're not at the breaking point.

895
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,403
The bozos have to believe that
their lives are in danger!

896
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,866
They have your death at his hands.

897
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,905
How much more do they need?

898
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,448
But they didn't see it happen.

899
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,993
They still have their
doubts, they're confused.

900
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,702
What we need is another body

901
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,998
and Stephen's bloody
hands right next to it.

902
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,883
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

903
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,383
I don't know,

904
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,597
this may sound a little
crazy, but hear me out.

905
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,026
This is all I could find.

906
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,700
This here.

907
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,200
- Well, it's gonna have to do.
- Yeah.

908
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,706
Are you coming, or
waiting for Blackburn?

909
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,210
Blackburn's dead.

910
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:17,500
Excuse me?

911
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,310
He would've been back by now.

912
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,430
He's dead.

913
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,470
Blackburn!

914
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,960
Oh, shit.

915
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,640
Oh, shit.

916
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,682
Where is he?

917
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,730
Blackburn!

918
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:22,650
He's gotta still be down here...

919
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,200
He's dead, all right? We're all gonna be dead.

920
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,485
- Will you stop saying that?
- Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

921
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,013
I just wanted to ask you a question.

922
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,489
Price is behind this.

923
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,411
How could he be? He's still locked up.

924
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,495
Let's go see.

925
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:40,962
It's Blackburn.

926
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,891
- Oh, my God.
- Shit!

927
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,152
Price, you murderer!

928
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,019
Melissa?

929
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,442
It's Sara.

930
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,816
Help me.

931
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:50,939
Somebody!

932
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,906
I'll help you. Oh God.

933
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,116
Just keep talking.

934
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,991
Oh God.

935
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:02,290
- Oh, oh, oh.
- It's okay.

936
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,421
Okay.

937
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,339
Okay.

938
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,678
It's okay, it's okay.

939
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,769
I woke up on the floor.

940
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,643
It was Blackburn.

941
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,396
Stay the fuck back!

942
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,865
I don't know what happened!

943
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:35,869
I do.

944
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,411
Please, tell me.

945
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,415
Help me.

946
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,661
I don't think so!

947
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,743
You gotta help me.

948
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,711
Not even for a million bucks, Mr. Price.

949
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:00,303
Help me.

950
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,572
Oh, shit!

951
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,789
Whoa!

952
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,454
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Grab her gun.

953
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,543
Okay, damn, she emptied it.

954
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,831
I got this.

955
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:29,828
I got this, baby girl.

956
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,829
Give, let go.

957
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,340
All right, there we go.

958
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,760
I'm gonna put this right here. Okay?

959
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:38,262
Look, it's cool, it's me.

960
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,870
Okay, it's me, Eddie, look.

961
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,257
Poor Mr. Price.

962
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,384
Fuck Mr. Price.

963
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:44,727
Come on, baby girl.

964
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,391
I got you.

965
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,855
I got you, come on, it's cool.

966
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:48,973
Let's get the Hell outta here.

967
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:49,985
I got you.

968
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,064
Okay, don't look, don't look, keep going.

969
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,779
Up we go, up we go, baby girl, okay.

970
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,241
Almost there.

971
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:00,576
You just get upstairs.

972
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,662
All right, easy, don't look, don't look.

973
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,484
Stephen.

974
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,944
You poor clueless old geek.

975
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,984
All it would've taken was a simple divorce

976
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,569
and ripping our prenup to
teeny, itsy-bitsy little pieces.

977
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:50,752
But no matter how it ended
please just know one thing:

978
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,626
From the first moment I set eyes on you

979
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,051
I have always, always loved...

980
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:01,540
...your money.

981
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,760
On the other hand, just the sight of you

982
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,013
has always made me want to puke.

983
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,849
Is that a fact, Princess?

984
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,441
Maybe you could have saved
us all a great deal of time

985
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:22,030
not to mention money, if you
just let me in on it years ago.

986
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,570
How--

987
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,662
You must be kidding!

988
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:32,535
I'm Stephen Goddamn Price!

989
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,126
Every place you've gone,
every person you've seen,

990
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:43,770
every word you and Blackburn
ever said to each other, bugged,

991
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,349
taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

992
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,184
Sweetie?

993
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,303
Anything, angel!

994
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,429
Just speak it!

995
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,522
What are you gonna do?

996
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,910
Just what you wanted everyone here

997
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,650
to believe in the first place!

998
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,264
I'm gonna murder you, Evelyn,

999
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:04,500
with the greatest of pleasure!

1000
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,830
Witnesses.

1001
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,499
You're already dead, Evelyn!

1002
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,243
Happy birthday, baby!

1003
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,170
Evelyn?

1004
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,950
Evelyn?

1005
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
Get up.

1006
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,240
Stephen, are you doing this?

1007
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,660
No.

1008
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,290
Get up!

1009
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,780
Now!

1010
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,514
Stephen! Stephen!

1011
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,400
Oh, Ms. Marr.

1012
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:38,266
Stephen, I want you.

1013
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,139
I've always wanted you.

1014
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,819
We all do.

1015
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:46,903
They're all here.

1016
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,950
Everyone who's died.

1017
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,280
Everyone who's responsible.

1018
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,700
It's your turn.

1019
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,536
One, two, three.

1020
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:30,564
Open the door!

1021
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:31,941
Somebody open the door!

1022
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,488
Oh, my god.

1023
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,986
- Oh God, open the door!
- It's Price.

1024
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,705
- Open the Goddamn door!
- Price?

1025
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:43,118
- Somebody, please!
- Price is dead.

1026
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,916
Open the Goddamn door!

1027
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:48,926
Pritchett!

1028
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:52,003
Open the Goddamn door!

1029
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,129
Open the door!

1030
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:58,500
No!

1031
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,830
Go!

1032
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,670
Run!

1033
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,346
Come on!

1034
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,270
What was that?

1035
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,610
It can't be, you're dead!

1036
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,930
Pritchett was right.

1037
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,689
The house is alive.

1038
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,480
There's gotta be something.

1039
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,537
Pulleys or something.

1040
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,950
The attic!

1041
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,241
Come on!

1042
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,060
Let's get to the attic! Hurry!

1043
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,620
Come on!

1044
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,370
Terrific!

1045
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,020
Fuck!

1046
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,850
So much for a Ph.D. in engineering.

1047
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,014
I found a way out!

1048
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,435
What, where?

1049
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,400
Up here! Better hurry!

1050
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,651
There is something of a time issue here.

1051
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,610
Sara.

1052
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,250
Come on!

1053
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,220
Where are you going?

1054
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,470
Sara, you have to stay for my show.

1055
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,170
Oh, God!

1056
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,400
There's light, there's light!

1057
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,899
Stay here, I'm gonna go and
see if we can get out this way.

1058
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,850
Sara, come...

1059
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,610
Oh, shit.

1060
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:14,690
Go!

1061
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,300
Sara!

1062
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,250
- No!
- Eddie, oh my God!

1063
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,040
Help me, Eddie!

1064
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,380
The doctor is in.

1065
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,584
No one gets out of here alive.

1066
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,350
Not me, not you.

1067
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,980
No.

1068
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,090
Next patient.

1069
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,980
Ah, Mr. Baker.

1070
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,310
It's time to take your
rightful place with the others.

1071
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,930
I had nothing to do with this!

1072
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,977
I was adopted!

1073
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:15,440
Oh, God.

1074
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,700
What is this?

1075
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:50,930
What is it?

1076
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,130
Oh, my God.

1077
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:28,090
That was one kick-ass party.

1078
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,795
Okay, one more thing: How
do we get down from here?
