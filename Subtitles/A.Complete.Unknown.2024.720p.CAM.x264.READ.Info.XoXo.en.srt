1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,297
Ladies and
gentlemen, Woody Guthrie.

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,559
...will take some pressure
off the kicking department...

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,895
and Packers star kicker
Paul Hornung.

4
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,272
For the NFC Eastern Conference
New York Giants...

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,191
they'll be in their
away uniforms,

6
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,942
white jerseys
with red numerals,

7
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,612
blue helmets,
and silver football pants.

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,239
The Giants are eight and three
at this stage of the season.

9
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,076
Y.A. Tittle
is in at quarterback
as usual for the Giants.

10
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,118
Thank you.

11
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,978
He sang a country song,
that doesn't mean

12
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,897
he's not still a Catholic
or a Communist.

13
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
You're boxin' him in.

14
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,150
You don't think
there's a difference

15
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,484
between folk music
and country music?

16
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,571
I didn't ask you
to box him in.

17
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,864
Nobody asked you
to box him in.

18
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,948
You did that.
I asked you a question,

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,783
you answered a question.
There you go.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,828
All right. That's it.
That's enough for me.

21
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,705
I'm off. Good night.

22
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,209
Hey, mister,
you know where this place is?

23
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,628
Called Greystone.

24
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,381
I think Woody Guthrie's
in there.

25
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,925
That's a, uh, hospital, pal.

26
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,261
In Morris Plains.

27
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,554
Where is that? Uptown?

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,265
No.

29
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,142
Woody's across the river
in New Jersey.

30
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,020
Christ, I just came
from New Jersey.

31
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,062
So go back.

32
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,105
All rise.

33
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,237
Mr. Seeger,
do you have anything to say

34
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,531
before I pronounce
your sentence?

35
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,910
In my whole life, I've never
said or done anything

36
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,287
subversive to my country,
Your Honor.

37
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,247
That's not why I'm here.

38
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,084
I'm here because
some second-rate politician
from Louisiana...

39
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,545
decided that he don't like
a song I sang...

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,007
...or maybe he don't like
some of the folks

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,175
I might have sung it to.

42
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,928
Mr. Seeger,
a jury has found you guilty

43
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,554
of contempt of Congress.

44
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,765
I refused to name names
and I...

45
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,477
Refused questions!
Under a federal subpoena!

46
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,312
Your Honor, you may know
a friend of mine,

47
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,064
Woody Guthrie.

48
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,690
Great songwriter
and a great American,

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,567
and Woody's not well...

50
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,152
but he's been much on my mind

51
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,487
as I've been
going through this,

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,322
'cause Woody once said that,

53
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,324
"a good song
can only do good."

54
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,867
That's right!

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,203
And the song I'm in hot water
for here, it's a good song.

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,454
It's a patriotic song,
in fact.

57
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,081
Amen!

58
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,458
And I thought,
maybe you'd like to actually
hear the words,

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,584
and I could play it for you.

60
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,336
-And you'll know.
-No, no, no.

61
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,546
No, you're not doing that.

62
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,006
Quiet!

63
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,008
-I said, quiet!
-Are you sure? It's free.

64
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,887
Now, look at that,
the skies are clearing, see?

65
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,389
Pete! Pete! Pete!

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,556
Pete,
are you disappointed?

67
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,724
Think you got a fair shake?

68
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,059
Wish you'd testified, Pete?

69
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,935
How do you feel
about the judgement?

70
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,978
We didn't get the result

71
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,104
that we thought was right,

72
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,023
but we're free to fight
another day.

73
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,150
I offered to play a song for
the judge up there

74
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,111
but he didn't wanna hear it.

75
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,905
But I feel like singing.
So, I'm gonna sing it for you.

76
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,156

Excuse me, Mr. Guthrie.

94
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,868
Well, no one calls him that
except the government.

95
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,162
I'm not the government.

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,041
Well, come on over, then.

97
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm Pete, by the way.

98
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, sir.
No question about it.

00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
How about you?

100
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,229
I'm Bobby.

102
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,067
Dylan.

103
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,824
Uh, Woody would like to know
more about that, Bobby Dylan.

104
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,325
Oh, um...

105
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,369
I sing and I... I play,

106
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,538
and I write songs, actually,
a couple of friends of mine,

107
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,206
Paul and John,
out in Minneapolis.

108
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,875
Midwestern boy?

109
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,668
Yeah, and they showed me
some of

110
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,129
Woody's records, uh,
Folkway ones.

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,966
Yours and Lead Belly and,
uh...

112
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,011
I listened to 'em while they
struck me down to the ground.

113
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,723
I like yours, too, Pete.

114
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,974
Oh, that's fine.

115
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,768
Anyways, uh,
Paul, my friend, uh,

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,770
he said you was
in the hospital, so...

117
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,147
I hitched myself here.

118
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,357
Why is that?

119
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,817
Well, I wanted to meet Woody.

120
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,696
Maybe catch a spark.

121
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,014
That's for damn sure.

122
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,186
We had those printed up
for visitors.

123
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,855
It's mostly family now,
though.

124
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
Uh,
Woody wants to hear something.

125
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,489
You shy?

126
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,699
Not usually.

127
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,492
Well, this is one
I wrote for him.

128
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,370

00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,789

You like that
rock and roll music, then?

160
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,503
Well, I like everything, Pete.

161
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,214
Except maybe, uh,

162
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,425
Patti Page and
That Doggie in the Window

163
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,386
or, you know, Vaughn Monroe.

164
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,221
I like Johnny Cash.
You ever hear of him?

165
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
Oh, sure.

166
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,349
Yeah, I like Hank Williams.

167
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,392
Ah, now you're talking.

168
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
Yeah.

169
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,563
But if you're talking about
rock and roll, specifically,

170
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,149
you gotta be talking about
Buddy Holly.

171
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,486
You think of yourself
as a folk musician now,
though. Yeah?

172
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,780
Well, I don't think to myself
as a folk singer,

173
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,740
you know, folk music thing.

174
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,325
I mean, I do sing folk music,

175
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,202
but when I do, it's sort of a
modified version or something.

176
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,828
You know,
not a modified version,

177
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,288
it's just, you know, sorta...

178
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,998
A good song.
A really good song.

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,543
It can get the job done
without the frills.

180
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,047
Without drums or electrified
instruments or any of that.

181
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,259
Yeah, but sometimes
they sound good.

182
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,989
Hey, Tosh.

183
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,116
This is Bobby,

184
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,244
fellow traveler.

185
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,413
He, uh, paid a visit to Woody
and he had nowhere to sleep.

186
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,249
All right.

187
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,042
Hi, Bob.

188
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,294
-Toshi.
-Hello.

189
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,754
Now,
we finally got a drill

190
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,631
hard enough to get through
all this rock

191
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,175
and now we got water
like a Swiss hotel.

192
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,054
We'll set you up here.

193
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,348
I snore and Toshi kicks me
out here all the time

194
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,767
so, I can vouch
it's comfortable.

195
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,435
The toilet's off
the hall there.

196
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,937
It's a new composter.

197
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,355
It's amazing.
It doesn't smell just...

198
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,439
- Yes, it does.
- Smells so bad!

199
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,899
Yes, it does. It smells awful!

200
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,694
Go to bed, go to bed.
Traitors. All of you.

201
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,487
Bobby, can you go outside
to smoke?

202
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,030
Oh, sorry.

203
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,741
If you get cold, just throw
that Indian blanket over you.

204
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,411
Is he going to bed?

205
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,455
He'll settle down.
He's just...

206
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,749
excited because he met
one of his heroes tonight.

207
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,627
Not me, Woody.

208
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,511
He played us a hell of a song.

209
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,513
Here's your pancake.

210
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,724

Miss Baez. Hey, Miss Baez.

262
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,471
-It's Joan.
-Joan.

263
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,225
Wait.
Can you sign this for me?

Columbia's not a label...

275
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,547

312
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,005
Miss Joanie, Joanie.
That was terrific.

313
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,131
Thanks, Pete.

314
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,341
Hey, this is my friend, Bobby.

315
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,051
-Hey.
-Oh.

316
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,970
-Nice work.
-Thanks.

317
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,641
And now,
a special guest

318
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,435
is going to introduce
open mic tonight.

319
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,646
Don't run. I ain't passing
the basket tonight.

320
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,108
A voice we already know,

321
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,985
and love...

322
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,695
Mr. Pete Seeger!

323
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,954
All right, all right.

324
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
Month or so ago, uh,

325
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,209
Woody and I met a young man.

326
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,504
He kinda just dropped in on us

327
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,922
and he sang us a song.

328
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,885
Well, it fairly struck us
to the ground.

329
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,263
And Woody and I felt that
maybe we were

330
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,141
getting a glimpse of
a new road.

331
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,643
This young man, he's been
playing around town a bit

332
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,022
but I thought it was high time
he took the stage
at Folk City.

333
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,566
So, I want you to give a warm
welcome to Bob Dylan.

334
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,111
All right. Cheers.

335
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,322
Oh, man.
All right, thanks, folks.

336
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,949
Thanks, Pete. That's, uh...

337
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,161
Boy, that's a lot
to live up to.

338
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,413
Uh. Well...

339
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,710
I hope this goes better
than it did

340
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,045
in East Orange, New Jersey.

341
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,424
I'm from New Jersey!

342
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,343
How 'bout that Joan Baez,
folks?

343
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,385
Yeah!

344
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,640
She's pretty good.

345
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,144
And she's pretty.

346
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,522
Sings pretty.

347
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,859
Maybe a little too pretty.

348
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,447
Anyway, here's a lil'
something I wrote.

349
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,532
I hope you think it's good.

350
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,452
It's gotta be good

474
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,162
Frank Sinatra's not a freak.

475
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,164
Well,
that voice ain't human.

476
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,333
You can be beautiful,
or you can be ugly,

477
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,959
but you can't be plain.

478
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,669
You gotta be something
people can't stop looking at,

479
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,713
like a train wreck
or a car crash.

480
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,882
Oh, you seen this?

481
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,052
No. I thought we were going to
see Guernica at the Museum.

482
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,386

483

488
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,559
So...

489
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,895
Bette Davis was a mousy girl,

490
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,524
who had to escape
her domineering mother
to find herself.

491
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,984
-She runs away...
-"Find herself"?

492
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,360
-...becomes beautiful...
-I don't like that.

493
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,863
...returns home,
destroys her mom,

494
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,991
and adopts the child of a man
she can never have.

495
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,325
She didn't "find herself"

496
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,870
like her "self" was a missing
shoe or something.

497
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,164
She just made herself
into something different.

498
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,541
Something better.

499
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,751
Different.

500
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,920
Okay.

501
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,256
You know,
what she wanted to be,

502
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,340
in that moment.

503
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,221
What do you wanna be?

504
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,056
A musician.

505
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,350
Who eats.

506
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,274
Well, I like your songs.

507
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
My record comes out
in a couple weeks.

508
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,863
Some of the songs you played
today on your record?

509
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,740
Well, it's mostly covers.

510
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,074
Just traditional stuff.

511
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,619
You know,
folk songs are supposed to

512
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,746
stand the test of time,
like...

513
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,081
um, Shakespeare or something.

514
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,002
They say no one wants to hear
what a kid wrote last month.

515
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,795
Who's they?

516
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,047
Record company.

517
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,632
My manager.

518
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,551
I'm sorry,

519
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,013
but Where Have All the Flowers
Gone is not Shakespeare.

520
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,767
I mean,

521
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,770
there was a time when the
old songs were new, right?

522
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,314
Someone at some point had to
give the songs a chance.

523
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,482
I mean...

524
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,567
There's a civil war going on
down south.

525
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,736
Biggest military buildup
in history.

526
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,696
Nuclear bombs hanging over us.

527
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,324
It's not all about
the Dust Bowl

528
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,993
and Johnny Appleseed anymore.

529
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,954
Monday to Thursday,
I'm at school.

530
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,415
Then I volunteer at CORE,
Fridays and Saturdays.

531
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,251
And I take a painting class
Sunday mornings in Queens.

532
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,921
What's CORE?

533
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,215
-Congress of Racial Equality.
-Oh, yeah.

534
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,800
We organized
the freedom rides.

535
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,842
All right.

536
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,681
This is me.

537
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,728
Dwight MacDonald wrote
a wonderful piece in here.

538
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,021
I think you'll like him.

539
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,774
He's contrarian, like you.

540
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,027
All right, I'll take a look.

541
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,697
What are you doin' tomorrow?

542
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,742
I told you my schedule.

543
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,036
Oh, yeah, painting. In Queens.

544
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,463
I'm at my mom's
in the afternoon.

545
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,966
Call me there?

546
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,374
Hey there. Have you got
any more Joan Baez?

547
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,542
No, you got the last one.

548
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,462
Amidst the resistance

549
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,796
from the Negro community,

550
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,215
Commissioner Connor
has vowed to stand firm.

551
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,468
Birmingham is home to
700 churches

552
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,720
and the Black churches serve
as the gathering spots...

553
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,641
Let us help you stimulate
your conscience.

554
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,783
I've been publishing it,

555
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,535
but the press
doesn't seem to notice.

556
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,578
Hi.

557
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,748
Package for,
uh, Zimmerman?

558
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,002
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

559
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,891
You need to sleep, babe.

560
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,893
Yeah, I know.

561
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,775

00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,903

-All right,

570
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,805
just let me finish the verse.

571
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,557
Mr. Guthrie needs quiet now.

572
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,101
Whoa! You got a lotta nerve
taking a cigarette out
a man's mouth.

573
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,727
There is another gentleman
in this room,

574
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,104
and he's trying to rest.

575
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,272
You know,
he been resting six months.

576
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,815
I don't think it's workin'.

577
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,235
I'm trying to look out for
your health, Mr. Guthrie.

578
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,237
You know,
last guy let us sing.

579
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,780
Do I look like the last guy?

580
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,699
No, you look like
a bona fide asshole.

581
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,242
Whoa, easy, Bob.
Hello, George.

582
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,661
Mr. Guthrie is here for
treatment, Mr. Seeger.

583
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,788
-That's true, yeah.
-He has a serious disease,

584
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,373
and he's sharin' his room
with a guest.

585
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
Yeah, a guest in a coma!

586
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,419
George, reasonable people
can work these things out.

587
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,379
This is a hospital,
not a nightclub.

588
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,717
Well, I guess every deck come
with two jokers, don't it?

589
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,682
She's a new favorite.
I call her Jane.

590
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,101
I'm moving away
from the abstract a bit

591
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,811
and trying to move into faces.

592
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,146
What about Hank Williams, Tom?

593
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,106
In your estimable opinion,
is he country or folk?

594
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,566
- He's country.
- It don't matter.

595
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,984
'Cause he got pedal steel
behind him?

596
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,152
Bob, man,
you're telling me

597
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,236
there's no difference?

598
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,905
Sylvie,
you gotta hear this, man.

599
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,281
No, man.

600
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,326
You can call it country
or blues or rock and roll,

601
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,329
but we all keep rewriting
the same songs.

602
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,725
Are these his friends
from his circus days?

603
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,062
Stop it, Gena.

604
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,355
Is his real name Zimmerman?

605
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,397
Move along.

606
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,248
Mr. Johnny Cash!

607
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,500
He started out
in country music

608
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,710
and sorta made
the transition over into pop.

609
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,295
Ain't no transition, man.

610
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:40,132
Gotta label him with
that corny bullshit, man.

611
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,468
Please remember
garbage on Tuesdays.

612
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,680
Except if Monday's a holiday,
which it will be next week.

613
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,431
You got it.

614
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,683
I have to do this.

615
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,309
It's a school trip,
it's required.

616
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,603
All right, you said that
already, like, three times.

617
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,063
It's only 12 weeks.

618
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,856
Well, God made the world
in six days.

619
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,149
So?

620
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,859
So, 12 weeks' a lot longer.

621
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,237
What am I supposed to do
with the extra 65 days?

622
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,697
Are you God, Bob?

623
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,282
How many times
do I have to say this?

624
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,450
Yes.

625
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,753
I think about how much
I'm gonna miss you...

626
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,715
then I realize...

627
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,051
I don't know you.

628
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,265
There's a face
on your driver's license.

629
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,433
He's different.

630
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,435
-Has a different name.
-Wow.

631
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,937
When I get back, I'd like to
get to know that guy.

632
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,105
Don't do this, Sylvie.

633
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,690
You wrote
a five-minute song about

634
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,483
this girl in Minneapolis.

635
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,027
Who was that? What happened?

636
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,528
You tell me you dropped out
of college...

637
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,612
No, I didn't drop out
of college.

638
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,697
-I didn't say that.
-You came here

639
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,781
with nothing but a guitar.

640
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,283
You never talk about
your family,

641
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,492
your past,
besides the "carnival."

642
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,411
'Cause people make up
their past, Sylvie.

643
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,538
They remember what they want,
they forget the rest!

644
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,248
I tell you everything.

645
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,126
My folks, my sister,
the street I grew up on.

646
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,669
Yeah, I never asked you
about any of it.

647
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,920
What, you think
that stuff defines you?

648
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,589
What I come from?

649
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,842
What I want and what
I don't want, what I reject.

650
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,677
-Yes!
-Mm.

651
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,137
Good thing
you're going to Rome.

652
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,890
And then what?

653
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,559
I come back and live
with a mysterious minstrel?

654
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,397
No, mysterious minstrels
sell more than 1,000 records.

655
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,609
Maybe just don't
come back at all.

656
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,084
Oh, Christ, come on, Sylvie.

657
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,672
Stop hiding.

658
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,384
We both know you can't wait to
have your place to yourself.

659
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,594
Jesus. Part of me.

660
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,930
Not all of me.

661
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,057
What? You want me to make
sense 100% of the time?

662
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
There's a lot I want.

663
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,229
And you do too.
You're ambitious.

664
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,522
I think that scares you.

665
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,859
"The line has been drawn.

666
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,861
"The curse has been cast.

667
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,030
"The slow one
now will later be..."

668
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,953
Your record was
all other people's music.

669
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,881
Good evening,
my fellow citizens.

670
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,925
This government, as promised,

671
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,970
has maintained
the closest surveillance

672
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,180
of the Soviet military buildup

673
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,557
on the island of Cuba.

674
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,351
Within the past week,

675
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,604
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

676
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,108
that a series of
offensive missile sites

677
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,320
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.

678
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,032
The purpose of these bases
can be none other

679
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,161
than to provide a nuclear
strike capability

680
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,580
against
the Western Hemisphere.

681
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,916
Upon receiving the first
preliminary hard information

682
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,377
last Tuesday morning
at 9:00 am...

683
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,298
...I directed that our
surveillance be stepped up.

684
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,050
It shall be the policy
of this nation

685
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,303
to regard any nuclear missile

686
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,638
launched from Cuba
against any nation

687
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,265
in the Western Hemisphere

688
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,977
as an attack
by the Soviet Union
on the United States

689
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,397
requiring a full
retaliatory response...

690
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,441
If invasion is undertaken

691
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,985
the Russians have said
that they would retaliate, uh,

692
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,155
with, uh, rocket fire.

693
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,823
We have said if there's
rocket fire from Cuba,

694
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,991
we will retaliate

695
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,994
and there goes
the whole ball game.

696
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,120
So, how do we relate Berlin
as the...

697
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,663
What's on TV?

698
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,165
On the question of
immediate relief

699
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,541
or optimism here

700
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,793
that nobody in the White House
is willing to say...

701
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,587
Pick up.

702
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,589
Come on.

703
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,800
They do not believe
that the 24 hours
of waiting is over.

704
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,094
There's still
considerable belief

705
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:58,015
that the confrontation
in the Caribbean
will come yet tonight.

706
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,981
No one can guarantee

707
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,568
that American families
on the eastern seaboard
will be alive tomorrow.

708
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,948
Hey!

709
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,668
Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Hey! Come on!

710
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you.

711
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,263

Thank you, Bob.

732
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,734
Troubling time,
go find someone to love.

733
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,196
American forces stand on edge

734
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,865
with naval ships positioned
throughout the Caribbean.

735
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,129
The Unites States almost
went to nuclear war.

736
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,923
Perhaps no one will ever know
how close it came

737
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,883
except for Nikita Khrushchev

738
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,719
who apparently
had no illusions.

739
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,303
The feeling
in official Washington

740
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,181
after one of the most
frightening weeks in history,

741
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,225
is that it's too early
for elation

742
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,561
but not too early
to wonder what happened,

743
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,770
and why it happened.

744
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,565
Moscow, of course,
in the last 48 hours

745
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,608
has seemed contradictory
and zigzagged

746
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,319
as if the Kremlin were having
a great, private debate.

747
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,114
The I's are not dotted,
and the T's are not crossed,

748
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,907
but everything seems easier.

749
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,659
The mood here
is still cautious,

750
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,244
spelled with a capital C.

751
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,205
Khrushchev has offered to
remove his missiles from Cuba.

752
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,666
If he does, we will call off
the quarantine

753
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,501
and there will be no invasion.

754
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,297
The President today called
Khrushchev's decision
statesmanlike.

755
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,841
Has the United States made
a deal with Moscow?

756
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,468
The answer is no.

757
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,720
What, then,
is in this for Khrushchev?

758
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,388
There will be
no armed showdown,

759
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,223
there will be no nuclear war.

760
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,476
The Cuban problem
will still be there for us...

761
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,436
Well, that's that.

762
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,023
Now to the news...

763
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,747
Who taught you to play?

764
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,332
Well, I taught myself really.

765
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,543
Picked up a few licks
at the carnival.

766
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,590
At the carnival?

767
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,884
Oh, yeah, there was singin'
cowboys that'd come through,

768
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,595
teach me all sorts of
funny chords.

769
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,971
Yeah, they'd pass through
in the shows

770
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,224
in, uh, Kansas or Dakotas.

771
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,312
Yeah, these chords I learned
from a cowboy
named Wigglefoot.

772
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,731
You were in a carnival?

773
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,363
You are so completely
full of shit.

774
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:10,244
I had lessons as a kid,
you know, normal lessons.

775
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,411
I write too.

776
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,704
I'm not sure
there's a way to learn that.

777
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,501
Too hard.

778
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,002
Excuse me?

779
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,881
You try too hard.

780
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,551
To write.

781
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,094
Really?

782
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,387
Yeah, if you're askin'.

783
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,557
I wasn't.

784
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,768
Sunsets and seagulls.

785
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,770
Smell of buttercups.

786
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,731
Your songs are like
an oil painting
at the dentist's office.

787
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,236
You're kind of an asshole,
Bob.

788
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,947
Yeah, I guess.

789
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,538

- You can plug that here.
- What did I say?

No, Sylvie,
don't bring 'em in here.

you did.

00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,981
Here. Put your finger there.

-Yeah.

872
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,074

00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,951
Yeah.

875
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,413

876
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,666

Time Magazine.

880
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,133
They recorded her live.

881
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,510
She didn't know they were
gonna put it on the radio.

882
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,804
'Course not.

883
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,270
So, you gave her the song.

884
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,813
I didn't give her the song.

885
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,190
Bobby,
we're ready over here, pal.

886
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,484
You're gonna see her
in California?

887
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,152

01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,532
All right, thank you, Newport.

1051
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,033
Thank you very much.

1052
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,328
Thank you, thank you.

1053
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,790
Well, the next fella up
is my pen pal.

1054
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,458
And sometimes,
when I read his letters,

1055
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,293
I think I can see his brain.

1056
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,839
Anyway, all I know is, uh,

1057
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,508
you better sing about that
rooster crowing
till the break of dawn

1058
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,760
'cause I need to learn
those damn words.

1059
01:06:56,053 --> 01:07:00,016
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Dylan!

1060
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,320
Thank you, Johnny.

1061
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,323
And thank you,
Newport Folk Festival.

1062
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,535

You got kids?

1099
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,253
Yeah.

He's here.

1102
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,661
Excuse me, one second.

1103
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,663
Hey, Bob. Bobby.

1104
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,081
Come on in.
Thank you so much for coming.

1105

Here, let me take your jacket.

Shirley, here.
Take this, please.

Yeah.
This way, my friend.

1112
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,925
Hey, Bob.
I love Tambourine Man.

1113
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,176
Oh, thanks.

1114
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,469
So when's the new album out?

1115
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,679
Uh, soon.

1116
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,015
Can songs really
change things, Bob?

1117
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,309
Well, they change keys.

1118
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,977
Bobby!

1119
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,104
We miss you at the Archive!

1120
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,647
How are you?
Word on the street

1121
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,358
is you're making quite a noise
down there in Studio A, huh?

1122
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,609
This is Becka, by the way.

1123
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,111
Nice to meet you.

1124
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,904
Listen, Bob, you don't have to
compete with the Beatles.

1125
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:06,989
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1126
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,324
You are better than that shit.

1127
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,992
Alan, you're obsessed
with the Beatles. Please.

1128
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,745
Can I get two glasses
of red wine, please?

1129
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:14,455
You didn't bring your guitar
with you, Bobby.

1130
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,165
What, are you saving yourself
for your little tour
with Joanie?

1131
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,750
Not little, Harold. Sold out.

1132
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,585
Whoa! Hey, listen,
that's wonderful!

1133
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,211
And honestly,
the last thing I wanna do now
is put pressure on you,

1134
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,423
but the dirty little secret
is most everybody here is here

1135
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,591
'cause they're hoping
you'd play a little something.

1136
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,343
Where'd they get that idea,
Harold?

1137
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,427
What'd you pull me into, man?

1138
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,720
Is this a fucking gig
or something?

1139
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,929
The prodigal. It's anything
you want it to be.

1140
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,389
-He's back. Hi.
-Hey, Pete.

1141
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,557
-How you doin'?
-Good.

1142
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,641
-Nice to see you.
-Great to see you.

1143
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,018
Toshi, how are you doin'?

1144
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,644
Well, you made it around
the world in 80 days, huh?

1145
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,771
Magic carpet ride.

1146
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,773
Just full of wonder.
Full of wonder.

1147
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,608
This is Becka, by the way.

1148
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,151
Nice to meet you.
This is my wife, Toshi.

1149
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,235
Nice to meet you.

1150
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,196
I absolutely love your music.

1151
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:48,322
I'm such a big fan,
Mr. Seeger.

1152
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,406
No. No, I'm Pete.

1153
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,241
Pete.

1154
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,535
Harold is putting the lean
on you, yeah?

1155
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,079
-Trying to get you to play?
-Yeah, little bit.

1156
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,039
All right. Well,
don't hold it against him.

1157
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,791
It's for a good cause.

1158
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:02,044
Wanna use this beauty?

1159
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,338
You always keep it handy,
huh, Pete?

1160
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,215
He's like a gunfighter
with his six-gun.

1161
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,424

Listen, don't forget to
sing out that thing next time.

Talk to me about that, Harold.
Have fun. Have a good night.

1177
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,311
You were amazing.

1178
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:02,604
Two hundred people
in that room

1179
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,857
and each one wants me
to be somebody else.

1180
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,610
They should just fuck off
and let me be.

1181

Be what?

1182
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,869
Excuse me?

1183
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,079
They should fuck off
and let you be what?

1184
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,542
I don't know.

1185
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,587
Whatever it is
they don't want me to be.

1186
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:31,467
Yeah, well, I'm not a horse,

1187
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,387
so I don't like carrying
other people's weight.

1188
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,476
Yeah. Well, I got
a hundred pounds on me

1189
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:42,603
that don't show on that scale.

1190
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,814
How do you sing, then?

1191
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,987
I put myself in another place.

1192
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,866
But I'm a stranger there.

1193
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,296

01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,014

in the East Village.

01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,766

about that?

01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:54,401
Bob. Bob.

1220
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,652
Bob. Bob.

1221
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,029
Take your glasses off.
Let me see your eyes!

1222
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,905
- Hey, get off!
- Fuck off!

1223
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:01,366
Hey, hey, hey.

1224
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,161
What are you doin', man?

1225
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:15,964
Bob.

1226
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,466
It's 4:00 a.m.

1227
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:19,843
Bob.

1228
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,058
We broke up, remember?

1229
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,934
Can I just get a towel
for this?

1230
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,455
Thanks.

1231
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,428
You know, everyone asks where
these songs come from, Sylvie.

1232
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,640
But when you watch
their faces,

1233
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,267
they're not asking
where the songs come from.

1234
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,814
They're asking why the songs
didn't come to them.

1235
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,028

01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,727
He's a Chicago
blues guitar player.

1248
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,146
Okay,
I can't get him tomorrow.

1249
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,731
-I can get another guitar...
-No.

1250
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,900
I don't want any of your old
session musicians, man.

1251
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,735
I want young guys
with hair on their heads,

1252
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,236
a guitar player,
and a bass player,

1253

an organ player,
and a drum player.

we're gonna get him tomorrow.

George! Victor said
he went by the shop

1265
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,150
and got fitted for
your daughter's wedding.

1266
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,360
- Hello, hello, hello.
- There he is.

1267
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,195
Welcome to the center
of the universe.

1268
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,321
Alan,
let's talk Newport.

1269
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,781
Hello, Harold. Peter.

1270
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,950
All right. Give me Saturday
night again, please.

1271
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:33,328
-Yes, we have Ian and Sylvia.
-Right.

1272
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,705
Odetta, Donovan,

1273
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:37,791
Johnny Cash and Kweskin...

1274
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,543
And Theodore Bikel.

1275
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,586
Yes,
I was just getting to me.

1276
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,213
I also have this proposal
on the table

1277
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,548
for the Butterfield
Blues Band.

1278
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:45,757
Remind me who they are.

1279
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,218
-Chicago blues band.
-Electric blues band.

1280
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,220
A white electric blues band.

1281
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,471
They're hot, Alan.

1282
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,557
The guitarist,
Mike Bloomfield,
is unbelievable.

1283
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:54,724
Oh, yeah. I'm sure he is.

1284
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:57,102
He comes from that
Albert Grossman's stable

1285
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,311
like you, Peter.

1286
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,604
Knock it off.

1287
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:03,191
I hear Bob
is playing electric now.

1288
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,985
Not on our stage, he isn't.

1289
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,070
There is no rock and roll
in Newport.

1290
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,155
We don't need to be dogmatic.

1291
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,574
Okay, okay.

1292
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:11,992
So, what is the
verdict on the Butterfields?

1293
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,160
We already have blues players.
And we got real ones.

1294
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,328
You never heard them, Alan.

1295
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,955
Newport Folk Festival
was created

1296
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,791
to fight a riptide
of inauthentic shit.

1297
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,210
-I understand that...
-No, you don't
understand, Peter.

1298
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:25,130
I'm sorry,
but Peter, Paul and Mary
is a confection.

1299
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:27,299
- Paul's name ain't even Paul.
- Okay, Alan.

1300
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,550
Albert Grossman
changed his name...

1301
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,759
All right, all right.

1302
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,969
...because he thought
it sounded better.

1303
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,137
Thank you so much.

1304
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,346
It's like fucking
Ritz Crackers.

1305
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,098
Now, stop it. Stop it!

1306
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,349
Now, Peter,
don't go, don't go.

1307
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,226
We're gonna work it out.
We're gonna work it out.

1308
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,270
We are here
to celebrate folk music.

1309
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,981
From the people,
for the people, Pete.

1310
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,357
The sound of a guitar

1311
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,109
- and a man's voice.
- Or a woman's.

1312
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,527
Alan, please. Let's calm down.

1313
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,653
Don't talk to me about
ticket sales, Harold.

1314
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,613
- I don't give a shit.
- Okay.

1315
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,659
Hey, Tom, give me a second,
I want to try something.

1316
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,289
All right.

1317
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,507
You're in trouble, man.

1318
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:12,719
Highway 61,
take seven.

1319
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,013
Man, you can't look at me
like that.

1320
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,389
'Cause then...

1321
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,141
All right, guys.

1322
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,768
Okay, wait.
Don't look at me like that,

1323
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,269
'cause I gotta
get through the take.

1324
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,772
If you got that thing on
your face, I'm gonna explode.

1325
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:25,899
All right,
let's just do it before

1326
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,443
this whole thing
crashes into the ground.

1327
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,405

1339
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:19,244
tonight, we'll continue
our Rainbow Quest together

1340
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:22,539
to seek out all the songs

1341

of ours.

1343
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:29,629
Now, if you tuned in tonight
hoping to hear our friend,
Bob Dylan,

1344
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,631
well, I don't wanna
disappoint you,

1345
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,175
but Bob's been hung up
in the studio in New York.

1346
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:35,427
He'll come another time.

1347
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:38,138
But tonight, we've got
a very special guest.

1348
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,432
A good friend of mine
from the deep

1349
01:23:40,473 --> 01:23:43,309
Mississippi Delta
named Jesse Moffette.

1350
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,478
And when he heard we had
a gap, he jumped in a cab,

1351
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,939
and he came right over
and he's live with us at NJU.

1352
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,358
-Thanks for being here.
-Well, thanks for having me.

1353

So good to be with ya.

1354
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:54,320
Well, you want to have
a drink with me?

1355
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:57,073
Oh, no, no. Not while
I'm working. No. Yeah.

1356
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,491
What kinda station

1357
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,993
This is educational, Jesse.

1358
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,245
This is a local public
educational channel, yeah.

1359

Educational?
Shit, I do educational!

1360
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:08,168
I offer blues lessons in
the privacy of your own home.

1361
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,670
-You wanna learn the blues?
-Sure.

1362
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:14,883

01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,791
- It's all right, man.
- No, come on out.

1387
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,334
Come on out. It's all right.

1388
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:36,047
I'm... I'm glad you came.
I'm glad you came, yeah.

1389
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,924
Jesse, say hi to a really
good friend of mine.

1390
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,843
This is Bobby Dylan.

1391
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:42,011
Bob. What kinda music
do you play?

1392
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,555
Well, I play all sorts.
I mean...

1393
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:44,722
What kinda music
do you say I play?

1394
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:45,890
Oh, Bob plays a lot of kinds

1395
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,392
and he plays all of them well.

1396
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:48,935
You trying to steal my spot?

1397
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,895
No, I'm not trying to
steal your spot, Jesse.

1398
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,605
I was really
I was trying to figure out

1399
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:53,857
what kinda tuning
you were using.

1400
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,191
I don't think
I ever heard it before.

1401
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,651
Nobody can, only me.

1402
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:59,279
Look here. How close
were you watching me?

1403
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,239
Well, I was, uh...

1404
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:05,118
Well, I was watching
real close, Jesse.

1405
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,537
I got these
special binoculars, right?

1406
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,205
And they allow me
to see into your soul.

1407
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:10,999
Really?

1408
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,125
I see exactly
what you were playing.

1409
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,168
It's like a tiny
little microscope, right?

1410
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:14,252
Oh, watch out.

1411
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,336
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1412
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:16,629
Do me a favor. Here.

1413
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,548
Take my guitar and show me
how close you really

1414
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,632
-was watching, my man.
-No, I can't.

1415
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:20,717
Couldn't do that, Jesse,

1416
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,177
that's like
touching your woman.

1417
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:23,761
It's okay. All right. Just
don't squeeze her too tight.

1418
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:26,723
-It's all right, Pete?
-Oh, yeah.

1419
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:28,183
It's a family station.
You can...

1420
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:30,185
As long as
I don't squeeze her too tight.

1421
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,396

01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,691
- All right.
- Uh...

1559
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,444
- Let's, uh, scratch the waltz thing.
-  -Yeah.

1560
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,695
Let's just go back
to what we were doing before.

1561
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:07,863
- Doin' it in four?
- Yeah.

1562
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:09,031
I think
it's gonna sound better.

1563
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,115
- Little slower?
- Yeah,

1564
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:11,242
and a little slower.

1565
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:12,743
You know,
not in that crazy pace.

1566
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:13,828
Yeah. Not too fast.

1567
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:15,329
Yeah. All right.

1568
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:18,874

1716
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:28,507
-Oh, my.
-Oh, God.

1717
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:30,092
She was headed
for the ferry.

1718
01:46:30,133 --> 01:46:32,010
You probably still got time to
catch her if you head out now.

1719

Christ, Bobby.

1720
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,554
Bobby, can I have a word?

1721
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:35,639
Can we just turn that
down, please? Maybe?

1722
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,349

He's not in on this?

Sorry, I gotta go.

1727
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:44,898
Bob, my friend...

1728
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,275
All we want to know
is what you're planning
on doing tomorrow, Bobby.

1729
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:49,277
If you're gonna play
the new songs, that's all.

1730
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:51,238
'Cause you want me
playing the old ones?

1731
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:54,199
All right, let's just cut
the crap, Bob. Come on.

1732
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:55,784
You're gonna be playing noise
like this?

1733
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:56,952
This is The Kinks.

1734
01:46:56,993 --> 01:46:58,078
I'm supposed to introduce you.

1735
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,204
And if you are,
just let me know.

1736
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,372
And we'll get Dick Clark
to introduce...

1737
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:01,998
Whoo-hoo! You hear that?

1738
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,792
You wanna get Dick Clark
to Newport Folk Festival?

1739
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:05,001
I don't know if you noticed,

1740
01:47:05,043 --> 01:47:06,044
but there's a lot of
fucking people here...

1741
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,421
How could I not?

1742
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:10,632
I'd rather have 10 faithful
than 10,000 groupies!

1743
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,551
It was the Newport
Folk Festival, then Bob,

1744
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:16,096
and it still is
the Newport Folk Festival.

1745
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:19,224
Not the teen dream,
uh, Brill Building,

1746
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,184
Top 40,
British Invasion Festival.

1747
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:22,602
A folk festival!

1748
01:47:22,644 --> 01:47:24,271
Do you even remember
folk music, Bob?

1749
01:47:24,312 --> 01:47:26,106
No, Alan, what's that?

1750
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:27,482
Maybe you could
sing me somethin'.

1751
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,238
♪ All day
and all of the night ♪

1752
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,459
Hey!

1753
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,586
Hey, Sylvie.

1754
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:50,922
Come here.

1755
01:47:57,095 --> 01:47:58,096
Come on.

1756
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,270
What are you doing?

1757
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:07,314
Where are you going?

1758
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:09,357
I'm going home.

1759
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:11,067
Why?

1760
01:48:12,527 --> 01:48:14,154
It was fun to be

1761
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:15,822
on the carnival train
with you, Bobby,

1762
01:48:18,074 --> 01:48:19,743
but I think I gotta step off.

1763
01:48:22,412 --> 01:48:26,750
I feel like one of those
plates, you know,

1764
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,585
that the French guy spins
on those sticks

1765
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:29,794
on The Sullivan Show.

1766
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,632
Oh, I kinda like that guy.

1767
01:48:36,259 --> 01:48:38,845
I'm sure it's fun
to be the guy, Bob,

1768
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:43,183
but I was a plate.

1769
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:11,628
Oh, Christ.

1770
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:18,134
Stay. Come on.

1771
01:49:20,595 --> 01:49:23,974
Don't ask for the moon,
we have the stars.

1772
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:35,652
Sylvie.

1773
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:40,865
Sylvie.

1774
01:50:14,065 --> 01:50:16,109
Rise, sunshine.

1775
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,235
Oh, Christ.

1776
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,945
Here you go. Morning.

1777
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:21,865
Thought we could have a chat,

1778
01:50:21,906 --> 01:50:23,408
so, I brought you
a cup of hot black

1779
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,493
and, uh,
one with milk for Sylvie.

1780
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:26,703
Hey.

1781
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:28,455
What the fuck?

1782
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:31,625
Morning, Albert.

1783
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:33,084
It's 7:00 in the morning.

1784
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:34,669
Fuck.

1785
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:35,962
Whatever this is, Pete,

1786
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:37,839
maybe you could wait
another few goddamn hours.

1787
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:42,552
Well, it is the last day
of our festival, Albert,

1788
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:44,554
and I think people would like
to know what's coming.

1789
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:47,932
So, I'm here to have
a conversation
with my old friend.

1790
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:49,768
Bobby,
did I ever tell you my, uh,

1791
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:52,354
my parable of
the teaspoon brigade?

1792
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:54,689
The parable of
the fucking what?

1793
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:56,941
It's the crack of
fucking dawn here!

1794
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,485
It's a good story.

1795
01:50:58,526 --> 01:51:00,111
Okay.

1796
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:02,197
Bob needs his rest, all right?

1797
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:03,740
We all need our rest.

1798
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:06,201
It's all right.
Let him tell his story, Al.

1799
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:09,621
Come on,
give it to me good, Pete.

1800
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:12,290
All right. Imagine,
we got a seesaw.

1801
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:14,167
- Seesaw?
- Yeah.

1802
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:16,086
Okay.

1803
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,713
One end of it, it's anchored
firm to the ground

1804
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,591
'cause it's got
a basket full of rocks on it.

1805
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,802
The other end,
it's floating up here,

1806
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:26,596
way up in the air
and wishin' it could come down

1807
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:28,848
but all it's got is a basket
that's half full of sand

1808
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,850
and the sand is leaking out
all the time.

1809
01:51:30,892 --> 01:51:32,060
Okay, now...

1810
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,311
Could you get me a cigarette,
man?

1811
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:34,771
We see this situation.

1812
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:37,190
We say, well, maybe we should
do something about this.

1813
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:39,776
And all we got with us
is some teaspoons

1814
01:51:39,818 --> 01:51:41,027
but we take 'em out
and we start

1815
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:42,654
putting sand up
into that basket

1816
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:45,657
and it's running out
as fast as we can put it in.

1817
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,367
There's all kinds of people.

1818
01:51:47,409 --> 01:51:49,577
They're looking at us
and they're laughin'

1819
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:52,247
and they're sayin', "Geez,
you're wastin' your time."

1820
01:51:52,288 --> 01:51:55,500
But every day a few
new people show up

1821
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,169
and they bring their spoons,
and they start pitchin' in.

1822
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:00,171
-You know why?
-Why?

1823
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,840
Because
one of these days,

1824
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:03,174
enough people
are gonna put sand

1825
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:04,884
in that basket
at the same time

1826
01:52:04,926 --> 01:52:07,303
that the whole damn thing
just goes, zoop.

1827
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,098
And we level things out.

1828
01:52:11,349 --> 01:52:14,602
Okay. Thanks, Pete.
We get the story.

1829
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:15,937
I don't think you do, Albert.

1830
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:18,231
Bobby, Newport, we built it

1831
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:22,777
for the purpose of sharing
traditional folk music.

1832
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:24,946
We started it six years ago,

1833
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:27,031
and every year since then,

1834
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:29,117
more and more people
have been showing up,

1835
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,702
and they're bringing
their teaspoons.

1836
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,621
Teaspoons for justice,

1837
01:52:33,663 --> 01:52:36,458
and teaspoons for peace
and teaspoons for love,

1838
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:39,377
and that's what we do and...

1839
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,757
Gosh, you showed up, Bobby,

1840
01:52:43,798 --> 01:52:45,633
and damn it,
if you didn't bring a shovel.

1841
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:48,803
Really.

1842
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,847
I mean,
we're all here just laboring
with our little teaspoons

1843
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:53,141
and you come
and bring a shovel.

1844
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:57,270
And thanks to you,
we're almost there.

1845
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:59,939
We're on the verge
of tipping it, Bob,

1846
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:03,568
and you're our closing act.

1847
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:07,697
And tonight, if you could
just get up there
one more time

1848
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:09,783
and use that shovel
in the right way...

1849
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,743
The right way?

1850
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:14,287
You could
level things out, Bob.

1851
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:21,169
You know, I sent you an
advance of my new record.

1852
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:24,088
Sure. Yeah, I got it.

1853
01:53:27,133 --> 01:53:30,011
Did you ever listen
to the music
you're telling me not to play?

1854
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:33,389
I can see the direction
you're goin' in.

1855
01:53:33,431 --> 01:53:35,517
I could see it
on the last record.

1856
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:43,983
You know, it... it's not...

1857
01:53:44,025 --> 01:53:46,820
No, don't take it that way.

1858
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:50,657
Bobby, you write great songs
that are leadin' to change

1859
01:53:50,698 --> 01:53:52,200
-and we're a folk festival.
-Nothing's changin', Pete.

1860
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:53,618
- Why is this controversial?
- Nothing's changing.

1861
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,203
Nothing's changing.
What, not at all.

1862
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:57,288
Kennedy's dead.
They just shot Malcolm X.

1863
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:59,040
Well, isn't that
all the more reason.

1864
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:01,459
You know,
there's more to sing about
than justice, Pete.

1865
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:03,419
There's more than
one way to play a song.

1866
01:54:03,461 --> 01:54:04,879
You ever just take a second
and think that maybe

1867
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:07,215
it's more fun to be in
a fucking band, man?

1868
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:09,759
You don't understand, Bobby,
they just want me singing
Blowin' in the Wind all alone

1869
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:11,302
for the rest of
my goddamn life.

1870
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,929
All we're talkin' about
is tonight.

1871
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:14,138
He's scared of your music,
Bob.

1872
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,890
Nobody's scared of
anybody's music.

1873
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:16,975
You are.
You're scared that the kids

1874
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:18,309
out on that lawn
might like it.

1875
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:19,894
And why would
I be afraid of that?

1876
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,855
Because you're pushing candles
and he's selling light bulbs.

1877
01:54:21,896 --> 01:54:23,022
Albert, there's only one of us

1878
01:54:23,064 --> 01:54:24,190
who's focused on
how much we're selling

1879
01:54:24,232 --> 01:54:25,400
and it ain't me.

1880
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:27,443
Hey, Bobby, Bobby...

1881
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:36,035
Oh, Christ, man. Shit.

1882
01:54:41,624 --> 01:54:43,918
Am I blocking you in, pal?

1883
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:45,879
Hey, JR.

1884
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,047
Johnny, it's me. It's Bobby.

1885
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:49,632
Hey! Shit, Bobby.

1886
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:50,675
Yeah!

1887
01:54:52,635 --> 01:54:53,970
Thought you left town already.

1888
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:57,932
Well,
we loaded out last night.

1889
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:00,810
June left for New York
with her mama.

1890
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,899
Pete asked me to stay for
the finale today, you know,

1891
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,483
and I couldn't sleep.

1892
01:55:08,192 --> 01:55:09,861
Just took a drive.

1893
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,363
Saw the ocean.

1894
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:14,949
Okay.

1895
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:16,534
-This yours?
-Yeah.

1896
01:55:17,452 --> 01:55:18,995
Hey, man, you got a cigarette?

1897
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:20,079
Yeah.

1898
01:55:21,122 --> 01:55:22,123
