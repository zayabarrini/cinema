1
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,135
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand with the canopy.

2
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,910
- Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
- Mary?

3
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,037
Yes, Mr. Burkett.

4
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,793
Everything's ready, milady.

5
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,815
- I think she's knocking.
- Well, see what she wants.

6
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,528
I can't open this wretched thing.

7
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,907
I suppose we'd better stop.

8
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,095
I can't get this top off.

9
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,494
Hello. Is everything alright?

10
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,162
Are you OK?

11
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,540
- Am I what?
- We're alright, thank you.

12
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,502
Is that Lady Trentham?
Lady Trentham.

13
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,297
It's, uh...
I'm William McCordle's cousin, Ivor.

14
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,760
- Ivor Novello.
- Yes, of course.

15
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,179
May I introduce
a friend of mine from California?

16
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,848
- Mr. Morris Weissman.
- Hello.

17
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,141
Hi.

18
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,021
Uh, we were just wondering
if we were headed in the same direction.

19
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,107
I daresay we might be.

20
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,696
Well, if... if everything seems
to be alright...

21
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,368
Bye.

22
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,248
Could we get on
before I freeze to death?

23
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,794
- Was that really Ivor Novello?
- Yes. Could we get on?

24
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,508
Oh, hello. Nice house. I like it.

25
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,767
- Oh, hello, Ivor.
- Welcome back, Your Ladyship.

26
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,769
Constance, welcome.

27
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,565
Hello, dear.
If he has to call me by my Christian name,

28
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,442
why can't he make it "Aunt Constance"?

29
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,736
I'm not the upstairs maid.

30
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,821
He's still got that vile little dog, I see.

31
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,574
Yes, the ones we hate last forever.
Did you have a horrid journey?

32
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,493
Yes, fairly horrid.

33
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,164
Take the car around the back
to unload it.

34
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,671
You better follow it.
Mrs. Wilson will look after you.

35
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,009
Your Ladyship.

36
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,638
- Your Lordship.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,353
- Louisa.
- William.

38
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,314
Raymond. Lots of good shooting coming.

39
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,274
That's what we're here for.

40
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,404
Just leave everything in one pile
around the corner there.

41
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,823
Make sure it's properly labeled.
It'll go up in the luggage lift.

42
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,158
These are the guns.
Where's the gun room?

43
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,327
Down there on the right.
Find Mr. Strutt, the keeper.

44
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,246
- He'll show you what to do.
- I know what to do.

45
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,832
Ellen, what do you
think you're doing over there?

46
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,835
Take that rain off those cases
before you take them up.

47
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,088
These are Mr. Novello's bags.
Can't you see?

48
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,382
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Weissman's man.

49
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,592
- The Countess of Trentham.
- Yes.

50
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,845
Make sure they're properly labeled.
Put them down there.

51
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,931
- Where am I?
- In the stable block with the grooms.

52
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,268
Her Ladyship is in the Chinese room.
Elsie! Elsie!

53
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,438
You'll be with the head housemaid.
She'll show you where everything is.

54
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,231
Elsie, this is Miss Trentham.

55
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,775
- Mrs. Wilson... Excuse me, ma'am...
- Take care of her, will you?

56
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,028
My name's Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

57
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,197
Not Mary, it's not. It's Trentham.

58
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,700
Lord Stockbridge, guns.

59
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,203
- Down there on the right.
- The name's Parks. Robert Parks.

60
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,205
Mr. Parks?

61
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,543
Erm, Mr. Parks, below stairs
you'll be known as Mr. Stockbridge.

62
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,464
I knew a Mr. Parks
who was in service in Norwich.

63
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,340
- Is he any relation of yours?
- No.

64
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,176
London born and bred.

65
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,219
What should I do
with Her Ladyship's jewels?

66
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,889
It's this way.
George is in charge of the safe.

67
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,850
He's the first footman, and you wanna
watch where he puts his hands.

68
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,649
She's new?

69
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,534
Have you got the ones for tonight?

70
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,286
Oh, sorry.

71
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,210
Always bring a separate box
for the first night. It saves bother.

72
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,315
Freddie, do wait.

73
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,526
For goodness sake, Mabel.
what is it this time?

74
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,945
- Does my hair look alright?
- It looks fine.

75
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,404
Where the hell were you?

76
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,992
We're not late.
Freddie, do please stop going on.

77
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,495
Isobel?

78
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,413
- Hello.
- Hello, Isobel.

79
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,831
Darling, I'll see you in there.

80
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,626
There's just been something
I've been meaning to say to you.

81
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,049
Have you, uh...
Have you spoken to your father?

82
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,217
No.

83
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,762
What do you mean, no?
Hey, you promised.

84
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,181
I never promised.
I said I'd do my best.

85
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,351
- You're so beautiful when you resist me.
- Stop it.

86
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,186
I'll ask him tonight.

87
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,814
Well, you bloody well better.

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,109
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

89
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,362
- Don't worry. He's nobody.
- Sorry, Miss Isobel.

90
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,657
Do you think you'll have a chance
to speak to him tonight?

91
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,326
- Would you stop going on about it?
- Izzy, that's all very well...

92
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,954
Well, I think it's ridiculous.
I'm here to shoot.

93
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,417
Darling, it's a relief to me to sit next
to someone who isn't deaf in one ear.

94
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,876
I'm sorry?

95
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,968
Darling, what do you mean,
"leave it"?

96
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:57,681
Well, I just meant let it come naturally.
Don't try and steer the conversation.

97
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,685
- It makes you sound so desperate.
- Well, I am fucking desperate.

98
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,732
Hello, Raymond. This is
my brother-in-law, Lord Stockbridge.

99
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,525
Hello.
I'm Morris Weissman.

100
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,445
- Who?
- Morris Weissman.

101
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,989
- Weissman, yes.
- Hello.

102
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,701
Oh, Elsie? Elsie,
this is Lord Stockbridge's valet.

103
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,120
He's new to the house,
so show him around, will you?

104
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,539
You'll be sharing with
Mr. Weissman's man.

105
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,125
- Has His Lordship's luggage gone up?
- Supposedly.

106
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,669
He's in the Tapestry room,
wherever that is.

107
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,631
Oh, well, here we go again.

108
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:34,384
That's just it. I've never
done a house party before, not properly.

109
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,553
How come you got
taken on as a countess lady's maid...

110
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,305
if you've got no experience?

111
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,974
She wants to train me.
She said she didn't care about experience.

112
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,726
She didn't want to pay for it, you mean.

113
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,855
It's cold in here.

114
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,233
You should know to pack your woolies
when you come to this house.

115
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,985
Here we are.

116
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,572
- Is everything alright, Elsie?
- Fine, Miss Lewis. Thanks.

117
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,074
That's your bed there.

118
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,203
- That's good? Yeah, that's tasty.
- Very tasty.

119
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,705
I think I'll...
I shall go in the library.

120
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,926
Here you are, Pip-Pip.

121
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,763
I beg your pardon, sir. I thought
I'd just take the Times up with me

122
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,765
in case you'd like to read it
when you're dressing.

123
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,101
Thank you, Probert.
Look after Pip for me, will you?

124
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,811
- Of course, sir.
- Good boy.

125
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,563
I have to make a telephone call
to California in a couple of hours.

126
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,607
- I can't find a telephone.
- There's one here on the left.

127
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:34,027
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
Of course, I'll reverse the charges.

128
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,697
- Yes.
- There's a new restaurant in the Strand.

129
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,448
It's an automatic restaurant.

130
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,119
It's open 24 hours a day.
You can go in any time day or night.

131
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,663
So, who's the funny little American?

132
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,290
- Morris Weissman. He's a friend of Ivor.
- Oh.

133
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,334
He makes films in Hollywood.

134
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,129
Ivor asked if he could bring him along.
I didn't see why not.

135
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,965
I thought he might be interested
in guns and shooting.

136
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,009
Oh, well, never mind.
He adds to the glamor of the gathering.

137
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,220
I didn't expect anything half as exotic.

138
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,265
Oh, no, not for me. You know
that I hate drinking whisky.

139
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,225
Go on, drink it. Do you good.

140
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,269
Go on.

141
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,857
Oh, really, Bill?
You are such a bad influence.

142
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,694
Well, don't blame me
if I start misbehaving.

143
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:19,448
I don't know how impressed
your husband is with our Hollywood folk.

144
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:24,077
Oh, you know Raymond.
He only feels safe with his own kind.

145
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,620
Bill!

146
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,335
I thought ladies' maids
never wore aprons.

147
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,797
Her Ladyship used to have a French maid
who wore a black one like this.

148
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,467
- She thinks it's got a bit of style.
- I bet she does.

149
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,635
And I bet she took it
out of your wages, too.

150
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,098
- She likes to have everything just so.
- Mmm, don't they all?

151
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,977
- That's him.
- Who?

152
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,979
Ivor Novello.

153
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,524
He passed us on the road today
on his way here, and he spoke to me.

154
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,403
Well, he spoke to Her Ladyship,
but I answered.

155
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,448
I only cut it out for Garbo.
I prefer the American stars.

156
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,868
- I think they've got more oomph.
- Go on!

157
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,872
- Is he really Sir William's cousin?
- Yep.

158
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,458
Imagine having a film star in the family.

159
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,503
- Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.
- Oh, I don't think.

160
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,546
Why wouldn't she be?

161
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,924
'Cause she's a snobbish cow.
'Cause she...

162
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,676
She looks down on anyone who got
to the top with brains and hard work.

163
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,929
Just like she looks down
on her husband.

164
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,349
Except when it's time to foot the bills,
and then she's got her hand out, alright.

165
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,393
- What was her family, then?
- What'd you expect, really?

166
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,481
Toffee-nosed and useless.
Her father was the Earl of Carton.

167
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,817
Sounds good, except
he didn't have a pot to piss in.

168
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:43,114
- What's she like to work for?
- She's horrible. But he's...

169
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,492
He's OK.
Come on, we better get cracking.

170
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,373
- Hello, I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

171
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,292
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

172
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,379
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

173
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,634
- Oh! I don't smoke. Thank you.
- No?

174
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,970
Mrs. Nesbitt's only got one dress.

175
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,430
Says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

176
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,891
Do you always look after visitors
if they haven't got a maid?

177
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,893
Sometimes Dorothy helps,
though why Mrs. Wilson

178
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,354
makes the still room maid do it
beats me.

179
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

180
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,568
- Which one does Dorothy answer to?
- Both. That's the problem.

181
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,320
She's rushed off her feet as it is.
Are you nearly done there?

182
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,531
- Yes.
- Here she is... Miss Bossy.

183
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,325
Tell me, what was Greta Garbo
really like?

184
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,954
- Did you get to know her?
- Yes, I did, actually.

185
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,790
She's coming to stay with me next month.

186
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,505
Tell me, how much longer are you
going to go on... making films?

187
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,507
I suppose that rather depends on

188
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,634
how much longer the public
want to see me in them.

189
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,639
Yes, it must be hard to know
when it's time to throw in the towel.

190
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:56,521
What a pity about that last one of yours.
What was it called?

191
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,858
- "The Dodger."
- "The Lodger."

192
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,277
"The Lodger."

193
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,071
And it must be so disappointing

194
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,283
when something just, you know,
flops like that.

195
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,787
Yes, it is... rather disappointing.

196
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,665
Look at this. Machine-made lace.

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,127
- Hark at her.
- Well, I hate cheap clothes.

198
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,463
They're twice the work,
and they never look as good.

199
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,301
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look at that. All over his waistcoat.

200
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,262
What do you expect from a woman
without her own maid?

201
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,558
Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels
with no maid has lost her self-respect.

202
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:37,479
- She calls it "giving in."
- I don't have a maid. I haven't given in.

203
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,023
- That's different.
- Why?

204
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:43,526
- What's your name?
- I think here I'm called Trentham.

205
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,904
No, I meant your real name.

206
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,658
Oh. Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

207
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,453
Blimey! What does Her Ladyship call you?

208
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,957
Well, she should call me Maceachran,
now I'm a lady's maid.

209
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,458
That's what my mother says.

210
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,628
But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,
so she calls me Mary.

211
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,130
I don't blame her.

212
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,467
Sylvia...

213
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,973
I'm serious.
There mustn't be anymore nonsense.

214
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,940
- Done much shooting this year?
- Quite a lot.

216
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,027
- Hello.
- Does Louisa always go out with you?

217
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,030
- Usually.
- It's very good of her.

218
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,950
- Do you have a minute?
- Don't do that! That's bad for him!

219
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,410
Put him down.

220
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,205
Yeah. Bores me stiff.

221
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,834
- Alright, Pip.
- William's such a rotten shot.

222
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,420
I usually try and duck out of it,
particularly in Scotland.

223
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,797
I'm rather fond of Scotland.

224
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,509
Alright, get on with your work.
Yes?

225
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,762
- Ah, Mr. Weissman. There you are.
- I'm dealing with this.

226
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,058
- What is it, Mr. Weissman?
- Well, to start with, my name is Denton.

227
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,061
- Henry Denton.
- You're here as valet to Mr. Weissman.

228
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,355
That means you'll be known
as Mr. Weissman below stairs

229
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,190
for the duration of your stay.

230
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,277
We stick to the old customs here.
It saves confusion.

231
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,321
- It's about Mr. Weissman's diet.
- Yes?

232
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,908
He's a vegetarian.

233
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,453
- A what?
- A vegetarian.

234
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,373
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,378
Well, I never!
Doesn't eat meat?

236
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,423
He's coming for a shooting party,
and he doesn't eat meat.

237
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,884
Mr. Weissman doesn't intend to shoot.

238
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,345
I think he just wants to walk out
with them, get a bit of air.

239
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,514
Get a bit of air?

240
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,892
Yes, thank you.
We'll make the necessary arrangements.

241
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,853
Now I suggest you get one
of the servants to take you upstairs.

242
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,563
Mr. Weissman is in the Green bedroom,

243
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,274
and you'll be sharing
with Lord Stockbridge's valet...

244
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,401
Robert Parks.

245
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,661
He's very full of himself, I must say.
"Doesn't eat meat."

246
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:02,123
Now, now, Mrs. Croft, we don't want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?

247
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,502
Mr. Weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.

248
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,923
Good boy.
Now, Give Louisa a kiss from me.

249
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,509
Darling, I'm sorry about that.

250
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,427
I should have said
that Morris just doesn't shoot.

251
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,972
Don't worry. William's just making
a fuss. He has this ridiculous idea

252
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,266
that Americans all sleep
with guns under their pillows.

253
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,728
They do, but they're more
for each other than for killing birds.

254
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,981
Remind me. How are you related
to William exactly?

255
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,400
Our mothers were first cousins.

256
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,695
Don't believe
I ever met William's mother.

257
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,490
Didn't she do something rather original?

258
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,660
Well, she was a teacher.

259
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,703
And so was mine.

260
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,666
- That's marvelous, isn't it?
- Sylvia is so clever.

261
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,877
She always finds
such wonderful servants.

262
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,923
I don't know how she manages.
I'm breaking in a new maid.

263
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,175
I'm simply worn out with it.

264
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,137
Actually, there's nothing
more exhausting, is there?

265
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:01,224
- I don't have a lady's maid.
- Oh... Oh, hello.

266
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,977
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid.

267
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,689
Honestly, the amount I have to do
for her, she should be paying me.

268
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,691
She does seem rather young.

269
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,528
Well, of course, what she is, my dear,
is wonderfully cheap.

270
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,699
Mabel, where are you going?
The room's this way.

271
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,410
Why the hell did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?

272
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,413
Why would you mention you didn't
have a maid, for God's sake?

273
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,094
You'd find it a lot easier to clean them
if you put the trees in first.

274
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,889
I was just about to do that.

275
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,185
- Are these Mr. Novello's shoes?
- Yes.

276
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,113
- Do you really live in Hollywood?
- I do.

277
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,241
Hmm. How did you get there?
Where did you start from?

278
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,952
Where else do you think?
Scotland.

279
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,705
Were you always in service?

280
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,083
Did you ever think of trying to get
into films while you were there?

281
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,170
I wanted to be an actor once...
when I was little.

282
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:19,802
I suppose old Mother Trentham will have
her begging bowl out while she's here.

283
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,263
She won't be bothering
your employers, that's certain.

284
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,598
Why not?

285
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,392
Because Lady Lavinia Meredith hasn't
got a penny to bless herself with.

286
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,144
And whose fault is that?

287
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,398
There's nothing wrong with the commander.
He's just been a bit unfortunate.

288
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,151
I'll say. I think he's pathetic.

289
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,320
Then why don't you hand in your notice?

290
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,365
Well, the other two sisters
fell on their feet.

291
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,033
It helps that they're both good-looking.

292
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,953
- Lady Sylvia's lovely.
- You think so?

293
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,497
She might have done a bit
better for herself, really.

294
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,083
I beg your pardon?
Lord Carton wanted to have Sir William

295
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,002
for either of the two eldest.
I was told he could have had his pick.

296
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,047
- Why was Lord Carton so keen?
- Why do you think?

297
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,675
Who do you suppose pays for him
to swan around Biarritz

298
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,260
for six months of the year?

299
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,930
Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

300
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,640
Old money bags, that's who.

301
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,101
I think it's disgusting
the way they all use him.

302
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,312
None of them has got the brains
to make the price of a packet of tea.

303
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,357
- Are you finished, Elsie?
- Yes, Mrs. Wilson.

304
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,277
- I've just got this hem to do.
- What's Lord Stockbridge like?

305
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,780
He thinks he's God Almighty.
They all do.

306
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,426
Why does this fork go on the right?

307
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,345
Because they eat the fish
with two of them.

308
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,473
- One in each hand.
- Why is that, then?

309
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,436
- Search me.
- What are you doing here?

310
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,773
- Just looking around.
- Mr. Jennings will be up in a minute.

311
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,151
If I were you,
I'd go and look around somewhere else.

312
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,654
- Is that what you'd do?
- That's exactly what I would do.

313
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,282
Then that's what I'll do.

314
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,579
- Something funny about that bloke.
- His accent for a start.

315
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,873
- What do you think his game is?
- I don't know.

316
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:16,419
Are you finished? What about
Lord Rupert Standish and Mr. Blond?

317
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,880
Her Ladyship said not to lay for them.

318
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,843
Stuff's all ready if they turn up on time.
We can stick on two extra places in a jiffy.

319
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,847
When they arrive,
you'll be dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.

320
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,099
- Mr. Blond?
- Yes, Mr. Blond.

321
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,934
George, you'll have Lord Rupert.

322
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,188
If they're very late,
they can change by themselves,

323
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,106
and you can tidy up
when they're downstairs.

324
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,777
- Is Mr. Nesbitt settled?
- I'll go and finish him off now, sir.

325
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:45,823
- And, um... Mr. Novello?
- Mr. Weissman's man will attend to him.

326
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,786
Right! After you're finished,

327
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,205
join me in the drawing room
with the drinks.

328
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,461
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

329
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,548
Only I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello, that's all.

330
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,717
Now you won't get to see him
in his under drawers.

331
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,387
Never mind. Better luck next time.

332
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,519
They're rather a mixed bunch.

333
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,981
That Mr. Weissman's very odd.
Apparently, he produces motion pictures.

334
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,819
The Charlie Chan mysteries.
Or does he direct them?

335
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,071
I never know the difference.

336
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:29,242
- Really? I enjoy those, milady.
- Ye... Mary.

337
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,412
I suppose it's fun
having a film star staying.

338
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:37,166
There's always so little to talk about
after the first flush of recognition.

339
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,088
And why has Freddie Nesbitt brought
that awful, common little wife of his?

340
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,383
I mean, Isobel only asked him
because a gun dropped out.

341
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,969
That's no excuse to inflict her on us all.

342
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,721
Mary!

343
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,141
So, what's the gossip
in the servants' hall?

344
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,436
- Hmm?
- Um... nothing, milady.

345
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,647
Nonsense. Come on, out with it.

346
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:05,445
Well, is it true that Sir William
could have married Lady Stockbridge,

347
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,113
if he'd wanted to?

348
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,199
Is that what they're saying?

349
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,203
Only that Lord Carton was
after Sir William for one of them,

350
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,164
but he didn't care which.

351
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,082
What would you say if I told you...

352
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,086
...they cut cards for him?

353
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,506
William, Lewis said you wanted me.

354
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,633
- Who's next to me at dinner?
- Oh, you know.

355
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,010
Aunt Constance and Lavinia.

356
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,971
Why do I have to have
that bloody old trout all the time?

357
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,222
I want Louisa.

358
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,683
Do I have to explain
the table of precedence again?

359
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,477
I don't give a shit about precedence!

360
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,562
You always complain
that people look down on you,

361
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,147
and then you behave like a peasant.

362
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:45,151
Now, tomorrow morning,
I'll... I'll breakfast in bed,

363
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,155
and then get straight up into the tweeds.

364
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,242
- What shirt have you brought?
- Um, the green with the pink stripe.

365
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,162
Oh, no, dear. No, that's quite wrong.

366
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,789
No, always something
very plain for country sports.

367
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,791
The one I had on today will do.

368
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,670
- But it's soiled.
- Yeah, well, you can wash it, can't you?

369
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,801
God, I hate shooting.

370
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,388
Why does one have to do these things?

371
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,016
Has Constance asked
for money, yet?

372
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,184
No.

373
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,188
Raymond tells me she's been complaining
that her allowance isn't big enough.

374
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,398
Good mind to stop it completely.

375
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,945
- I thought it was for her lifetime.
- No, no.

376
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,325
- Will that be all, sir?
- Mmm.

377
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,452
I do wish that Anthony
wasn't here.

378
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,454
Make sure I'm not left
alone with him.

379
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,332
- Why?
- I'm pulling out of his scheme.

380
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,753
- Oh. Have you told him?
- No, and I'm not going to, either.

381
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,673
Louisa said I should leave it
till next week.

382
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,050
Let him sob in private.

383
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:56,222
- Go, say hello to your mommy. Go on.
- Far be it from me to contradict Louisa.

384
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,810
- Anything else, sir?
- Just get Pip.

385
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,520
- He might fall down the stairs.
- Where is he gone?

386
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,106
Hey, hey, come here!
Come here.

387
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,067
Thank you, Elsie.
You keep hold of him.

388
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,486
- Is everything alright?
- Cheap dress, wrong shoes.

389
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,072
I'm making bricks without straw,
Mr. Probert, really.

390
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,533
You don't have any spare hairpins,
do you?

391
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:20,162
Yeah. I'm trying to get back to the room
for a second, and I can't find it.

392
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,998
It's the staircase
at the end of the corridor.

393
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,292
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah!

394
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,003
Oh, Pip.
Oh, thank you, Elsie.

395
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,589
Thank you. Oh!
You've got some hair on your dress.

396
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,008
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes.

397
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,603
Shut up, Mabel! There is
nothing going on between me and Isobel.

398
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,188
Can't you just tell me the truth?
You're a liar, Freddie.

399
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,024
- There is nothing...
- You are a liar!

400
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,401
Don't you call me a liar!

401
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,034
I found some pins, madam,
from Lady Trentham's maid.

402
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,327
Right.

403
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,915
- We're supposed to be downstairs already.
- Well, you go on.

404
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,126
I'll be down in a minute.

405
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,635
Try and make her look respectable.

406
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:22,850
Oh, thank you.

407
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,524
Well, there's no harm in trying.

408
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,369
Well, thank you very much,
Mr. Jennings.

409
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,871
- Just Jennings, sir.
- Alright.

410
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,956
Just Jennings.

411
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,460
Oh, by the way, I've booked
a telephone call to California,

412
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,338
and I'd appreciate it if you would get me
as soon as it comes through.

413
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,132
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, Jennings.

414
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,227
You're not gonna provide
entertainment?

415
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,606
That's how you got your invitation.

416
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,778
Oh, no, don't get up. Please, go on.

417
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,863
You look lovely in that dress,
if I may say so.

418
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,240
Thank you.

419
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,450
What is it? I don't recognize it.

420
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,245
A little something I'm working on.

421
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,416
I can't imagine how one ever
goes about inventing a tune.

422
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,378
- Where do you start?
- It's rather difficult to say.

423
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,424
Well, I think you're too clever for words.

424
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,342
- Good evening.
- Hello.

425
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,803
- Lovely dress.
- Thank you.

426
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,267
Hi.

427
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,061
How do you manage
to put up with these people?

428
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,983
Well, you forget I earn my living
by impersonating them.

429
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,366
Can I help you?

430
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,496
You know, I really enjoy the way
you do things, Mr. Jennings.

431
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,665
I beg your pardon?

432
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,877
- What is it, Henry?
- Nothing.

433
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,381
I just wanted to be sure
you had everything you need, sir.

434
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,134
Yes, I do. Thank you.

435
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,182
It's wonderful to find a servant
who really shows an interest.

436
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,184
- Don't you think?
- Sir.

437
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:42,448
Come on, girls. Sit down.
Tuck in, we've got 20 minutes.

438
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,334
Shuffle along. Here he comes.

439
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,797
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?
- Yes, thank you, Dorothy.

440
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,090
They have their drinks.
I think we can all take

441
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,092
our leisure for half an hour or so.

442
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,969
What's this?

443
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,805
I believe this is my place,
Mr. Jennings.

444
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,892
Oh... and since when did a baroness
outrank a countess?

445
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,188
Miss Trentham, would you
take the place of honor, please?

446
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,649
Miss Trentham?

447
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,276
I'm alright here,
Mr. Jennings. Thank you.

448
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,445
Go on. Don't keep him waiting.

449
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,035
Ah, Miss Meredith.
Would you come and sit on my left?

450
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,746
Naturally, I'm nothing when
there are visitors in the house.

451
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,541
- Never mind, I'm used to it.
- Good evening, Mrs. Wilson.

452
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,083
Good evening.

453
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,549
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

454
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,553
Right! Start when you get it.
No time for loitering.

455
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,517
I'm not serving tonight,
Mr. Jennings, am I?

456
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,353
Not tonight, Elsie,
but probably tomorrow.

457
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,650
- Where is Mrs. Croft?
- Always eats with her own staff.

458
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,945
Does she take her pudding
to Mrs. Wilson's room? Our cook does that.

459
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,822
Fat chance. They hate each other.

460
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,368
- Can I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Weissman.

461
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,704
And how can we help you?

462
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:16,041
I just wondered, how many people here
had parents in service?

463
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,252
And was that why
they chose to go into it?

464
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,713
What an interesting question,

465
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:24,133
and one, um, to which, I'm afraid,
I cannot provide the answer.

466
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:28,721
All of you whose parents
were in service, raise your hand.

467
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,348
- My father was.
- Both... nanny and groom.

468
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,476
- Not you, Dorothy?
- My father was a farmer, Mr. Jennings.

469
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,562
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

470
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,982
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

471
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,484
And if you ask me, they were better off.

472
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,862
What about you, Mr. Stockbridge?

473
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,991
What's the matter?
Don't you know?

474
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,659
Yeah, I know what they did.

475
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,954
But it didn't have any effect on me
or my choice of work.

476
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:58,000
- And why's that?
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

477
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,341
Thank you, Mr. Weissman,

478
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,302
for giving us all a little something
to think about.

479
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,777
Oh, Her Ladyship.

480
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,697
Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

481
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,824
Please, do sit down
and finish your supper.

482
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,536
Mrs. Wilson, a major crisis has arisen.
I have just found out

483
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,289
that Mr. Weissman won't eat meat,
and I don't know what to do.

484
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,416
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I simply don't dare.

485
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,502
Everything's under control,
Your Ladyship.

486
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,754
Mr. Weissman's valet informed us
as soon as he arrived,

487
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,923
so we've prepared
a special version of the soup.

488
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,092
He can eat the fish
and the hors d'oeuvres,

489
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,678
and we'll have a Welsh rarebit
for the game course.

490
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,263
I don't know about the entree,
but we'll think of something.

491
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,516
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
Ten steps ahead as usual.

492
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,061
Which one of you
is Mr. Weissman's valet?

493
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,522
I am, Your Ladyship.

494
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,567
Are you, indeed? Yes, heavens.

495
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:11,031
Um, thank you for your... efficiency.

496
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,081
- You're all set, then.
- Yes, George?

497
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,499
Nothing, sir.

498
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,044
I should hope not.
I'm very hungry.

499
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,436
I was, uh, wondering, William,

500
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,105
if I could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

501
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,274
I can't leave my guests, can I?

502
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,694
You'll make that dog sick.

503
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,696
Isobel, did you know
that William and I

504
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,823
are going into business together
in the Sudan?

505
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,701
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's quite exciting. Erm...

506
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,327
What's happened is, apparently,

507
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,289
there are hundreds and hundreds
of Sudanese native soldiers,

508
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,833
entire regiments
wandering around the desert,

509
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,627
willy-nilly,
without anything on their feet,

510
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,297
which causes some hardship,
I imagine.

511
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,841
No, I grew up in Leicester.

512
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,386
- My father had a glove factory.
- Really?

513
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,889
One thing I do know is
how a glove should fit.

514
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,018
Really, darling. You're boring
poor Mr. Novello to death.

515
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,021
No!

516
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,315
I think he will explain
everything to me,

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,108
and kind of show me how it all works.

518
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,111
There's gonna be a pheasant hunt
in my picture.

519
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,574
There's a large market in modernizing
the armies in the Sudan,

520
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,534
and providing them with boots.

521
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,038
And then the old bag
just served it to all the servants.

522
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,456
I couldn't believe it.

523
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:47,252
- Aren't you cold?
- It's better than that kitchen.

524
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,133
Here. I thought you could do with this.

525
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,927
Oh, that's kind, love.

526
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,977
- Elsie, hello.
- Good evening, Your Lordship.

527
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,438
We've got bags and guns
and everything and no man.

528
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,065
Will you sort it out for me?

529
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,942
- Of course, Your Lordship.
- Thank you.

530
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,486
- We'll get your bags, sir.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

531
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,071
Good evening.

532
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,324
Right. In the boot, is it?

533
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,579
Sorry, can I trouble you
for a light, please?

534
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,165
- You got that bag?
- Yeah.

535
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,006
Thank you.
Good evening.

536
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,678
You think he's losing
interest in that thing?

537
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,930
Well, not just that.
The whole Empire.

538
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,932
I think he said
the steam's gone out of it.

539
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,310
William?

540
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,147
That's not true, is it,
that you think the Empire's finished?

541
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,731
I w-w-what?

542
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,151
Well, the Empire was finished
after the war.

543
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,611
Well, because of the war.
It changed everything.

544
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,655
Empire Leicester Square?

545
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,824
Well, I don't care
what's changed or not changed.

546
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,577
As long as our sons are spared
what you all went through.

547
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,913
Oh, not all.
You didn't fight, did you, William?

548
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,915
I did my bit.

549
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,752
Well, you made a lot of money,
but it's not quite the same thing

550
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:13,505
as charging into the cannon's mouth,
now, is it?

551
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,218
Thank God for Raymond. At least the family
had one representative in the front line.

552
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:22,389
Raymond, tell them how many times
you were mentioned in dispatches.

553
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,516
- I forget.
- No, you don't. Come on.

554
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,854
- Is he being modest?
- Yes, he's being very modest.

555
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,481
What do you think you're doing here?

556
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,359
Mrs. Wilson asked me to tell you
that the others have arrived.

557
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,195
Good.

558
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,998
Lord Rupert Standish
and Mr. Blond are here, milady.

559
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,000
They can have a tray
in the billiard room.

560
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,085
- They can join us later.
- Very good, milady.

561
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,297
- Is Rupert here?
- Yes.

562
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,925
- Shall I go and say hello?
- No, I don't think so.

563
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,640
Face it, you're a younger son,

564
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,936
with the taste of marquess
and the income of a vicar.

565
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,731
Her mother likes you.
She does, too.

566
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,275
Now, I know she's not exactly
a show-stopper...

567
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,153
- Her father's not keen on the idea.
- He'll come around.

568
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,573
"Met my daughter,
Lady Rupert Standish?"

569
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,785
He thinks I'm in it for the money.

570
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,121
Of course he does.
But you can't let that put you off.

571
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,415
He's much more
of an obstacle than you think.

572
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,752
Then you must overcome that,
mustn't you?

573
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:37,631
Her Ladyship asked if you would join her
in the drawing room when you've finished.

574
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,591
Alright, ladies, off you go.

575
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,427
Gentlemen.

576
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,013
Chaps, move down, move down.

577
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,809
Louisa, look after Pip for me, will you?

578
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,728
I wonder if we could have
a word or two later on, William?

579
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,313
- Ah, George...
- Do you think so?

580
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,525
Ah, good, good.

581
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,403
- Jennings, could I...?
- Certainly, sir.

582
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,199
There's more in here.
I'm just getting them.

583
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,952
I need all the knives there.
All the knives.

584
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,830
- Maude, let's go and get the fish kettle.
- Counting again...

585
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,920
Fred? Albert? Ready?

586
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,133
- There he is.
- Who?

587
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:25,429
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
Apparently, he grew up in an orphanage.

588
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,181
Arthur said they made him
shout it down the table.

589
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,017
Makes you feel sorry for him, really.

590
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,185
It's nothing to be
ashamed of. It's not his fault.

591
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:36,231
Would you like me to ask Lord Rupert
and Mr. Blond to join you, sir?

592
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,650
No, leave them be.
They can entertain the ladies.

593
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,569
Give Mr. Novello a rest.

594
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:44,531
Anthony, did I overhear you saying
you will go into business with Sir William?

595
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,116
- I beg your pardon?
- Is it very old?

596
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,743
Possibly, possibly.

597
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:52,873
If you need an expert in changing money,
especially Africa, I'm your man... expert.

598
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,458
Yes, the expert.

599
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,419
No, it's not here.

600
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,088
Mr. Jennings is certain
he hasn't got it?

601
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,798
Oh, so he says.

602
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,926
But if it's a silver carving knife,
he must have it.

603
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,512
It's just gone in the wrong drawer
in the silver pantry.

604
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,640
- It wouldn't have been put in here.
- Well, that's what I told him!

605
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,270
How old would you say
that Mr. Stockbridge was?

606
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,358
Don't know. About 31, 32.

607
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,652
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

608
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,322
I think I'll turn in.
We got an early start.

609
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,241
You can tell Mr. Jennings
we haven't got that knife.

610
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,881
- Pleasant evening, milady?
- Not really, no.

611
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,760
Had Lord Stockbridge on one side
boring for Britain,

612
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,347
and Freddie Nesbitt
on the other sucking up.

613
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,393
Oh, I'm worn out.
Is there any more chocolate in that pot?

614
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,772
I'll go down
and make some more, milady.

615
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,745
Lewis?

616
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:18,959
Lewis?

617
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,840
- I was looking for my maid.
- She's just gone downstairs.

618
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,675
Can I help?

619
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,094
She went to fetch some chocolate,

620
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,680
but now I wonder whether
I wouldn't prefer milk.

621
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,641
Would that be hot milk or cold?

622
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:39,438
- You decide.
- I couldn't say, milady.

623
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,651
Hot then, with something to make it sweet.
You have your hands in your pockets.

624
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,697
- Otherwise I'll never sleep.
- Why?

625
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,283
Do you have trouble sleeping,
milady?

626
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,077
I have a feeling
I might have trouble tonight.

627
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,583
I'll be wide awake at 1:00am,
bored to sobs.

628
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,004
Then we must try and think
of something to amuse you.

629
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,520
- Barnes. It's alright.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

630
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,106
No, I knew it. I knew William
would try something like this.

631
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,567
- Course he would. Fuck him!
- Shortarse!

632
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,402
And fuck this room!

633
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,660
I think you should come with me
tomorrow.

634
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,787
I'll just say I need you.

635
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:44,211
Oh, I got through to the coast tonight.
Finally. Is that clock right?

636
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:53,929
We got turned down by Una Merkel,
so... Sheen's pushing for a rewrite.

637
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,140
He thinks the part's too small.

638
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,606
It's a fucking Charlie Chan picture,
not a movie about a socialite.

639
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,860
So...

640
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,321
Will I see you later?

641
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,159
I don't think I should risk it.
Do you?

642
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,372
Goodnight, sir.

643
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,500
Henry.

644
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,338
Don't forget those.
They'll think you don't care.

645
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:16,052
- Oh, I must've taken the wrong stairs.
- You better not be seen up here.

646
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,518
- I'd better go down.
- Why?

647
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,562
There's no rush.

648
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:30,358
Since you're here now,
what about a drink?

649
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,656
What are you doing?

650
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,076
No!

651
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,329
Get off me!

652
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,375
Get off me! Get off...

653
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,877
What?

654
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:54,424
What's this?
What are you doing here?

655
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,719
I came up the wrong staircase. I was
just waiting till the coast was clear.

656
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,098
Well, you better go down again
before anyone catches you.

657
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,642
Just a minute.

658
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,658
- What?
- Nothing.

659
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,623
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

660
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,794
So what do you make of the place?

661
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,963
Is this a well-run house,
would you say?

662
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:37,050
Do you think Sir William
would be good to work for?

663
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,468
No.

664
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,680
How long you been doing this?

665
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,890
- What?
- Valeting?

666
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,477
About seven years.
I was a footman before that.

667
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,731
And working for Lord Stockbridge...
is that a promotion?

668
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:52,899
No.

669
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,822
I used to be with the Earl of Flintshire.

670
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,326
- Then why did you move?
- 'Cause I felt like it.

671
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:06,830
Who's that?

672
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,333
- That's my mother.
- Where does she live?

673
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,711
She doesn't. That's why they put me
in an orphanage.

674
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,381
That's right. Sorry.

675
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,509
What happened to her?

676
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:24,264
- What do you mean?
- I mean, why did she die?

677
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,017
Was she young?
Was it in childbirth?

678
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,604
You're not very curious, are you?

679
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,318
Yeah, she was young.
She worked in a factory.

680
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,404
She had me.
A little while later, she died.

681
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,364
End of story.

682
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,617
Then why didn't you say
she was a factory worker at dinner?

683
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,286
'Cause I didn't fancy discussing
my private life

684
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,413
with a table full of strangers.

685
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:55,420
I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn, mate.
Didn't mean to offend you.

686
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,213
I'm not offended.

687
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,466
And don't call me "mate".

688
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,471
Well, I'll see you later.

689
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,308
I've got a date
with a hot glass of milk.

690
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:14,439
I shouldn't worry about it.
It goes with the territory.

691
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,403
Oh, look. It's Mr. Novello.

692
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,660
Just think of him sleeping downstairs.

693
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,872
I'm gonna have to watch you, my girl.
I can see that.

694
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,959
Her Ladyship says Mr. Weissman's
a Hollywood producer.

695
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,544
He does the Charlie Chan films.

696
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,297
Yeah, I like those.
I like a bit of a fright in the cinema.

697
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,675
You could go with his valet.
He'd give you a fright.

698
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,473
You'd better keep your eye on him.
I think he's a queer one.

699
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:53,895
He's not from Scotland, for a start.
At least not any part of it that I know.

700
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,735
- What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?
- She's alright.

701
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,363
I feel a bit sorry for her, really.

702
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,616
- Of course, it never works.
- What never works?

703
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,743
Well, when a man like that
marries beneath him,

704
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,912
he hasn't got the brains
to carry it off.

705
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:16,251
- I think it's romantic to marry for love.
- Love? Not him.

706
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,670
He's a nasty piece of work.

707
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,132
The honorable Freddie Nesbitt.
That's a laugh.

708
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,010
No, it was her father's money
he was after.

709
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,763
It was less than he thought,
and now it's all spent,

710
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,516
all he's got to show for it
is a wife he's ashamed of.

711
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,310
And he's lost his job.

712
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,438
Wants Miss Isobel to put in a word
with Sir William.

713
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,150
- What's the matter?
- I never washed that shirt!

714
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,571
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

715
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,906
Do you think I could do it now?

716
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,826
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.

717
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,953
I'll be alright.

718
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,032
What are you doing down here?

719
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,993
I'm supposed to wash
Lady Trentham's shirt for tomorrow.

720
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,996
There's a sink in the ironing room.

721
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,479
Is someone in there?

722
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:01,374
What are you doing here?

723
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,210
I just had to rinse this shirt out.

724
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,350
Should've knocked, shouldn't you?

725
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,575
Miss Trentham?

726
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,703
I was just washing a shirt
of Her Ladyship's.

727
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,955
I hope you found everything
you required.

728
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,208
Does she have to have marmalade?

729
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,711
Only Dorothy made
too little of it last January,

730
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,047
and we've run out of the homemade.

731
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,883
I don't suppose she'd care
for strawberry jam instead?

732
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,638
No, I thought not.

733
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,520
Oh, I was rather hoping
for a word with Mrs. Wilson.

734
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,314
Mrs. Wilson, will you tell Jennings

735
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,900
that we'll have the soup
after the fourth drive tomorrow?

736
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,529
A-a-and tell Mrs. Croft
to-to make sure it's hot, cold-hot.

737
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,282
It's been cold the last few weeks.
And more pepper in it.

738
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,589
Is that you?

739
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,717
Were you expecting someone else?

740
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,478
Seven-hundred day today?

741
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:50,024
Well, lads, don't coach your guns,
even if they can't hit a barn door.

742
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,112
Don't tell them where
they're missing, unless they ask.

743
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:58,032
- Lovely day! Jennings...
- I hope it holds for you, sir.

744
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,202
- Enjoy the shoot.
- Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?

745
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,163
- Dangerous?
- Do I have to worry about it attacking?

746
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,208
- Morning, sir.
- Right, draw your pegs.

747
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,918
I'm gonna be cheering him on.

748
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,753
Here we are.

749
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,840
- Morning, Jennings.
- Are you shooting today, sir?

750
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,842
- I never shoot.
- Oh.

751
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,345
I'm-I'm starving.

752
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,305
Where have you been?

753
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,725
Sorry.

754
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,395
Oh, they always send up
a good breakfast here.

755
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:32,775
I'll say that for Sylvia.
She's not at all mean in that way.

756
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,906
Oh, dear. Bought marmalade.
Dear me, I call that very feeble.

757
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,409
Well, I suppose
one can't have everything.

758
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,412
Mary, I don't think
I'll wear that shirt after all.

759
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,165
The other one's warmer.
That's all I care about.

760
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,210
Ooh, yummy!

761
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,379
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

762
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,008
What do you mean,
you're going shooting?

763
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:01,012
Mr. Weissman wants me to accompany him.
Nothing wrong in that.

764
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:04,098
But what for? You're not loading.
He hasn't got a gun.

765
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,311
- He might need something.
- What could he need?

766
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:12,648
Yeah, we know the very idea of service
is offensive to you, George.

767
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,818
But there's no need
to take it out on the rest of us.

768
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,113
Please, forgive our ill manners,
Mr. Weissman.

769
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,411
I think he's got something to hide,
that one.

770
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,707
We all have something to hide,
Mr. Meredith.

771
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,022
Would you like
to get changed now, Miss?

772
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,526
- He won't do it.
- Who won't do what?

773
00:53:57,652 --> 00:54:00,821
My father. He won't give Freddie a job.

774
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,242
I spoke to him last night,
and he said he'd think about it.

775
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,912
But this morning, he says
it isn't up to him, when, of course, it is.

776
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,164
- Why not?
- I don't know.

777
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,042
Something to do
with why Freddie was sacked.

778
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,711
But I can't get a straight answer
out of either of them.

779
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,213
Well, you've done your best.

780
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,882
Mr. Nesbitt can't ask
for more than that now, can he?

781
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:24,053
But he can, much more!
He says he's going to tell him.

782
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,931
Do you think he will?

783
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:31,894
I don't know. He says Daddy
will give him a job to keep him quiet.

784
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,317
- Will you say something?
- To Mr. Nesbitt?

785
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,030
To Daddy.

786
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:48,119
Really, Miss, why do you think
I can make a difference?

787
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,330
Will you?

788
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,418
I think you should wear
your warm underwear today.

789
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,572
Nearly.

790
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,080
That's mine.

791
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:37,835
Oh, God! It's on its way.

792
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:49,138
Damn! Bloody gun's no good.
I told you not to bring this one.

793
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,485
Blast.

794
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,447
I think I pricked that one.
I-I 'm pretty sure I pricked it.

795
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,700
Bugger!

796
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,081
Oh! Oh!

797
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,708
Blast!

798
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,384
Oh, damn! Blast!

799
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,552
- Are you alright, sir?
- No, I'm not alright!

800
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,931
God, where the bloody hell
did that come from?

801
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,433
- It's nicked you, sir.
- God, it's nicked me.

802
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,769
- What cretin did that?
- I don't know, sir.

803
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,689
Find Strutt! Ask him if he knows
who's responsible.

804
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,692
And if he knows, tell him to send
the gun back to the bloody house.

805
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:48,239
Everybody knows the desperate situation
we're in, but nobody seems to care.

806
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,449
Oh, there you are.
Did you find one?

807
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,701
- Well?
- Don't look at me.

808
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:56,163
If I so much as open my mouth
on the subject, it'll make things worse.

809
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:00,334
- I've already tried.
- Jennings says the car's ready.

810
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,838
Oh, goody. I'm starving.

811
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,674
- What are you wearing?
- Why? Don't you like it?

812
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:11,053
- You bought it.
- Did I?

813
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:16,058
- Oh, how extraordinary of me.
- Come on. Better get going.

814
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,352
Where's that wretched Mabel?

815
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,896
Has anyone checked her outfit?
She's probably in black velvet

816
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,148
with a feather in her hair.

817
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,775
She's in the morning room
looking perfectly normal.

818
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,695
- Don't be such a snob, Aunt Constance.
- Me?

819
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,114
I haven't the snobbish bone
in my body.

820
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,583
Oh, Mr. Meredith.

821
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,461
- Is Mr. Stockbridge in?
- Search me.

822
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,636
Oh, Mr. Stockbridge.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

823
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,763
I was just making
my routine inspection.

824
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:04,190
So, uh, how are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

825
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:07,651
I'm sorry?

826
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:11,572
How are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

827
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:14,074
I know that you haven't been
with him for long.

828
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,911
Not long, no.

829
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:21,624
I'm afraid smoking
isn't allowed up here.

830
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:40,351
I hope you're finding everything to make
His Lordship's stay more comfortable.

831
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,436
I hope we haven't forgotten anything.

832
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,773
I can't believe you forget much,
Mrs. Wilson.

833
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,985
No, not much.

834
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,614
Well, I'll leave you to your book.

835
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,802
You know... bang! Whoof!

836
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,346
You should be more
selective about the people you invite.

837
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,515
- Well, I've got a good appetite.
- Yes.

838
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:41,203
Terribly muddy here.
Do watch.

839
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,665
Do you see what I'm saying?
I've been noticing it.

840
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,543
Doesn't this look lovely?
They really have done well.

841
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,088
Now do go in and have a drink.

842
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:54,883
I can tell you, Raymond, it's a bloody
awful thing to have happened.

843
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,345
- Oh, God, Louisa.
- Oh! Oh, I say.

844
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,973
Two inches to my right I'd have been dead.
I've just been shot.

845
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,224
- What?
- Yes, that's right.

846
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,978
- Oh, yes, please.
- What happened to your ear?

847
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,646
Some idiot shot me.

848
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,774
- That was a terrible shot.
- Did you have fun?

849
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,027
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

850
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:14,903
Of course I do.

851
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,031
Why can't you get
your sisters to help?

852
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:20,576
Darling, do you think I haven't tried?
You know what they're like.

853
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,870
Well, I know they couldn't care less
if we go under.

854
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,873
Why should they care,
as long as their dressmakers are busy

855
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,750
and their dinners are served on time?

856
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,505
- Wait a minute. There's a queue here.
- Shh, shh.

857
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:39,136
Oh!
Shut the door, for heaven's sake.

858
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,139
Don't worry.
It's only Lewis and Dorothy.

859
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,726
If any of the men get found up here,
they get sacked on the spot.

860
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:47,519
Worse luck.

861
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:53,192
So, don't tell me you're a convent girl.
Or is that Presbyterian modesty?

862
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:58,489
- Is the water hot?
- Not really.

863
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:04,745
No, it won't be till the guns get back.
I'd better get in yours.

864
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,166
Her Ladyship says that Sir William
loves his shooting.

865
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,711
Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door,
but he does love it.

866
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,546
It's quite sweet, really.

867
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,217
- Elsie.
- Yeah?

868
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,511
Last night...

869
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,055
What?

870
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,101
- No, I shouldn't say.
- Yes, you should. What?

871
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:34,650
Well... when I went down
to wash that shirt,

872
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,236
I think I saw him in the ironing room.

873
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,363
He was with
one of the kitchen maids.

874
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,825
- No, that wouldn't have been him.
- I think it was.

875
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,994
He came down the passage
a minute later, and I don't see how...

876
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,788
No, it wasn't him.

877
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,666
You weren't serious last night, were you?

878
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,209
I'm afraid I was, old boy.

879
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,795
I was going to tell you next week,
but since you mentioned it...

880
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,923
I don't think you've grasped quite
what it'll do to the whole project,

881
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,550
in particular what it'll do to me.

882
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,594
- It can't be as black as all that, can it?
- Yes, it bloody well is.

883
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,807
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but business is business.

884
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,601
- I'm not a charity commissioner.
- William, I'm begging you.

885
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,064
Damn it!

886
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,607
Oh, dear.

887
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,651
- I'll clear that up.
- I'm sorry.

888
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,070
Arthur, go and get a bucket.

889
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,322
- Have you a cloth?
- ...glass under the table.

890
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,158
Seems very nervous.

891
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,077
We'll have that
cleaned for you at the house.

892
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:32,332
- ♪ I do like gathering nuts in May
- I borrowed it from Lewis.

893
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,380
- Shot, frightened to death.
- Everything alright, sir?

894
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:46,972
- I think it's left me deaf.
- Thank you, Arthur.

895
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,809
You know how you said Sir William
could've had his pick,

896
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,811
between Lady Sylvia
and Lady Stockbridge?

897
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,607
- Aye.
- Well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.

898
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:59,276
And she said they cut cards for him.

899
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,780
- No!
- I know.

900
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:06,658
I can't believe it, either.
Do you suppose it was a joke?

901
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,994
Well, I wouldn't be too sure.

902
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,997
You know what I heard?

903
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,125
- Oh, just listen to me.
- What?

904
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,961
Why do we spend our lives
living through them?

905
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,548
I mean, look at poor old Lewis.

906
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,217
If her own mother had a heart attack,

907
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:26,470
she'd think it was less important
than one of Lady Sylvia's farts.

908
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:29,890
You must know. You can't fool me.

909
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,810
If there's one thing I don't look
for in a maid, it's discretion.

910
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:35,354
Except with my own secrets, of course.

911
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,689
Well, I don't know much, milady,

912
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:41,360
but apparently he was counting
on Sir William for an investment,

913
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:44,738
and had guaranteed his interest,
whatever that means.

914
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,324
Anyway, Mr. Barnes,
the commander's valet,

915
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,951
he said he wanted to leave at once,

916
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:52,120
but Lady Lavinia's persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow

917
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,789
to make less of a thing of it.

918
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:56,041
Oh, thank heavens.

919
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,960
Lewis told me you were wearing white.

920
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,587
White? She must be mad.
I never wear white.

921
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,631
I thought it was a little odd.

922
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,551
By the way, for God's sake,
don't rub him up tonight.

923
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,512
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.

924
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,557
He's in a filthy mood with everyone.

925
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,184
He's talking about stopping
your allowance.

926
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,522
But it's for life. That was settled.
He can't do that.

927
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:22,192
Just you watch him.
He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.

928
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,903
So if you'll take my advice,
you won't give him one.

929
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:30,200
Now, that you can be discreet about.

930
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,290
Thank you.

931
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:44,464
Goodness, isn't it pretty here?
The house has such lovely position.

932
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,303
The best view's from the old water tower.
You might well walk up there tomorrow.

933
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,348
Do you really have to go
back to London?

934
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,018
I am afraid so, Raymond.

935
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,021
When you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

936
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:03,817
Yes, there is, isn't there?
Moan, moan, moan.

937
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,579
Would anybody care
for a game of bridge after dinner?

938
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:17,664
Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind.

939
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,793
Who else? Louisa, how about you?

940
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:25,255
Oh, I don't think so.
I've rather gone off cards.

941
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,634
I've never been very lucky with them.

942
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:31,762
Me too.

943
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,686
Mr. Weissman, tell us about the film
you're going to make.

944
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:44,024
Oh, sure. It's called "Charlie Chan
in London". It's a detective story.

945
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,485
- Set in London?
- Well, not really.

946
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,947
Erm, most of it takes place
at a shooting party in a country house,

947
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:52,282
sort of like this one, actually.

948
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,285
A murder in the middle of the night.
A lot of guests for the weekend.

949
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,121
Everyone's a suspect...
You know, that sort of thing.

950
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,749
How horrid.

951
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,543
And who turns out to have done it?

952
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,588
I couldn't tell you that.
It would spoil it for you.

953
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:10,592
Oh, but none of us will see it.

954
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,971
Are you thinking of making it here,
Mr. Weissman?

955
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:18,392
Uh, no, we're going to shoot it
in Hollywood, on the backlot.

956
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:19,935
But since I was in England,

957
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,105
I thought I would do a little research
on country living

958
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,526
and Ivor was kind enough
to arrange it for me.

959
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,570
Mmm, no.
William arranged it for you.

960
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:32,572
Are you interested
in films, sir?

961
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,324
Not likely.

962
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:39,287
Why shouldn't I be interested in films?
You don't know what I'm interested in.

963
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,708
Well, I know you're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

964
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,543
but for anything else I'm stumped.

965
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,795
That is not fair. Bill is...

966
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,430
Elsie.

967
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:41,808
Elsie, what's...?

968
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,314
It's not as if I didn't know.

969
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:50,984
So we can all play bridge.

970
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:52,861
All playing?

971
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,114
Who's going to play bridge?
Are they going to play bridge?

972
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,449
Where's Rupert?

973
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,410
- Rupert!
- Coming.

974
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:05,624
- I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out of turn.
- You didn't actually see?

975
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,965
So what's going to happen to Elsie?

Hmm?

He gave you that
for your birthday, William did?

1148
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,147
Yeah, I've got a call
booked for California.

1149

still in the library?

1156
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,089

- Hmm?

1157
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,924
- I suppose.
- Where have you been?

1158
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:26,095
- None of your business.
- What else are we going to do?

1159
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:30,224
- Well, I could try and fetch him.
- Oh, would you?

1160

Hello? Yes, would you connect me
with the police station, please?

1200
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:22,063
I'm looking for a kind
of realistic Charlie Chan movie.

1201
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:24,899
This isn't out of the question.
We should try to do this.

1202
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:28,486
It has to be better. We can't do
the same old shit over and over again.

1203
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,406
Alan Mowbray... I like that.
I mean, that's a butler.

1204
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,533
These people here
look like Alan Mowbray.

1205
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:38,245
I mean, they're sort of tall,
and they don't say too much.

1206
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:41,165
And they have
fucking British accents, right?

1207
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,959
They talk like they're from England.

1208
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,586
- Good evening.
- Is Ray Milland British?

1209
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,297
- Evening. This is Constable Dexter...
- You must be the police.

1210
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,342
- Yes, I'm Inspector Thom...
- I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.

1211
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:56,013
We haven't moved him. I've gathered
everyone. Come straight through.

1212
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:59,141
Don't worry about him.
He's just an American staying with us.

1213
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,602
I'll tell you who we all are.

1214
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,854
Then we can all go to bed
and leave you with poor William.

1215
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,773
- Does that sound like a good plan?
- Yes, indeed.

1216
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,566
Shall I introduce myself?
I'm Inspector Thom...

1217
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:10,361
- This is my aunt, Lady Trentham.
- Ah, yes, the Countess of Trentham.

1218
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,530
I served with your husband on a...

1219
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:15,199
My brother-in-law Lord Stockbridge.
Lady Stockbridge.

1220
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,702
Jennings, please would you
remove that vile animal?

1221
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:20,413
- Certainly, milady.
- Uh, Mrs. Nesbitt.

1222
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,164
Mr. Nesbitt.

1223
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:23,958
Ivor Novello, who I'm sure
needs no introduction.

1224
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,127
- Of course. Mr. Novello...
- No, wait.

1225
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:28,587
Would you like to speak
to the servants tonight, Inspector?

1226
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:31,173
- Inspector Thom...
- He ought to speak to my husband's valet.

1227
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,800
Tell him to come up.
Now, where was I?

1228
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:36,220
- Uh... Isobel McCordle, my daughter.
- Charlie Chan is in London.

1229
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,264
He's not in California.

1230
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:41,642
They're talking to me about rewrites
about the part of the Cockney maid,

1231
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,769
and she's running in
and saying all these things.

1232
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,147
Look, I'm here. They don't talk.

1233
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,482
The butlers and the maids,
they stand, they watch.

1234
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,027
I mean, you know, they serve.
They do things.

1235
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:54,447
What about Claudette Colbert?
She's British, isn't she?

1236
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:58,075
She sounds British.
Is she, like, affected, or is she British?

1237
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:07,668
Oh, Dorothy, would you take...?

1238
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,590
Um, well, I...

1239
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,884
Come on, spit it out.

1240
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:17,219
The police would like to see you
for a moment.

1241
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:20,181
- Me?
- No, Mrs. Croft. Mr. Probert.

1242
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:23,142
Me? Why?

1243
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,187
Oh, well.

1244
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,773
I don't know what I can tell them.

1245
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:35,029
George, would you see if anything more
is required in the red drawing room?

1246
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:36,781
Yes, sir.

1247
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:40,743
I don't see the point
in the rest of you waiting up.

1248
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:42,369
What about me, Mr. Jennings?

1249
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,081
You can go as soon
as the police release you.

1250
01:24:45,206 --> 01:24:47,166
I daresay that'll be sometime tomorrow.

1251
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:51,170
Until then, you can stay in your room.

1252
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,130
I'm not contagious, you know.

1253
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,966
Nobody's going anywhere.

1254
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:59,678
Those of you with remaining duties,
see to them as quickly as you can.

1255
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:03,349
Otherwise... goodnight, everyone.

1256
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:06,268
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

1257
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,188
- Mr. Jennings.
- Yes, Mr. Weissman?

1258
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,107
I have a confession to make.

1259
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:21,742
Right, but I think
it's clear that it's the valet that did it.

1260
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,495
No, because the valet
has access to everybody.

1261
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,914
No, the valet isn't the butler.

1262
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,793
No, there's one butler, and there's
lots of valets running all over the place.

1263
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,546
He takes care of people.
He's in their rooms at night.

1264
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:36,924
He could do it. I mean, the valet
easily could've done it.

1265
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,180
Pull yourself together, Mr. Probert.

1266
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,891
Try and be a bit patient.
They'll be along in a minute.

1267
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:51,021
Couldn't I just make him
a little more comfortable, sir?

1268
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:53,357
- Please?
- Have a heart, Inspector.

1269
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,277
No, it wouldn't be wise, sir. We shouldn't
have to wait too much longer now.

1270
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:59,363
Oh, I don't think it'd do any harm.
Go on.

1271
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,493
Oh!

1272
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:10,291
Yes, well, you see, this is why
we have rules and regulations, isn't it?

1273
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,168
What is it, Dexter?

1274
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:16,255
Well, only that there doesn't seem
to be much blood, sir.

1275
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,846
- Is that everything, milord?
- Yes, thank you, Parks.

1276
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,806
I think you should try
and get some sleep.

1277
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:30,644
It's so unfair.
Nobody liked him.

1278
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:40,946
Do stop sniveling.
Anyone would think you were Italian.

1279
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,867
Christ!

1280
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:53,709
Will you not let me help you
with your frock, milady?

1281
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,253
No, I can manage.

1282
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,131
- Then I'll say good night, milady...
- No, wait, wait.

1283
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:03,010
Thank you, milady.

1284
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,284
What is it?

1285
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:40,339
Please tell me you haven't come
with condolences.

1286
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,175
No.
I was just wondering if you wanted...

1287
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,760
What?

1288
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:49,974
I said, I was just
wondering if you wanted some company.

1289
01:27:56,355 --> 01:28:00,025
Well, I suppose life must go on.
Unhook me.

1290
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:12,371
No, there's another one.
You'll never get it off like that.

1291
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:19,878
I'm really sorry
about everything.

1292
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:25,050
Don't feel sorry for me.
pity that poor Dorothy.

1293
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:29,305
She's got all the early morning teas
to do and the breakfast trays.

1294
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,765
And she's got to get Miss Isobel
to the dining room

1295
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,226
and see if she can find anything in black.

1296
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:39,356
She's the one who needs your sympathy.
I'm well out of it.

1297
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:44,236
I would think Miss Isobel
might stay in bed tomorrow.

1298
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:50,034
Unmarried girls don't have
breakfast trays. Not in this house.

1299
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,289
I wish I could help.

1300
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:58,751
You can't.

1301
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:17,853
'George says
Mr. Novello was in on it.

1302
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:20,481
'And Sir William.'

1303
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:24,026
The point is, that Henry Denton,
he's an actor.

1304
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,444
An actor?

1305
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:29,239
He's playing a butler in the next Charlie
Chan. Wanted to make it authentic.

1306
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,408
I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.

1307
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:33,994
I hope he don't model
his performance on Mr. Jennings,

1308
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,538
or he'll be too squiffy
to remember his lines.

1309
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:41,043
Ah, Mrs. Croft, isn't it?
I wonder if I could...

1310
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:44,588
Ah, yes, er...have a few words with you.
I'm Inspector Thom...

1311
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,299
Oh, I haven't got time for this now.
I'm doing the breakfast.

1312
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:52,179
It wouldn't take much time. Perhaps
you have a room where we could speak.

1313
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:54,306
Oh, I suppose
you'd better come to my room.

1314
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:56,016
Bertha, I'm leaving you in charge.

1315
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:59,311
Dorothy, make sure those menus go up
on Her Ladyship's tray.

1316
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,980
And get that filthy dog out of here!

1317
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:10,781
Honestly, these days the countryside's
getting more dangerous than Piccadilly.

1318
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,409
But why one of the knives
from the silver pantry?

1319
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:15,661
Doesn't make sense.

1320
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:18,288
He must have forgotten to bring one.

1321
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,582
When you think of what
they have to carry about,

1322
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:25,170
all those jemmies and torches
and skeleton keys,

1323
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:28,173
it's a miracle anyone
ever gets burgled at all.

1324
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:31,844
Oh, it's glacial in here.
Get my fur, will you?

1325
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,473
Anyway, it wasn't in the silver pantry.

1326
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:39,017
It's been missing since yesterday.

1327
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:41,019
Obviously William had it.

1328
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:43,230
And when the fellow surprised him,
there it was,

1329
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,816
on the table as handy as you like.

1330
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:51,238
Are any of the others getting up
for breakfast? The women, I mean.

1331
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,657
I think Lady Lavinia may be.

1332
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:57,828
That settles it. Come back
at half past eight. I'll get dressed.

1333
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:03,250
It's the greatest bore, of course,
but I don't want to miss anything.

1334
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:11,800
When I came back last night,
I found this on my dressing table.

1335
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,844
What is it?

1336
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:21,393
"This is your final warning.
If I've not received an offer..."

1337
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:25,272
Freddie. What a stupid idiot.

1338
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,650
Well, at least he's off your back now.
There's no one to tell.

1339
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,528
At least no one's who's gonna give him
a job to shut him up.

1340
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:38,744
Ha-ha! Oh, now,
he's quite the bonny lad, isn't he?

1341
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,954
What's he up to these days,
this one, eh?

1342
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,706
He's dead.

1343
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,792
I don't know what I can tell you.

1344
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:48,212
Shouldn't you be looking
for signs of a break-in?

1345
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:51,715
The thing is, Mrs. Croft, I understand
that no one has served Sir William

1346
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,176
longer than you have, is that true?

1347
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:57,429
I'd better be off.
Might not see you again.

1348
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:02,726
I'm only staying
till the police give the nod.

1349
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,269
But, Elsie...

1350
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,399
You're not in any difficulty, are you?

1351
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:12,361
What, apart from having
no home and no job?

1352
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:15,447
Nah. There's no worries there.

1353
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:19,451
Yes, I was forgetting.
You were much cleverer than I was.

1354
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,578
You'll be fine.

1355
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,085
I wonder what Lady Sylvia will do now.

1356
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,755
If I were her, I'd set up in London
as a glamorous widow,

1357
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,132
with all the gentlemen chasing me
for my money.

1358
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:36,426
I wouldn't. I grew up in London.

1359
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:40,806
- Is that where the orphanage was?
- On the edge. Isleworth.

1360
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,641
And you don't get homesick?

1361
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,560
I don't think you get homesick
if you've never had a home.

1362
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:47,771
Heard about Mr. Weissman's valet?
Turns out he's a fraud.

1363
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,107
- He isn't Scottish at all.
- No!

1364
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:52,734
I could've told you that.

1365
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:56,196
- Who is he, then?
- Do you think he's the murderer?

1366
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:58,991
It's worse than that.
He's an actor.

1367
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:05,122
Yes, I want you to wake him up.
How else do you suggest I talk to him?

1368
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:09,793
Yes. Right. Well, what did he say?
What, he's talking about Clara Bow again?

1369
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:14,590
Listen, you tell Sheehan that I think
Clara Bow's a really nice person,

1370
01:33:14,715 --> 01:33:17,342
and she's not coming
in ten miles of my picture.

1371
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:19,428
I don't want her in the fucking movie.

1372
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:23,765
There's one thing. The bastard's death
may have saved my bacon.

1373
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:27,311
For God's sake, be quiet.
What's the matter with you?

1374
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:32,441
Arthur...

1375
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,776
- Oh, are these tomatoes?
- Yes, milady.

1376
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,945
That's exactly what I want.

1377
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:40,699
- Good morning.
- Morning, dear.

1378
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,659
Have you heard?

1379
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:47,164
It's too tiresome. That frightful
inspector won't let anyone leave.

1380
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,207
So we're to be treated to another day

1381
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:52,544
of Mr. Weissman shouting
down the telephone.

1382
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:55,964
He has some problems with his work
in Los Angeles, I'm afraid.

1383
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,426
Well, I must say,
he conducts his affairs very oddly.

1384
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,929
Just now, I thought I'd been
transported to a bar in Marseilles.

1385
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,890
Jennings?
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1386
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:07,267
I'm expecting
a really important telephone call.

1387
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,269
Will you get me
the second it comes through?

1388
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,771
Very good, sir.

1389
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:14,191
And I'd like, uh, oh... tomato and eggs.
Thank you.

1390
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:16,485
Of course, sir, but...

1391
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,946
perhaps you would prefer
to choose for yourself, sir?

1392
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:23,075
What do you mean,
like cafeteria style?

1393
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,703
The Englishman is never
waited on at breakfast.

1394
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:30,582
Really? Well, that's interesting,
because an American is.

1395
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:32,793
Wow!
I'm going to make a note of that.

1396
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:37,881
Good morning.

1397
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:39,424
Morning.

1398
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,766
I'd like some coffee, Jennings.

1399
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,476
There it is.

1400
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:55,774
Ah. Good.
Good morning, ladies, gents.

1401
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:59,778
Um, I wonder...
Excuse me.

1402
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,323
Uh, will Lady Sylvia
be coming down soon?

1403
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:05,992
I shouldn't think so.
She has breakfast in her room.

1404
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,412
Then she usually goes for a ride.

1405
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:11,998
Yes, but she won't be doing that
this morning, will she?

1406
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,293
Well, I see.

1407
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:20,882
Well, in that case I wonder,
Lady Trentham,

1408
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:25,053
if you would be kind enough
to join us for some questions.

1409
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,055
If you wish, Inspector.

1410
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:30,058
I'm afraid I won't be much help,

1411
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:34,146
but I suppose on a day like this
we all have to pull our weight.

1412
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:37,107
'Mr. Denton made a right chump
out of Mr. Jennings.'

1413
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:39,526
Never mind that.
Did you hear about Sir William?

1414
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,362
Apparently, he wasn't stabbed after all.

1415
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:45,782
Well, I mean, he was,
but that's not why he died.

1416
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:49,327
He was poisoned.
That's what killed him.

1417
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:51,079
The inspector told Mrs. Croft.

1418
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:53,331
They don't know why
the killer stabbed him as well,

1419
01:35:53,457 --> 01:35:55,459
but he must've been dead already.

1420
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:57,961
That's why there was no blood.

1421
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,422
Dead bodies don't bleed, you know?

1422
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:03,341
Trust Sir William
to be murdered twice.

1423
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:09,848
Of course he wasn't murdered.
Not that sort of murder.

1424
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:14,311
Some ruffian broke in,
thinking the library was empty,

1425
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:18,482
Sir William surprised him
and paid the price for it.

1426
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:20,358
And very tragic it is too.

1427
01:36:20,484 --> 01:36:22,360
I can't see that, Mr. Jennings.

1428
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:24,446
I don't think ruffians go
about poisoning people

1429
01:36:24,571 --> 01:36:26,072
and then stabbing the corpses.

1430
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:27,908
Apart from anything else,

1431
01:36:28,033 --> 01:36:30,410
they're usually in a hurry to get away,
aren't they?

1432
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:32,245
What are you suggesting?

1433
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:35,040
- I'm not suggesting anything. It's just...
- Just what?

1434
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:39,795
Well... it looks to me like Sir William
was killed deliberately, that's all.

1435
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,881
No wonder they're not letting
any of us go.

1436
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:45,675
Tough luck on whoever's got
any secrets to hide.

1437
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:50,555
Now they've cancelled the shooting,

1438
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,100
muggins here has got to pull a luncheon
for God knows how many out of the hat.

1439
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:56,102
- Is Her Ladyship back yet?
- No.

1440
01:36:56,228 --> 01:36:58,980
Well, she'll have to take what she gets.

1441
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:01,149
Why would anyone
want to kill Sir William?

1442
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:04,027
Well, he wasn't exactly
Father Christmas!

1443
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,029
Oh, get on with your work.

1444
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:08,615
And take that filthy dog out of here!

1445
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:12,452
He made a few enemies
in his time, that's all.

1446
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,454
What do you mean, enemies? When?

1447
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:18,542
Is this before the war, Mrs. Croft,
when you were a factory worker?

1448
01:37:18,667 --> 01:37:21,837
I was not a factory worker.
I was never a factory worker.

1449
01:37:21,962 --> 01:37:24,172
I was a cook
in one of his factories.

1450
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,634
He had two in Isleworth and two
in Twickenham, and all full of girls,

1451
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,344
so you can imagine.

1452
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:32,264
Wasn't that risky with factory girls?
Suppose they complained?

1453
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:33,974
Who to, exactly?

1454
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:36,977
But what if they got, you know,
in trouble?

1455
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,690
- What sort of trouble?
- Here, take these. Whites only, alright?

1456
01:37:41,815 --> 01:37:43,441
Didn't happen very often.

1457
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:47,195
When it did,
he arranged to have it adopted.

1458
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,866
But what if you didn't want it adopted?
Say you wanted to keep it?

1459
01:37:50,991 --> 01:37:53,034
Then you got kicked out, lost your job.

1460
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:56,746
You can take my word for it,
he was a hard-hearted, randy old sod.

1461
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:02,627
Ah, come in, Miss Maceach...
I'm Inspector Thom...

1462
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:05,338
This is all
too tiresome and absurd.

1463
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,340
He's making the most dreadful fuss.

1464
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,594
If you don't mind, I would like to ask
the young lady some questions.

1465
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:14,097
Well, I'm not leaving,
if that's what you think.

1466
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,225
Well, does it bother you
if Lady Trentham stays?

1467
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,227
Why should it?

1468
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:21,187
Sir, someone's traipsed mud in
down here.

1469
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:22,689
Not now, Dexter, please.

1470
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:26,860
I understood that
there was some difficulty

1471
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:29,195
between the late Sir William McCordle
and your employer.

1472
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,114
This is too vulgar to be believed.

1473
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:34,910
I wasn't aware of that, sir.
They got on well as far as I could see.

1474
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:37,495
Inspector, there's
a broken coffee cup down here.

1475
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:42,167
Dexter, they have people to clear
these things up. Get on with your own job.

1476
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:47,631
So you were not aware of any trouble
over the matter of an allowance?

1477
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:52,594
An allowance, I might add, that
Sir William's death has now made secure.

1478
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:57,223
What sort of an allowance
would that be, sir?

1479
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,067
Ah, there you are.

1480
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:10,111
Have you got enough light?

1481
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:14,324
Black on black? We don't want you
going blind on top of everything else.

1482
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,326
They've got to be done,
Mr. Jennings,

1483
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,829
but the outside staff need them
for the funeral.

1484
01:39:19,955 --> 01:39:24,542
I'm sorry that this business with Elsie
has landed you with so much work.

1485
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:27,295
That's what comes
of being so reliable.

1486
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,880
- Never mind me.
- Hmm.

1487
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:33,885
Mr. Jennings, have you...
have you spoken to the police again?

1488
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,389
Not yet, no.

1489
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:42,102
I suppose they have to ask
their questions, don't they have to?

1490
01:39:42,227 --> 01:39:44,104
Well, yes.

1491
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:47,649
Will they be talking to all of us?

1492
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,569
I shouldn't think so, no.

1493
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,781
- Well, I'll leave you to it, then.
- Mr. Jennings...

1494
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,996
You know... You know
I'd say anything you want me to.

1495
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,125
- What?
- Anything at all.

1496
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:08,920
I don't care what I tell them,
if it'll help you. You know that, don't you?

1497
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:11,047
You've only to ask.

1498
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:30,859
So, let me, uh...
let me pour you a cup of tea, eh?

1499
01:40:30,984 --> 01:40:35,530
Yes, thank you. Would you mind
putting the milk in afterwards?

1500
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:38,074
Of course. Of course.
Don't know what came over me.

1501
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,785
I usually put the milk in after,
but on that occasion...

1502
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,496
- Sir?
- Not now, thank you.

1503
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,914
So sorry.

1504
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,625
Mrs. Inspector Thompson
prefers the milk in first,

1505
01:40:47,751 --> 01:40:49,502
so I get used to pouring it for her.

1506
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:53,006
I don't know why. Some nonsense about
bacteria. You know what women are like...

1507
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:55,341
Well, what wives are like.

1508
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:57,552
No, she's a funny old...
Sugar?

1509
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,345
No, thank you.

1510
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:00,805
They'll give her a good reference,

1511
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:04,684
otherwise they'd have to explain
why they're giving her a bad one.

1512
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:08,480
- Mr. Parks...
- Robert.

1513
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:10,857
Robert, then.

1514
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:15,779
It's just... last night
when you said you'd surprise me,

1515
01:41:17,072 --> 01:41:20,283
you didn't mean anything by it,
did you?

1516
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:22,786
Why? Don't you like surprises?

1517
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:26,706
Now...
Oh, Mr. Stockbridge.

1518
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,626
By now, I assume you are all aware

1519
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:33,671
that, uh, Mr. Denton has been
playing a trick on us

1520
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:36,382
by posing as a valet.

1521
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:39,135
Since Sir William was aware
of the plan,

1522
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:42,639
it is not for me or anyone else
to criticize it.

1523
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:46,893
However, it does leave us with some
adjustments to make for this evening.

1524
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,105
Arthur, you will take over
dressing Mr. Weissman.

1525
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,065
That leaves us with the problem
of Mr. Novello,

1526
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:54,484
and I really don't want to ask you,
Mr. Probert.

1527
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,069
I don't mind, Mr. Jennings.

1528
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:57,654
Oh, no.
You've got enough on your plate.

1529
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,197
I'll do him, if you like.

1530
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:02,659
That's very generous of you,
Mr. Stockbridge.

1531
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:05,078
I suppose I could always
do it myself, of course.

1532
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,664
No, no, it's no trouble.
It's only for a night or two.

1533
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:10,542
Good. Splendid.
That's settled, then.

1534
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:15,713
And I think we can leave Mr. Denton
to dress himself. Ha-ha!

1535
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:20,552
"The bastard's death
may have saved my bacon."

1536
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:24,264
- What do you think he meant by that?
- Isn't it obvious?

1537
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:25,890
Is it?

1538
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:29,561
Well, perhaps he meant the investment
that Sir William had agreed

1539
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:32,188
would probably
have to be paid now... Sir!

1540
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:36,276
What about that low shot that nearly
killed him that morning they were out?

1541
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:38,069
- Sir.
- What is it?

1542
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:40,864
We haven't dusted those things
for fingerprints yet.

1543
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:42,574
Good.

1544
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:45,910
Do you think that shot might have
been intended for Sir William?

1545
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:49,747
- Well, it nearly took his ear off.
- Hmm.

1546
01:42:49,873 --> 01:42:52,375
Well, thank you, Mr. Barnes,
you've been most helpful.

1547
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,712
Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask
Commander Meredith to join us just now.

1548
01:42:55,837 --> 01:43:00,508
Y-y-you won't tell him what I said,
will you, Inspector Thomas?

1549
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:02,594
Thompson.
It's Inspector Thom...

1550
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,763
Never mind.
Just go and fetch him up, please.

1551
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,268
Sir...

1552
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,734
- We've only got this.
- I don't think mine's bothered.

1553
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:19,944
She hasn't got any black here.

1554
01:43:22,197 --> 01:43:24,699
- You're a lech.
- George?

1555
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:27,410
They're coming in a minute.
The dressing bell's just gone.

1556
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:30,371
I'm going out of my mind up there.
I've read all my magazines twice.

1557
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,790
You couldn't pinch something
out of the library for me?

1558
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:36,377
I don't care if it's "Horse and Hound",
as long as I haven't read it.

1559
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:42,467
Well, we are honored.

1560
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,553
In case you've forgotten,
this is the servants area, sir.

1561
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:48,848
Yours is at the top of the stairs
behind that door there, sir.

1562
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,975
Barnes, it was just a...

1563
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,062
- I wanted to explain...
- No explanation necessary, Mr. Denton.

1564
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:58,066
If you'll excuse us, some of us have
got real work to do. Come on, Arthur.

1565
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:01,069
The accent was a dead giveaway,
you know. We all knew.

1566
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:03,071
Robert, I was just having fun.

1567
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:06,616
Perhaps you'd better enjoy your fun
in the drawing room, sir.

1568
01:44:07,533 --> 01:44:10,662
They're afraid you'll repeat things,
be indiscreet.

1569
01:44:10,787 --> 01:44:12,664
But I'm very discreet.

1570
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:16,626
In Hollywood, that's what
I'm known for... my discretion.

1571
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:22,465
Tell Rupert if you like.
He won't give you any money.

1572
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,300
No, you're completely
misunderstanding me.

1573
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:27,845
And Mummy wouldn't pay
five pounds to save me...

1574
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:31,349
Oh, my poor darling.
Come here. Come on.

1575
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:36,896
Look, please don't think that
I'm enjoying this. All I wanted was a job.

1576
01:44:37,021 --> 01:44:40,650
My checkbook's downstairs.
I'll give you a check after dinner.

1577
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:48,783
I'm trying to find my man Parks.
Have you seen him?

1578
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,952
Uh, no.
I've been with the police.

1579
01:44:51,077 --> 01:44:53,329
You look as if you've had
rather a pasting.

1580
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:59,043
They kept on and on about that low shot
yesterday, and they wouldn't let it go.

1581
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,380
- I told them it was nothing to do with me.
- I'm sure you did.

1582
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,924
But another time, Anthony,
try to be less greedy. Parks!

1583
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,592
What?

1584
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:09,971
Attend to Mr. Novello first.
I want a word with Her Ladyship.

1585
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:11,431
Very well, milord.

1586
01:45:11,556 --> 01:45:14,475
- What?
- I saw you.

1587
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,854
Of course it was an accident.
When a man's as short as you,

1588
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:21,607
it must be very difficult
to gauge the height of the birds.

1589
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,781
- Mr. Meredith.
- Hmm?

1590
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:31,326
You haven't seen Commander Meredith
anywhere, have you?

1591
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:32,577
No.

1592
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:34,871
He never came down stairs
and he's not in his room.

1593
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,914
Mr. Jennings,
I've washed him and dressed him.

1594
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,876
If he can't find his way
to the drawing room, it isn't my fault.

1595
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:52,597
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1596
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:56,559
No, no, no, Please.
I'm just trying some of your jam.

1597
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,771
I must be in your way.

1598
01:45:59,896 --> 01:46:01,981
No, no. No, no. No bother.

1599
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:05,985
What one is that, sir?

1600
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:10,323
Um, it's raspberry.
October '31.

1601
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:14,660
You might like to try
the, um... strawberry one.

1602
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:16,829
Oh, is there strawberry?

1603
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:20,041
Let's see. Ah, yes.

1604
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:24,087
You alright, sir?

1605
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:29,592
Just been with the inspector and...
I feel a little bruised.

1606
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,098
Mmm.

1607
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:44,357
Why is it, would you say,

1608
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:48,319
that some people seem to get
whatever they want in life?

1609
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:51,114
Everything they touch turns to gold.

1610
01:46:52,657 --> 01:46:57,328
Whereas others can strive and strive
and have nothing.

1611
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:02,583
I wonder, do you believe in luck?

1612
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:07,130
Do you think some men
are lucky and...

1613
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:13,177
some men just aren't and...
nothing they can do about it?

1614
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:17,932
I believe in love.
Not just getting it. Giving it.

1615
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:21,686
I think as long as you can love
somebody, whether or not they love you,

1616
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:23,855
then it's worth it and...

1617
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,116
That's a good answer.

1618
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:40,079
Uh, I think I've got to go.
Must have finished dinner by now.

1619
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:44,834
Thank you.

1620
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:49,464
I thought the wine
was frightful tonight. Vile.

1621
01:47:49,589 --> 01:47:52,800
Jennings, old boy,
I'll have a bourbon.

1622
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:57,346
We don't have bourbon.
We have ordinary Scotch or single malt.

1623
01:47:57,472 --> 01:48:00,516
Ordinary for me.
I'm just an American.

1624
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:02,477
Who cares? We know...

1625
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:08,649
I understand this is not an ideal time,
but I would like to see you again.

1626
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,945
Mabel is so clever to travel light.

1627
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:16,616
Why should one wear
a different frock every evening?

1628
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,743
We're not in a fashion parade.

1629
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:22,246
No, and I wouldn't want to be.
Excuse me.

1630
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:24,123
Difficult color, green.

1631
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:27,460
- What did she say?
- Mmm. Very tricky.

1632
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:29,420
- Isobel...
- Excuse me.

1633
01:48:30,546 --> 01:48:32,757
It sort of draws you...

1634
01:48:37,345 --> 01:48:40,431
Oh, how this tune
used to make me cry.

1635
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:53,110
- I promise, I'll pay back every penny...
- Just take it.

1636
01:48:54,028 --> 01:49:00,201
I must say, your guests sleep in much
more comfortable beds than your servants.

1637
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:04,997
Excuse me.

1638
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,292
What did Isobel give to you?

1639
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:10,294
- Don't make a scene here.
- Tell me!

1640
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:15,967
Ivor, dear... would it be possible
to play something a little more cheerful?

1641
01:49:16,092 --> 01:49:18,135
We're all quite emotional enough, as it is.

1642
01:49:21,556 --> 01:49:22,640
Excuse me.

1643
01:49:22,765 --> 01:49:25,268
Freddie, stop all your lies.

1644
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:29,063
If you don't give it to me,
I will scream this house down.

1645
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:31,148
If you don't believe me, try me.

1646
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:32,775
Where've you been?

1647
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,445
You know, you've missed dinner.
We can organize a tray for you.

1648
01:49:39,574 --> 01:49:42,618
Try buying yourself
a new frock with that.

1649
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:47,415
- We gave up, Louisa, dear.
- Oh, right.

1650
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:49,166
I'm so sorry...

1651
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,961
No coffee, George,
but I'll have a... Ah!

1652
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:54,297
I do apologize, sir.
Can't imagine how that happened.

1653
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:56,882
You son of a bitch.
You did that on purpose!

1654
01:49:57,008 --> 01:49:59,844
Shall I fetch you a towel, sir?

1655
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:09,520
Oh!

1656
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,023
- Arthur?
- Oh, dear!

1657
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:16,027
Clean this up, will you?

1658
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:18,654
They were fishin'
parts of her body out the Thames

1659
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:20,281
from Richmond to Rotherhithe.

1660
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:25,411
- More tea, Constable?
- I'll take that. Thank you, Bertha.

1661
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,080
No head. No hands...

1662
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:30,916
What's the point in that?
Won't it all be chucked out?

1663
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,628
I'll know I've left everything
in good order.

1664
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:35,880
That's all I can do for him now.

1665
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:38,132
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, leave him alone.

1666
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:42,428
George has had his revenge
on Mr. Denton. Hot coffee in the lap.

1667
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:45,014
- Oh!
- Poor Mr. Denton.

1668
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:47,475
Constable, I'm glad I caught you.

1669
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,935
I assume the inspector won't keep
everyone beyond tomorrow,

1670
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:51,520
but I thought I'd better check.

1671
01:50:51,646 --> 01:50:53,773
We haven't spoke
to all the servants yet, so...

1672
01:50:53,898 --> 01:50:56,442
There you are, Dexter.
Come on, we're going home.

1673
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:59,195
I was just asking how long
our guests will be staying.

1674
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,907
Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange and
one housemaid is anxious to get away.

1675
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:06,869
There's no need to worry about that.
I'm not interested in the servants.

1676
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:10,039
Only people with a real connection
with the dead man.

1677
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:11,749
I see. Thank you.

1678
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:15,002
- Do you have a light, Inspector?
- Yes.

1679
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:19,423
I think we can let them all go home,
to be honest.

1680
01:51:19,548 --> 01:51:21,509
Got their addresses, after all.

1681
01:51:21,634 --> 01:51:24,595
Constable Dexter will be here
tomorrow morning to confirm that.

1682
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,932
Don't you worry.
It doesn't end here. Oh, no.

1683
01:51:28,057 --> 01:51:30,518
Whoever he is, I'll find him.

1684
01:51:30,643 --> 01:51:32,478
I always do.

1685
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:35,189
Inspector... your matches.

1686
01:51:35,314 --> 01:51:37,149
Yes. Thank you.

1687
01:51:39,652 --> 01:51:42,446
Uh, sir, I think you'll find it's this way.

1688
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:44,657
Well, yes, we could use this one.

1689
01:51:44,782 --> 01:51:49,245
There is, I think, a way out that way,
but, yeah, we'll take your way.

1690
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,010
Oh! Beg your pardon, sir.

1691
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:08,139
Just collecting Mr. Nesbitt's shoes, sir.

1692
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:21,235
I think you'll find these stairs
are the easiest way up, sir.

1693
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,612
- Thank you, uh...
- George, sir.

1694
01:52:23,738 --> 01:52:25,156
George.

1695
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:33,456
You naughty, naughty girl.

1696
01:52:37,042 --> 01:52:40,671
Poor bloke... We were
in the ironing room the other night,

1697
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:43,048
and one of the visiting maids
walked in.

1698
01:52:43,174 --> 01:52:45,551
Must think I did it on purpose.

1699
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:48,053
- You won't tell, will you?
- I won't tell.

1700
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:51,307
But you're lucky you're in the kitchen
and not under Mrs. Wilson.

1701
01:52:51,432 --> 01:52:54,894
She'd have sniffed you out
without any help from me.

1702
01:53:07,156 --> 01:53:09,992
Do you think Sir William
was in love with you?

1703
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:13,078
Nah. I was a bit of fun, that's all.

1704
01:53:15,331 --> 01:53:17,249
And you?

1705
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:21,712
I didn't love him.
I didn't mind him, but...

1706
01:53:23,923 --> 01:53:25,633
I liked the way he'd talk.

1707
01:53:25,758 --> 01:53:29,553
He'd only talk to me because
he was sick of her, but I liked it.

1708
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:34,600
He used to say to me, I could be anything
I wanted as long as I wanted it enough.

1709
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,397
You're not sorry, then?
Even after the way things have turned out?

1710
01:53:40,523 --> 01:53:44,485
Nah, I'm not sorry.
It's time for a change.

1711
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:48,113
Who knows?
Could be the makin' of me.

1712
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:52,034
What did he used to say?
<i>Carpe diem</i>. Seize the day.

1713
01:53:57,832 --> 01:53:59,542
What's up?

1714
01:54:00,251 --> 01:54:02,670
What did I say?
Where are you going?

1715
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:13,222
Who is it?

1716
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:16,809
What are you doing?

1717
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,779
You'd better go back to your room.
You don't want to get caught in here.

1718
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,201
You didn't really dislike him, did you?

1719
01:54:35,536 --> 01:54:37,621
Not really.

1720
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:40,374
At least not enough to kill him.

1721
01:54:48,257 --> 01:54:50,676
You can't have.

1722
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:53,137
You didn't know him.

1723
01:54:53,262 --> 01:54:55,931
You'd have to hate him.
And why would you?

1724
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:01,061
Can't a man hate his own father?

1725
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:11,488
Sir William McCordle...
was my father.

1726
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:18,037
He didn't know it, but he was.

1727
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:23,250
You said you were an orphan.

1728
01:55:23,375 --> 01:55:26,587
No, I didn't. I said I grew up
in an orphanage.

1729
01:55:34,053 --> 01:55:38,098
Not long before I left, we broke into
the warden's office and took out our files.

1730
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:42,019
I found my birth certificate.

1731
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:44,229
Mother's name, father unknown.

1732
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:48,943
Found this photograph.
And they had my admission form.

1733
01:55:49,068 --> 01:55:52,821
I was two days old.
Guess who brought me to the door.

1734
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:56,992
- Robert, that doesn't mean that he...
- Yes, it does.

1735
01:55:58,702 --> 01:56:01,914
After that, I found out
she worked in one of his factories.

1736
01:56:03,874 --> 01:56:05,918
She wasn't the only one, apparently.

1737
01:56:07,962 --> 01:56:10,506
Either the authorities didn't know,
or they didn't want to know.

1738
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:14,510
They took his babies...
and they took his money.

1739
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,472
What happened to your mother?

1740
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:21,892
She died.

1741
01:56:26,230 --> 01:56:29,775
Is that why you took the job
with Lord Stockbridge?

1742
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,027
To get to Sir William?

1743
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:34,697
To poison him?

1744
01:56:34,822 --> 01:56:36,573
I didn't poison him.

1745
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,451
What?

1746
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,578
I didn't poison him.

1747
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:46,583
But then you didn't kill him.

1748
01:56:46,709 --> 01:56:49,378
Did you stab him?

1749
01:56:50,295 --> 01:56:53,090
Even if you did,
he was already dead.

1750
01:56:53,215 --> 01:56:55,217
And whoever did it
must've known that.

1751
01:56:55,342 --> 01:56:57,511
No one could stab a corpse
and not know it.

1752
01:56:57,636 --> 01:57:00,681
Really? When was the last time
you stabbed a corpse?

1753
01:57:04,393 --> 01:57:06,687
You really murdered him, then.

1754
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:10,024
I don't know.

1755
01:57:12,776 --> 01:57:14,611
I don't care.

1756
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:33,047
Ooh.

1757
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:39,762
I've been wanting to do that
ever since I first set eyes on you.

1758
01:58:06,705 --> 01:58:08,040
Oh!

1759
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:13,754
- Mr. Jennings?
- Wilson! Mrs. Wilson. Mrs...

1760
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:22,679
Dorothy. I need your help.

1761
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:25,432
Of course, Mrs. Wilson.
Are you alright?

1762
01:58:27,935 --> 01:58:29,937
- No one must see him like this.
- Oh!

1763
01:58:30,062 --> 01:58:31,480
Help me.

1764
01:58:32,481 --> 01:58:34,358
- Mr. Jennings?
- Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1765
01:58:34,483 --> 01:58:36,610
Come on. Bedtime.

1766
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:40,781
- Alright, bedtime.
- No, this way. Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1767
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:44,159
Bedtime, Mr. Jennings.
Bedtime now. Come on.

1768
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:46,120
Where is...?

1769
01:58:46,787 --> 01:58:50,082
Where is my reference?

1770
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:53,710
You'll get your reference. Into bed now.

1771
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:55,504
- Into bed.
- Aah!

1772
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:57,089
Watch him. Watch him.

1773
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:01,969
Take his trousers off him,
would you, Dorothy?

1774
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:04,596
I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilson.
I couldn't do that.

1775
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:06,974
Take his trousers off. Come on!

1776
01:59:07,099 --> 01:59:09,226
- Come on.
- Dorothy!

1777
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,447
Who is it?

1778
01:59:22,573 --> 01:59:25,200
- Oh, I'm ever so sorry, sir.
- Sorry for what?

1779
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:27,911
I'm supposed to get the fire lit
without waking you.

1780
01:59:28,036 --> 01:59:31,582
Why does everyone treat me
as if I were one of these stupid snobs?

1781
01:59:31,707 --> 01:59:34,376
I spent half the week
downstairs with all of you.

1782
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:37,337
You can't be on both teams
at once, sir.

1783
01:59:41,133 --> 01:59:43,010
It's official.
They're off after breakfast.

1784
01:59:43,135 --> 01:59:45,804
Thank God for that. What about him?

1785
01:59:45,929 --> 01:59:48,765
He's going too,
as soon as he's seen Mr. Jennings.

1786
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:52,436
Are you alright, Mrs. Croft?
you sound a bit funny.

1787
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:55,063
Oh, just too many fags, that's all.

1788
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:58,025
They'll be the death of me.
Here, you finish it.

1789
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:02,029
- Did you tell the police any of that stuff?
- I did not.

1790
02:00:02,154 --> 02:00:07,034
Sorry if I shock you, but the plain fact
is, he only got what he deserved.

1791
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:08,994
There, I've said it.

1792
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:14,708
I can't stop thinkin' about those girls.
The ones that got, you know...

1793
02:00:14,833 --> 02:00:17,669
I'm not surprised,
the way you carry on.

1794
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:20,255
Just see it never happens to you,
that's all.

1795
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:24,301
It won't... And even if it did,
I know I couldn't part with my baby,

1796
02:00:24,426 --> 02:00:26,303
not just to hang on to a job.

1797
02:00:26,428 --> 02:00:28,430
I'm very glad to hear it.

1798
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:30,599
Who is it?

1799
02:00:31,683 --> 02:00:34,102
No, don't mind me, Mr. Jennings.

1800
02:00:34,228 --> 02:00:36,772
Inspector Thompson's just asked me
to take one last look round.

1801
02:00:36,897 --> 02:00:38,398
Is the inspector with you?

1802
02:00:38,523 --> 02:00:41,151
No, we're working
from the station from now on.

1803
02:00:41,276 --> 02:00:44,154
See if we can't manage things
better from there.

1804
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:47,991
What about the poison?
Have you traced that at least?

1805
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:52,537
Hardly.
This house is a poisoner's paradise.

1806
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,583
We found the stuff
in practically ev...

1807
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:01,713
...every room.

1808
02:01:02,673 --> 02:01:06,176
Unfortunately,
no one's got a police record.

1809
02:01:07,261 --> 02:01:09,471
Well, except you, of course.

1810
02:01:09,596 --> 02:01:11,598
Perhaps the butler did it.

1811
02:01:23,277 --> 02:01:26,488
I had a brother who was
a conscientious objector.

1812
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:29,825
He did a bit of time too.

1813
02:01:31,743 --> 02:01:36,039
Did they know upstairs you refused
to fight and were sent to prison?

1814
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,752
I'd forget about it if I were you.

1815
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:43,588
Not everyone's cut out
to be a soldier.

1816
02:02:07,446 --> 02:02:10,699
- Did you remember the other boxes?
- Everything's in the car, milady.

1817
02:02:10,824 --> 02:02:12,492
Wonderful. Good.

1818
02:02:12,617 --> 02:02:14,703
Darling, here I come.

1819
02:02:14,828 --> 02:02:17,998
Do you know?
I can't wait to leave this place.

1820
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:20,625
Christ, what are we supposed
to do now?

1821
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:25,130
Freddie, do try to stop being
so frightened all the time.

1822
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:27,924
Darling, have I made
the most terrible fool of myself?

1823
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:30,677
- Maybe.
- Anthony, erm...

1824
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:33,347
- Just, erm...
- Oh, God.

1825
02:02:33,472 --> 02:02:37,476
I wanted to remind you of the conversation
we had at dinner the other night.

1826
02:02:37,601 --> 02:02:40,062
Perhaps this is not the most
appropriate moment,

1827
02:02:40,187 --> 02:02:45,567
but when you get to the Sudan
you'll need an expert, and I'm your man.

1828
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:47,736
- ...finds out I haven't been signed up.
- I want to know...

1829
02:02:47,861 --> 02:02:49,696
- Did you ask her?
- No, I didn't.

1830
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:51,698
I think, on reflection,
that's a good thing.

1831
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:53,533
According to the servants' hall gossip,

1832
02:02:53,658 --> 02:02:57,079
she won't get any of her estate
till her mother dies.

1833
02:02:57,204 --> 02:03:01,917
If that's the case, it's too long
for you to wait. You can do better.

1834
02:03:05,379 --> 02:03:07,964
Have you checked your room?

1835
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:10,509
You mustn't leave anything behind.

1836
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:12,886
I'm sure Mummy's
going to sell the house.

1837
02:03:13,011 --> 02:03:15,764
Isobel. Isobel. Isobel!

1838
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,810
Sidney Kent's taking over the studio.

1839
02:03:19,935 --> 02:03:23,021
He loves Charlie Chan
and he hates Winfield Sheehan.

1840
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:25,774
No more rewrites,
and I can cast whoever I like.

1841
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:29,820
- Well, that was painless, wasn't it?
- No, it wasn't.

1842
02:03:29,945 --> 02:03:31,905
Not for me, anyway.

1843
02:03:33,365 --> 02:03:35,700
Careful, careful. Watch yourself!

1844
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:45,585
- Do they know?
- No.

1845
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:49,589
- Don't you think they might notice?
- I don't care.

1846
02:03:49,714 --> 02:03:52,008
Hey, you there.
Where you going?

1847
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:56,721
- The station.
- Hey, you want a ride to London?

1848
02:03:59,975 --> 02:04:01,726
Sure. Why not?

1849
02:04:03,186 --> 02:04:05,063
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1850
02:04:09,192 --> 02:04:10,986
There you go.

1851
02:04:11,111 --> 02:04:14,531
Well, good luck.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1852
02:04:14,656 --> 02:04:17,868
At least I know that gives me
room for maneuver.

1853
02:04:21,163 --> 02:04:23,832
No, keep your hands to yourself.

1854
02:04:23,957 --> 02:04:26,710
You Brits really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

1855
02:04:26,835 --> 02:04:28,712
We do if something's funny, sir.

1856
02:04:28,837 --> 02:04:31,423
- Mr. Jennings, can I...?
- Be quick about it.

1857
02:04:31,548 --> 02:04:33,842
Honestly, it's getting so expensive,

1858
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:37,262
by the time one does Jennings
and leave something for the housemaids,

1859
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:41,099
one might as well have taken
a suite at the Ritz.

1860
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:43,518
Tell me, what happened
to William's little maid?

1861
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,854
I never saw her again after that dinner.

1862
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,481
- Elsie?
- Mmm.

1863
02:04:47,606 --> 02:04:50,066
- She's gone.
- Oh. Pity, really.

1864
02:04:50,192 --> 02:04:52,611
I'd have thought it was a good idea
to have someone in the house

1865
02:04:52,736 --> 02:04:54,946
who's actually sorry he's dead.

1866
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,450
Oh, there you are, dear.
Did you have a nice ride?

1867
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:01,036
I'm feeling rather guilty.
Apparently everyone's gone.

1868
02:05:01,161 --> 02:05:02,913
Apart from you and Louisa.

1869
02:05:03,038 --> 02:05:08,168
- Why don't you stay for lunch?
- No, best be off. Leave you in peace.

1870
02:05:09,294 --> 02:05:14,257
Now, you will telephone
about the funeral plans, hmm?

1871
02:05:14,382 --> 02:05:18,011
- You don't have to come if it's a bore.
- Nonsense. Of course I'm coming.

1872
02:05:18,136 --> 02:05:20,722
Have you decided what
you're going to do about this place?

1873
02:05:20,847 --> 02:05:24,017
- Oh, I don't know.
- Will you keep it?

1874
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:27,354
It's so difficult.

1875
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:30,899
I mean, does one really want
the bother nowadays?

1876
02:05:32,192 --> 02:05:35,028
Oh, I suppose I could shut it up

1877
02:05:35,153 --> 02:05:38,448
and make a decision
when my head stops spinning.

1878
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,534
Mrs. Wilson could manage
till you're ready.

1879
02:05:40,659 --> 02:05:44,412
Oh, yes, she could manage, alright.
Let's not worry about that.

1880
02:05:44,538 --> 02:05:48,166
No doubt she'll seize the opportunity
to get rid of the wretched Mrs. Croft.

1881
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:51,962
- Why are those two such enemies?
- I don't know.

1882
02:05:52,087 --> 02:05:55,340
Something to do with when they were both
workers in one of William's sweatshops.

1883
02:05:55,465 --> 02:05:58,093
Mrs. Croft was the senior then.
She was the cook.

1884
02:05:58,218 --> 02:06:01,263
And Mrs. Wilson,
a lowly factory worker.

1885
02:06:01,388 --> 02:06:04,766
Now that she's got up in the world,
poor old Croftie can't abide it.

1886
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:06,351
The usual rubbish.

1887
02:06:06,476 --> 02:06:09,729
Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?
I can't imagine it.

1888
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:11,690
Nor could I.

1889
02:06:11,815 --> 02:06:14,776
Although, funnily enough,
I think there must've been.

1890
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:17,237
Really? You amaze me.

1891
02:06:17,362 --> 02:06:19,155
She might've changed her name,

1892
02:06:19,281 --> 02:06:21,157
but when she was working
with William,

1893
02:06:21,283 --> 02:06:23,118
she was called something
quite different...

1894
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:27,789
Parks or Parker or Parkinson,
or something like that.

1895
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:32,627
Come in.

1896
02:06:35,755 --> 02:06:38,341
- You're busy.
- No, just checking the linen rotation.

1897
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:41,344
If I'd have left it to the maids,
the same twenty sheets would be used

1898
02:06:41,469 --> 02:06:43,471
till they fell into rags.

1899
02:06:53,148 --> 02:06:55,150
Why did you do it?

1900
02:07:02,282 --> 02:07:04,784
How did you know it was him?

1901
02:07:04,909 --> 02:07:08,163
Was it the name, or did you see
the photograph in his room?

1902
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,956
Ah, yes, the photograph.

1903
02:07:11,333 --> 02:07:15,337
It's a miracle that survived. I remember
his mother putting it into his blanket.

1904
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:18,465
I suppose she wanted him
to have something of hers.

1905
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,967
Does he know what happened to her?

1906
02:07:21,843 --> 02:07:25,639
They said she died
just after he was born.

1907
02:07:25,764 --> 02:07:28,391
Well, she didn't die.
She gave him away.

1908
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:35,273
He promised the boy would be adopted.
He said he knew the family.

1909
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:39,944
Turns out we all clung to that dream,
all us girls.

1910
02:07:40,070 --> 02:07:42,739
A better start in life for our children.

1911
02:07:43,948 --> 02:07:46,743
And all the time, he was dumping them,
his own children,

1912
02:07:46,868 --> 02:07:48,828
in some godforsaken place.

1913
02:07:50,205 --> 02:07:54,542
And I believed him.
I suppose it was easier that way.

1914
02:07:54,668 --> 02:07:57,337
My sister certainly
never forgave me for it.

1915
02:07:58,755 --> 02:08:00,173
Your sister?

1916
02:08:00,298 --> 02:08:02,842
Yes, Mrs. Croft. She's my sister.
Didn't you know?

1917
02:08:02,967 --> 02:08:04,719
She kept hers, you see.

1918
02:08:04,844 --> 02:08:09,182
It was very hard for her. She lost her job,
and then the baby died anyway.

1919
02:08:09,307 --> 02:08:11,142
Scarlet fever.

1920
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:15,814
I made him take her back.
She never forgave me for that either.

1921
02:08:15,939 --> 02:08:18,566
But even if Robert is your son,

1922
02:08:18,692 --> 02:08:22,904
how did you know that
he meant to harm his father?

1923
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:27,992
What gift do you think a good servant has
that separates them from the others?

1924
02:08:28,118 --> 02:08:30,412
It's the gift of anticipation.

1925
02:08:31,371 --> 02:08:34,040
And I'm a good servant.
I'm better than good, I'm the best.

1926
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,000
I'm the perfect servant.

1927
02:08:36,126 --> 02:08:38,211
I know when they'll be hungry,
and the food is ready.

1928
02:08:38,336 --> 02:08:41,256
I know when they'll be tired,
and the bed is turned down.

1929
02:08:41,381 --> 02:08:44,008
I know it
before they know it themselves.

1930
02:08:47,971 --> 02:08:50,098
Are you going to tell him?

1931
02:08:51,766 --> 02:08:55,562
Why? What purpose
would it possibly serve?

1932
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:02,026
What if they find out what happened?

1933
02:09:02,152 --> 02:09:05,363
Not much of a crime
to stab a dead man, is it?

1934
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:09,242
They can never touch him.
That's what's important, his life.

1935
02:09:10,994 --> 02:09:13,079
And your life?

1936
02:09:14,456 --> 02:09:18,293
Didn't you hear me?
I'm the perfect servant, I have no life.

1937
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:27,343
- Her Ladyship's leaving now, Miss.
- Thank you, George.

1938
02:09:31,848 --> 02:09:34,601
Well, you should go now,
Miss Trentham.

1939
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:53,953
- Here you are, Jennings.
- Goodbye, Sylvia.

1940
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:55,163
Thank you.

1941
02:09:55,288 --> 02:09:59,250
Do let us know if there's anything
that we can do to help.

1942
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:00,877
Are you going away?

1943
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:03,129
No, not once
the shooting's finished.

1944
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:06,674
- Thank you for your help last night.
- You don't have to thank me.

1945
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,886
You know I'd kill for Mr. Jennings
if I had to.

1946
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:38,498
Don't cry, Jane. They'll hear you.

1947
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:44,587
Come on.

1948
02:10:46,381 --> 02:10:50,593
You did what you felt
was best for him at the time.

1949
02:10:50,718 --> 02:10:52,720
I see that now.

1950
02:10:54,597 --> 02:10:56,015
Lizzie...

1951
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,685
I've lost him.

1952
02:10:59,853 --> 02:11:02,772
I've lost him.
He'll never know me now.

1953
02:11:04,065 --> 02:11:05,608
Oh, my boy!

1954
02:11:05,733 --> 02:11:08,778
Well, at least your boy's alive.

1955
02:11:10,321 --> 02:11:12,156
He's alive.

1956
02:11:13,116 --> 02:11:15,118
That's what matters.

1957
02:11:31,175 --> 02:11:33,177
So, you're leaving.

1958
02:11:33,303 --> 02:11:34,721
Yes.

1959
02:11:37,849 --> 02:11:39,267
Goodbye, then.

1960
02:11:41,477 --> 02:11:42,896
Goodbye.

1961
02:11:43,021 --> 02:11:44,856
Parks...

1962
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:50,278
- Get in, Bennett.
- Chin up, chin up.

1963
02:11:53,406 --> 02:11:58,328
Heavens! What a relief to be going.
It'll take me a month to recover.

1964
02:11:58,453 --> 02:12:00,788
Oh, Mary, dear,

1965
02:12:00,914 --> 02:12:05,376
do you think if there's a trial,
I might have to testify in court?

1966
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:07,295
Or you?

1967
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:09,422
I can't think of anything worse.

1968
02:12:09,547 --> 02:12:14,636
Imagine a person being hanged
because of something one said in court.

1969
02:12:15,345 --> 02:12:19,724
I know. And what purpose
could it possibly serve anyway?

1970
02:12:27,607 --> 02:12:29,525
Goodbye!
