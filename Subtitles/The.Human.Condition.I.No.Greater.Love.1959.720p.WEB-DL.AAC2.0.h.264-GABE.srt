SOUTHERN GATE OF PEACE

31
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,746
This isn't like you.

32
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:27,085
- Why?
- You're running away.

33
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:46,912
Don't you want me?

34
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,543
Of course I do.

35
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:54,051
And I want you too.
Yet we can't marry -

36
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:55,949
How many times
must I explain?

37
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:58,647
Because you might be
called up?

38
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:04,256
I wouldn't care
if it was the day after.

39
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,599
Of course I'd cry.

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,830
I'd cry bitterly.

41
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:16,833
But happiness only lies
in marrying the one you love.

42
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,776
All right.

43
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:24,148
I'll take you back
to my dormitory.

44
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,352
You'll stay with me tonight.

45
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,311
All right?

46
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:35,088
Yes... I'll go.

47
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,628
No, you better go back
to your own dormitory.

48
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,874
I can't take you to mine.

49
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,538
You were just testing me.
You shouldn't have done that.

50
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,817
You're a coward
and a weakling!

51
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,988
Now I see that!

52
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,067
SOUTH MANCHURIA STEEL CO.

53
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:23,242
RESEARCH DEPARTMENT

54
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:37,680
Hey.

55
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,721
Well, what a surprise.

56
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:43,485
I came to say good-bye,
as sentimental as that may sound.

57
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:45,391
You got called up?

58
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,692
When do you leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:54,566
The papers came five days ago.
I've been drinking ever since.

60
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:59,910
Oh, yes.
I ran into Michiko last night.

61
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:03,974
Aren't you going to marry her?

62
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:08,218
It's you today.
Tomorrow it could be me.

63
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,219
Being called up
isn't a death sentence.

64
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,616
I'm a born optimist.

65
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:18,194
Unlike you, I've had
my share of earthly pleasures.

66
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:21,165
My only regret

67
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:27,499
is not having left the seed of life
in the womb of a woman I love.

68
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,236
I'll probably regret it too,

69
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:34,435
but I can't be
as optimistic as you.

70
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:38,879
The manager wants me.
Wait for me inside.

71
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,213
No, I'll see you tonight.

72
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,988
Tonight? All right.

73
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,091
Kaji looked a bit angry.

74
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,230
Is anything wrong?

75
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:31,027
Are you going to be
platonic friends forever?

76
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:35,738
You had the spunk to come
out here to Manchuria alone.

77
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:38,435
Throw yourself at him!

78
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:42,611
I did.

79
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,017
He rejected you?

80
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:48,187
No. 12 and 13,
stop your chatter...

81
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,188
or I'll report you.

82
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,189
THE SUPERVISION
OF COLONIAL LABOR

83
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,191
I read it twice.

84
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,296
Very interesting,

85
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:01,899
though it does smell
of leftist tendencies.

86
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:05,034
What are you trying to say?

87
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:10,170
That men should be treated as men -
I suppose that's the gist.

88
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,706
But in colonial territories it's -
- A challenge?

89
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:13,708
Yes, sir.

90
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:19,681
We profit by exploiting
Chinese labor - isn't that the idea?

91
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:20,944
That's right.

92
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:24,180
And that goes
against your thesis.

93
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,021
Yes, it does.

94
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,219
Mind if I take a cigarette?
- Help yourself.

95
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:37,233
So how about it?

96
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:41,999
Without that contradiction,
there'd be nothing to write about.

97
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,404
So it contradicts your thesis,

98
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:50,071
but there are still ways
to improve performance,

99
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,773
is that it?

100
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,888
Yes, perhaps there are.

101
00:08:56,489 --> 00:09:02,257
Listen, I want you to take over
at the Loh Hu Liong mines.

102
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:07,699
Any objections to being sent off
to the hinterlands?

103
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:12,170
I'm not trying to force you.

104
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,435
You've analyzed the local
situation quite well on paper.

105
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:21,010
Would you want it
to end up only on paper?

106
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:22,772
No.

107
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:30,352
When you're ready to put
your theories into practice,

108
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:34,750
I'll help you get
a fair chance

109
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:38,692
at exemption
from military service.

110
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:41,928
An exemption
from military service?

111
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:45,126
You're not the only one
to get an exemption.

112
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:47,372
There are dozens of others.

113
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,973
But it's the idea
of accepting an exemption

114
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,140
in exchange
for the Loh Hu Liong job.

115
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:03,578
You always complicate things.
It's a bad habit.

116
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:10,992
The war is escalating,
and there's only one way to oppose it:

117
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:14,991
A life sentence in prison.

118
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:24,065
Neither you nor I have
the courage for that. Am I right?

119
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,844
Yes... you're right.

120
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,331
I humbly accept your kind gift.

121
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:54,833
Not even the commander of the
Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me.

122
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:05,583
Take Michiko
and go to Loh Hu Liong.

123
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:09,221
Michiko... his sweetheart?
Is pretty?

124
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:13,188
The most beautiful girl
in the world.

125
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:17,755
But you're the most beautiful
girl in my world.

126
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,165
Listen.

127
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:26,362
So you think you'd just be
a shepherd's dog.

128
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,440
What's wrong with that?

129
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,372
A good dog can lead the sheep
to greener pastures

130
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,810
and earn their gratitude.

131
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,279
If such things are possible.

132
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:43,681
As for me,
I'll take this one.

133
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:51,963
My little Manon,
your hair smells like dried grass.

134
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,832
Michiko-san!

135
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,098
Kageyama-san, take care.

136
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:37,434
Michiko-san, go with Kaji
to Loh Hu Liong.

137
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,873
Let this damn war
go to the dogs.

138
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,105
If you let happiness
slip through your fingers...

139
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,857
He may never return.

140
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,958
I won't be called up.

141
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:17,474
Loh Hu Liong
is a tiny Manchurian village.

142
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:22,983
All we'll find there are iron ore
and labor camps.

143
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,023
Would you go with me
to a place like that?

144
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,997
I'd follow you anywhere.

145
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,927
This will affect your whole life.

146
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,570
Think it over carefully.

147
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,112
Even if you were called up...

148
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:54,984
I'd still want
to have your child.

149
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,721
Is that crazy?

150
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:54,675
What a honeymoon!

151
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,776
What did you say?

152
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:59,314
It's all this wind and dust.

153
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,419
I don't care! It's wonderful!

154
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,690
It feels like gravel
in my mouth.

155
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,034
LOH HU LIONG

156
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:24,575
Step up.

157
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:28,572
All right.

158
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,553
Bastard!

159
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,258
Why, you!
Think I'm blind?

160
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,434
Trick me into giving you
special rations?

161
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:52,929
Oh no, you don't!

162
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:55,373
Come here.

163
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,247
- Kaji from the head office?
- Yes.

164
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:14,124
I'm Okishima.
We'll be working together.

165
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:16,419
We can dispense
with the formalities.

166
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,868
What ever made you
come out to the boonies?

167
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,673
Following Kaji-san
through thick and thin?

168
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:32,838
Nice to meet you.

169
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,569
This way.

170
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:39,607
Hey, take their bags
to their new quarters.

171
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,795
I read your report on the supervision
of colonial labor.

172
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,797
Lots of fancy words.

173
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,662
Please, ma'am.

174
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:03,839
The men here are plain speakers.
You'll be fundamentally incompatible.

175
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,937
- Thanks for the advice.
- What's so funny?

176
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:11,913
Sorry, but your own fancy words
sound out of place.

177
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:17,847
Anyway, it's very well-written.
Touches the core of the matter.

178
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,591
Touches...
but doesn't quite grasp it.

179
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,186
Why?

180
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:26,159
If I knew, I'd write it myself.

181
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,063
I'll show your wife around.
You go see the boss.

182
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,864
Furuya, show him the way.

183
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:39,943
I know this is
nothing new, sir,

184
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,842
but our first shift
requested 2,500 men.

185
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,415
Only 1,500 turned up
this morning.

186
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:51,282
We can never meet
our production goal that way.

187
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:57,358
We're at war, Okazaki.
We must expect such shortages.

188
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,033
You can't do your work
unless all conditions are perfect?

189
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:06,932
I didn't mean that,
but if Labor would do something -

190
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,699
MEETING IN PROGRESS

191
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,043
I'm Kaji. I just arrived.

192
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,413
So you're Kaji?

193
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,552
I'll introduce you.

194
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,687
Mr. Higuchi,
supervisor of Pit No. 2.

195
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:32,190
His foreman, Mr. Kawashima.

196
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:34,923
Mr. Koike,
supervisor of Pit No. 1.

197
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,101
And his foreman, Mr. Okazaki.

198
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:44,269
The head office sent Mr. Kaji here
as labor supervisor.

199
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,103
Pleased to meet you.

200
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:50,748
You're just in time.
Please sit down.

201
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:56,551
We're discussing labor problems.
Any good ideas?

202
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,853
I'd like to speak
with Mr. Okishima first...

203
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,794
and find out how many men
are available.

204
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,233
If labor conditions
are improved,

205
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:16,135
all available men
will report for work.

206
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:20,902
And in more concrete terms?

207
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:25,848
Our employment system
must be radically revised.

208
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:31,314
The labor boss must be replaced
by a direct employment system.

209
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,118
Ridiculous!
You'd be throttling the mines.

210
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,425
Right, Kawashima?

211
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,557
Why is that?

212
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,960
Because -

213
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:45,537
Kaji's the name, right?
Think about it.

214
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:48,604
We have
200 labor groups here.

215
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:54,109
You think a single one
has no system of skimming

216
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:56,304
or doesn't cheat
on food rations?

217
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:57,607
I doubt it,

218
00:19:57,816 --> 00:20:01,115
but the matter under discussion

219
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,017
is how to improve
the work attendance rate.

220
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:08,185
Laborers lose the desire to work

221
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:11,851
because labor conditions
are basically no good.

222
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:15,066
Regardless of
how things are "basically,"

223
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:20,534
workers aren't what
you make them out to be in theory.

224
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,907
They squander any surplus
in idleness or gambling

225
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,273
or pour it
into women's crotches.

226
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,607
We have a difference of opinion.

227
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:33,649
Mistreating the men
won't yield good results.

228
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,747
You know, Kaji,

229
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:41,289
theory may be correct
and yet not always apply in reality.

230
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:45,327
Then either
the theory was wrong

231
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,726
or it was incorrectly applied.

232
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,231
Never mind.
Do what you think is right.

233
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:55,039
I respect revolutionary ideas.

234
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,670
Now, your work here
won't just be a desk job.

235
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,438
It will cover all aspects
of the men's lives.

236
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:07,950
Rationing food, disposing
of excrement from 10,000 men,

237
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:11,680
handling menstrual cases
among the women.

238
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,255
The women?

239
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,155
We have comfort quarters
for our men.

240
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:21,958
Okishima will show you.
There are about 60 Manchu women.

241
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:25,096
Starting today,
you're their boss.

242
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,370
I'm relieved
you're not a bachelor.

243
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:34,704
Go home now and do your duty
by your wife -

244
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:37,541
but don't overdo it, eh?

245
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,890
But why must our group
be disbanded?

246
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:53,463
Poor yields.
You've been raking off too much.

247
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:57,123
Are you kidding?
What's this all about?

248
00:21:57,336 --> 00:22:00,635
Shall I show you the evidence?

249
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:06,975
Why should the company make trouble
over our contracts with the men?

250
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,841
The company's money
is meant for the workers.

251
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:14,610
But Mr. Okazaki says
our men work very hard.

252
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,755
Yes, but your rolls
have been padded.

253
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,548
But Mr. Okazaki -

254
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,988
I'm not Mr. Okazaki!

255
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,900
Mr. Okishima,
put in a good word for us.

256
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:36,631
We've been associates
a long time.

257
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,268
And it's made me moldy.

258
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:46,014
Kaji's been scraping away the mold
until I'm practically raw.

259
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:51,078
Mr. Supervisor,
it's the poor living quarters

260
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,986
and poor food
that make our men sickly.

261
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:55,786
I know.

262
00:22:55,994 --> 00:23:00,897
Bad quarters, poor food.
Men can't work on beans alone.

263
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,763
But there's a still greater evil.

264
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:07,264
You know what that is?

265
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,274
You men.

266
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:14,809
Now get this:
I give the men my word.

267
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:18,549
The food situation
will definitely improve.

268
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,514
Better quarters
will be considered.

269
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:27,284
But it's no use
as long as you exploit them.

270
00:23:28,126 --> 00:23:32,062
You lend money
to transient laborers

271
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:35,233
to bind them for life.

272
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:37,402
And that's not the worst.

273
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:41,629
You try to squeeze even more
from your investment.

274
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,209
You hire slave-drivers to practically
murder those who try to escape.

275
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:48,637
I won't allow such methods.

276
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:51,247
Allow them?
What do you mean?

277
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,079
You're just an employee yourself!
You have no right!

278
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:57,983
Won't allow it, eh?
Try and stop us!

279
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,452
Hey!

280
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:03,116
Any more threats
and I'll kick your nuts in!

281
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:13,632
The gentlemen
seem to be having a bad day.

282
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,170
We'll come back.

283
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:17,069
Mr. Muta.

284
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,773
I'm returning this.

285
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:23,880
Your other gifts have been
returned to your home.

286
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:33,290
Sons of bitches
left too peacefully.

287
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:35,960
They must be up to something.

288
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:48,672
Making a tour of inspection?

289
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:51,104
Much obliged.

290
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,448
Mr. Okishima, please see
that we get the men we need.

291
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,818
I have to face
the old man.

292
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:07,549
You'll get 'em.
Just don't kill 'em off too fast!

293
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:31,680
Son of a bitch!

294
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:38,714
What's going on?

295
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:41,256
The dog refused to work!

296
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,190
Beating him won't help.
They're not horses.

297
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,454
Get up, scum!

298
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:47,791
Beating them
only lowers productivity.

299
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:50,294
I take orders from Okazaki...

300
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:52,595
not you.

301
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:54,971
What goes on here
doesn't concern Labor.

302
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:58,267
- So you'll keep beating them?
- That's right!

303
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:02,445
Fine. Then tomorrow
you'll have no men to beat.

304
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:06,775
What?
You're in the pit now.

305
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:09,112
You can't pull rank
down here.

306
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:12,184
You men don't want to work?

307
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:13,925
Then don't!

308
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:16,891
But you needn't
come back tomorrow.

309
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:21,398
Stay by the cozy fireplace
in your barracks.

310
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:28,333
But remember:
You'll get no food!

311
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:42,414
Just getting home?

312
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,719
You want something?

313
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,318
Just one question.

314
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:53,464
Did you threaten
to shut off our supply of labor?

315
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,393
Well? Say something.

316
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,038
Can we talk about work
in the morning?

317
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:07,137
In the morning?
I can see why you'd prefer that.

318
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:10,439
Can't have your loving wife
seeing your weaknesses.

319
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:12,981
- Do I have any?
- Answer my question!

320
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:15,414
What have you got
to be so proud of?

321
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:22,024
You may brutally beat
your laborers,

322
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:25,890
but it doesn't mean
others will be intimidated.

323
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:28,028
I just warned your assistant.

324
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:33,136
Mr. Kaji, you know how
important that ore is to us.

325
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:36,569
What's wrong
with slapping a cheek or two

326
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:41,109
if it keeps the ore coming out
and helps the war effort?

327
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:45,778
What's more important:
The ore or the workers?

328
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,709
I don't think
in those terms.

329
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:53,322
It's ridiculous
to compare men with ore.

330
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:58,990
Take care of your men
and the ore will come out.

331
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,389
Let me make it very clear

332
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:06,867
that Okazaki of Loh Hu Liong
won't be changed

333
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:10,599
by any of
your half-baked theories.

334
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:14,701
I'll stick to my own ways.
Remember that.

335
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:18,349
I will. And I'll stick
to my ways too.

336
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:21,374
Son of a...

337
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:33,123
<i>KENPEITAI - MILITARY POLICE</i>

338
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:36,763
<i>These gentlemen
from the Kenpeitai</i>

339
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:40,995
are offering us 600 special
laborers to achieve our goals.

340
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:43,470
Special laborers?

341
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:48,806
War prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed.

342
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:53,144
With the labor shortages,
it's a heaven-sent blessing.

343
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:55,080
A stroke of good fortune.

344
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:59,154
Yes! Our head office
will certainly be pleased.

345
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:03,057
Kaji, discuss the matter
with Okishima.

346
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,626
Discuss what exactly?

347
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,024
I'll tell you what.

348
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:12,362
I never repeat my instructions.
Got that?

349
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:19,540
First: Special laborers must not
mingle with ordinary laborers.

350
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:25,473
Second: Their quarters
must be enclosed by barbed wire...

351
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:28,653
electrified barbed wire.

352
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:30,946
Understand?

353
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,019
You'll handle matters
of food and labor,

354
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:39,060
but they must not escape!

355
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:43,428
What voltage can you supply
for the fence?

356
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,203
About 3,000 volts.

357
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,929
Good enough.

358
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:53,869
The laborers will be delivered
one week from today.

359
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:58,348
The exact time will be
specified later. Understand?

360
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:03,481
We may not be ready
in a week.

361
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,677
What?

362
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,118
You don't seem terribly grateful.

363
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,130
Kaji!

364
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:17,158
Why should civilians
take over POWs -

365
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,628
Make preparations immediately!

366
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,232
Wait!

367
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:25,776
I haven't heard your answer.

368
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:29,444
We understand.
We'll be ready.

369
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,596
It could take an armed platoon
to return safely with these men.

370
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:57,106
I want to be neither aggressive
nor defensive with them.

371
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:59,037
You go on if you want.

372
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,872
Don't waste
your heroism on me.

373
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,242
Someday you'll appreciate me.

374
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:12,718
Chen, how's your mother?

375
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,719
She says she's sick.
She lies in bed all day.

376
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:18,754
Sick, huh?

377
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:21,365
Take good care of her.

378
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:27,498
Mr. Kaji, I have a request.

379
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,236
May I have some flour
from the storeroom?

380
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,371
For your mother?

381
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:44,950
I wish I could help,
but I can't make any exceptions.

382
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,326
Here they come.

383
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,894
Chen, how do you feel
about all this?

384
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:36,931
These are your fellow countrymen
who lived in anti-Japanese areas.

385
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:42,539
Your mother's from Shantung.
Her friends might be among them.

386
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:46,740
My mother raised me

387
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:51,014
not to be anti-Japanese.

388
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,784
In a battle zone,
you'd be killed as a sympathizer.

389
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:17,807
The key!

390
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,149
We don't have it yet.

391
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:36,697
- You in charge from Loh Hu Liong?
- Yes.

392
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,664
- Your name?
- Kaji.

393
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,931
Oh, right.
I never forget a name.

394
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,872
Very well. I hereby transfer
the special laborers to you.

395
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:51,079
Never forget that these men
are prisoners of war.

396
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:56,345
You must deal with them
like a soldier.

397
00:33:56,821 --> 00:34:00,757
Civilian negligence will not be
tolerated. You understand?

398
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,119
I do.

399
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,454
No, you don't!

400
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:08,132
You think your seven men
can handle 600 prisoners?

401
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,927
What if they try to escape?

402
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:14,599
We received no special instructions
about the transfer,

403
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,967
so we anticipated
no special danger.

404
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:21,967
You're a bold one.
How old are you?

405
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:23,981
I'm 28.

406
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,178
You married?

407
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:30,111
May I please have the key?

408
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:51,567
You don't back down.
I like that.

409
00:34:57,382 --> 00:34:59,179
Will you witness the transfer?

410
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:04,747
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm now on leave.

411
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:09,923
You seem to believe
that the army can make mistakes.

412
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:15,156
Don't worry.
When the army says 604, it's 604.

413
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:18,329
Submit a transfer receipt
immediately.

414
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:22,962
Let those who die, die,
but they must not escape!

415
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,407
Filthy bastard!

416
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:17,155
Get up!

417
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:21,865
What a mess to unload on us!

418
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,500
Open the other cars!

419
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:28,470
Out! Everyone out!

420
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:36,309
Hurry up! Everyone out!

421
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,586
Everyone out!

422
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:49,750
Line up! Double file!

423
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,657
Mr. Kaji!

424
00:36:58,369 --> 00:36:59,859
This is bad.

425
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,832
What is it?

426
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,904
Hurry!

427
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,607
Line up quickly!

428
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:25,986
They baked to death.

429
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,755
<i>Help!</i>

430
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:45,543
Don't let them eat
all of a sudden!

431
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,944
Stop them!

432
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:01,692
If you gorge yourselves now,
you'll die!

433
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,515
Kaji!

434
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:23,276
Get back!

435
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:27,157
Don't eat that!

436
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,727
Don't eat that!

437
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,231
Don't eat that!

438
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:43,273
Get back!

439
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,417
You'll all die!

440
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,884
Throw me the whip!

441
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,857
Kaji, the whip!

442
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:35,225
The special laborers
are unfit for work.

443
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:39,752
Please give them a month's rest.
They're half dead.

444
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:47,498
These anti-Japanese elements
should be fed without working?

445
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:52,665
If you'd witnessed the scene,
I'm sure you'd agree, sir.

446
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:57,547
Twelve of them were allowed
to bake to death.

447
00:39:57,748 --> 00:40:02,981
If you want to kill them, stuff them
with raw beans - they'll die for sure!

448
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:04,449
Listen here.

449
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,556
Be careful what you say.

450
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:12,888
What you're saying amounts
to denouncing the military.

451
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:20,001
I'll defer to your opinion
one last time.

452
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:22,263
- One last time?
- That's right.

453
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:24,270
One last time.

454
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:26,204
May I ask why?

455
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,173
You really want to know?

456
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:31,507
You're a man
of strong convictions,

457
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:34,708
but I just got a report
from Furuya.

458
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:40,050
150 men under your supervision
were just snatched away.

459
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:47,430
But I'll overlook
the matter this once.

460
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:56,698
Everyone up!

461
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:04,939
I give you all warning.

462
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:10,684
I know you all want to escape.

463
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,786
But you cannot.

464
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,086
If you even try...

465
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:22,163
you'll meet the same fate
as this dog.

466
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:25,068
Chen, show them.

467
00:41:55,266 --> 00:42:00,067
Tomorrow begins a month
of still higher production goals.

468
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:06,736
The directors have even discussed
replacing all the top men here.

469
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:13,780
I'll accept this disgrace
if we cannot increase production.

470
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:17,818
However, we have not yet
done our utmost.

471
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,456
Until we attain the 20% increase
demanded of us,

472
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:27,688
I will extend the higher
production goal every month.

473
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,802
If there are dissenting
opinions, air them now.

474
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:38,303
In the name of final victory,

475
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:41,774
I refuse to listen
to any excuses hereafter.

476
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:47,680
Mr. Koike,
tell him we'll see it through.

477
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:53,020
I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1
will achieve the new goal.

478
00:42:57,361 --> 00:43:01,764
I'm sure you'll permit me
to use any means necessary.

479
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:04,161
Use all means available.

480
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:06,694
Increased production
is the main thing.

481
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:08,303
Listen here:

482
00:43:08,506 --> 00:43:11,373
Lash them on
with all you've got.

483
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:15,538
If any Chinaman balks,
kill the scum!

484
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:19,942
Push them! Whip them!
We need that extra 20%.

485
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:26,255
Those of you who top your quota
will be amply rewarded.

486
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:30,018
Remember: We're at war here.

487
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:35,622
If anyone feels he can't do this,
let him step forward!

488
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:44,201
Good. I have your word.

489
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:49,243
I'll assume all responsibility.
Don't worry... and do your best!

490
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:54,349
You will start work tomorrow.

491
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:57,751
Your rations will be
sorghum wine and soy pulp,

492
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,747
same as the regular laborers.

493
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:05,222
You don't smoke?

494
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:06,963
I used to.

495
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:08,891
You stopped?

496
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:11,090
When we run out of tobacco,

497
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:13,899
we suffer again.

498
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:18,673
The Japanese
won't keep us supplied.

499
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:21,208
We restored your health,

500
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:24,213
yet you still hate us?

501
00:44:25,282 --> 00:44:27,580
We are not soldiers.

502
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,981
We have the right
to be released.

503
00:44:31,522 --> 00:44:36,391
I don't have the authority
to release you,

504
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,522
only to detain you.

505
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:43,595
Master, when we be free?

506
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:48,761
We all not soldier.
We don't fight.

507
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:54,640
Japan soldiers come...
do bad things to Chinese women.

508
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:58,112
Take away all men... bring here.

509
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,580
Nothing to eat... many die.

510
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,184
Not die... killed.

511
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:12,426
I can't set you free,
but I can promise

512
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,124
that you will not be killed.

513
00:45:16,734 --> 00:45:19,259
The Japanese
say pretty words...

514
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:22,061
and write pretty words...

515
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:26,440
but never keep their promises!

516
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:31,712
Your name was Kao?

517
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:34,281
Remember this:

518
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:38,585
You've been placed
under our supervision.

519
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:48,296
Whether that barbed wire
stays up or not depends on you.

520
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:56,937
Faster!

521
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:00,844
Move it!

522
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:14,056
Step along there!

523
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,221
Come on!

524
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:19,120
Move!

525
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:41,981
You'll be in trouble
if any men escape, won't you?

526
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:46,084
Why should they escape?

527
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:51,292
They used to work
in their own villages.

528
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:54,620
Why would they want
to work here?

529
00:46:55,966 --> 00:47:00,232
Here they have no mother,
no wife, no children.

530
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:13,940
Kaji, why are so many
special laborers left in camp?

531
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:15,875
They're the sick ones.

532
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:21,388
Make sure
they're not just malingerers.

533
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,427
I didn't come to find fault.
I'd like to see their camp.

534
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:29,792
Certainly.

535
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,378
No danger of escape?

536
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:44,479
I don't think so.

537
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,377
We must give them
some incentive to work.

538
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:49,245
I think so too.

539
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,578
What does a man in a cage
dream of most?

540
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,626
Freedom, I suppose.

541
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:59,921
Freedom?
You must be a poet!

542
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:02,026
It's women.

543
00:48:02,232 --> 00:48:05,292
Men dream of women.
Women dream of men.

544
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:08,730
What did you dream of
as a bachelor?

545
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,669
The ways of the empire?
I doubt it.

546
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:15,875
The way to make
caged men work

547
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,809
is to satisfy
70% of their bodily lust.

548
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:20,813
With what women?

549
00:48:21,618 --> 00:48:23,483
It's very simple.

550
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:26,781
You're in charge of the comfort women.
Send them in here.

551
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:29,081
Is that necessary?

552
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:37,227
Do you want a woman?

553
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:44,765
See that?

554
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:48,001
Just the word brings
joy to their hearts.

555
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:53,579
What is a man?
Not poetry or morality.

556
00:48:53,784 --> 00:48:57,880
He's a mass of lust and greed
that absorbs and excretes.

557
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:01,356
I'll ask their leaders' opinion.

558
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:05,323
Who gives you orders?
POWs or me?

559
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,726
I'm more concerned
about escapes than you are.

560
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:10,627
Carry out my orders.

561
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:15,163
Stop loafing!

562
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:17,796
Hurry up!

563
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,244
Hurry up!

564
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:34,816
Son of a bitch!

565
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:46,535
Get up!

566
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,438
You dog!

567
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:54,236
Master!

568
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:56,503
This man sick!
He maybe die.

569
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:00,005
Have mercy... he sick man!

570
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:03,183
Save your whining for Kaji.

571
00:50:03,387 --> 00:50:06,652
I don't care if I kill
a few of you dogs.

572
00:50:26,143 --> 00:50:28,043
Here he comes!

573
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:30,372
Ah, Kaji-san!

574
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,105
No want to see?

575
00:50:42,492 --> 00:50:43,459
Sister Jin!

576
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,024
Mr. Kaji... welcome!

577
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:55,037
Mr. Kaji, wanna have some fun?
I won't charge you.

578
00:50:58,675 --> 00:51:00,370
I'm sorry...

579
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:04,911
but I need 30 girls
for the special laborers.

580
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:06,909
The Labor Office will pay.

581
00:51:07,117 --> 00:51:09,085
They go inside barbed wire?

582
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,818
Just like dogs... sleep together...
everybody watch?

583
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,622
If you don't wish to,
just say so.

584
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,654
You don't, do you?

585
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:21,388
We no have choice.
It's our job.

586
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:24,999
I send 30 girls tomorrow.

587
00:51:25,202 --> 00:51:26,760
Don't be crazy!

588
00:51:28,038 --> 00:51:31,235
We can't work
with everyone watching.

589
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:37,579
Know how many men
are in that compound?

590
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,349
If you don't wish to go.
Then don't.

591
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:44,946
Even if the others go,
I refuse.

592
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:49,581
Think you can get out
of working?

593
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,419
What do you mean?
I was speaking for all of you.

594
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:57,492
You talk real big.

595
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:00,633
If you want to go, then go.

596
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:03,237
Don't act so big!

597
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,674
What about you?

598
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:09,502
Stop arguing.
You don't make the decisions here.

599
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,572
I'll decide what to do.

600
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:20,783
Thirty girls will go tonight.

601
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,891
All right?

602
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:25,857
Yes, please do that.

603
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,944
- What happened?
- The foreman let him have it.

604
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:49,683
- Where?
- Pit No. 3.

605
00:52:49,886 --> 00:52:51,581
Okazaki!

606
00:52:52,122 --> 00:52:54,147
Get him to first aid quickly.

607
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,559
If this is ignored,
supervision will be impossible!

608
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,372
I'll charge Okazaki
with manslaughter.

609
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,334
Come now! Relax!

610
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:16,439
It wasn't wise to use force,

611
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:22,676
but he was only following orders
to increase production.

612
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:26,322
So he actually acted
out of patriotism.

613
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:30,616
Listen here.

614
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:34,687
Okazaki may be a brute,

615
00:53:34,898 --> 00:53:38,493
but his brutality
lets him run that large pit.

616
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:42,001
We need him just like
we need you and Okishima

617
00:53:42,205 --> 00:53:45,174
to keep our 10,000 men in line.

618
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,373
Understand?

619
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:49,909
We're at war.

620
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:55,551
To achieve the greater goal,
we must overlook the small mistakes.

621
00:53:55,952 --> 00:53:57,579
Small mistakes?

622
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:00,518
A human being was murdered!

623
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:04,919
Kaji, I'll tell you just once more:
Calm down!

624
00:54:06,229 --> 00:54:08,823
Think it over.
I'm sure you'll see.

625
00:54:09,032 --> 00:54:13,366
Can we exchange a good,
hard-working Japanese man

626
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,403
for the life
of one mere prisoner?

627
00:54:17,407 --> 00:54:18,897
That's not the point.

628
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:27,545
If you insist on pressing charges,
include me as an accomplice.

629
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:32,278
I'll see that the suit
goes unfavorably for you.

630
00:54:33,256 --> 00:54:35,952
I can do it, you know.

631
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:38,423
You'd dare distort the truth?

632
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:43,022
Sir, will you see
that this never happens again?

633
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:45,601
How should we report it?

634
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:49,096
As an accidental death.

635
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:52,469
Say he fell off a ledge.
It does happen, you know.

636
00:54:52,676 --> 00:54:54,234
Sir!

637
00:54:59,482 --> 00:55:01,575
You think I'll falsify the report?

638
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:03,548
What else can we do?

639
00:55:03,987 --> 00:55:06,455
- Well, I won't!
- Yes, you will!

640
00:55:06,656 --> 00:55:10,057
Then I become
Okazaki's accomplice.

641
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,591
What will you do?

642
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:13,194
I'll get Okazaki!

643
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:17,230
You fool!
Why play the hero?

644
00:55:17,434 --> 00:55:20,403
Fight so hard
and you'll just run out of steam.

645
00:55:20,604 --> 00:55:23,971
You're a fool to ruin
your future with his.

646
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:32,281
Mr. Kaji.

647
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:43,318
One of our men was mistreated.
What became of him?

648
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:46,221
He died.

649
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:49,296
I assume the culprit
was arrested.

650
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:54,364
- He's still working.
- Will there be no trial?

651
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:56,699
I suppose not.

652
00:55:56,906 --> 00:56:01,605
If that's why you're here,
come inside and explain to all of us.

653
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:04,405
No, I came to wait
for some women.

654
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:10,484
You promised not to kill!
You're like all the other Japanese!

655
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:18,351
If you treat me like a murderer
just because I'm Japanese,

656
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:23,330
you'll be losing
the only friend you have.

657
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:25,201
Friend?

658
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:27,229
You don't have to believe me!

659
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:29,437
Wait.

660
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:34,869
Does this man's death
mean others may also die?

661
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:38,304
I won't allow it.

662
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,382
Women!

663
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:42,709
Women!

664
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:55,722
Women!

665
00:57:03,406 --> 00:57:05,966
Open the gate.
Let the women in.

666
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:09,577
Ten girls to a barrack.
Have them out by 10:00.

667
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:23,383
Look! Women!

668
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:26,460
I'm coming!

669
00:57:32,135 --> 00:57:33,397
Women!

670
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:45,113
We're here,
just like I promised.

671
00:58:01,264 --> 00:58:02,993
Why do you send us women?

672
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:09,068
Think as you please.
I'm just obeying orders.

673
00:58:09,506 --> 00:58:13,033
You send whores

674
00:58:13,343 --> 00:58:20,181
to sleep with us like dogs
so we'll work harder?

675
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,215
Is that it?

676
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:25,213
What's that about whores?

677
00:58:26,623 --> 00:58:29,353
I wouldn't talk so big!

678
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:31,724
You wouldn't understand!

679
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:35,754
Oh, I understand.
You're no better off than us.

680
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:37,728
Look at your friends
over there.

681
00:58:40,336 --> 00:58:43,100
Have you no shame?

682
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,237
You think I like coming here?

683
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:49,403
I told him I refused!

684
00:58:53,716 --> 00:58:57,243
Aren't you the same, beaten down
by the Japanese every day?

685
00:58:58,388 --> 00:59:01,414
Then why so cocky?
You love it here so much?

686
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:03,959
I'm sorry.

687
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:11,096
We all suffer
the same misfortune.

688
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:27,172
Welcome home!

689
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,320
You must be tired.

690
00:59:42,565 --> 00:59:44,590
Look at this!

691
00:59:45,101 --> 00:59:48,070
Isn't it wonderful?
Her first egg!

692
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:52,965
She cackled so loud
I thought a dog had gotten inside.

693
00:59:53,176 --> 00:59:56,805
But right there
was this great big egg!

694
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:00,114
What is it?

695
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,509
Are you in a bad mood?

696
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:04,949
No, it's nothing.

697
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:08,853
It's like you hate
coming home.

698
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:10,855
Is something wrong?

699
01:00:12,896 --> 01:00:14,830
Why won't you
tell me about it?

700
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:19,467
Would you want a husband
who runs a whorehouse?

701
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,897
What does that mean?

702
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:25,503
You'd vomit if I told you!

703
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:31,044
What happens to 30 women
in a camp of 600 men?

704
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:36,411
And now I'm
an accomplice to murder too.

705
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:39,987
That can't be.

706
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,259
The workers
don't believe a word I say.

707
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:51,092
With time
you'll gain their trust.

708
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:53,667
Could you just be quiet
for a while?

709
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,573
It's a shame.

710
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:03,102
What is?

711
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:07,381
Since those prisoners came,
you seem so far away.

712
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:11,109
I guess I do.

713
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:16,017
I hate feeling
like I'm fighting a Ione battle.

714
01:01:17,393 --> 01:01:21,955
You leave early
every morning

715
01:01:22,565 --> 01:01:24,999
and return late at night.

716
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:27,801
During that time, you work.

717
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:32,366
Meanwhile,
I clean the house,

718
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:36,978
putter around the kitchen,
and do the shopping...

719
01:01:39,315 --> 01:01:41,681
but it's like doing nothing.

720
01:01:43,586 --> 01:01:47,647
Still I try to convince myself
that the little things I do

721
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:51,520
help keep you going.

722
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:57,661
Otherwise, there's no difference
between a housewife and a housekeeper.

723
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,063
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

724
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:07,003
I'll letting my work
get the best of me.

725
01:02:08,244 --> 01:02:10,303
Let's stop worrying about it...

726
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,343
just for now.

727
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,058
It was nice talking to you.

728
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,791
Locked up in here,

729
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:29,294
we lose touch
with the outside world.

730
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:31,261
Thank you.

731
01:02:31,601 --> 01:02:35,435
Don't you want to have a good time?
I came here for business.

732
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:40,138
I'm sorry to take your time.

733
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:43,176
I just wanted to talk.

734
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:46,279
You plan to escape,
don't you?

735
01:02:49,018 --> 01:02:52,784
It's impossible
with all that barbed wire.

736
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,586
It's charged with electricity,
that's all.

737
01:02:57,226 --> 01:03:00,525
It's men who run
the electricity through it.

738
01:03:01,297 --> 01:03:04,755
Don't talk like that.
Human beings are weak creatures.

739
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:07,562
Go where you're told to go.

740
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:09,762
Do what you're told to do.

741
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:13,767
That's the only way to survive.

742
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:15,809
You're wrong.

743
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:19,842
Man can become
as strong as he wishes.

744
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:23,542
He need only find
the cause of his unhappiness.

745
01:03:49,245 --> 01:03:51,338
Want to make
some easy money?

746
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,781
You mean selling
my girls elsewhere?

747
01:03:55,485 --> 01:03:57,453
I don't go
for that kind of deal.

748
01:03:57,653 --> 01:03:59,518
This isn't about women.

749
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:01,519
Laborers?

750
01:04:01,724 --> 01:04:04,454
I have something else
in mind this time.

751
01:04:05,328 --> 01:04:07,626
You mean
behind the barbed wire?

752
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:10,825
Too dangerous.

753
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:15,629
If anything goes wrong,
it's my neck.

754
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,240
It's not like the others.
Escaped prisoners mean big profit.

755
01:04:21,711 --> 01:04:25,909
Help make arrangements
and I'll split it with you.

756
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:27,978
It's easy money.

757
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:31,714
What kind of arrangements?

758
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:36,682
The easiest way... is like this.

759
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:42,894
You just flick off
the electric switch.

760
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,060
Did someone
put you up to this?

761
01:04:48,037 --> 01:04:52,736
My buddy Muta, the Japanese
assistant who was just fired.

762
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:57,375
How sad,
selling men like that.

763
01:04:59,482 --> 01:05:03,077
Don't expect
any sympathy from me.

764
01:05:04,253 --> 01:05:09,190
I'm just a Korean. The Japanese
and Chinese both look down on me.

765
01:05:35,418 --> 01:05:37,181
Hurry it up!

766
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,427
Mr. Wang!

767
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:51,190
I just heard the Japanese say
that the Italians have surrendered.

768
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:54,960
Defeat for Germany
can't be far off.

769
01:05:55,238 --> 01:05:58,207
Our time is coming.

770
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,433
When?

771
01:06:01,143 --> 01:06:03,008
Six months, maybe a year.

772
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:06,381
We must be patient.

773
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:08,140
What's going on there?

774
01:06:11,787 --> 01:06:13,186
You scum!

775
01:06:22,832 --> 01:06:24,390
Thank you.

776
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,094
This'll really invigorate my man
and the young folk.

777
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:33,101
If Okazaki gets
any more invigorated, ma'am,

778
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:35,277
you'll be in trouble.

779
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:37,776
Didn't you know?

780
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,471
We women prefer
our men that way.

781
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:50,223
Ma'am, I'm sure
you've seen to everything,

782
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:53,418
but it might be wise to send
some of that flour to Kaji's wife.

783
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:57,725
A very good idea!
I'll do just that.

784
01:06:59,235 --> 01:07:00,532
Your food.

785
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:03,571
<i>Good day, sir.</i>

786
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:13,280
Ah, it's you.

787
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:17,085
You want dumplings?

788
01:07:18,654 --> 01:07:22,112
Can you loan me
a bag of white flour?

789
01:07:23,492 --> 01:07:27,792
I'd like to make my mother happy.
She hasn't long to live.

790
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,219
One bag?

791
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:32,798
Why don't you go
get some yourself?

792
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:37,864
The Japanese steal the flour
they ration to us...

793
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:42,308
and eat their fill.

794
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:44,112
I can't do that.

795
01:07:44,347 --> 01:07:46,907
But Mr. Kaji trusts you.

796
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:51,178
This flour was stolen
from the warehouse

797
01:07:51,387 --> 01:07:53,378
by the warehouse guard
with the big mole.

798
01:07:54,056 --> 01:07:55,751
It's stolen property.

799
01:07:56,492 --> 01:08:00,451
You still want
to buy some of it?

800
01:08:05,234 --> 01:08:09,500
Let him have half a bag.

801
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:11,467
No, I won't.

802
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:16,177
Young man, don't forget
you were born of a Chinese mother,

803
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:19,472
of Chinese seed.

804
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:26,081
Go ask the man
with the big mole!

805
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:03,184
Try not to be so obvious.

806
01:09:03,392 --> 01:09:04,450
About what?

807
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,925
Okazaki's wife just left here
with a big sack.

808
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:13,695
I hate to interfere,
but you're making a mistake.

809
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:18,997
People around here
appreciate my mistakes.

810
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,869
It's an old custom.

811
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:23,568
Well, it's one
that should be abolished.

812
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:27,408
Unpleasant as it may seem,
that's my job.

813
01:09:27,783 --> 01:09:33,050
If it happens again,
I'll have to order an inventory.

814
01:09:35,724 --> 01:09:37,658
Mr. Kaji...

815
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:42,827
the men in the pits
wonder if you're one of us

816
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:45,296
or just a puppet
of the Chinese.

817
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:47,736
And?

818
01:09:49,171 --> 01:09:51,332
That's all.

819
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:57,137
But I do think your acute sense
of justice is inflamed by the fact

820
01:09:57,346 --> 01:10:01,715
that you can't take
some extra flour to your own wife.

821
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:07,319
Take your filthy feet
off your desk when speaking to me!

822
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:11,126
Or do you need my help?

823
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:33,547
<i>You fool!
They'll see your light!</i>

824
01:10:52,735 --> 01:10:54,635
<i>Go easy tonight.</i>

825
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:02,510
Hurry!
It's the night watchman!

826
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:18,686
What's taking so long?

827
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:25,255
Get going!

828
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:07,872
I like you a lot.

829
01:12:09,678 --> 01:12:14,047
You did very well
for your first time.

830
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:23,348
You'll do it for me,
won't you, Chen?

831
01:12:25,194 --> 01:12:28,186
Talk to Sai
at the power station.

832
01:12:29,098 --> 01:12:33,865
Just have him shut off
the current for three minutes.

833
01:12:35,771 --> 01:12:38,205
I'll see that
you're well-rewarded.

834
01:12:40,242 --> 01:12:44,178
Then you can buy
all the flour you want

835
01:12:45,147 --> 01:12:48,708
without playing the thief.

836
01:12:56,225 --> 01:12:58,625
Still can't make up your mind?

837
01:13:14,677 --> 01:13:16,235
Hey, Big Mole!

838
01:13:24,086 --> 01:13:26,748
Well, Chen, how'd it go?

839
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:29,883
Did you get a good price?

840
01:13:32,027 --> 01:13:33,927
Or did you eat it yourself?

841
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:37,423
Free white flour
must taste good.

842
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,534
What's going on, Matsuda?

843
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,264
What indeed.

844
01:13:45,941 --> 01:13:50,435
Seems even saints
have thieves for underlings.

845
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:52,772
Flour thieves.

846
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:06,358
Mr. Kaji...

847
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:11,933
I'm willing
to overlook it this time.

848
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:19,340
But just for future reference,
I'd like to see how you handle this.

849
01:14:24,947 --> 01:14:27,177
Chen, stand up.

850
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,293
Look at me.

851
01:14:47,836 --> 01:14:50,964
You didn't do it, did you?

852
01:14:57,446 --> 01:14:58,538
I did.

853
01:15:00,616 --> 01:15:02,345
Alone?

854
01:15:08,857 --> 01:15:12,224
Matsuda,
I hope you're satisfied now.

855
01:15:12,428 --> 01:15:16,296
Now get out before I expose
all your dirty doings!

856
01:15:38,754 --> 01:15:41,052
Chen, what's the matter?

857
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,759
I stole something...

858
01:15:45,828 --> 01:15:47,819
and Mr. Kaji struck me.

859
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:51,365
Kaji struck you?

860
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:54,128
But no matter.

861
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:58,402
Mr. Kaji is Japanese,
and I'm Chinese.

862
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:01,572
It's that simple!

863
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,127
Sister Jin is busy now.

864
01:16:22,698 --> 01:16:25,599
I think he's Korean.

865
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:27,792
Korean?

866
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:37,310
Hi, cutie.

867
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:40,805
Get in a fight?

868
01:16:49,191 --> 01:16:52,126
Yang, let me use
your room awhile.

869
01:16:54,129 --> 01:16:55,357
What's wrong?

870
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:00,958
I don't understand it myself.

871
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:03,270
Foolish girl,

872
01:17:03,472 --> 01:17:06,873
acting like an amateur
in love for the first time.

873
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:11,171
I can't seem to forget Kao.

874
01:17:18,587 --> 01:17:23,615
Love at first sight...
with a man behind barbed wire.

875
01:17:29,731 --> 01:17:31,198
Why not use your room?

876
01:17:33,268 --> 01:17:34,826
It's such a mess.

877
01:17:37,139 --> 01:17:38,697
Why do you ask?

878
01:17:58,093 --> 01:18:02,894
The Japanese are all the same.
They don't consider us human beings.

879
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:05,433
Chen...

880
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:08,201
go to the power station

881
01:18:08,637 --> 01:18:10,696
and work it out
with your friend.

882
01:18:11,773 --> 01:18:13,764
I'm not Korean.

883
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:16,006
I won't betray my friend
for money.

884
01:18:16,211 --> 01:18:17,542
I know that.

885
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:20,240
You're a good man.

886
01:18:21,316 --> 01:18:25,446
But those men in there
are prisoners.

887
01:18:25,687 --> 01:18:27,621
The Japanese will exploit them
and then kill them.

888
01:18:28,023 --> 01:18:30,423
Can they really be saved?

889
01:18:31,393 --> 01:18:32,382
Of course.

890
01:18:35,297 --> 01:18:38,926
But the only one
who can do it...

891
01:18:40,202 --> 01:18:41,794
is you.

892
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:57,582
This can wait, Chen.

893
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:00,918
First go do as I ask.

894
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:37,025
I understand.

895
01:19:38,593 --> 01:19:40,254
I'm Chinese too.

896
01:19:41,797 --> 01:19:44,425
I'm ready to do my part.

897
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,696
At exactly 1:00 a.m.

898
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:53,537
When the siren sounds,
I'll cut the current.

899
01:19:56,211 --> 01:20:00,511
But only for two minutes.
That's the best I can do.

900
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:02,472
Two minutes?

901
01:20:07,122 --> 01:20:08,111
Watch out!

902
01:20:09,257 --> 01:20:13,216
That's 3,300 volts!

903
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:19,689
Be careful.
Don't let them see you.

904
01:20:19,901 --> 01:20:21,368
<i>Sai!</i>

905
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:24,461
Go now,
and don't let them see you.

906
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:29,874
My regards to our brothers
behind barbed wire.

907
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:56,726
They're in love.
This isn't business.

908
01:20:57,272 --> 01:21:00,002
In that case, we don't pay.

909
01:21:00,342 --> 01:21:01,331
Stop kidding around.

910
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:29,626
A prisoner and a prostitute in love -
it's like a novel.

911
01:21:31,773 --> 01:21:34,333
But what will come of it?

912
01:21:36,812 --> 01:21:40,771
Nothing can come of it
while there's a war going on.

913
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:46,387
They have their love today.
That's all.

914
01:21:46,788 --> 01:21:49,120
Can't you let them marry?

915
01:21:51,226 --> 01:21:53,217
I would if I could.

916
01:21:55,063 --> 01:21:57,861
I'm sure you'd want
to help them.

917
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:01,663
I do, but it ends right there.

918
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:05,439
Have some.
They're delicious.

919
01:22:06,675 --> 01:22:08,040
What are they?

920
01:22:08,343 --> 01:22:11,141
A rare treat.
They were given to us.

921
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,213
By whom?

922
01:22:13,815 --> 01:22:15,715
Try and guess.

923
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:18,820
Mrs. Okazaki.

924
01:22:19,888 --> 01:22:21,617
Send them back!

925
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,556
But...

926
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,726
I can't send them back now.

927
01:22:27,929 --> 01:22:31,365
Return them!
Tell her I was furious.

928
01:22:31,566 --> 01:22:32,658
But why?

929
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:34,993
Why?

930
01:22:36,705 --> 01:22:38,832
Why do you glare at me
like that?

931
01:22:39,608 --> 01:22:42,634
She wanted to make up
for earlier.

932
01:22:42,844 --> 01:22:46,610
The murderer stole that flour!
It's time you showed more sense.

933
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,143
Can't you understand
my position

934
01:22:51,353 --> 01:22:54,789
and what I'm trying
to do at this mine?

935
01:22:56,157 --> 01:22:58,022
No, I can't.

936
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:02,294
How could I,
when you never tell me anything?

937
01:23:02,664 --> 01:23:08,660
Of course, even I can guess
where the flour and sugar came from.

938
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:13,871
But women can't always live
by unbending rules.

939
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:16,775
I didn't accept them
for myself.

940
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:19,446
So you accepted them for me?

941
01:23:19,714 --> 01:23:21,909
I don't need
that kind of thoughtfulness.

942
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:27,485
Because it was the Okazakis?

943
01:23:28,256 --> 01:23:30,281
What if it had been
Mrs. Okishima?

944
01:23:31,559 --> 01:23:33,026
I'd still refuse.

945
01:23:34,996 --> 01:23:38,762
Yes, you're just
the kind who would!

946
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:42,803
You struck Chen, didn't you?

947
01:23:46,241 --> 01:23:49,540
I know you didn't want to,
yet you did.

948
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:51,109
Why?

949
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:54,915
Because he did
something wrong?

950
01:23:56,418 --> 01:23:58,215
That's not why.

951
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:02,083
You could have forgiven him
for such a minor matter.

952
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:07,318
It was because you lost face
in front of others.

953
01:24:08,129 --> 01:24:12,532
For a man who aspires to great things,
you have a small mind!

954
01:24:12,734 --> 01:24:14,201
You wouldn't understand.

955
01:24:14,402 --> 01:24:15,869
But I do!

956
01:24:17,138 --> 01:24:21,541
I know what people think of you.
It's reached my ears too.

957
01:24:21,943 --> 01:24:23,911
What do they think?

958
01:24:27,015 --> 01:24:30,246
That you try to look better
than everyone else.

959
01:24:30,585 --> 01:24:32,485
I didn't believe them.

960
01:24:32,687 --> 01:24:35,713
I thought it was just spite,
but now -

961
01:24:35,924 --> 01:24:38,415
- Think what you want!
- Where are you going?

962
01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:40,719
I've kept 30 women waiting.

963
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:45,800
Marriage?

964
01:24:47,035 --> 01:24:48,332
Impossible!

965
01:24:50,605 --> 01:24:54,097
We can marry
after the war is over.

966
01:24:55,543 --> 01:24:57,841
Is the war going to end?

967
01:24:59,881 --> 01:25:03,408
It won't be much longer.

968
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,622
But they'll take you
away again.

969
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:12,249
No, Chun Lan.

970
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:16,990
It will end in victory for China.

971
01:25:21,469 --> 01:25:24,632
We'll be free.

972
01:25:24,973 --> 01:25:26,235
I...

973
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:32,104
I can only hope
that things stay as they are.

974
01:25:32,947 --> 01:25:35,609
Why, Chun Lan?

975
01:25:36,951 --> 01:25:41,115
When that day comes,
I'll never see you again.

976
01:25:41,756 --> 01:25:46,090
But I'm asking you
to marry me.

977
01:25:48,997 --> 01:25:52,228
There are plans
to escape from here,

978
01:25:52,434 --> 01:25:56,768
but I will not run away
as long as you're here.

979
01:25:58,406 --> 01:26:02,706
You won't run away?
You promise?

980
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:37,303
I'm sorry.
I went too far.

981
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:58,062
You brute!

982
01:27:03,538 --> 01:27:07,065
I'm thinking of letting
those two get married.

983
01:27:20,021 --> 01:27:21,079
Hello.

984
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:23,257
What? Escaped?

985
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:26,052
I'll be right there!
- How many?

986
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:27,728
Eleven men!

987
01:27:33,701 --> 01:27:36,761
<i>I won't bother
asking for information.</i>

988
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:40,533
We'll soon know
who planned the break.

989
01:27:41,609 --> 01:27:44,772
I won't ask for details.

990
01:27:45,446 --> 01:27:48,438
But you must understand
one thing.

991
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:53,719
We've tried our best
to help you.

992
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:56,287
If you cannot trust us,

993
01:27:56,491 --> 01:28:00,052
and if you continue
to try to escape,

994
01:28:01,062 --> 01:28:06,864
those who remain behind
will face reprisals

995
01:28:07,235 --> 01:28:09,863
and even more hard labor.

996
01:28:11,072 --> 01:28:14,530
And I will not raise a finger
to protect you.

997
01:28:15,443 --> 01:28:20,540
You think we can't bring you
before a firing squad.

998
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:25,147
But if Kaji and I decide to,

999
01:28:25,486 --> 01:28:27,954
we can always pack you
into those freight cars

1000
01:28:28,156 --> 01:28:30,647
and send you back
to the army!

1001
01:28:32,594 --> 01:28:34,653
They acted on their own.

1002
01:28:35,396 --> 01:28:38,058
We only serve as liaisons
for the prisoners.

1003
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,792
We couldn't stop them
even if we knew of their plot.

1004
01:28:43,104 --> 01:28:44,901
I see through your lies!

1005
01:28:45,473 --> 01:28:49,102
What if I said that
Wang Heng Li plotted this break?

1006
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:52,245
It no lie... we don't know.

1007
01:28:52,447 --> 01:28:54,381
I no run away.

1008
01:28:54,582 --> 01:28:56,311
You fools!

1009
01:28:56,784 --> 01:28:59,947
You think we'd take
your word for it?

1010
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:03,150
Why don't you all
run off somewhere!

1011
01:29:04,092 --> 01:29:05,787
I will not run.

1012
01:29:06,394 --> 01:29:09,955
I'll walk out of here
with dignity.

1013
01:29:10,565 --> 01:29:12,999
And just where will you go?

1014
01:29:15,903 --> 01:29:18,701
Don't think all Japanese
are as forgiving as me.

1015
01:29:18,906 --> 01:29:22,603
If you want to die,
just try to escape.

1016
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:29,417
Wang, the safety of your men
depends on all of you.

1017
01:29:32,587 --> 01:29:36,853
<i>I'm the one who has
to answer to the Kenpeitai -</i>

1018
01:29:37,058 --> 01:29:38,582
not you!

1019
01:29:38,793 --> 01:29:41,728
Investigate the situation
and take adequate measures.

1020
01:29:41,929 --> 01:29:46,423
<i>Oh, and think up a good story
for the Kenpeitai.</i>

1021
01:30:10,425 --> 01:30:12,256
Where's Kaji?

1022
01:30:18,266 --> 01:30:20,666
You stood by
while those men escaped?

1023
01:30:21,035 --> 01:30:23,003
We didn't stand by.

1024
01:30:23,471 --> 01:30:26,804
So you took
all precautionary measures?

1025
01:30:28,109 --> 01:30:30,100
Let me remind you once more:

1026
01:30:32,447 --> 01:30:36,144
Those prisoners are spoils of war,
obtained at great sacrifice.

1027
01:30:36,584 --> 01:30:40,418
You allowed them to damage
the prestige of our Imperial Forces.

1028
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:44,615
I demand an explanation.
- I have none.

1029
01:30:44,826 --> 01:30:48,159
The only explanation
is their desire to escape.

1030
01:30:48,363 --> 01:30:52,356
Why did you stand by and let them?
Answer me!

1031
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:54,797
I can hear you.
You don't have to shout.

1032
01:30:56,204 --> 01:30:58,764
We have
10,000 other laborers here,

1033
01:30:58,973 --> 01:31:01,908
but these special prisoners
have taken all our attention.

1034
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:06,444
No matter what, they'll manage to escape.
What are we supposed to do?

1035
01:31:08,616 --> 01:31:09,708
One question!

1036
01:31:13,287 --> 01:31:14,254
Go ahead.

1037
01:31:14,722 --> 01:31:17,054
We reported the truth.

1038
01:31:17,258 --> 01:31:22,594
I could have reported them dead
and avoided trouble.

1039
01:31:23,097 --> 01:31:25,463
<i>Does the Kenpeitai
not want the truth?</i>

1040
01:31:26,067 --> 01:31:28,501
I acknowledge your honesty.

1041
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:32,428
But shortage of personnel
is not an acceptable excuse.

1042
01:31:34,876 --> 01:31:37,777
Though your negligence
is inexcusable,

1043
01:31:38,546 --> 01:31:40,980
I shall overlook it
just this once.

1044
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:44,474
No more men must escape.

1045
01:31:44,685 --> 01:31:49,452
Tell them that if they do,
I will personally kill their leader.

1046
01:31:49,657 --> 01:31:51,147
Understand?

1047
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:52,826
I understand.

1048
01:31:54,996 --> 01:31:58,898
How about it?
Want me to scare them a little?

1049
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,167
That won't be necessary.

1050
01:32:02,303 --> 01:32:07,297
You must be quite sure of yourself
to refuse aid from the military.

1051
01:32:08,176 --> 01:32:09,074
Very well.

1052
01:32:09,677 --> 01:32:12,578
I'll hold you personally
responsible from now on.

1053
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,238
I never go back on my word.
- I understand.

1054
01:32:17,318 --> 01:32:18,910
And you?

1055
01:32:19,954 --> 01:32:21,444
Do you understand?

1056
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,614
I understand.

1057
01:32:27,128 --> 01:32:29,187
That will be all.

1058
01:32:45,246 --> 01:32:46,804
No! Wait!

1059
01:32:50,751 --> 01:32:52,048
Wait!

1060
01:32:53,921 --> 01:32:55,081
Let me go!

1061
01:32:55,289 --> 01:32:59,089
- Don't take it out on the men.
- What about you?

1062
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,421
You lost your temper and struck Chen,
and now you lecture me?

1063
01:33:03,631 --> 01:33:05,531
Don't pull your humanism on me.

1064
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:09,635
I struck Chen, and I regret it.
But should you do the same?

1065
01:33:09,837 --> 01:33:11,930
Don't let your feelings
ruin my work.

1066
01:33:12,139 --> 01:33:13,163
Your work?

1067
01:33:13,674 --> 01:33:14,572
Yes, my work.

1068
01:33:17,945 --> 01:33:22,109
You've kept in step so far,
but now you're going your own way.

1069
01:33:22,517 --> 01:33:23,950
Can't you see?

1070
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:27,382
Force has meaning
only when overcoming tyranny.

1071
01:33:27,588 --> 01:33:30,421
I know that.
I've had enough of your lectures.

1072
01:33:30,858 --> 01:33:33,725
You intend to let them
do as they wish?

1073
01:33:33,928 --> 01:33:35,725
I'll talk to them.

1074
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:42,597
I won't mince words.

1075
01:33:42,803 --> 01:33:46,500
I don't want
your men trying to escape.

1076
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:52,743
As far as you men
are concerned,

1077
01:33:52,947 --> 01:33:55,415
I am your friendliest enemy.

1078
01:33:56,317 --> 01:34:00,481
I pride myself on supervising you
without hostility.

1079
01:34:01,222 --> 01:34:03,383
Despite the conflicts
of interest

1080
01:34:04,659 --> 01:34:08,891
that result
from our being at war,

1081
01:34:09,397 --> 01:34:13,163
I've tried
to protect your interests.

1082
01:34:14,235 --> 01:34:17,068
What you say is difficult.

1083
01:34:18,306 --> 01:34:19,705
I see.

1084
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:23,833
Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.

1085
01:34:26,581 --> 01:34:29,982
When one of your comrades
was killed,

1086
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:36,246
we didn't take adequate
measures to protect you.

1087
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:40,952
Therefore
you no longer trust us.

1088
01:34:41,862 --> 01:34:43,762
That's only natural.

1089
01:34:44,599 --> 01:34:45,588
However...

1090
01:34:46,233 --> 01:34:50,192
I shall do my utmost
to correct this mistake.

1091
01:34:51,372 --> 01:34:54,432
It may take time...

1092
01:34:57,278 --> 01:35:01,271
but I hope you'll trust me
and be patient.

1093
01:35:03,618 --> 01:35:07,145
No one wants to risk
the danger of escaping.

1094
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:11,649
Let me speak
for my friend Kaji.

1095
01:35:13,561 --> 01:35:15,859
Since he arrived here,

1096
01:35:16,397 --> 01:35:19,525
the regular laborers' conditions
have greatly improved.

1097
01:35:20,134 --> 01:35:21,999
This also applies to you.

1098
01:35:23,404 --> 01:35:26,703
However, if there's
another escape,

1099
01:35:27,675 --> 01:35:30,667
<i>I cannot say
what the Kenpeitai might do.</i>

1100
01:35:33,914 --> 01:35:36,508
I don't know how Kaji feels,

1101
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:41,688
but the only way
to save my own neck

1102
01:35:41,889 --> 01:35:44,858
<i>is to send you back
to the Kenpeitai.</i>

1103
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,352
It's true what he says.

1104
01:35:49,597 --> 01:35:52,725
We can reach
an understanding by talking.

1105
01:35:56,203 --> 01:35:58,194
How about you, Kao?

1106
01:35:58,873 --> 01:36:01,433
If you can marry
Yang Chun Lan,

1107
01:36:01,642 --> 01:36:05,043
will you stay
until the war ends?

1108
01:36:06,047 --> 01:36:08,948
I don't like propositions
that start...

1109
01:36:11,652 --> 01:36:13,119
with the word "if."

1110
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:17,051
Can't you understand?

1111
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:20,093
We're talking things over.

1112
01:36:20,461 --> 01:36:22,019
Bootlicker!

1113
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:26,358
It's the same old
Japanese trick.

1114
01:36:27,501 --> 01:36:33,030
They always promise
to do this and do that...

1115
01:36:36,177 --> 01:36:38,145
but they never
keep their word.

1116
01:36:39,046 --> 01:36:40,479
Stand up!

1117
01:36:42,883 --> 01:36:45,647
You dog! You wouldn't
understand what men say.

1118
01:36:45,853 --> 01:36:48,845
Go to Yang Chun Lan
and learn the ways of human beings!

1119
01:36:56,864 --> 01:36:59,958
By the way, Wang, if I -

1120
01:37:01,702 --> 01:37:03,693
There's the "if" again.

1121
01:37:04,205 --> 01:37:10,735
If I gain the freedom for you
enjoyed by the regular laborers,

1122
01:37:10,945 --> 01:37:13,140
will you trust me?

1123
01:37:14,148 --> 01:37:19,017
To wait seems to be
the only safe liberty.

1124
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:20,881
You promise?

1125
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:27,456
Wang, you must trust me.

1126
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:46,939
I wonder if they trust me.

1127
01:37:47,314 --> 01:37:49,839
You want to believe they do,
don't you?

1128
01:37:50,551 --> 01:37:54,851
I want to believe Wang
when he says he'll wait.

1129
01:37:57,725 --> 01:38:01,821
You plan to continue sending
the women inside. Why?

1130
01:38:02,029 --> 01:38:03,656
Just a hunch.

1131
01:38:04,331 --> 01:38:08,927
I also plan to take 50 of them
for outside labor.

1132
01:38:09,136 --> 01:38:12,594
- Under armed guard?
- No, just by myself.

1133
01:38:13,107 --> 01:38:16,167
These strange hunches
aren't like you.

1134
01:38:17,411 --> 01:38:20,244
Why not be honest?
- About what?

1135
01:38:20,581 --> 01:38:24,745
You'd let them escape
if you could.

1136
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,312
That's nonsense.

1137
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,887
When that happens,
I stand to lose my neck.

1138
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:32,058
Remember that.

1139
01:38:51,912 --> 01:38:55,609
On days they come out here,
they seem happy.

1140
01:38:58,018 --> 01:39:00,248
Is your mother still ill?

1141
01:39:04,024 --> 01:39:07,551
I suppose she still longs
for some white flour.

1142
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:09,992
She's given up hope.

1143
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,968
I'm sorry I struck you
that day.

1144
01:39:17,471 --> 01:39:21,032
I'm hardheaded
in some ways, I know.

1145
01:39:21,242 --> 01:39:22,709
It's all right.

1146
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:34,085
Is Sai at the power station
a friend of yours?

1147
01:39:39,326 --> 01:39:41,692
Somebody shut off
the current.

1148
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:45,496
Sai was on duty that night.

1149
01:39:48,202 --> 01:39:51,638
If he did it,
tell him not to do it again.

1150
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,435
Well, back to work.

1151
01:40:01,749 --> 01:40:04,115
They could escape
whenever they want.

1152
01:40:04,318 --> 01:40:07,014
<i>Maybe they're starting
to trust you.</i>

1153
01:40:07,354 --> 01:40:11,950
No, they're just wary
of a trap.

1154
01:40:13,427 --> 01:40:15,327
Then you'll stop
taking them out?

1155
01:40:16,797 --> 01:40:18,662
No, I'll keep doing it.

1156
01:40:20,467 --> 01:40:24,733
Isn't it dangerous?
They might kill you and escape.

1157
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:27,036
I doubt that.

1158
01:40:27,341 --> 01:40:29,332
This bath feels good.

1159
01:40:30,144 --> 01:40:32,772
Why don't you come in?

1160
01:40:34,515 --> 01:40:36,142
I think I will.

1161
01:40:38,585 --> 01:40:42,282
If the workers settle down,
let's go into town on vacation.

1162
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:45,986
Let's do it!

1163
01:40:46,193 --> 01:40:48,286
How many days
can you take off?

1164
01:40:48,495 --> 01:40:50,463
Three at the most.

1165
01:40:50,965 --> 01:40:52,557
That would be wonderful!

1166
01:40:54,268 --> 01:40:57,135
Well, if they really
settle down...

1167
01:40:58,005 --> 01:41:01,304
Someday you'll be
a great supervisor,

1168
01:41:01,508 --> 01:41:04,966
but by then our youth
will have vanished.

1169
01:41:05,179 --> 01:41:06,908
That's not for me.

1170
01:41:07,982 --> 01:41:11,816
I'll take that vacation.
You're probably right.

1171
01:41:12,419 --> 01:41:13,784
Please do, all right?

1172
01:41:13,988 --> 01:41:15,979
I will.

1173
01:41:25,099 --> 01:41:28,899
See to it, Cho.
We need a break in that barbed wire.

1174
01:41:29,136 --> 01:41:32,128
Kaji will be off
on a three-day leave.

1175
01:41:32,339 --> 01:41:34,899
Okishima will be busy.
We'll do it then.

1176
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:39,045
Releasing prisoners is more profitable,
but more dangerous too.

1177
01:41:41,448 --> 01:41:46,010
With things going smoothly,
Kaji has let down his guard...

1178
01:41:47,221 --> 01:41:49,917
but watch out for Okishima.

1179
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:54,287
The timing is ideal.

1180
01:41:54,495 --> 01:41:59,398
Let's pull another fast one
and then make ourselves scarce.

1181
01:42:01,802 --> 01:42:05,863
That's right. Getting away clean
is the important thing.

1182
01:42:14,014 --> 01:42:15,447
Is Jin Tung Fu in?

1183
01:42:15,883 --> 01:42:19,216
She's in bed
with the cute boy.

1184
01:42:21,989 --> 01:42:23,547
How about you?

1185
01:42:37,805 --> 01:42:41,502
There's a problem.
Chen won't help anymore.

1186
01:42:41,708 --> 01:42:43,266
Won't help?

1187
01:42:44,611 --> 01:42:47,079
Once is as bad
as 100 times.

1188
01:42:47,281 --> 01:42:50,182
He doesn't want that risk
with you and me.

1189
01:42:50,517 --> 01:42:52,951
But he'll risk
sleeping with you.

1190
01:42:53,153 --> 01:42:55,781
He wants me
to break away too.

1191
01:42:56,423 --> 01:42:58,789
Has that dog squealed on us?

1192
01:42:58,992 --> 01:43:01,825
- He'd never do that.
- You never know.

1193
01:43:04,298 --> 01:43:06,823
Don't let him spend the night.
Send him home.

1194
01:43:26,753 --> 01:43:31,588
Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
How was it?

1195
01:43:31,859 --> 01:43:35,795
I hear Kaji will be away
starting Saturday.

1196
01:43:35,996 --> 01:43:38,624
Have the power cut off
while he's gone.

1197
01:43:39,633 --> 01:43:42,466
Sai isn't on duty those nights.

1198
01:43:42,669 --> 01:43:44,296
Then when is he?

1199
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:45,870
Friday night.

1200
01:43:46,073 --> 01:43:48,337
Then make it Friday night.

1201
01:43:49,343 --> 01:43:51,504
He can't!
They already suspect him!

1202
01:43:51,712 --> 01:43:53,202
Who does?

1203
01:43:53,914 --> 01:43:55,279
Mr. Kaji.

1204
01:43:56,783 --> 01:43:59,809
What can he do
without evidence?

1205
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:03,548
Listen carefully, punk.

1206
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:09,659
Play it straight and I'll fix it
so Jin Tung Fu will be yours alone.

1207
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:20,734
You little scum!

1208
01:44:23,744 --> 01:44:27,475
You'll do it, won't you?
Be a good boy.

1209
01:44:27,681 --> 01:44:31,344
If you refuse,
you and Sai will die.

1210
01:44:35,489 --> 01:44:41,485

PART 2

1240
01:49:51,938 --> 01:49:53,064
I feel wonderful!

1241
01:49:53,273 --> 01:49:56,538
We arrived in a whirl of dust,
but it's so nice today.

1242
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:59,240
Worried about work?
- No.

1243
01:49:59,412 --> 01:50:01,539
Just wondering
why I didn't do this before.

1244
01:50:01,715 --> 01:50:03,546
- Really?
- I mean it.

1245
01:50:04,217 --> 01:50:08,176
I'll phone Yasuko first thing
and tell her to take the day off.

1246
01:50:08,989 --> 01:50:10,456
Would you mind?

1247
01:50:11,024 --> 01:50:12,184
And then what?

1248
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:17,790
We'll have lunch together
and then go to the apple orchard.

1249
01:50:18,999 --> 01:50:23,698
It's so wonderful!
I feel as light as a balloon!

1250
01:50:33,346 --> 01:50:35,371
Allow me just one thing.

1251
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:36,940
What?

1252
01:50:37,117 --> 01:50:40,052
Let me go
for just one hour?

1253
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,051
What for?

1254
01:50:42,756 --> 01:50:46,419
With our increased production,
I'd like to talk to the main office

1255
01:50:46,593 --> 01:50:50,427
about treating the special laborers
like the ordinary laborers.

1256
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,661
Just one hour?

1257
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,901
- The rest of my time is all yours.
- All right.

1258
01:50:57,771 --> 01:51:01,002
I'll give you two hours,
but not a minute more.

1259
01:51:01,174 --> 01:51:03,301
<i>Mr. Kaji!</i>

1260
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:21,260
- They broke out again.
- What?

1261
01:51:22,896 --> 01:51:25,729
Where's Okishima?
- At their camp.

1262
01:51:26,299 --> 01:51:28,426
All right.
I'll be right there.

1263
01:51:35,342 --> 01:51:37,071
I don't want you to go.

1264
01:51:38,478 --> 01:51:40,503
I have no choice.

1265
01:51:43,183 --> 01:51:46,744
You go have
a good time with Yasuko.

1266
01:51:48,788 --> 01:51:50,346
Yasuko isn't you.

1267
01:51:50,557 --> 01:51:52,457
- But this is my job...
- I don't care!

1268
01:51:52,626 --> 01:51:57,325
You're officially on vacation.
They can't make you go back.

1269
01:51:57,964 --> 01:52:02,458
Leave it to Okishima.
I'll wait till after lunch, okay?

1270
01:52:02,636 --> 01:52:04,763
I'll never finish by then.

1271
01:52:06,473 --> 01:52:08,441
You just don't want to go.

1272
01:52:08,608 --> 01:52:10,200
Don't be foolish!

1273
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:14,447
Your work's important,

1274
01:52:14,614 --> 01:52:17,583
but don't you see
how important this is for us?

1275
01:52:17,751 --> 01:52:19,946
I'll make up for it next time.

1276
01:52:20,153 --> 01:52:22,280
You needn't bother!

1277
01:52:22,656 --> 01:52:25,318
Why so angry
over such a small thing?

1278
01:52:28,728 --> 01:52:30,696
Such a small thing?

1279
01:52:32,098 --> 01:52:36,057
You don't seem
to care how I feel.

1280
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:40,005
At any rate,
I can't just leave now.

1281
01:52:41,775 --> 01:52:43,367
I see.

1282
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:45,807
Then I'll go on alone.

1283
01:53:10,437 --> 01:53:12,405
Stop it!

1284
01:53:13,106 --> 01:53:16,598
From now on,
I do things my way!

1285
01:53:18,611 --> 01:53:21,808
- And ruin everything?
- They'll understand my fist!

1286
01:53:22,148 --> 01:53:23,979
Hitting them
won't bring back the others!

1287
01:53:24,184 --> 01:53:26,152
Do you realize
how many got away?

1288
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:30,016
Eighteen men,
led by Hwang and Sung!

1289
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:32,181
Still think words will help?

1290
01:53:32,358 --> 01:53:35,350
- I'll assume all responsibility.
- You fool!

1291
01:53:35,528 --> 01:53:38,691
If you don't like my methods,
you can quit.

1292
01:53:38,865 --> 01:53:41,333
<i>You won't be dragged
before the Kenpeitai.</i>

1293
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:46,600
Fine!

1294
01:53:54,447 --> 01:53:55,778
Wang!

1295
01:53:58,918 --> 01:54:00,545
Stand up!

1296
01:54:01,554 --> 01:54:05,320
I've given up on all of you.
You said you'd wait.

1297
01:54:05,492 --> 01:54:10,225
You might think I'm a fool,
but even a fool has limits!

1298
01:54:18,271 --> 01:54:21,798
Another escape and you'll all
go without food for three days.

1299
01:54:21,975 --> 01:54:26,275
I'll turn your men against you
and break your authority in this camp!

1300
01:54:26,513 --> 01:54:30,381
You Japanese
are all the same!

1301
01:54:30,583 --> 01:54:31,447
Fine!

1302
01:54:32,318 --> 01:54:35,754
Then I'll act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.

1303
01:54:36,723 --> 01:54:41,422
Now I realize there can be
no trust between us.

1304
01:54:42,896 --> 01:54:45,262
<i>Mr. Okishima!</i>

1305
01:54:55,508 --> 01:54:57,999
<i>How will you report
this to the Kenpeitai?</i>

1306
01:54:58,845 --> 01:55:01,279
They won't let us off
easy this time.

1307
01:55:02,482 --> 01:55:05,144
- I won't report the incident.
- What?

1308
01:55:07,353 --> 01:55:11,312
If it leaks out,
I'll assume all responsibility.

1309
01:55:11,624 --> 01:55:15,219
I don't think
it was all your responsibility.

1310
01:55:17,297 --> 01:55:20,596
You think someone
shut off the power?

1311
01:55:21,167 --> 01:55:23,032
I couldn't say.

1312
01:55:23,236 --> 01:55:26,000
Shall I put only Japanese
on night duty there?

1313
01:55:26,172 --> 01:55:28,766
You can't do that
without evidence.

1314
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:34,345
Shall I increase the night watch
around the fence?

1315
01:55:34,514 --> 01:55:38,746
I'd have to check
that they're at their posts.

1316
01:55:40,286 --> 01:55:43,949
Eighteen men...
that's a big loss!

1317
01:55:44,257 --> 01:55:48,284
I've achieved
the 20% increase in production.

1318
01:55:48,461 --> 01:55:51,794
I don't want trouble now
over something like this.

1319
01:56:01,341 --> 01:56:04,674
I forgot: Okishima
is hereby relieved

1320
01:56:04,844 --> 01:56:08,075
of all responsibility
for the special prisoners.

1321
01:56:08,248 --> 01:56:10,148
I don't know!

1322
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:18,548
Damned Chinaman!

1323
01:56:20,693 --> 01:56:22,422
Son of a bitch!

1324
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,695
Tell me!

1325
01:56:29,936 --> 01:56:31,904
Who paid you?

1326
01:56:36,276 --> 01:56:42,112
Okishima favors drastic measures,
but Kaji always stops him.

1327
01:56:42,348 --> 01:56:46,842
Meaning he gives
tacit consent to the runaways?

1328
01:56:47,186 --> 01:56:49,780
I wouldn't say that,

1329
01:56:50,156 --> 01:56:53,592
but it does all seem
rather suspicious.

1330
01:56:58,731 --> 01:57:02,223
There is one way
to teach them a lesson.

1331
01:57:02,402 --> 01:57:04,063
How?

1332
01:57:05,872 --> 01:57:09,899
We let them plan another break
and then foil them.

1333
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:13,410
With your permission,
I'd like to try.

1334
01:57:15,048 --> 01:57:17,039
Sounds intriguing.

1335
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:20,485
I'll try anything
that brings results.

1336
01:57:21,654 --> 01:57:23,121
Give it a try.

1337
01:57:23,890 --> 01:57:25,949
Boss's orders.

1338
01:57:26,926 --> 01:57:31,363
We're distributing flour and oil.
Only to the Japanese, of course.

1339
01:57:31,898 --> 01:57:34,196
I'm sure you don't approve.

1340
01:57:35,068 --> 01:57:36,797
I do not.

1341
01:57:37,737 --> 01:57:41,537
Unfortunately,
you're not the manager.

1342
01:57:42,942 --> 01:57:45,740
I'm sure you're happy I'm not.

1343
01:57:47,814 --> 01:57:50,806
Mr. Kaji, it's Mr. Okishima!

1344
01:57:57,557 --> 01:57:59,115
Filthy scum!

1345
01:57:59,759 --> 01:58:02,125
Son of a bitch!

1346
01:58:06,165 --> 01:58:07,427
Kill the rat!

1347
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,465
Let him have it!

1348
01:58:19,612 --> 01:58:22,979
Mr. Okishima,
let us handle that Korean dog!

1349
01:58:23,683 --> 01:58:25,913
Stay out of this!
Filthy dog!

1350
01:58:27,854 --> 01:58:30,948
Swipe men from
under my nose, eh?

1351
01:58:32,225 --> 01:58:33,886
Bastard!

1352
01:58:47,173 --> 01:58:48,834
Not stopping me today?

1353
01:58:49,008 --> 01:58:50,600
You want me to?

1354
01:58:50,777 --> 01:58:52,677
Don't look so disapproving.

1355
01:58:52,845 --> 01:58:56,713
Should I go easy
on the regular workers too?

1356
01:58:57,483 --> 01:59:03,513
Your clumsy humanism kills good men
and lets scoundrels run wild.

1357
01:59:03,689 --> 01:59:05,589
Chen, take him
to the medical ward.

1358
01:59:05,758 --> 01:59:09,421
Do no such thing!
His boss will pick him up.

1359
01:59:09,595 --> 01:59:11,290
Take him!

1360
01:59:20,506 --> 01:59:22,565
Go call Furuya.

1361
01:59:23,076 --> 01:59:26,978
Don't worry, young one.
I won't talk.

1362
01:59:42,662 --> 01:59:48,794
Chen, it seems I know more about you
than you do about me.

1363
01:59:50,903 --> 01:59:55,772
Go back and tell Kaji
his wounds aren't serious.

1364
01:59:56,976 --> 01:59:59,103
It's better if Kaji doesn't
come around here.

1365
02:00:22,502 --> 02:00:24,299
Well? How is he?

1366
02:00:24,704 --> 02:00:26,638
He seems all right.

1367
02:00:27,673 --> 02:00:29,470
Mr. Furuya is with him.

1368
02:00:29,842 --> 02:00:31,503
Furuya?

1369
02:00:34,714 --> 02:00:38,741
Furuya, send
a telegram to Muta.

1370
02:00:39,952 --> 02:00:41,943
That rat Okishima!

1371
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:04,105
He says he's going
to sue Okishima.

1372
02:01:04,277 --> 02:01:07,872
Help him arrange it.
You two seem friendly enough.

1373
02:01:08,948 --> 02:01:11,940
Don't bother explaining!
Think I'm that stupid?

1374
02:01:12,585 --> 02:01:16,351
Was it the money?
Or just to make trouble for me?

1375
02:01:17,757 --> 02:01:20,726
Don't worry.
I won't tell the boss.

1376
02:01:22,128 --> 02:01:25,359
See that your buddy
is hospitalized.

1377
02:01:25,531 --> 02:01:29,399
But you're paying for him...
not Labor!

1378
02:01:30,369 --> 02:01:33,065
You probably made plenty.

1379
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:40,838
Where you been hidin'

1380
02:01:41,781 --> 02:01:43,681
What's wrong with you?

1381
02:01:44,083 --> 02:01:45,675
Drunk, I see.

1382
02:01:46,519 --> 02:01:49,647
Think I got drunk
and came to make trouble?

1383
02:01:49,822 --> 02:01:53,349
I had a drink with the boss,
but I'm not drunk.

1384
02:01:59,232 --> 02:02:01,427
I have some hot news.

1385
02:02:01,601 --> 02:02:05,298
They're issuing commendations
for the increased production.

1386
02:02:05,771 --> 02:02:08,171
Okazaki will surely
be included.

1387
02:02:09,408 --> 02:02:13,708
I told the boss
you were the only one in Labor

1388
02:02:13,879 --> 02:02:17,280
who deserved a commendation.

1389
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:22,619
The boss felt the same way,

1390
02:02:23,122 --> 02:02:27,218
but he feared that this old-timer
might feel slighted.

1391
02:02:29,929 --> 02:02:33,456
You don't think
I'd feel slighted, do you?

1392
02:02:36,869 --> 02:02:39,997
Why have you suddenly
turned to brute force?

1393
02:02:41,073 --> 02:02:43,268
The boss asked the same thing.

1394
02:02:43,643 --> 02:02:46,476
I was born a brute...
good enough?

1395
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:53,245
How long do you plan
to keep on like this?

1396
02:02:53,886 --> 02:02:54,910
Meaning what?

1397
02:02:56,222 --> 02:03:01,319
Straddling a fundamental contradiction
and trying to justify it.

1398
02:03:05,431 --> 02:03:07,661
I'm out of breath.

1399
02:03:08,134 --> 02:03:12,070
If I'm being a nuisance,
just say so and I'll back off.

1400
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:41,391
Kao!

1401
02:04:24,143 --> 02:04:25,474
Chun Lan!

1402
02:04:26,112 --> 02:04:28,808
I was afraid
you might have escaped.

1403
02:04:31,484 --> 02:04:33,748
That's all I could buy today.

1404
02:04:34,687 --> 02:04:36,177
Thank you.

1405
02:04:36,889 --> 02:04:38,550
Thank you!

1406
02:04:57,276 --> 02:05:01,076
We can't meet
for the time being.

1407
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:06,241
We can't come here.

1408
02:05:08,154 --> 02:05:09,746
If you run off by yourself...

1409
02:05:11,557 --> 02:05:13,286
I'll kill myself.

1410
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:17,454
I'll take you with me
when I escape.

1411
02:05:18,364 --> 02:05:19,092
When?

1412
02:05:21,033 --> 02:05:24,969
After I learn
how the others have fared.

1413
02:05:25,304 --> 02:05:30,640
I can't take any chances
if I take you along.

1414
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:33,478
Stay here.

1415
02:05:34,914 --> 02:05:37,474
They might let us marry.

1416
02:05:38,818 --> 02:05:40,718
Don't believe them!

1417
02:05:41,587 --> 02:05:45,683
Wang says
the war will end soon.

1418
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:50,388
Japan will be defeated.

1419
02:05:52,331 --> 02:05:54,424
Now that I have you...

1420
02:05:55,701 --> 02:05:59,228
I'm willing to bear anything.

1421
02:06:00,706 --> 02:06:01,798
Kao!

1422
02:06:03,709 --> 02:06:08,908
I wish we could meet
like this every night.

1423
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:16,518
But if they start suspecting us...

1424
02:06:18,524 --> 02:06:20,754
then it's all over.

1425
02:06:22,862 --> 02:06:23,851
This cursed wire!

1426
02:06:24,029 --> 02:06:25,018
Careful!

1427
02:06:27,733 --> 02:06:29,928
Why do the gods
torment us like this?

1428
02:06:33,873 --> 02:06:35,306
Chun Lan...

1429
02:06:36,408 --> 02:06:38,535
I love you!

1430
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:44,044
And I love you!

1431
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:35,590
Can't you sleep?

1432
02:07:37,269 --> 02:07:42,536
Kaji would have been happier
married to a girl like you.

1433
02:07:43,175 --> 02:07:45,541
You're too much
the wife, Michi.

1434
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:48,911
You're forgetting
to be a woman.

1435
02:07:49,682 --> 02:07:51,479
What do you mean?

1436
02:07:52,651 --> 02:07:55,347
Being a wife
is a kind of profession,

1437
02:07:55,554 --> 02:07:58,250
but it's the woman
that men love.

1438
02:07:59,258 --> 02:08:05,197
When you typed Kaji's reports,
you studied them like one possessed.

1439
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:09,463
I never understood a word.

1440
02:08:09,668 --> 02:08:13,695
And now? Do you ask him
about his work?

1441
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:17,639
He doesn't like me
asking questions.

1442
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:24,006
If I were you, I'd pester him
until he told me everything.

1443
02:08:24,216 --> 02:08:26,776
Then I'd ask
even more questions.

1444
02:08:30,956 --> 02:08:34,653
What's wrong?
Did I go too far?

1445
02:10:20,365 --> 02:10:22,492
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1446
02:10:23,335 --> 02:10:26,361
I failed as a wife
and as a woman.

1447
02:10:31,477 --> 02:10:33,468
I couldn't sleep.

1448
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:37,205
This is your home.

1449
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:40,775
You can sleep soundly here.

1450
02:10:42,588 --> 02:10:48,549
Promise you'll share
both your joys and sorrows with me.

1451
02:10:50,763 --> 02:10:52,663
Sorrow for one is enough.

1452
02:10:52,865 --> 02:10:54,662
It's not!

1453
02:10:54,867 --> 02:10:57,700
I'm walking down
the same path you are.

1454
02:10:58,604 --> 02:11:00,538
It's okay if I lose my way.

1455
02:11:00,773 --> 02:11:03,970
Just tell me we might get lost
and take me along.

1456
02:11:05,444 --> 02:11:07,344
I'll follow you...

1457
02:11:08,313 --> 02:11:10,873
and do my best to keep up.

1458
02:11:14,052 --> 02:11:15,610
I understand.

1459
02:11:16,021 --> 02:11:18,353
If I don't walk fast enough,

1460
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:21,318
will you wait
just a tiny bit for me?

1461
02:11:21,527 --> 02:11:23,552
Just a very tiny bit?

1462
02:11:25,397 --> 02:11:26,989
Of course.

1463
02:11:27,733 --> 02:11:30,964
I'll never ask you
the same question twice.

1464
02:11:37,209 --> 02:11:41,737
"Through fitting leadership
in the pit,

1465
02:11:41,914 --> 02:11:47,944
you have helped achieve
a 20% increase in ore production.

1466
02:11:48,153 --> 02:11:51,486
At this hour
of dire national emergency,

1467
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:56,718
you've rendered a valuable service
to our armed forces

1468
02:11:56,895 --> 02:11:59,955
and set a fitting example
for other employees.

1469
02:12:00,199 --> 02:12:03,259
You are hereby
officially commended.

1470
02:12:03,468 --> 02:12:06,335
September 23, 1943.

1471
02:12:06,538 --> 02:12:10,565
Chairman of the board
Jushiro Kitada.

1472
02:12:10,776 --> 02:12:13,210
Read in proxy
by Junichi Kuroki."

1473
02:12:40,672 --> 02:12:43,038
Looks like we'll have rain.

1474
02:12:45,177 --> 02:12:48,408
Rainy nights are ideal
for escape attempts.

1475
02:13:00,759 --> 02:13:03,057
When you deliver their dinner,

1476
02:13:03,262 --> 02:13:07,392
tell them arrangements have been made.
They can break out tonight.

1477
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:09,066
Tonight?

1478
02:13:09,368 --> 02:13:11,734
Then go to the power station

1479
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:15,867
and tell them Kaji says
to cut the power.

1480
02:13:16,308 --> 02:13:18,367
But Mr. Kaji would never...

1481
02:13:20,245 --> 02:13:23,408
I'm acting under direct orders
from the boss.

1482
02:13:23,916 --> 02:13:27,909
<i>You want me to tell
the Kenpeitai about you?</i>

1483
02:13:30,956 --> 02:13:34,824
About how you and Jin Tung Fu
aided the plotters,

1484
02:13:35,727 --> 02:13:40,858
and how Kaji knew
but pretended not to see?

1485
02:13:53,512 --> 02:13:56,970
It's the only way
to save your neck.

1486
02:14:05,958 --> 02:14:10,327
<i>As ships at sea
part the great white waves</i>

1487
02:14:10,529 --> 02:14:15,091
<i>So do I part
my loved one's thighs</i>

1488
02:14:31,249 --> 02:14:36,243
Mr. Kaji, I look forward
to your continued favor.

1489
02:14:37,723 --> 02:14:40,920
You're young,
but you're quite a fellow!

1490
02:14:41,126 --> 02:14:43,458
No, a great fellow!

1491
02:14:43,929 --> 02:14:48,491
The day you arrived
it was snowing...

1492
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:50,600
No, it was windy.

1493
02:14:50,802 --> 02:14:53,498
Really? Windy?

1494
02:14:53,705 --> 02:14:55,969
That day I thought

1495
02:14:56,174 --> 02:15:00,042
a young squirt like you
could never handle this mine.

1496
02:15:00,245 --> 02:15:04,773
But things really did
work out as you said.

1497
02:15:04,983 --> 02:15:07,076
You're really something!

1498
02:15:08,653 --> 02:15:10,644
But Mr. Kaji...

1499
02:15:11,323 --> 02:15:13,689
I've been watching.

1500
02:15:14,059 --> 02:15:18,291
You haven't been drinking.

1501
02:15:29,307 --> 02:15:31,070
Give me a hand?

1502
02:15:37,182 --> 02:15:40,845
If you want to try,
tonight is your last chance.

1503
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:44,250
Why the sudden rush?

1504
02:15:45,123 --> 02:15:48,581
If the timing's no good,
just forget it.

1505
02:15:49,928 --> 02:15:56,197
But my friend's being moved
to the day shift tomorrow.

1506
02:15:57,002 --> 02:15:59,300
You sure about this?

1507
02:16:01,807 --> 02:16:05,675
On behalf
of the men in the pit

1508
02:16:05,844 --> 02:16:10,281
and in the spirit of friendship,

1509
02:16:10,482 --> 02:16:15,818
I challenge Mr. Kaji
to a friendly drinking bout.

1510
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:18,546
Hear! Hear!

1511
02:16:19,391 --> 02:16:20,881
I concede defeat.

1512
02:16:21,093 --> 02:16:23,391
No, you can't!

1513
02:16:23,595 --> 02:16:27,395
We haven't even started yet!

1514
02:16:27,766 --> 02:16:29,427
No, I really do.

1515
02:16:29,601 --> 02:16:31,034
Mr. Kaji...

1516
02:16:32,404 --> 02:16:36,067
do you only show spirit
when you're snarling at me?

1517
02:16:38,977 --> 02:16:42,208
Come on. Be a man!

1518
02:16:43,348 --> 02:16:46,010
All right! I'm ready!

1519
02:16:49,421 --> 02:16:51,252
Use this.

1520
02:16:51,423 --> 02:16:54,051
Get drunk and let down
your guard for once.

1521
02:16:54,259 --> 02:16:55,920
That's right!

1522
02:16:56,128 --> 02:16:59,291
Okay, let's begin.

1523
02:17:00,632 --> 02:17:02,293
Show 'em, Mr. Kaji!

1524
02:17:06,571 --> 02:17:10,063
- That's the way!
- More!

1525
02:17:12,444 --> 02:17:17,279
Those boys in Labor are used
to being wined and dined by the bosses.

1526
02:17:17,482 --> 02:17:19,109
They get the women too!

1527
02:17:19,317 --> 02:17:22,047
They run the whorehouse
and have their pick.

1528
02:17:23,388 --> 02:17:26,050
So we're wined and dined, eh?

1529
02:17:27,859 --> 02:17:30,589
And the whores are ours
for the taking?

1530
02:17:31,730 --> 02:17:35,894
Fine! Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!

1531
02:17:47,112 --> 02:17:48,670
Chen.

1532
02:17:52,817 --> 02:17:54,785
All done delivering their meals?

1533
02:18:00,425 --> 02:18:03,690
This is a special ration ticket
for Japanese only.

1534
02:18:03,995 --> 02:18:06,190
You're welcome to mine.

1535
02:18:06,398 --> 02:18:09,595
- But your wife...
- She's given up hope.

1536
02:18:11,036 --> 02:18:12,526
Mr. Kaji.

1537
02:18:15,473 --> 02:18:17,134
No, nothing.

1538
02:18:18,376 --> 02:18:22,210
I just wanted to say thank you.

1539
02:18:23,615 --> 02:18:25,583
It's me who should thank you.

1540
02:18:25,951 --> 02:18:29,853
I was afraid
you wouldn't accept it now.

1541
02:19:11,463 --> 02:19:13,727
There's a nice ass!

1542
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:18,835
Hey, lady-killer!

1543
02:19:19,037 --> 02:19:20,698
Tops in Japan!

1544
02:19:20,905 --> 02:19:24,864
Back off!
Still in heat at your age?

1545
02:19:25,076 --> 02:19:26,839
What if I am?

1546
02:19:27,045 --> 02:19:30,503
Go sow your seed
in your own rice paddies!

1547
02:19:31,483 --> 02:19:34,509
I wouldn't act so big,
Okishima.

1548
02:19:34,719 --> 02:19:39,383
If you and Kaji
would mind your own business,

1549
02:19:39,591 --> 02:19:43,459
I could have topped
our production goal long ago.

1550
02:19:43,662 --> 02:19:49,157
And you'd have 10 murders
on your record now.

1551
02:19:49,801 --> 02:19:51,894
You'd be having dinner in jail!

1552
02:19:53,805 --> 02:19:55,102
Bastard!

1553
02:19:55,307 --> 02:19:57,502
If you want trouble, come on.

1554
02:20:39,584 --> 02:20:41,814
Chen, what's the matter?

1555
02:20:54,699 --> 02:20:56,599
What should I do?

1556
02:20:58,203 --> 02:21:00,194
I won't be able
to see you again.

1557
02:21:02,140 --> 02:21:04,734
I've fallen into a trap!

1558
02:21:06,211 --> 02:21:10,079
Go to the station
and have him cut off the power.

1559
02:21:11,649 --> 02:21:13,241
If I do that...

1560
02:21:14,853 --> 02:21:17,185
and the men are captured...

1561
02:21:19,124 --> 02:21:21,388
they'll kill me!

1562
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:26,794
This is a Japanese plot.

1563
02:21:27,832 --> 02:21:32,132
No matter what happens,
you won't be killed.

1564
02:21:33,171 --> 02:21:37,938
You speak as if
this didn't concern you.

1565
02:21:39,144 --> 02:21:43,205
If I'm caught,
I might confess everything.

1566
02:21:43,882 --> 02:21:45,144
Don't threaten me.

1567
02:21:46,151 --> 02:21:48,585
You dragged me into this!

1568
02:21:50,321 --> 02:21:52,687
- Where are you going?
- To warn them.

1569
02:21:52,857 --> 02:21:55,325
You'll never get word to them.

1570
02:21:55,493 --> 02:21:56,892
I can try.

1571
02:21:57,295 --> 02:22:00,230
Wait! I have a better idea.

1572
02:22:07,172 --> 02:22:09,606
Chun Lan.

1573
02:22:12,877 --> 02:22:15,243
Kao is breaking out tonight.

1574
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,742
Kao is breaking out?

1575
02:22:18,917 --> 02:22:21,852
Go tell him
it's too dangerous.

1576
02:22:23,087 --> 02:22:25,021
I won't let him escape alone!

1577
02:23:37,161 --> 02:23:39,186
Drink. It'll relax you.

1578
02:24:05,890 --> 02:24:10,054
I couldn't contact him.
Are you sure he plans to escape?

1579
02:24:10,695 --> 02:24:11,855
You met no one?

1580
02:24:12,530 --> 02:24:16,091
With this downpour,
I couldn't see a thing.

1581
02:24:17,101 --> 02:24:18,625
Not a soul?

1582
02:24:19,437 --> 02:24:21,769
Is he really breaking out?

1583
02:24:22,006 --> 02:24:24,270
What'll we do now?

1584
02:24:24,943 --> 02:24:26,706
If he runs off by himself...

1585
02:24:28,313 --> 02:24:29,871
I'll kill myself!

1586
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:39,588
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.

1587
02:25:09,387 --> 02:25:10,752
What should we do?

1588
02:25:11,255 --> 02:25:16,716
The best way is to confess
the whole thing to Mr. Kaji.

1589
02:25:16,894 --> 02:25:20,660
No! He's the worst
of them all!

1590
02:25:21,232 --> 02:25:22,824
Where are you going?

1591
02:25:30,508 --> 02:25:32,442
Go to the power station!

1592
02:26:32,270 --> 02:26:34,101
You little punk!

1593
02:26:37,075 --> 02:26:39,441
I expected as much.

1594
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:41,976
Did you do as I told you?

1595
02:26:43,748 --> 02:26:45,215
Yes.

1596
02:26:45,516 --> 02:26:49,919
You didn't mention
the matter to Kaji, did you?

1597
02:26:50,755 --> 02:26:52,222
No.

1598
02:26:52,623 --> 02:26:56,286
We'll find out in a moment...

1599
02:26:57,795 --> 02:26:59,854
whether you did as ordered.

1600
02:27:03,501 --> 02:27:06,493
If you betrayed us,
it's a bullet in your head.

1601
02:27:08,072 --> 02:27:13,601
We'll report that we caught you
helping the men escape.

1602
02:27:14,278 --> 02:27:16,337
It'll even mean a reward.

1603
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,615
They're coming!

1604
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:27,377
Mr. Furuya.

1605
02:28:30,087 --> 02:28:32,248
The power... I didn't...

1606
02:28:32,557 --> 02:28:34,218
What?

1607
02:28:39,063 --> 02:28:40,758
Son of a bitch!

1608
02:28:48,172 --> 02:28:50,936
Bastard! You want to die?

1609
02:29:24,709 --> 02:29:28,338
I never dreamt that Chen
might plot something like this.

1610
02:29:28,946 --> 02:29:30,743
I've been blind.

1611
02:29:32,650 --> 02:29:34,140
Furuya!

1612
02:29:35,553 --> 02:29:40,718
Blind because I never thought you
capable of such a diabolical plot!

1613
02:29:41,192 --> 02:29:44,252
Go brag to the boss
of your brave deed!

1614
02:29:49,166 --> 02:29:50,155
Wang!

1615
02:29:52,803 --> 02:29:55,271
You're not always right either.

1616
02:29:56,073 --> 02:29:58,667
Your failed leadership
caused this.

1617
02:29:59,110 --> 02:30:01,738
You refused to trust us.

1618
02:30:03,281 --> 02:30:08,150
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!

1619
02:30:11,455 --> 02:30:14,049
<i>Kao!</i>

1620
02:30:24,869 --> 02:30:27,599
Why did you do it?

1621
02:30:27,805 --> 02:30:30,171
It was so foolish!

1622
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:34,543
Kao!

1623
02:30:43,988 --> 02:30:45,649
You're alive!

1624
02:30:47,091 --> 02:30:49,082
You're alive!

1625
02:30:58,135 --> 02:30:59,693
Chun Lan!

1626
02:31:00,838 --> 02:31:04,296
Look at the man whose mistake
killed his own friends!

1627
02:31:34,005 --> 02:31:36,974
Okishima came
to tell me about it.

1628
02:31:37,975 --> 02:31:40,375
Why didn't Chen come to me?

1629
02:31:41,212 --> 02:31:43,271
He was probably afraid to.

1630
02:31:44,949 --> 02:31:46,940
Because I hit him?

1631
02:31:49,553 --> 02:31:51,612
Okishima told me

1632
02:31:52,256 --> 02:31:56,283
you'd take it really hard.

1633
02:31:58,095 --> 02:32:00,859
It's not my fault
that I'm Japanese...

1634
02:32:02,366 --> 02:32:06,166
yet it's my worst crime
that I am!

1635
02:32:14,011 --> 02:32:18,311
Chen was kind to you
even though I struck him.

1636
02:32:19,283 --> 02:32:21,774
He understood how I felt.

1637
02:32:22,887 --> 02:32:24,821
Yet look what happened.

1638
02:32:27,024 --> 02:32:30,016
That son a bitch Furuya!

1639
02:32:30,861 --> 02:32:33,022
The boss put him up to this.

1640
02:32:34,999 --> 02:32:37,866
They'll never meddle
in Labor affairs again!

1641
02:32:47,545 --> 02:32:49,012
Let's go home.

1642
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:54,443
Some nice hot soup
will help you feel better.

1643
02:32:57,021 --> 02:32:58,488
Yes, let's.

1644
02:33:00,324 --> 02:33:01,814
Let's go home.

1645
02:33:30,187 --> 02:33:34,021
<i>I wish you'd ask the main office
about getting the Kenpeitai</i>

1646
02:33:34,225 --> 02:33:38,184
to let us treat these prisoners
like ordinary laborers.

1647
02:33:38,729 --> 02:33:42,756
But I know I asked you
to stay out of my affairs.

1648
02:33:42,967 --> 02:33:44,832
Don't worry. I'll do it.

1649
02:33:45,035 --> 02:33:49,563
My trip will cool us both off.
It'll be my present to you.

1650
02:33:51,575 --> 02:33:55,102
Seems the boss considers Okazaki
more indispensable than me.

1651
02:33:58,682 --> 02:34:00,877
I'm boarding
this run-down truck,

1652
02:34:01,152 --> 02:34:05,213
but you're trying to catch the train
of humanism before it's too late.

1653
02:34:05,422 --> 02:34:07,151
I won't stop you.

1654
02:34:07,525 --> 02:34:10,983
You seem willing to pay the fare,
no matter how high.

1655
02:35:03,447 --> 02:35:06,245
Am I making trouble
by coming here?

1656
02:35:10,254 --> 02:35:13,382
I already offered
my apologies.

1657
02:35:14,692 --> 02:35:16,626
Leave us alone.

1658
02:35:19,964 --> 02:35:24,628
From now on, we'll have
to escape from the work areas.

1659
02:35:25,369 --> 02:35:27,803
Wang wants us
to lie low for a while.

1660
02:35:28,872 --> 02:35:32,399
And there's been
no news from the others.

1661
02:35:47,591 --> 02:35:49,422
What's going on here?

1662
02:35:51,729 --> 02:35:52,753
Run!

1663
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:55,194
Bastards!
You dare resist?

1664
02:36:10,381 --> 02:36:11,939
Get back here!

1665
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:14,316
Come back!

1666
02:36:22,593 --> 02:36:24,220
Escape attempt!

1667
02:36:24,395 --> 02:36:25,760
Escape attempt!

1668
02:36:30,267 --> 02:36:31,598
How about it?

1669
02:36:31,802 --> 02:36:35,329
They're offering us
500 more prisoners.

1670
02:36:35,939 --> 02:36:37,930
We lack accommodations.

1671
02:36:38,108 --> 02:36:39,939
Accommodations?

1672
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:42,305
Don't you mean supervision?

1673
02:36:42,946 --> 02:36:46,609
We just caught seven prisoners
trying to escape!

1674
02:36:46,784 --> 02:36:49,810
You caught them?
Good work!

1675
02:36:49,987 --> 02:36:53,252
- Did they resist?
- The bastards almost got away.

1676
02:36:53,457 --> 02:36:55,891
- From the pit?
- The ore dump.

1677
02:36:56,060 --> 02:36:57,357
That's strange.

1678
02:36:57,528 --> 02:37:00,725
You were eating Chinese food here.
How would you know?

1679
02:37:00,898 --> 02:37:02,832
How could they escape
in broad daylight?

1680
02:37:03,033 --> 02:37:07,265
Look at this. Only desperate men
would throw ore at me.

1681
02:37:07,438 --> 02:37:09,167
That makes it a break?

1682
02:37:09,373 --> 02:37:14,037
I'm not the only witness.
It took 15 men to capture them.

1683
02:37:14,211 --> 02:37:17,806
Inside the compound? Running
inside the compound is a break?

1684
02:37:17,981 --> 02:37:21,508
- Why do you defend the chinks?
- I'll investigate this.

1685
02:37:21,685 --> 02:37:23,619
You needn't bother!

1686
02:37:27,291 --> 02:37:30,488
- Where are they?
- The guard house.

1687
02:37:30,661 --> 02:37:31,821
Good.

1688
02:37:32,496 --> 02:37:35,488
Captain, what are
your instructions?

1689
02:37:35,899 --> 02:37:38,129
Well, let's see.

1690
02:37:38,369 --> 02:37:41,497
Shall we try the method
you've been suggesting?

1691
02:37:46,543 --> 02:37:49,273
He's a master swordsman.

1692
02:37:50,114 --> 02:37:52,810
How many men
did you slay in China?

1693
02:37:52,983 --> 02:37:56,111
Wait! How can you be sure
it was a break?

1694
02:37:56,286 --> 02:38:00,188
Silence! We have a witness.
Any more objections?

1695
02:38:00,357 --> 02:38:04,088
Yes! An impassioned witness
can't be trusted.

1696
02:38:04,261 --> 02:38:09,699
All those men want to escape.
Would you execute them all?

1697
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:11,765
- Why you...
- Enough!

1698
02:38:12,836 --> 02:38:16,602
Whether it was or wasn't
an escape attempt isn't the point.

1699
02:38:16,807 --> 02:38:20,937
All that matters
is that we say it was!

1700
02:38:21,145 --> 02:38:23,238
Arguments will not be tolerated.
Sergeant!

1701
02:38:23,447 --> 02:38:27,850
They're to be executed tomorrow.
You decide how.

1702
02:38:28,051 --> 02:38:30,645
They will be executed
tomorrow, sir!

1703
02:38:35,259 --> 02:38:37,090
I assume you approve.

1704
02:38:44,701 --> 02:38:48,467
You shall officially witness
the execution!

1705
02:39:38,856 --> 02:39:40,721
You'll save seven men's lives

1706
02:39:40,924 --> 02:39:45,020
if you testify
they weren't trying to escape.

1707
02:39:45,863 --> 02:39:48,331
They were trying to escape.
They ran.

1708
02:39:48,532 --> 02:39:53,367
They should have stayed
and taken their beating.

1709
02:39:59,776 --> 02:40:02,301
What's going to happen to us?

1710
02:40:03,146 --> 02:40:09,881
If injuring Okazaki was a crime,
why not just investigate me?

1711
02:40:12,089 --> 02:40:13,021
Listen to me.

1712
02:40:13,757 --> 02:40:16,157
You're all guilty
of attempted escape.

1713
02:40:16,593 --> 02:40:19,756
- Lies!
- You're wronging the innocent!

1714
02:40:19,997 --> 02:40:20,986
Quiet!

1715
02:40:24,668 --> 02:40:26,226
Dog!

1716
02:40:29,873 --> 02:40:32,899
An investigation
will reveal the truth.

1717
02:40:34,144 --> 02:40:35,338
Investigate it!

1718
02:40:35,612 --> 02:40:36,579
Immediately!

1719
02:40:41,585 --> 02:40:44,179
The investigation is over.

1720
02:40:45,822 --> 02:40:51,590
But I don't believe
you tried to escape.

1721
02:40:52,529 --> 02:40:55,896
<i>You're turning us over
to the Kenpeitai?</i>

1722
02:40:57,134 --> 02:40:58,692
I don't intend to.

1723
02:41:00,137 --> 02:41:05,871
But you never
had faith in me before.

1724
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:12,307
Perhaps it's best
to doubt me now as well.

1725
02:41:14,952 --> 02:41:18,410
Those men have all the power!

1726
02:41:19,156 --> 02:41:21,818
I have none!

1727
02:41:26,563 --> 02:41:32,365
I'll do everything I can
until tomorrow evening.

1728
02:41:37,274 --> 02:41:42,109
<i>Sir, if you ask them,
the Kenpeitai will listen to reason.</i>

1729
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:44,679
This is an object lesson, Kaji.

1730
02:41:46,516 --> 02:41:49,713
Personally I don't approve,

1731
02:41:49,886 --> 02:41:54,084
<i>but the head office says
to leave it to the Kenpeitai.</i>

1732
02:41:54,257 --> 02:41:55,349
Why?

1733
02:41:55,525 --> 02:41:57,356
Must there be a reason?

1734
02:41:58,261 --> 02:42:03,460
Please wait! You're about
to chop off men's heads!

1735
02:42:03,634 --> 02:42:06,262
If the company
protested strongly...

1736
02:42:08,572 --> 02:42:11,666
This is wartime.
Peacetime reasoning doesn't apply.

1737
02:42:12,542 --> 02:42:14,305
That's no reason!

1738
02:42:15,278 --> 02:42:20,079
You may not think so, but I do.
You're wasting your breath.

1739
02:42:20,751 --> 02:42:24,619
If you're not satisfied,
speak to the head office.

1740
02:42:26,289 --> 02:42:27,688
I will!

1741
02:42:30,994 --> 02:42:35,090
There's no answer.
He's in a conference.

1742
02:42:37,134 --> 02:42:39,432
Shouting like a madman!

1743
02:42:40,737 --> 02:42:43,797
Hello? One moment, please.

1744
02:42:44,074 --> 02:42:46,201
Someone else
will take your call.

1745
02:42:46,543 --> 02:42:50,274
Okishima?
We're in real trouble.

1746
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:52,505
You've heard?

1747
02:42:57,688 --> 02:42:59,212
Hello? Hello?

1748
02:42:59,423 --> 02:43:01,482
I can't hear you!

1749
02:43:02,292 --> 02:43:04,522
Speak louder!

1750
02:43:05,162 --> 02:43:07,357
I can't hear you at all.

1751
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:11,792
What's that?

1752
02:43:13,103 --> 02:43:14,730
Give up?

1753
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:16,869
That's ridiculous!

1754
02:43:17,074 --> 02:43:20,976
Okishima,
please talk to them again.

1755
02:43:21,878 --> 02:43:25,814
Please try again.
I'll be waiting.

1756
02:43:39,930 --> 02:43:44,697
I'll be honest. There's only
one chance in a hundred.

1757
02:43:45,168 --> 02:43:47,932
This does not
concern us alone.

1758
02:43:48,138 --> 02:43:52,837
Just as my companions
stand between life and death,

1759
02:43:53,043 --> 02:43:56,706
so do you now stand
at an important crossroads.

1760
02:43:57,247 --> 02:43:58,578
You're right.

1761
02:43:58,782 --> 02:44:04,414
If you fail now,
no one will ever trust you again,

1762
02:44:04,621 --> 02:44:07,988
and you too will lose
faith in yourself.

1763
02:44:08,658 --> 02:44:10,125
It's true.

1764
02:44:10,293 --> 02:44:12,591
Yet you would do nothing?

1765
02:44:12,763 --> 02:44:14,355
What can I do?

1766
02:44:14,531 --> 02:44:20,436
Must a man outside this barbed wire
ask me such a question?

1767
02:44:23,206 --> 02:44:28,109
Not all the Japanese working here
are murderous devils.

1768
02:44:28,311 --> 02:44:32,543
Their combined opinion
objecting to this execution

1769
02:44:32,749 --> 02:44:36,276
will be more effective
than one individual alone.

1770
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:40,620
If I'd always acted
as you wanted me to,

1771
02:44:40,824 --> 02:44:44,191
there'd be no Kaji here today.

1772
02:44:44,694 --> 02:44:50,189
I'd like to see
what you'd do in my position.

1773
02:44:50,367 --> 02:44:55,327
You and I will both make
minor mistakes.

1774
02:44:55,539 --> 02:44:58,167
Such things can be forgiven.

1775
02:44:58,375 --> 02:45:04,371
But an error made at a crucial
moment is an unforgivable crime.

1776
02:45:04,981 --> 02:45:08,542
Your life has been
a series of errors

1777
02:45:08,752 --> 02:45:13,655
stemming from the conflict
between your work and yourself.

1778
02:45:13,857 --> 02:45:16,849
Such errors can possibly
be corrected.

1779
02:45:17,027 --> 02:45:20,690
But this one cannot.

1780
02:45:21,364 --> 02:45:22,331
Meaning?

1781
02:45:22,499 --> 02:45:28,369
You'll either be revealed as a murderer
wearing the mask of humanism

1782
02:45:28,939 --> 02:45:32,966
or as one worthy
of the beautiful name..."man."

1783
02:45:35,745 --> 02:45:37,610
I know that.

1784
02:45:38,048 --> 02:45:43,042
You have less faith in man
than you try to believe.

1785
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:45,513
Regardless of how
you might feel,

1786
02:45:45,722 --> 02:45:52,525
true men will always find
kindred spirits!

1787
02:46:50,153 --> 02:46:52,678
What will happen to Kao?

1788
02:46:54,891 --> 02:46:58,190
I wish I knew myself.

1789
02:46:59,562 --> 02:47:06,058
When will you release him?

1790
02:47:06,503 --> 02:47:11,270
You won't kill Kao, will you?

1791
02:47:13,376 --> 02:47:17,403
You won't, will you?

1792
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:25,982
Hello? Okishima?
What's the decision?

1793
02:47:26,189 --> 02:47:28,316
<i>Calm down and listen.</i>

1794
02:47:28,491 --> 02:47:33,258
<i>The manager is no help,
the old fool.</i>

1795
02:47:34,898 --> 02:47:38,129
<i>Wait until morning.
I'll talk to the chairman.</i>

1796
02:47:38,335 --> 02:47:39,666
The chairman?

1797
02:47:39,869 --> 02:47:43,600
<i>Yes, the chairman!
I'll make him listen to me.</i>

1798
02:48:04,060 --> 02:48:06,494
Please go away.

1799
02:48:09,232 --> 02:48:12,133
I want to be alone.

1800
02:48:15,205 --> 02:48:16,672
Mr. Kaji!

1801
02:48:18,141 --> 02:48:19,870
Please save him!

1802
02:48:20,343 --> 02:48:22,072
Save him!

1803
02:48:25,648 --> 02:48:27,275
He wouldn't try to escape!

1804
02:48:30,253 --> 02:48:36,192
We planned to be married
after the war ended.

1805
02:48:38,661 --> 02:48:42,324
You won't kill him, will you?
You're a good man.

1806
02:48:42,499 --> 02:48:45,059
You won't kill him, will you?

1807
02:49:14,631 --> 02:49:18,123
Go to sleep
and stop worrying.

1808
02:49:21,905 --> 02:49:23,998
I won't do anything.

1809
02:49:25,275 --> 02:49:28,210
There's nothing I can do.

1810
02:49:33,950 --> 02:49:36,714
Can I really set
my mind at ease?

1811
02:49:38,488 --> 02:49:39,750
Really?

1812
02:49:42,826 --> 02:49:45,727
Go to sleep
and don't worry.

1813
02:49:52,235 --> 02:49:54,203
I'll try to sleep too.

1814
02:50:27,470 --> 02:50:29,199
Where are you going?

1815
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:35,004
Where are you going?

1816
02:50:35,211 --> 02:50:37,008
To free those men.

1817
02:50:37,213 --> 02:50:40,011
You can't!
Think what might happen to you!

1818
02:50:40,216 --> 02:50:41,843
I don't care!

1819
02:50:42,719 --> 02:50:45,210
You did everything you could.

1820
02:50:45,421 --> 02:50:48,413
Don't you care
what happens to you?

1821
02:50:48,625 --> 02:50:50,217
Well, I do!

1822
02:50:50,426 --> 02:50:52,291
Michiko, don't torment me!

1823
02:50:55,899 --> 02:51:00,666
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it.

1824
02:51:01,037 --> 02:51:05,201
You always go your own way,
and perhaps you're right.

1825
02:51:05,408 --> 02:51:10,744
But if you free those men,
they'll kill you for sure!

1826
02:51:10,947 --> 02:51:14,178
Please don't go!

1827
02:51:15,218 --> 02:51:18,779
I'll follow you!
I'll shout for help!

1828
02:51:18,988 --> 02:51:22,515
Michiko, if I don't,
I'm no longer a human being!

1829
02:51:27,797 --> 02:51:33,326
How can you ignore me
like some stray dog?

1830
02:51:34,204 --> 02:51:38,800
Even you don't want
to give up this life, do you?

1831
02:51:39,075 --> 02:51:41,805
Remember: You promised!

1832
02:52:37,333 --> 02:52:39,028
I'm sorry.

1833
02:52:40,203 --> 02:52:42,797
Go and do as you see fit.

1834
02:52:45,341 --> 02:52:48,435
Perhaps it's me who's wrong.

1835
02:52:48,878 --> 02:52:52,609
I can't have you feeling
I stood in your way.

1836
02:52:52,949 --> 02:52:57,852
I don't want you hating me,
not loving me anymore.

1837
02:52:59,822 --> 02:53:01,687
There's no hope for me!

1838
02:53:44,534 --> 02:53:46,525
- All ready!
- Good work.

1839
02:53:53,843 --> 02:53:57,074
Spare us!

1840
02:54:21,738 --> 02:54:25,640
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.

1841
02:54:26,476 --> 02:54:27,704
Kaji!

1842
02:54:32,081 --> 02:54:33,878
Stay right there.

1843
02:54:34,817 --> 02:54:36,842
Thanks for being my witness.

1844
02:54:40,523 --> 02:54:42,286
Get up!

1845
02:55:07,984 --> 02:55:09,576
On your knees!

1846
02:55:49,392 --> 02:55:50,723
Kaji...

1847
02:55:51,994 --> 02:55:54,121
you can tell them all later:

1848
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:56,798
If they want to die,
they can run all they like.

1849
02:55:59,435 --> 02:56:00,959
Next!

1850
02:56:05,208 --> 02:56:08,336
Spare me!

1851
02:56:38,574 --> 02:56:40,303
Want to try?

1852
02:56:44,413 --> 02:56:45,846
Next!

1853
02:56:52,655 --> 02:56:55,180
I don't want it!

1854
02:56:56,759 --> 02:56:59,057
I demand an explanation!

1855
02:56:59,662 --> 02:57:02,597
Why are we being executed?

1856
02:57:02,765 --> 02:57:04,164
Son of a bitch!

1857
02:57:07,169 --> 02:57:09,228
Japanese devils!

1858
02:57:09,405 --> 02:57:10,394
Stand up!

1859
02:57:12,475 --> 02:57:14,204
I'll go by myself!

1860
02:57:26,622 --> 02:57:28,180
Inhuman wretch!

1861
02:57:29,091 --> 02:57:32,390
This is your true form!

1862
02:57:38,935 --> 02:57:41,028
The face of a man...

1863
02:57:42,104 --> 02:57:43,628
but the heart of a beast!

1864
02:57:53,215 --> 02:57:55,911
Good! You show some grit.

1865
02:58:29,018 --> 02:58:31,282
Stay calm! Slash him!

1866
02:58:32,455 --> 02:58:35,686
The Chinese nation...

1867
02:58:35,858 --> 02:58:37,951
will live forever!

1868
02:58:59,815 --> 02:59:02,545
Don't think of it
as a human head.

1869
02:59:02,718 --> 02:59:05,812
Take a rest and try again.

1870
02:59:07,223 --> 02:59:08,155
Next!

1871
02:59:08,491 --> 02:59:11,255
Spare my life!

1872
02:59:16,932 --> 02:59:18,422
Wait!

1873
02:59:19,935 --> 02:59:21,095
No more!

1874
02:59:21,837 --> 02:59:22,929
What?

1875
02:59:23,706 --> 02:59:25,401
Please stop!

1876
02:59:25,574 --> 02:59:28,839
Stay out of this
or I'll kill you too!

1877
02:59:29,011 --> 02:59:32,811
I'm not afraid any longer.
Kill me if you dare!

1878
02:59:33,382 --> 02:59:35,350
I'll be happy to oblige.

1879
02:59:36,052 --> 02:59:39,180
Enemy sympathizers
deserve to be killed.

1880
02:59:55,538 --> 02:59:57,768
We won't let them kill
our countrymen!

1881
02:59:58,174 --> 02:59:59,038
Stop them!

1882
02:59:59,442 --> 03:00:02,934
You're killing innocent men!

1883
03:00:11,320 --> 03:00:13,083
Murderers! Murderers!

1884
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:54,523
Murderers! Murderers!

1885
03:01:51,020 --> 03:01:52,681
Private!

1886
03:01:54,723 --> 03:01:57,317
Very well.
The execution is called off.

1887
03:02:09,572 --> 03:02:14,703
Go back and join
the others, quickly!

1888
03:02:16,478 --> 03:02:18,537
Take them back!

1889
03:03:18,574 --> 03:03:20,041
Kaji!

1890
03:03:24,947 --> 03:03:27,108
We're taking you
to headquarters.

1891
03:04:00,983 --> 03:04:06,216
Pvt. Tanaka, take special care
of our honored guest.

1892
03:04:07,856 --> 03:04:10,120
I'll return later. Go.

1893
03:05:20,062 --> 03:05:22,257
Kaji won't be
coming home today.

1894
03:05:44,920 --> 03:05:46,979
Did something happen?

1895
03:05:47,256 --> 03:05:49,156
Did something happen?

1896
03:05:49,792 --> 03:05:52,818
He refused to let me
behead those enemy dogs.

1897
03:05:53,095 --> 03:05:56,553
He may not be back for a while.
It all depends.

1898
03:06:01,603 --> 03:06:03,537
Did he hide anything?

1899
03:06:04,073 --> 03:06:05,563
No.

1900
03:06:08,677 --> 03:06:12,306
No wonder.
Books by damn Westerners.

1901
03:06:13,615 --> 03:06:15,742
Open the desk drawers.

1902
03:06:27,229 --> 03:06:30,426
Place everything
on top of the desk.

1903
03:07:02,397 --> 03:07:04,126
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1904
03:07:30,225 --> 03:07:33,126
How about it?

1905
03:07:34,129 --> 03:07:37,223
Wouldn't it be smarter
to confess everything?

1906
03:07:40,602 --> 03:07:45,630
I only regret that I let you
behead the first three.

1907
03:07:45,841 --> 03:07:48,071
You don't say!

1908
03:07:54,082 --> 03:07:56,312
You're a hopeless case.

1909
03:08:16,138 --> 03:08:17,765
Pvt. Tanaka...

1910
03:08:19,308 --> 03:08:22,368
you should show
our guest more courtesy.

1911
03:08:25,113 --> 03:08:28,446
Kaji, don't you miss your wife?

1912
03:08:30,953 --> 03:08:35,322
She was crying. She'll have
no one to ride her at night.

1913
03:08:35,524 --> 03:08:37,685
What have I done?

1914
03:08:39,094 --> 03:08:40,959
I'm no monster.

1915
03:08:41,163 --> 03:08:45,623
I'd like to put you back
on top of your wife tonight,

1916
03:08:45,801 --> 03:08:51,398
but for that I'd need
more cooperation from you.

1917
03:08:54,309 --> 03:08:55,799
What's so funny?

1918
03:08:56,011 --> 03:09:00,812
I don't pick pockets. I don't steal.
I have nothing to confess.

1919
03:09:01,016 --> 03:09:02,483
Very interesting.

1920
03:09:03,185 --> 03:09:06,211
Then don't confess
until I make you.

1921
03:09:09,291 --> 03:09:11,725
Show off your bravado
while you can.

1922
03:09:13,362 --> 03:09:17,423
You let 18 POWs escape
and failed to report it, didn't you?

1923
03:09:20,102 --> 03:09:22,696
Is it so funny
you can't even answer?

1924
03:09:22,904 --> 03:09:26,533
I didn't report it,
but I never let them escape.

1925
03:09:27,909 --> 03:09:31,777
You used that chink Chen
to contact the prisoners.

1926
03:09:32,047 --> 03:09:36,916
Show me evidence. Or will you
lose face if you can't prove it?

1927
03:09:37,085 --> 03:09:38,643
Son of a bitch!

1928
03:09:59,608 --> 03:10:01,508
Did you want something?

1929
03:10:01,677 --> 03:10:03,269
No.

1930
03:10:03,545 --> 03:10:07,174
I just didn't expect things
to come to this.

1931
03:10:07,783 --> 03:10:10,274
Quarrels over work
are one thing.

1932
03:10:10,485 --> 03:10:14,615
I didn't intend for others
to do my fighting for me.

1933
03:10:15,157 --> 03:10:16,556
So I came to...

1934
03:10:16,725 --> 03:10:18,317
I understand.

1935
03:10:18,860 --> 03:10:21,761
I never thought
Kaji would do such a thing.

1936
03:10:24,399 --> 03:10:26,299
Do what?

1937
03:10:26,868 --> 03:10:28,927
Oh... nothing.

1938
03:10:29,104 --> 03:10:32,073
I don't know
what other people think,

1939
03:10:32,240 --> 03:10:36,438
but I know that whatever Kaji did,
he alone could do.

1940
03:10:37,145 --> 03:10:41,673
I see. If that's how you feel,
you can do as you please.

1941
03:10:41,850 --> 03:10:46,514
I just dropped by to see
if I could help in any way.

1942
03:10:46,722 --> 03:10:49,213
I won't be asking
for your help.

1943
03:10:49,524 --> 03:10:51,355
What you can do

1944
03:10:51,560 --> 03:10:55,519
is admit that those men
were not trying to escape.

1945
03:10:56,732 --> 03:11:01,260
Admit it! You and Wang Heng Li
plotted their escape.

1946
03:11:01,470 --> 03:11:03,028
Didn't you?

1947
03:11:07,242 --> 03:11:09,676
Why don't you answer?

1948
03:11:11,413 --> 03:11:16,646
Wang Heng Li was arrested.
He confessed everything.

1949
03:11:18,387 --> 03:11:20,048
Wang was arrested?

1950
03:11:22,190 --> 03:11:24,215
Only his execution remains.

1951
03:11:26,928 --> 03:11:28,919
When will it be?

1952
03:11:29,231 --> 03:11:33,634
Worried?
He was your friend, wasn't he?

1953
03:11:35,404 --> 03:11:40,706
He instigated the uprising
at your suggestion, didn't he?

1954
03:11:40,909 --> 03:11:42,501
When is he to die?

1955
03:11:42,711 --> 03:11:44,542
Why don't you answer?

1956
03:11:46,314 --> 03:11:47,838
Very well.

1957
03:11:48,049 --> 03:11:51,280
Today I'll make you
weep like a woman.

1958
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:54,115
That'll be something
for your wife to hear!

1959
03:12:09,538 --> 03:12:11,972
WANG HENG LI
In Memoriam

1960
03:12:21,249 --> 03:12:22,773
Wang...

1961
03:12:24,653 --> 03:12:27,884
in the end you died
without seeing the dawn.

1962
03:12:32,327 --> 03:12:34,227
But your countrymen...

1963
03:12:35,931 --> 03:12:41,528
will surely bury you
by the light of the newborn day.

1964
03:13:03,258 --> 03:13:05,658
Get out here.

1965
03:13:06,928 --> 03:13:08,225
Come on.

1966
03:13:33,021 --> 03:13:34,488
Go inside.

1967
03:14:07,856 --> 03:14:11,622
Kiss her.
Don't let me stop you.

1968
03:14:14,396 --> 03:14:17,297
Michiko,
you mustn't come here.

1969
03:14:17,465 --> 03:14:19,194
Don't worry. Go home.

1970
03:14:21,336 --> 03:14:25,238
I brought some sushi.
May I give it to him?

1971
03:14:29,244 --> 03:14:30,677
Go ahead.

1972
03:14:59,574 --> 03:15:01,041
Won't you have some?

1973
03:15:36,044 --> 03:15:37,534
Michiko...

1974
03:15:38,380 --> 03:15:43,283
if you ever need help,
talk to Okishima.

1975
03:15:43,852 --> 03:15:46,446
Okishima,
I'm counting on you.

1976
03:15:48,623 --> 03:15:50,750
Mr. Okishima...

1977
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:53,819
is being transferred.

1978
03:15:58,066 --> 03:15:59,795
I came to say good-bye.

1979
03:16:00,468 --> 03:16:01,833
I see.

1980
03:16:03,071 --> 03:16:05,904
I'm sorry I wasn't
any help on the phone.

1981
03:16:07,709 --> 03:16:12,510
I argued with the manager.
I'm being shipped out to a smaller mine.

1982
03:16:14,382 --> 03:16:16,145
So that's how it is.

1983
03:16:18,586 --> 03:16:22,647
I'd have liked to stick around
and fight with you some more.

1984
03:16:27,529 --> 03:16:30,054
Furuya's taking over my spot.

1985
03:16:32,667 --> 03:16:34,897
We're back to square one.

1986
03:16:40,475 --> 03:16:43,035
Is there anything you'd like?

1987
03:16:45,146 --> 03:16:46,613
Nothing.

1988
03:16:49,951 --> 03:16:53,443
So... I won't be seeing you again?

1989
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:59,957
I learned so much from you.

1990
03:17:01,896 --> 03:17:05,024
No, it's me
who learned from you.

1991
03:17:05,867 --> 03:17:09,132
Though you've paid
a bitter price,

1992
03:17:09,337 --> 03:17:13,467
you finally caught
the humanism train.

1993
03:17:20,515 --> 03:17:23,177
Oh, yes. Wang Heng Li...

1994
03:17:23,384 --> 03:17:25,477
No unauthorized conversation!

1995
03:17:27,055 --> 03:17:29,421
Your time is up.

1996
03:17:29,691 --> 03:17:30,623
Private!

1997
03:17:40,101 --> 03:17:41,534
Michiko!

1998
03:18:03,691 --> 03:18:07,127
You're hereby released
by special permission.

1999
03:18:11,366 --> 03:18:13,800
But don't think
you're out of the woods.

2000
03:18:14,536 --> 03:18:18,472
Remember:
I'll always be watching you.

2001
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:22,837
Wherever you go,
I'll be there first.

2002
03:19:13,995 --> 03:19:15,758
Reporting back, sir.

2003
03:19:17,098 --> 03:19:19,191
It arrived, Kaji.

2004
03:19:33,047 --> 03:19:36,915
EMERGENCY SUMMONS
TO MILITARY SERVICE

2005
03:19:48,563 --> 03:19:50,497
I knew something was up.

2006
03:19:51,466 --> 03:19:55,402
So you use me up
and then throw me out.

2007
03:19:57,105 --> 03:20:00,768
I can't afford to lose you,

2008
03:20:01,142 --> 03:20:03,110
but there's nothing I can do.

2009
03:20:04,779 --> 03:20:06,804
Forget the smooth talk!

2010
03:20:08,182 --> 03:20:10,582
Nice way to get rid
of those you don't want.

2011
03:20:10,785 --> 03:20:14,744
There's nothing I can do.
Now I see the light.

2012
03:20:14,989 --> 03:20:19,517
I should have trusted the whores
instead of the managers here!

2013
03:20:25,233 --> 03:20:28,999
I know you're tired,
but turn your duties over to Furuya.

2014
03:20:29,470 --> 03:20:33,167
He needs to find a new leader
among the special laborers.

2015
03:20:33,374 --> 03:20:37,743
Since Wang Heng Li escaped,
no one wants to lead them.

2016
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:40,547
Escaped?

2017
03:20:41,749 --> 03:20:44,183
Wang Heng Li escaped?

2018
03:20:44,552 --> 03:20:46,782
Thirty of them got away.

2019
03:20:55,930 --> 03:20:58,125
So he made it after all!

2020
03:20:58,666 --> 03:21:00,497
Good for you, Wang!

2021
03:21:03,137 --> 03:21:06,265
I hope they all get away!

2022
03:21:11,346 --> 03:21:14,747
Sir, please inform Furuya

2023
03:21:15,149 --> 03:21:20,109
that he's been spared a thorough
beating thanks to Wang's escape.

2024
03:21:20,355 --> 03:21:25,122
I was going over there to thrash him,
not hand over my duties.

2025
03:21:27,495 --> 03:21:31,761
But I've suddenly
changed my mind.

2026
03:21:32,767 --> 03:21:37,261
I guess a man finds
kindred spirits after all.

2027
03:21:40,641 --> 03:21:41,665
Japanese devil!

2028
03:21:44,645 --> 03:21:45,873
Japanese devil!

2029
03:21:47,648 --> 03:21:51,880
Kill me...
like you murdered Kao!

2030
03:21:52,954 --> 03:21:57,220
Why don't you kill me,
Japanese devil?

2031
03:21:59,861 --> 03:22:03,058
He murdered
an innocent man!

2032
03:22:03,664 --> 03:22:06,633
He murdered
an innocent man!

2033
03:22:07,235 --> 03:22:08,361
Mr. Kaji.

2034
03:22:11,305 --> 03:22:13,364
Don't be angry.

2035
03:22:14,308 --> 03:22:18,335
I know you have a good heart...

2036
03:22:19,847 --> 03:22:26,514
but you weren't able
to save Kao's life.

2037
03:23:03,391 --> 03:23:05,586
Michiko, you'll fall!

2038
03:23:17,839 --> 03:23:19,773
Welcome back!

2039
03:23:24,112 --> 03:23:28,048
I heard you'd come back
in terrible shape.

2040
03:23:28,916 --> 03:23:32,181
But it's not true.
You look well.

2041
03:23:32,386 --> 03:23:33,853
I'm so happy!

2042
03:23:34,689 --> 03:23:36,350
So very happy!

2043
03:23:39,127 --> 03:23:40,788
What's this?

2044
03:23:42,463 --> 03:23:44,260
They wouldn't!

2045
03:23:45,533 --> 03:23:48,127
No, it's not fair!

2046
03:23:49,237 --> 03:23:51,831
They promised you
an exemption.

2047
03:23:52,039 --> 03:23:53,700
This is a dirty trick!

2048
03:23:55,810 --> 03:23:58,278
This is too much.

2049
03:23:58,980 --> 03:24:01,005
It's not fair.

2050
03:24:05,553 --> 03:24:09,887
Nothing can be done now.

2051
03:24:11,659 --> 03:24:14,219
What did you do to deserve this?

2052
03:24:15,496 --> 03:24:17,259
Nothing.

2053
03:24:19,433 --> 03:24:24,370
But I'd hoped to accomplish things
with you when I returned.

2054
03:24:32,246 --> 03:24:35,647
Why must these terrible
things happen to you?

2055
03:24:39,453 --> 03:24:41,785
What have you done
to deserve this?

2056
03:24:43,524 --> 03:24:45,719
You're so thin,

2057
03:24:45,927 --> 03:24:48,293
so covered with scars.

2058
03:24:51,465 --> 03:24:54,195
And now they're dragging you
off to war.

2059
03:25:02,143 --> 03:25:04,077
You mustn't die.

2060
03:25:05,012 --> 03:25:07,139
We must live again.

2061
03:25:08,382 --> 03:25:12,341
When will we meet again?

2062
03:25:16,290 --> 03:25:20,386
You'll come back.
I know you will.

2063
03:25:20,962 --> 03:25:22,190
<i>Japanese devil!</i>

2064
03:25:25,466 --> 03:25:27,195
Japanese devil!

2065
03:25:29,070 --> 03:25:30,537
Japanese devil!

2066
03:25:31,005 --> 03:25:32,438
I hope you die!

Michiko, let's go home.

2068
03:25:38,613 --> 03:25:41,343
We still have

Japanese devil!
