19
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,432
What you are saying
are not good reasons for a divorce.

20
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,143
- If there is something else let me know.
- Like what?

21
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,522
Like if he is an addict, beats you
or does not give you an allowance.

22
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:49,984
Nothing like that.
He is a good, decent person.

23
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,111
Then why do you want a divorce?

24
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,863
He won't come with me.

25
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,409
If he does
I'll cancel my request for a divorce.

26
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,621
- Will you come?
- No, I won't.

27
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,457
- Why not, your honour?
- You know why.

28
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,001
No I don't.
Please explain again why.

29
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,046
Let her explain why we should move
abroad in these circumstances.

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,548
- You give me one reason to stay.
- I'll give you a thousand.

31
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:16,260
- Just one.
- My father. I can't leave him.

32
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,428
But you can leave your wife?

33
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:20,181
- When did I leave you?
- You brought me here.

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,349
You filed for a divorce.

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,518
When you tell your wife and child
to leave, isn't that leaving them?

36
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,063
Your honour, didn't he just say
leave if you want?

37
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,606
Yes and I'll say it again.

38
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,192
If you don't want to stay
I can't keep you by force.

39
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,235
Keep your voice down.
Calm down.

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,489
One day you came to live with me.
Today you don't.

41
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,158
- When you prefer...
- What does "you prefer" mean?

42
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,951
This was something we both started.

43
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:45,539
Your honour, after 18 months of running
around and expenses, we got our visa.

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,418
It has been six months now
and it will expire in 40 days.

45
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,295
Why should we lose this opportunity?

46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,883
You don't want to lose this opportunity,
then make a suggestion.

47
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,093
You know my situation.

48
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,178
Tell us what to do, your honour.

49
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,890
- His father is his excuse...
- He is not my excuse. He's the reason.

50
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,767
- Let me speak.
- Calm down.

51
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:08,020
His father has Alzheimer's.
He doesn't even know that he's his son.

52
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:12,525
- What difference does it make to him?
- Why are you saying that?

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,568
Does he even realise you are his son?

54
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,612
I know he is my father.

55
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,782
Your daughter or her future
is not important to you?

56
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:23,744
Who said anything about our daughter?
Why do you think only you care?

57
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:27,498
So the children living in this country
don't have a future?

58
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,960
As a mother, I'd rather she didn't
grow up in these circumstances.

59
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,587
What circumstances?

60
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,468
Is she better off here with both her
parents or there without a father?

61
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:42,304
That's why I want him to come.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,432
I can't leave.

63
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,892
How many times do I have to say it?

64
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:50,438
He can't come.
So what happens to me?

65
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,065
Nothing. Go back to your life.

66
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,193
If I could
I wouldn't file for a divorce.

67
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,114
Consent has to be mutual.

68
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,116
He just gave his.

69
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,534
Do you agree to a divorce?

70
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,538
If she prefers to leave her family
to go live abroad, yes I do.

71
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,540
He agrees.

72
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,417
What about my daughter?

73
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,837
You have to agree on everything.
How old is your daughter?

74
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,047
11 in two weeks.

75
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,259
She can't leave
without her father's permission.

76
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,136
He won't give permission.

77
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,096
That's between you two.

78
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,099
Please sign here and good day.

79
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,059
Your honour, I came here
for you to solve my problem.

80
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,644
Please sign here.

81
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,812
You too.

82
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:34,607
- Where should I sign?
- Here.

83
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,735
He can have everything,
I just want my daughter.

84
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,697
Our daughter is attached to me.
She doesn't even want to go with you.

85
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,158
- She doesn't know better.
- Why not?

86
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,619
She is 11 years old.

87
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,747
Please sign here
and don't take the court's time.

88
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,125
- No one knows better except you.
- No, you're the one who knows better.

89
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,421
Your honour, what should I do?
I only have 40 days.

90
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,548
You can't file for a divorce
over every little problem.

91
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,050
A little problem?

92
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,385
My problem is not little.

93
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,223
It is my daughter.

94
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,767
She is his daughter too.
He has rights too.

95
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,561
My finding is that your problem
is a small problem.

96
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,855
Please sign here and good day.

97
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,280
Nader and Simin, A Separation

Producer, Writer, Director
Asghar Farhadi

99
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,774
You said the second floor.

100
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,442
This is the second floor.

101
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,610
Then what's that?

102
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:05,489
That's the ground floor, that's the first.
This is the second.

103
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,325
The price we gave was for two floors.

104
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,286
But the buyer will pay you.

105
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,662
Only for two floors.

106
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,748
I don't understand what you're saying.

107
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,000
Call the buyer.

108
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,919
This is three floors.

109
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,340
I'll pay for one floor.
Let me pass.

110
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,130
Excuse me, ma'am?

111
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,262
Go tell your dad
they want to leave.

112
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,639
Why don't you tell him?

113
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,350
What did I say?

114
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,392
Didn't we agree?

115
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm studying.

116
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:31,617
Hello.

117
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,952
Hello, ma'am.

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,497
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,502
I don't know how much you know.

120
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:46,131
The work is taking care of my father.

121
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,300
There is some housework too,

122
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:52,388
but the main work is giving him
his medication on time,

123
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:57,184
keeping him away from the stove,
from leaving the house.

124
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,270
Termeh, get your laundry.

125
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:05,317
You have to be here at 7:30
so I can go to work.

126
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,820
7:30 is too early.

127
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,323
I'll have to leave my house at 5
to get here by then.

128
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:12,992
Can you make it by 87?

129
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,660
I don't know.

130
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,955
8 is good too.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,332
Ring the upstairs bell.

132
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,669
I'll leave the house keys up here.

133
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,920
- OK?
- Yes.

134
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,297
Can you pay us please?

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,091
What's the pay per month?

136
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,509
She'll be right there.

137
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:31,802
300,000 a month.

138
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,554
That's too little.

139
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,472
No, that's the rate.

140
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,391
Ask around.
The commute is far.

141
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,309
Several bus lines.

142
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,145
It's what I can afford.

143
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,481
If you agree
you can start tomorrow.

144
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:45,899
Can I let you know tomorrow?

145
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,277
They might need this too.

146
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,570
I don't have change.

147
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,988
You have till the afternoon.

148
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,158
There is someone else I can hire
if you can't come.

149
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,201
OK.

150
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,329
Termeh! Your laundry!

151
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,891
You're not coming?

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,109
- Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

153
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,780
All this for just 2 weeks?

154
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:44,083
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,672
Which setting does she use?

156
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,966
Should I go ask her?

157
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,887
You want to make me look bad?

158
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,811
- Simin, where're you going?
- I'll be right back.

159
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,065
Just to the corner.
I'll be right back.

160
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,861
I'll come back.

161
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,614
I have an appointment.

162
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,282
Four.

163
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,201
Why four?

164
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,203
Because it has faded.

165
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:25,541
She must have used it the most.

166
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,128
Four it is.

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,674
From now on
we'll set everything on four.

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,884
She is really leaving.

169
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,386
She'll be back.

170
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,554
Termeh!

171
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,765
Come stay with your grandfather.

172
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,819
Dad?

173
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,447
Termeh, honey, go to your room.

174
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,200
Dad, get up.

175
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,202
Let go of her hand.

176
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:06,665
Get up.
I want to take you to the bathroom.

177
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,839
Where are you taking me?

178
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,551
The bathroom
and then to get the paper.

179
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,262
Darling, I said go to your room...

180
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,893
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

181
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,982
Don't put your hand there.

182
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,594
I'm taking this CD.

183
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,430
Take whichever you want.

184
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,432
No, just this one.

185
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,826
Bye.

186
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,488
I thought you live there too.

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,991
No, I've moved to my mum's.

188
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,537
This is a bit difficult.

189
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,081
No, you can trust him.

190
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,418
Don't worry about these things.

191
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,878
Besides, he won't be around.

192
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:22,009
He leaves early
and comes back when you leave.

193
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,139
Do bring your daughter.
She'll keep my daughter company

194
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,599
and I'll feel better.

195
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,357
Tell your sister-in-law
your decision.

196
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,759
Where are you going?

197
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,902
What's this?

198
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:07,697
Oxygen.

199
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,282
What's oxygen?

200
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,284
Get away.
You'll wake him.

201
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,526
I can't hear anything.

202
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,787
What is it doing?

203
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,926
Hello.

204
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:11,636
Where do you want to go?

205
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,638
- The paper.
- What?

206
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,724
I want the paper.

207
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,810
The paper is in your room.

208
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,397
Come, I'll take you to your room.

209
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:31,323
I'll take you to your room
and get your meal.

210
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,665
Mummy...

211
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,001
he's peed in his pants.

212
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:50,884
Sit on the bed.

213
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,182
What's that?

214
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,981
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,319
Go get your shoes.
You can see the floor's wet.

216
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,949
He'd say when he needed to go...

217
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,870
Take him to the bathroom...

218
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,086
I can't come till 12. I have class.

219
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,340
Call my husband.

220
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,342
Do you have his number?

221
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,178
Write it down.

222
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,430
There's a pen by the phone.

223
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,988
If I bring you some pants
can you change?

224
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,199
Your clothes, can you change them?

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,368
Simin?

226
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,036
Can you wash yourself?

227
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,204
Simin?

228
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,967
Here are your clothes.

229
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,930
Wash yourself and put them on.

230
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,100
I put your towel here.

231
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,102
- OK?
- Yes.

232
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,355
Clean yourself up.

233
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,567
Put your pants in there.

234
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,324
Will you manage?

235
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,087
Your pants.

236
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,006
Take them off.

237
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,884
Wear the ones I gave you.

238
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,552
OK?

239
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,685
Simin...

240
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,093
Hello.
I had a religious question.

241
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,136
I am working in a house.

242
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:44,474
There is an old man
I am supposed to care for.

243
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,184
I wanted to ask...

244
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,604
Pardon me,
but he has wet his pants.

245
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:54,651
I wanted to know if I change him,
will it count as a sin?

246
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,861
No one is here.

247
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:03,702
He's 70 or 80 years old
and he's senile...

248
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:12,502
The urgency is that the poor guy
has been sitting like this for half an hour.

249
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:13,753
I can...?

250
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,473
I won't tell dad.

251
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,685
My angel.

252
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,148
Get up.

253
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,776
Open your legs.

254
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:41,072
OK, now take off your pants.

255
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,175
Card!

256
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,645
Everyone's staring.

257
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,564
Let them.

258
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,483
- How much?
- 37.5.

259
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,651
- Any change?
- He didn't give it.

260
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,279
- You asked?
- It's his tip.

261
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,031
Tip?
Sir, wait one sec.

262
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,243
A tip is for when he pumps the gas.
Go get it.

263
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,912
- Dad!
- Quick!

264
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,331
Wait.

265
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,772
Here.

266
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,191
Keep it.

267
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,359
Really?

268
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,876
Hello.

269
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,044
Hello, Termeh.

270
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,337
Hello.

271
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:23,007
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

272
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,803
I'll get my books.

273
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,555
And your test results.

274
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,974
- How are you, Ms Qahraei?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

275
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,976
Fine, thanks.

276
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
Sorry we're late.

277
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,354
It's OK.
How's your wife?

278
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:39,315
- Good, thank you.
- We'll get started.

279
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,610
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

280
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,321
How are you, Dad?

281
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:47,740
- Hi, young lady.
- Hello.

282
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,742
Here's the paper.

283
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:56,040
Did you read the paper for him
or did he read it for you?

284
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,043
Son...

285
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,421
Ali is married.

286
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,923
- Who's Ali?
- Ali.

287
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,759
Yeah, Ali's married.
Termeh, hurry.

288
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,845
His oxygen valve wasn't shut.

289
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,222
He must've opened it.

290
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:14,475
From tomorrow tighten it a bit more
so he can't open it.

291
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,561
Sorry, but...

292
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,272
I can't come anymore.

293
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,317
Didn't we say every day?

294
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,027
The commute is too much.

295
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,155
I turned someone else away.
It's 4pm.

296
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,949
How can I find someone now
for tomorrow morning?

297
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,702
It's too much work.

298
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:36,039
Really I can't.
The work is heavy, I can't.

299
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,960
Come to the other room, please.

300
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:44,505
- Somayeh, where's your scarf?
- It's here.

301
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:49,510
Maybe you're tired
because it's your first day.

302
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,596
No.

303
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,182
You were here for a few minutes.
You saw.

304
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:57,644
Somayeh, come get your bag.

305
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,897
Can you please give me that number?

306
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,194
They also do sonograms.

307
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,655
It moved a lot today.

308
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,822
Then it's a boy.

309
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,576
It was kicking in Mummy's tummy.

310
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,454
Because he wants to come out...

311
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,456
To play with me.

312
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,839
Can you write it in here please?

313
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,176
Tell them Qahraei sent you.

314
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,095
They know me.

315
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,099
- Is it a man or a woman?
- A woman.

316
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,476
Call first.

317
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,603
You had to tell me yesterday.

318
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,523
How can I leave him at home
alone tomorrow?

319
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,069
- Where does your mum keep the tea?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,905
You should've told me
I've to clean him.

321
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,240
Clean him?

322
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,784
He soiled his pants today.

323
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,667
It's not right for me to clean him.

324
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,634
Please pay me for today
so I can go.

325
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,147
He always said
when he had to go.

326
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:30,862
There are companies you can call
for a male helper.

327
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,906
I can't just let anyone into my home.

328
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,951
Here.

329
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:39,245
Count it, please.

330
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,080
Sorry, but it's a religious issue.

331
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,331
It's OK.

332
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,459
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,752
Bye.

334
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,420
Goodbye.

335
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,096
Yes?

336
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,015
I wanted to know
if it is OK for me

337
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,976
to give your number to my husband

338
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,062
and tell him I got it out of the paper.

339
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,481
For the housework and your father.

340
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,483
Give him the job description

341
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,401
and if he agrees
tell him to come...

342
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,570
I don't want to tell him
I know you.

343
00:26:12,695 --> 00:26:14,238
I didn't tell him
I was coming here.

344
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,243
Then tell him to call me
or tell him to come here tonight.

345
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:21,579
It's late for tonight.

346
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,331
I'll come tomorrow.

347
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,334
Just don't give the job to anyone else.

348
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,586
You'll see with him for the money.

349
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,421
That's not a problem.
Tell him to call me.

350
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,923
I will arrange to meet him.

351
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,550
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

352
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,761
And thank you.

353
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:48,564
Mr Lavasani?

354
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,400
Go ahead.

355
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,797
Hello. I am Samadi.

356
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,715
- I called about the job.
- Yes, how are you?

357
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,883
Sorry I'm late.

358
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:19,137
It's OK.
Where did you work before?

359
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,471
I was a cobbler.

360
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,849
And you're OK with cleaning him?

361
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,183
With what?

362
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,644
Since yesterday
he's been soiling himself.

363
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,356
I'll treat him like my own father.

364
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,776
But you'll be alone with him
and you have to really watch him.

365
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,069
Your wife won't be there?

366
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:37,780
No, I am single for now.

367
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,786
Excuse me but isn't 300,000
too little for this work?

368
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,371
How much did you have in mind?

369
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,373
Maybe if you could pay 400,000...

370
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,167
I really can't pay that.

371
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,085
I'll come for a few days.

372
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,172
If you like my work,
add something to the 300,000.

373
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,591
- If not don't pay me.
- Here's the address.

374
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,092
I can even start today.

375
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:02,221
No, there's someone there today.
Start tomorrow and bring an ID.

376
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:03,890
Like what?

377
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,143
Any legal ID will do.

378
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:08,936
Pious?

379
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,479
Worshipper.

380
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,772
Barren?

381
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,191
Sandbar.

382
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:14,859
Desert!

383
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,068
Desert.

384
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,195
Insurrection?

385
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,779
Rebellion.

386
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:21,407
Doorbell?

387
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,075
- Razieh.
- No!

388
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,118
Her husband.

389
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,161
Yes.

390
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:33,044
Give the Persian version
of the following words...

391
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,129
- "Maquette"?
- Nemunak.

392
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:36,464
"Compote"?

393
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,673
Khoshaab.

394
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,258
"Guarantee"?

395
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,052
Tazmin, zemanat

396
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,137
That's Arabic, not Persian.

397
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,431
That's what my teacher said.

398
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:46,849
Don't give me that.

399
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:51,562
What's wrong is wrong,
no matter who says what.

400
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:56,359
- For "guarantee" write...
- She'll deduct points.

401
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,526
That's OK, let her.

402
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,613
Write poshivaneh.

403
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,949
Poshtvaneh.

404
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,167
Hello.

405
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,970
What happened? Your husband
was supposed to come today.

406
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,638
Sorry, he couldn't make it.

407
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,182
What about tomorrow?

408
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:30,559
I don't know.
If he doesn't, I'll come.

409
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,688
I hope he won't change his mind
everyday.

410
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,773
No, poor guy wanted to come.

411
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:40,069
Last night, one of his creditors came
with an officer and took him away.

412
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:43,197
Yes but if something comes up
and he can't make it

413
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,699
I need to know in advance.

414
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,326
No, he will definitely come.

415
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:51,831
I'll go see the creditor
and beg him

416
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,833
to release him.

417
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,377
Please lock the door behind me.

418
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,712
Goodbye.

419
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,753
Hi.

420
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,347
Don't step on it.
It is dirty.

421
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,934
Go take the garbage out.

422
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,772
Can you?

423
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:00,107
Yes.

424
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,213
Where will I get you a clean dress?

425
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,508
Take it off!

426
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,635
Take it off!

427
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,641
Mummy...

428
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,226
he's not in his room.

429
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,853
- What?
- He's not in his room.

430
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,107
Go look in the bathroom.

431
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,525
Like that.

432
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,361
Block the ball. OK?

433
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,547
Give me five.

434
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,886
- Grandpa, whose side are you on?
- He's the manager.

435
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,811
Did you see that?

436
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,254
What's wrong?

437
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,256
Sit here.

438
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,726
You OK?

439
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,912
Where've you been?

440
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:45,165
Poor thing has been waiting
for half an hour.

441
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,501
It's a long commute.

442
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,169
Hello.

443
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,507
Also, take the garbage out
with the bin.

444
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:56,552
The bags tear and dirty the stairs.

445
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,222
Yesterday I got dizzy.
I dropped the bag and it tore.

446
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,890
I'll mop the stairs.

447
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,727
Go in.

448
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,395
Let us in.

449
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,111
Let me close the door.

450
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,601
- Mrs...
- She's not there?

451
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,396
- What's her kid's name?
- Somayeh.

452
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:54,443
Don't sit there. It's wet.

453
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,111
Somayeh!

454
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,323
Somayeh!

455
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,878
Mrs Khalani!

456
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:15,589
Knock.

457
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,301
Grandpa!

458
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,969
Mrs Khalani!

459
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,056
Yes.

460
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,891
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

461
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:28,352
Did you see the lady that works for us?

462
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,396
She was mopping the stairs.

463
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,856
- When?
- Before noon.

464
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:36,151
- She's not there?
- No. Thanks.

465
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:39,405
Wait here.
I'll get the keys from the car.

466
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,586
What's wrong?

467
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:56,964
Dad?

468
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,237
Get his feet.

469
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,414
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

470
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,082
Dad!

471
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,681
He's breathing.

472
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:48,932
Don't worry.

473
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,989
Does your arm hurt?
Help me take his shirt off.

474
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,911
Move your arm.

475
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,579
Does it hurt?

476
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,584
Take a step.

477
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:18,629
Walk.

478
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,131
Let's get the paper, Dad.

479
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:22,800
Move your leg.

480
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:29,723
Does it hurt?
Let me see what's happened.

481
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:32,184
Who did this to you?

482
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:36,772
I want to see if your legs are OK.

483
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,527
Let me...
Honey, go to your room.

484
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,780
- Has something happened?
- No. Go out.

485
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,033
She's gone, Dad.

486
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:51,286
Let me see your legs.

487
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,206
Take them off.

488
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,730
Scum!

489
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,816
Honey, did you take money
from the drawer?

490
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,984
No.

491
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,361
OK, go to the kitchen.

492
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:30,826
I told you to go to the kitchen.

493
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,912
You saw that nothing happened.

494
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:37,583
Go on... Close the door.

495
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,823
Hello.

496
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,201
Come here.

497
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,914
Mummy, I'm thirsty.

498
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,214
Watch him.

499
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,134
Hello.

500
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,470
Where were you?

501
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:36,975
Something came up.
I had to go out.

502
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,436
You had no right to go.

503
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:43,190
- He was asleep.
- So you lock the door and leave?

504
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,777
I was gone briefly.

505
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,821
Briefly? You're lying.

506
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,157
He was dying when I got here!

507
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,534
He always naps at this time so I...

508
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,995
So you do this everyday?

509
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,581
Lock the door and run your errands?

510
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:01,583
No. I swear to God, today I had to.

511
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,753
- Why did you tie his hand?
- Go wait outside.

512
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,257
Was this our agreement?

513
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,926
I had to go.

514
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,053
I had no choice.

515
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:14,638
Thanks a lot!

516
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,057
You tie his hand everyday

517
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,684
and go do your own stuff.

518
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,851
Is he OK?

519
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,646
Thanks a lot!

520
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,440
Wait outside, sweetie.

521
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,818
Go check on grandpa.

522
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:31,905
Why did you go in that room?

523
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,073
Which room?

524
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:36,702
Which room?
The one you took the money from.

525
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,579
I took money from that room?

526
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,915
- Don't I pay you?
- I took money?

527
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,083
You didn't take it?

528
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,502
I swear I didn't take any money.

529
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:47,379
Get out.

530
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,799
Sir, I'm swearing on our martyrs.

531
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,637
You say I took money.

532
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:59,975
Here, look in my bag.
If I took it, it should be here.

533
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,309
Here, take this.

534
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,187
Give me my bag.

535
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:07,482
I am swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't go there.

536
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:09,026
Here's my bag.

537
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,777
What are you doing?

538
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:11,945
I didn't go there.

539
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,490
I'm swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't step into that room.

540
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,701
- Get out.
- You're saying...

541
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,246
What did I do?
Don't touch me!

542
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,707
I won't touch you.
Get out.

543
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,628
I won't leave
till I get what I deserve!

544
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,673
What you deserve
is for me to kick you out.

545
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:34,801
Because of her I won't.

546
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:38,847
Get out! I'm doing you a favour
by throwing you out.

547
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:41,850
Tell me what's happened to him.

548
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:43,769
It's my house, I want you out.

549
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,146
Fine but it's not right.

550
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:48,857
- It displeases God.
- Out!

551
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,276
That's it.

552
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,156
Dad.

553
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,252
Open the door.
It's me. I want to come in...

554
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,964
This is how you watch him?

555
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,470
Open the door.

556
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,890
Go check what's behind you.

557
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:23,558
Have a look.

558
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:25,894
Open the door!

559
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,605
It's no use shouting.

560
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,942
This is why I asked you to watch him.

561
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,403
Maybe his leg hurts
and he can't get up.

562
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,614
Grandpa...

563
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,744
Dad, open the door.

564
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,372
Open the door, please.

565
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,209
I'm going to push the door open.

566
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:53,213
It'll hit you, Dad. Move aside.

567
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:58,051
I'm going to push the door open.

568
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:03,723
Why do you do this to yourself?

569
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,654
Who told you to come in?

570
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:20,532
- What happened to him?
- Give me the key. Get out!

571
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,867
I didn't steal from you.

572
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,660
You are pissing me off!

573
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:24,828
I didn't.

574
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:28,748
- Don't give me that!
- I wouldn't be here now if I had.

575
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,916
Get out.

576
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,459
Pay me for today.

577
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,213
You already took your pay, didn't you?

578
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:39,593
Since 5:30 this morning
with my daughter... Somayeh!

579
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,011
Sir, wait!

580
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,512
Get out.

581
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:46,141
I swear I didn't steal.

582
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,893
Get out!

583
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,615
What happened?

584
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:08,038
What happened?

585
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,706
Sit.

586
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,590
What happened?

587
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,887
Mummy, be careful.

588
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,585
Tell her to work with you
on your English.

589
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,504
Bye, Grandpa.

590
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:42,299
Dad, Termeh said bye.

591
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,053
Careful!

592
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,893
OK.

593
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,689
What is it?

594
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,066
Mum says come in.

595
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:02,110
Tell her
grandpa's in the car.

596
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:03,445
She says it's important.

597
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:10,035
Not divorced yet
and already ignoring us!

598
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,870
I'm busy.

599
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,165
People divorce their wives
to get less busy.

600
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,209
Ma'am, these channels
have too much static.

601
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,421
OK, set the ones you can.

602
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,882
- Come and sit.
- Thank you. Simin...

603
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:30,013
Hi.

604
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,768
Where's Termeh?

605
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,353
In the car with dad.

606
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,188
Then bring him in too.

607
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,023
No, he is tired.

608
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,483
It's his nap time.

609
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,861
What is it?

610
00:47:44,986 --> 00:47:46,738
Did you have a fight
with that woman?

611
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:48,990
Did she come see you?

612
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,784
Her sister-in-law called.

613
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,702
Shameless!

614
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:54,079
What did she do?

615
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,582
Tied the old man to the bed
and locked the door.

616
00:47:57,707 --> 00:47:59,459
Went after her own errands.

617
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:02,295
If I'd gotten there 10 minutes later
I would've lost him.

618
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,713
Is he OK?

619
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:05,215
He had fallen off the bed.

620
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,759
I don't know for how long
he was like that.

621
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,010
Where had she gone?

622
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:10,220
How should I know?

623
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,097
She said you hit her.

624
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,515
I hit her?

625
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,643
- Nonsense.
- Then why is she in the hospital?

626
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,939
Hospital? Why?

627
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,149
You're asking me?

628
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:24,859
I just pushed her out of the house.

629
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:27,320
The sister-in-law called
and told me off.

630
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:28,655
Saying what?

631
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,200
That if she dies,
her blood will be on your hands.

632
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,078
Stuff like that.

633
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:42,210
- She didn't say what happened?
- I hung up. She started cursing.

634
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:47,674
That's what you get
for hiring people off the streets.

635
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,137
Don't blame me. I told you
I only know her sister-in-law.

636
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,972
Did she say which hospital?

637
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,645
- Hello.
- Yes?

638
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,273
Hold please.

639
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:07,152
A woman by the name of Razieh
was brought in tonight.

640
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,780
- What's her family name?
- I don't know. She was admitted earlier.

641
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:12,115
Why was she brought in?

642
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,076
- They just told us...
- That she was taken to hospital.

643
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:18,079
I'll call you back. Bye.

644
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:21,249
Her husband's last name is Samadi.

645
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,046
Razieh Asnaqi?

646
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,841
Is she in her thirties?

647
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,845
She had surgery.
She's in post-op.

648
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,305
Why surgery?

649
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:37,724
She had a miscarriage.

650
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,562
Is she OK now?

651
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:43,688
Hello? Hold.

652
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:44,814
Yes.

653
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:48,067
Is her family here?

654
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,986
If they are,
they are downstairs.

655
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:51,654
Thank you.

656
00:49:58,536 --> 00:50:00,622
What did you do to her?

657
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:04,167
What did I do to her?

658
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,772
Hello.

659
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:30,735
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

660
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,237
Hello, ma'am.

661
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,446
How is she?

662
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:35,532
Who?

663
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,992
Your wife.

664
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:40,286
They took her to the ward.

665
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,664
Do you know her?

666
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,166
- I know her.
- My wife.

667
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:48,419
- They didn't have sandwiches.
- Hello.

668
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,052
Can we see her?

669
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,221
Where do you know her from?

670
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:02,433
Your sister introduced her to us
for housework.

671
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,102
Thanks a lot!

672
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,106
She was coming
to your house to work?

673
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,358
She came for a few days.

674
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:13,611
Apparently you couldn't come
so she came in your place.

675
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:15,572
Come sit and eat something.

676
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,866
You mean
she took care of your father?

677
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,077
Just for a few days.

678
00:51:21,202 --> 00:51:22,579
Two or three days.

679
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,456
Why didn't you tell me this
at the bank?

680
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,836
I thought she would tell you.

681
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,880
Why have you come here now?

682
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,882
To see if we can do something.

683
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,092
Do what?

684
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:38,678
Help. We were worried.

685
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,847
Did she fall?

686
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,225
Come with me. I'll explain.

687
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,312
I'll explain to you...
Come with me.

688
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,689
I understand your situation.

689
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:52,734
You kill her child
and now you've come to do what?

690
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,027
I'm really sorry.

691
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,904
I'm sorry
won't be a child to her.

692
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,489
Just tell me one thing.

693
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,074
I'll explain outside.

694
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:02,744
Wait! Why didn't you tell me that day?

695
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,204
I told you. I thought she...

696
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,960
You live alone in that house.

697
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,422
Let him go.

698
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,966
Calm down.

699
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,553
This is a hospital.

700
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,222
Don't!

701
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,641
Stop!

702
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,397
Why the hell did you come here?

703
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,943
Let me see.

704
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,780
- My own sister?
- I'm sorry.

705
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,781
Forgive me.

706
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,865
Let me see.

707
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,788
Come out here.

708
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,208
I want to talk to you.

709
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,004
Please, I beg you. Hojjat!

710
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,348
Do you want your seat down?

711
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,016
No.

712
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,479
I'll take you home
then I'll get dad and Termeh.

713
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,357
No.

714
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,943
No?

715
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:21,155
You want to go
to your parents' like this?

716
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,410
It's over.
You're coming home tonight.

717
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,330
I don't want to.

718
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,509
Where are you going?

719
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,645
Hand it in.

720
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:03,925
Did you hear his complaint?

721
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,301
It was the 13th.

722
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:09,013
I'm sorry.
I was really upset when I heard.

723
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,641
- I went to the hospital.
- Then you admit it.

724
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:14,936
Is this the medical examiner's report?

725
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:19,565
It is the hospital report
that we took

726
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,734
to the medical examiner.

727
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:23,444
Four and half months, male.

728
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:24,987
Please explain.

729
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:27,615
I accept that I was a bit rough.

730
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,492
By rough you mean you pushed her?

731
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,703
No. I tried to get her out of my house.

732
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,332
Be clear.
Your charge is murder.

733
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:40,169
It was 19 weeks old.
A full human being.

734
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:44,215
I didn't intend to push her.

735
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,676
I wanted her to leave
so I could close the door.

736
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,761
- You didn't push me?
- Ma'am, please.

737
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:51,222
If I knew she were pregnant,

738
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:54,725
I wouldn't even have tried
to get her out of the house.

739
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,520
I just wanted to close the door.

740
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,313
Do you accept his explanation?

741
00:55:59,438 --> 00:56:03,401
He didn't push. He grabbed me here
and threw me and I fell on the stairs.

742
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,653
I didn't throw you.

743
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:08,531
I wanted to get you out of my house.

744
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,741
Who throws out a pregnant woman?

745
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,617
I didn't know.

746
00:56:11,742 --> 00:56:12,743
Why are you lying?

747
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,037
I found out in the hospital.

748
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,374
Your honour, can't everyone tell

749
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:21,669
from the body of a woman
that she is pregnant?

750
00:56:21,794 --> 00:56:23,212
Four to five months pregnant.

751
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:25,089
When would I even see you?

752
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:28,301
I was already gone or leaving
when she'd come.

753
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,429
When I'd come, she looked like this.

754
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,890
Always with the chador.

755
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,808
How can anyone tell
she was pregnant?

756
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:38,144
He can claim that he couldn't guess.

757
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:43,608
I didn't think a pregnant woman
would come for this kind of work.

758
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,944
Your honour, I spoke of my pregnancy

759
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:50,406
in front of him,
his daughter and her tutor.

760
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,658
They all heard it.

761
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:54,702
When?
I don't remember.

762
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:56,787
No, of course you wouldn't remember.

763
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,749
The issue isn't that I knew or not.

764
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,459
Yes.

765
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,294
If it's proven that you knew

766
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:06,964
the court can request
a prison term of one to three years.

767
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,426
- Well?
- What?

768
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,220
No, I didn't know.

769
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,390
His daughter's tutor can testify.

770
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:17,892
Can she come in tomorrow?

771
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,561
I don't want her or the school involved.

772
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:23,230
It's not good for my daughter.

773
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,900
You trash.
You've killed my child.

774
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,401
It's bad for your child?

775
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:31,113
She matters
but ours was an animal?

776
00:57:31,238 --> 00:57:32,031
Don't insult...

777
00:57:32,156 --> 00:57:35,952
Am I insulting?
He took my pregnant wife...

778
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,954
Quiet or I'll put you in prison.

779
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,414
Please, he's a bit hot-tempered.

780
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,626
Hot-tempered?

781
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,547
I should sue you for working
for a single man we don't even know.

782
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,593
I wanted to help with the bills.
He hasn't worked for months.

783
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:55,972
The tutor has to come in as a witness.

784
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,808
Call her to come in tomorrow.

785
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,061
Your honour,

786
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:04,730
I'm here today for one thing.

787
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:08,067
I lost my child
but it didn't hurt as much

788
00:58:08,192 --> 00:58:11,112
as when he accused me
of being a thief.

789
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,321
We're thieves?

790
00:58:12,446 --> 00:58:13,739
If we stole

791
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:17,326
we wouldn't come to wipe
your father's arse.

792
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:19,954
Do you have proof that she stole?

793
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,497
I didn't say she stole.

794
00:58:21,622 --> 00:58:24,166
Money was missing

795
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:27,086
and it was the same amount
that I pay her.

796
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:28,587
Is that why you fought?

797
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,089
He accused her of stealing.

798
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:33,134
Your honour,
my father has Alzheimer's.

799
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:37,638
She tied his hand to the bed
and left the house.

800
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:39,432
That day I came home early.

801
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,226
I saw him on the floor
with his hand tied.

802
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:43,853
I thought he had died.

803
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,688
She came back

804
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,524
and I'm not saying I wasn't angry,

805
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:49,692
I was.

806
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,695
I told her to leave
and she wouldn't.

807
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,822
Where should I have gone?

808
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:56,532
He accused me of stealing.

809
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:59,285
If I hadn't asked for the money and left

810
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,662
he would've thought I had stolen.

811
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:03,414
Sit down.

812
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,708
- Was your father hurt?
- Yes, he was.

813
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,543
How hurt?
If he had been

814
00:59:07,668 --> 00:59:09,503
he would've filed a complaint.

815
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:11,088
Yes, he was hurt.

816
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,590
Where are you going?

817
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,093
I'm going to check on my child.

818
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,386
Come back quick.

819
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:19,055
Close the door.

820
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,641
What's taking so long?

821
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:07,812
I'm not well.
You go, I'll come.

822
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,814
He says
you locked up his father and left.

823
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:12,817
What should I say?

824
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,569
Say?
If he complains you'll be charged.

825
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,490
Where's Somayeh?

826
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:20,658
Over there.

827
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,910
Go.
I'll get her and come.

828
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:24,912
Let's go.

829
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,639
Yes?

830
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,602
He was sleeping.
I locked the door to keep him in.

831
01:00:48,727 --> 01:00:53,023
Even he would lock the door
and leave me the key.

832
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,608
I saw that he does it so I...

833
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:57,069
He says you tied him to the bed.

834
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:03,284
I was afraid he would wake up
and do something to himself.

835
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,620
I was afraid for him.

836
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:08,998
Why did you leave?

837
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,250
- So you should hit her?
- Quiet!

838
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,627
Who said
you could touch my wife?

839
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:14,420
Sir, get out.

840
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,006
They don't care about honouir,
I do.

841
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,301
- Don't be offensive.
- Leave the room.

842
01:01:22,928 --> 01:01:25,055
I want to file a complaint
against this woman.

843
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,348
Write your complaint.

844
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:30,269
Take your father to the medical examiner.
If he's hurt get a report.

845
01:01:30,394 --> 01:01:31,937
What happens to our complaint?

846
01:01:32,062 --> 01:01:34,440
Sign this and leave.

847
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,192
You have to post bail.

848
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,027
What for?

849
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,696
You're charged with murder.

850
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:42,865
I can't let you leave.

851
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,534
The blood money is forty million.

852
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:47,745
How am I going to post bail?

853
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:52,041
I live at my dad's.
He has Alzheimer's.

854
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,293
If you don't you'll go to jail.

855
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:57,671
My father can't even come here.

856
01:01:57,796 --> 01:01:59,298
He's sick.

857
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,716
Please don't.

858
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:03,344
I can't go to jail.

859
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,138
I've left him at home to come here.

860
01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:07,640
I can't go to jail.

861
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,642
I can't post bail.

862
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,352
It's not in my hands.
It's the law.

863
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,770
Wait one second.

864
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,648
What should I do with my dad?

865
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,859
I left him at home
and locked the door to come here.

866
01:02:18,984 --> 01:02:20,736
My child will come home from school.

867
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:22,238
Please.
What are you writing?

868
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,115
Don't waste time.
Go make your call.

869
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,493
I can't go to jail.
I won't go.

870
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,453
Write what you want!

871
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:30,704
Go get an officer.

872
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:32,790
What for? Don't.

873
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,376
I'm begging you.

874
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,461
Please don't write it.

875
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,881
My life will be ruined.

876
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,174
Don't waste time.

877
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:43,842
Go make your call.

878
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,933
<i>Hello, Termeh. I'm stuck here.
They're keeping me tonight.</i>

879
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,520
<i>Don't worry. It's nothing.
But you'll be alone tonight.</i>

880
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:58,565
<i>Take care of the house.
Take grandpa to the bathroom regularly.</i>

881
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,859
<i>Take care of yourself.
I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

882
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:37,146
If you hadn't left
dad wouldn't be in jail.

883
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,607
Your dad's not in jail because of me.

884
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,609
He hit a pregnant woman.

885
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,403
She came because you left.

886
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:47,364
How upset he was that I left.

887
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,576
He knew you weren't really leaving.

888
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,203
Did you tell him?

889
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,664
No, he knew.

890
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,082
Tell me the truth.

891
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:58,751
You told him?

892
01:04:06,383 --> 01:04:09,136
Get your stuff.
We're going to grandma's.

893
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:10,512
What about grandpa?

894
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:11,805
We'll take him too.

895
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,600
I have homework.
I'm not coming.

896
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,478
- You'll be on your own...
- Fine.

897
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:21,899
You'd better not call.

898
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,954
He doesn't even ask me to stay.

899
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,415
He doesn't refuse to divorce.

900
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,252
After having lived together for 14 years.

901
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:25,587
Dad!

902
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,801
What are you doing here?

903
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:33,011
Who're you with?

904
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,181
Didn't you have an exam?

905
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:38,559
No, it's tomorrow.

906
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,477
Who're you with?

907
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,650
Hello.

908
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:49,403
Shouldn't you tell us
you're in trouble

909
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,155
SO we can help you?

910
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,031
I didn't want to trouble you.

911
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,867
Silly man.

912
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,077
- Sit.
- No, ma'am, he has a hearing.

913
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,374
Where's grandpa?

914
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:04,168
He's safe.

915
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,671
What are they saying?

916
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:11,133
"My child" as if their 18-year old son

917
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:12,968
was stabbed to death.

918
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:14,553
Did you speak to them?

919
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:17,473
You can't even speak to the man.

920
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,225
I told the wife, "You're young.

921
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:23,979
"You can try next year."

922
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:26,857
What happened?

923
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:29,860
- I have to appraise the house.
- OK, go.

924
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:31,528
Hi.

925
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:34,490
- I'll be back.
- We'll be here.

926
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,121
Thanks.

927
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,417
- Hi, Mrs Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

928
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:46,710
Good, you?

929
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:50,214
- Sorry we're troubling you.
- No, what trouble?

930
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,842
Is it true what they're saying?

931
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:57,387
Yes, unfortunately he pushed her
and she fell and lost her baby.

932
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,306
So what should I tell them?

933
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:02,351
I don't know what they'll ask.

934
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,980
What if he asks something
to his disadvantage?

935
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:09,441
I think you should tell the truth.

936
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:10,817
Please don't stand there.

937
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,611
Where was he?

938
01:07:12,736 --> 01:07:14,780
Mr Lavasani was in the kitchen.

939
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:18,116
He didn't have a reaction
to your conversation?

940
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,535
If he did I didn't notice.

941
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,162
How did you realise
she was pregnant?

942
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:25,332
I think she told me.

943
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:27,292
You asked.
Why should I tell you?

944
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:32,839
Her daughter was drawing
a man and a woman.

945
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,591
She said
this is my mummy and daddy.

946
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:38,053
I said your mummy's not that fat.
She said she was pregnant.

947
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:40,138
So it wasn't from her appearance?

948
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,431
No.

949
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,724
Why are you lying?

950
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,351
You're a woman.

951
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:47,980
You can't tell if a woman is pregnant?

952
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,399
Even if I could tell

953
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,986
what difference does it make
for Mr Lavasani?

954
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,405
This woman is his daughter's tutor.

955
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,365
They've fixed their story.

956
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,117
Why are you insulting this lady?

957
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,827
No one's talking to you.

958
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,121
When did I have the opportunity
to fix my story?

959
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,831
I was here last night.

960
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,042
One thing is clear.
Now that we are speaking,

961
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:12,879
that man over there
can hear us, can't he?

962
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,965
I didn't hear you.

963
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:19,928
My mind is on other things.

964
01:08:20,053 --> 01:08:23,223
Why would I listen to your conversation?

965
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:25,267
Do I have to swear to God?

966
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,727
Like you believe in God!

967
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,812
No, God is for your type only!

968
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:30,939
Open that window.

969
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:34,651
He is an honourable man.

970
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:37,321
I've been going there for a year
to teach his daughter.

971
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,198
He's not like that.

972
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,744
Why should she hide her pregnancy?

973
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,788
If I knew
I wouldn't have hired her.

974
01:08:46,913 --> 01:08:50,375
Why did you hire her
without her husband's permission?

975
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,127
Thank you.

976
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:53,879
You may go.

977
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,172
Thank you.

978
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:04,598
"During the Sassanid period,
people were divided into two classes,

979
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,392
“the royalty,

980
01:09:07,517 --> 01:09:11,271
“the upper class and the normal people."

981
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,357
“The regular class."

982
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,363
What did they ask you?

983
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,367
Whether your dad knew
she was pregnant.

984
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,411
Forgive us for taking your time.

985
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:30,540
There's nothing to forgive.

986
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,918
Sweetie, how did mummy lose her baby?

987
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,212
She got a tummy ache.

988
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,799
Why?

989
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,802
Did daddy fight with her?

990
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,554
Why should he fight with her?

991
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,725
Maybe because she didn't tell him
she was working in people's homes?

992
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:52,521
- Did he hit her?
- My mum and dad never fight.

993
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:57,359
Then why were they fighting
in your drawing that day?

994
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,027
You showed me.

995
01:09:59,152 --> 01:10:00,946
They don't fight anymore.

996
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,407
No?

997
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,450
You're sure?

998
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:12,374
Yesterday he said
he didn't know she was pregnant.

999
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,710
Now he says he didn't push her.

1000
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,504
And you just stand there in silence!

1001
01:10:17,629 --> 01:10:20,257
Honestly, didn't you push me?

1002
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,676
-I didn't say I...
- Listen...

1003
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,803
Don't repeat everything.

1004
01:10:24,928 --> 01:10:27,431
How far is the door
from the stairs?

1005
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,682
Two metres?

1006
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
What else can have happened to her?

1007
01:10:31,768 --> 01:10:33,145
The corridor in our house...

1008
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,813
- Look...
- I am talking!

1009
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:36,606
Don't talk. Just answer.

1010
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,525
Quiet!

1011
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:42,863
You've come here to answer.

1012
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,240
I've a question for you to answer.

1013
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:46,450
I want to ask him...

1014
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,451
Ask me.

1015
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,163
If you hadn't done anything wrong,
why'd you come to the hospital

1016
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,165
to see what was wrong with her?

1017
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,000
I came out of decency.

1018
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,252
Where was your decency
when you hit her?

1019
01:10:57,377 --> 01:10:59,463
Was anyone there
during the fight?

1020
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,214
The neighbours were there.

1021
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:02,632
I'll order questionings.

1022
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,761
They're in it too just like the teacher.

1023
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,180
He's been insulting me from the start!

1024
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,098
Am I lying?

1025
01:11:10,223 --> 01:11:12,225
I'll determine who's lying or not.

1026
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,685
You be quiet.

1027
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:17,355
Sir, do you realise
his ex-wife has posted his bail?

1028
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:18,690
Oh my God!

1029
01:11:18,815 --> 01:11:20,358
Can someone vouch for you?

1030
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,651
What do you mean?

1031
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,696
A government employee
or business-owner to vouch for you.

1032
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:26,740
- No one.
- Why vouch?

1033
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,742
Because she's been accused.

1034
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,118
Accused of what?

1035
01:11:30,243 --> 01:11:32,996
According to the complaint he filed...

1036
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:34,247
Which he had no right...

1037
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:37,918
She admitted that she tied his father
to the bed and locked him up.

1038
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,085
I explained to you why.

1039
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,587
Her child just died.

1040
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:42,798
Keep your voice down.

1041
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:46,760
Aren't you ashamed?
You call yourself a man?

1042
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,221
I said quiet.

1043
01:11:51,431 --> 01:11:54,434
For God's sake, listen to us

1044
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:55,769
for a change.

1045
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,563
He is twisting everything.

1046
01:11:58,688 --> 01:12:01,608
He beat my wife
and she had a miscarriage.

1047
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:04,569
What could be clearer?
Why are you being unjust?

1048
01:12:04,694 --> 01:12:05,987
Listen to us for a change.

1049
01:12:06,112 --> 01:12:09,366
If you disturb the peace,
I'll send you to jail for three days.

1050
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,494
I've lost everything.
You think I fear jail?

1051
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:14,704
You should fear God.

1052
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:18,291
Mr Izadi, call an officer to arrest him.

1053
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:21,419
Sir, for the sake of the Qoran, don't.

1054
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:24,172
- No, let them come and take me.
- Go out. Be quiet.

1055
01:12:24,297 --> 01:12:27,300
Why be quiet?
So they can trample my rights?

1056
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:28,969
Go out.

1057
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:33,181
- Fine, I'm leaving.
- Sir, come out.

1058
01:12:33,306 --> 01:12:34,683
Let me get my helmet.

1059
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,351
Get out.

1060
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,980
I worked for ten years with a cobbler.

1061
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,733
They fired me and said
get justice if you can.

1062
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,905
I sued and went back and forth
for a year. In the end, nothing.

1063
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:51,867
They said go sit at home.

1064
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,952
But this time I won't let it go.

1065
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:56,830
This time it's different.

1066
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,583
I have nothing to lose.

1067
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,711
The problem is
I can't talk like this guy.

1068
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,838
I am hot-tempered.

1069
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,840
Don't!

1070
01:13:15,473 --> 01:13:17,017
Hojjat?

1071
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:20,145
I don't feel well.

1072
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:22,022
Go sit there.

1073
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,148
Let's go!

1074
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,192
- What do you want? He's calm.
- I have to take him.

1075
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,653
I'm going to talk to the judge.

1076
01:13:28,778 --> 01:13:31,156
Stay there and don't move.

1077
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,914
Sir...

1078
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,415
I beg you...

1079
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,958
Please let me speak.

1080
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,669
Sir, he's stressed out.

1081
01:13:44,794 --> 01:13:47,255
I've been patient for the past two days.

1082
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,592
I swear, he's been
in and out of prison the past month.

1083
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,552
His creditors put him in prison.

1084
01:13:52,677 --> 01:13:54,846
I begged them to let him come out.

1085
01:13:54,971 --> 01:13:57,432
I beg you to forgive him.

1086
01:13:57,557 --> 01:14:00,060
Sir, look.

1087
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:03,355
Look at these.

1088
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,858
Sir, can I ask you
to please forgive him this time?

1089
01:14:06,983 --> 01:14:09,611
Sir, everyday he has to take these.

1090
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,988
I swear I'm not lying.

1091
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:17,410
Sir, since he was fired,
he's been depressed.

1092
01:14:17,535 --> 01:14:18,995
He can't help it.

1093
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:21,623
Sir, you're his elder.

1094
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,625
Please forgive him.

1095
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:29,381
Go tell him to find
someone to vouch for you.

1096
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:31,216
God bless you.

1097
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,385
Don't leave the building.

1098
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,054
No, I'll wait for him
to come back.

1099
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,809
Will you ask her?

1100
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:45,271
She'll think
it's because she bailed me out.

1101
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,232
So let her...

1102
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,528
Dad... please.

1103
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,240
OK.

1104
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,908
Promise.

1105
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:01,871
Why do you promise?

1106
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,212
Dad...

1107
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,381
Yes?

1108
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,427
You didn't know
Razieh was pregnant?

1109
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:18,680
No.

1110
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,018
Why?

1111
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:24,477
Nothing.

1112
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:27,147
So why did you ask?

1113
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,566
Last night,
mum said you knew.

1114
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,903
Where was she to see
if I knew?

1115
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,991
She said when you were told
that Razieh's baby had died,

1116
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,826
you didn't say anything.

1117
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:42,412
You didn't ask if she was pregnant.

1118
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:44,372
You didn't get surprised.

1119
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:49,586
At times like this, people usually ask
if she was carrying a child.

1120
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,796
It was like you knew.

1121
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,845
Your mum wants
to turn you against me.

1122
01:16:14,652 --> 01:16:16,529
Will you ask her?

1123
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,714
I can't.

1124
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:19,634
Didn't you promise?

1125
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,013
I'm sorry.

1126
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,276
Which step was she on?

1127
01:17:37,193 --> 01:17:38,278
This one.

1128
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,572
- This?
- This one.

1129
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:53,793
Take grandpa in.
I'll be right back.

1130
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,122
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

1131
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,753
You went upstairs?

1132
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,464
Yes, I went to see Mrs Kalani.

1133
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:41,341
What for?

1134
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,802
I told her they are coming to investigate.
To beware.

1135
01:18:45,678 --> 01:18:46,971
Beware of what?

1136
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:52,060
Beware of...

1137
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:55,104
that they are coming to investigate.

1138
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,607
Is that not OK?

1139
01:18:57,732 --> 01:19:01,694
If she is to tell the truth,
why should she beware?

1140
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:10,453
Termen...

1141
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:11,621
Yes?

1142
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:12,830
Come with me.

1143
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:16,751
- I have homework.
- Leave it for now.

1144
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:19,712
Look, imagine that I am her.

1145
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:24,634
Is this right?

1146
01:19:24,759 --> 01:19:29,389
When someone is thrown
they fall straight.

1147
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,766
They don't hit here and bounce off

1148
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:35,520
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here.

1149
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:36,854
Right?

1150
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,565
If I'd thrown her from there

1151
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,277
she should've fallen there on those steps

1152
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:45,780
or she would fall straight on the railing.

1153
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:48,116
She wouldn't fall like this.

1154
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,576
Imagine you were thrown.
Follow the direction.

1155
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:53,871
- Then how had she fallen there?
- I don't know.

1156
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,624
I'm just saying
she wasn't thrown on these steps.

1157
01:19:56,749 --> 01:19:58,293
Come and stand here.

1158
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:01,838
- Why don't you tell them?
- Forget them.

1159
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,716
I want you to know.
Go on.

1160
01:20:19,647 --> 01:20:21,399
Did he throw you in this direction?

1161
01:20:21,524 --> 01:20:23,568
No, towards the lower level.

1162
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,986
You look.

1163
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,364
This door doesn't allow me to
even if I want to. It's not possible.

1164
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:29,907
Where did you fall down?

1165
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,827
- On these stairs.
- Which step?

1166
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:34,579
I think it was this one.

1167
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:35,997
You think
or you're sure?

1168
01:20:36,956 --> 01:20:38,416
I'm not sure.

1169
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:40,460
Ma'am, this is where you found her?

1170
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,795
I didn't see her fall.

1171
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,423
When I got here,
she was on that lower step.

1172
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:47,300
Why don't you say anything?

1173
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,093
Go show them how he threw you.

1174
01:20:49,218 --> 01:20:51,387
I was so sick
I didn't know what happened to me.

1175
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:54,223
Look, I'll stand in her place.

1176
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:58,853
You in the doorway
and push me as hard as you want.

1177
01:20:58,978 --> 01:21:00,772
I'm saying
it's not possible to fall there.

1178
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,024
Of course you won't fall.

1179
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:04,942
A pregnant woman falls easily.

1180
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:08,488
Then you come here.
You choose who pushes you.

1181
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,448
I'm saying it's not possible.

1182
01:21:10,573 --> 01:21:13,743
I'm saying if you push from here,
she won't fall on the stairs.

1183
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:16,496
What stairs? She says
she fell on that step up there.

1184
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,665
They all say
they saw her on that one.

1185
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,001
Ma'am, did you see her get thrown?

1186
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:24,712
From up there
I couldn't see the door

1187
01:21:24,837 --> 01:21:26,881
but I saw the stairs
when she fell.

1188
01:21:27,006 --> 01:21:29,258
Can you show me
where you were?

1189
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,511
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.

1190
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,930
How often did you use these stairs?

1191
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,723
Why hadn't she gotten dizzy?

1192
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:36,933
Excuse me.

1193
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,686
That morning when I saw her here
I asked her

1194
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,022
why there was garbage on the steps.

1195
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:46,734
She said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag.

1196
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:47,902
Right?

1197
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:51,989
- She took the garbage down.
- You told me you got dizzy.

1198
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:55,493
Mrs Kalani, hadn't she mopped
the stairs that day?

1199
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:57,787
The stairs were wet.
Maybe she slipped.

1200
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:59,789
You jerk! You made her slip.

1201
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:01,249
Be respectful!

1202
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:03,209
I'm polite
in front of your family.

1203
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:05,670
You'd better be polite, you shit!

1204
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,004
Don't curse.

1205
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,673
Take him outside.

1206
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:12,427
Would his neighbours say
anything against him?

1207
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:14,470
If you can prove they're lying...

1208
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:17,181
So you think
they're telling the truth?

1209
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:21,477
To hell with me
for wasting my time here.

1210
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:23,020
Excuse me.

1211
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,022
Give us her backpack.

1212
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,702
Here it is...

1213
01:22:48,337 --> 01:22:50,840
Don't you want your drawing book?

1214
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,178
Sweetie, don't be upset

1215
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,055
that I am fighting
with your mum and dad...

1216
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,057
Let me put it in your bag.

1217
01:23:07,398 --> 01:23:10,985
My mummy didn't take your money.

1218
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,653
I know.

1219
01:23:13,362 --> 01:23:16,199
That's not why I was fighting with her.

1220
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:20,244
Then for what?

1221
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,415
I was upset because she left my dad.

1222
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:29,754
She went to the doctor's.

1223
01:23:34,383 --> 01:23:36,260
Go on.

1224
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,055
Take care.

1225
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,059
According to the court's request,
I'll examine him and write what I see.

1226
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:47,021
Well, doctor, you can see
he doesn't talk anymore.

1227
01:23:47,146 --> 01:23:48,981
Didn't you say
he has Alzheimer's?

1228
01:23:49,106 --> 01:23:52,527
Yes but before this happened,
he would speak a bit.

1229
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:54,195
This is a doctor's office.

1230
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,364
Prove that in court.

1231
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,366
Does he have any bruising?

1232
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,576
Yes, some.

1233
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,531
What happened?

1234
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:43,536
I'm not sure the bruising has to do
with when he fell off the bed.

1235
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,304
Don't run.

1236
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,140
Mum, pull the window down.
They're fighting.

1237
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,559
Don't you see this is a girl's school?

1238
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,894
I just have one question for this lady.

1239
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,272
You're not allowed to stand here.

1240
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:16,485
Take your fight to the police.

1241
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,738
I don't want to fight.
I just want to speak to her.

1242
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:22,867
I have nothing to say to you.
I don't know you or her husband.

1243
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,578
- Then why did you lie in court?
- What lie?

1244
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,746
She knows what lie.

1245
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,956
Ms Safaei, call the police.

1246
01:25:29,081 --> 01:25:31,334
Don't scare me with the police.

1247
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,377
She's not involved.

1248
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:35,921
Then why does she try
to get my daughter to speak?

1249
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,131
I did no such thing.

1250
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:40,760
You are a teacher.
Aren't you ashamed?

1251
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,471
Why did you ask her
if I hit her mum

1252
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:44,430
and she lost the baby?

1253
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:45,389
I never did.

1254
01:25:45,514 --> 01:25:47,767
You pick on a 4-year-old's drawing

1255
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:51,062
and tell her her dad hit her mum
and she lost the baby?

1256
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,396
I didn't say that!

1257
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:56,692
Why do you think we beat our wives
and children like animals?

1258
01:25:56,817 --> 01:26:00,529
I swear on this Qoran,
we're humans just like you.

1259
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:10,081
I have nothing to lose.

1260
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:14,168
Tell your husband
not to make me do something crazy.

1261
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:16,337
I'll wait by the door.

1262
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,758
I'm unemployed.

1263
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,552
I'll stand out there all day.
Eventually you'll come out.

1264
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,221
Come to the court
and say you lied

1265
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,432
or I'll get to the bottom
of what's between you and her husband.

1266
01:26:28,557 --> 01:26:31,477
Shame on you.
I've been patient so far.

1267
01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:33,020
So why are you defending him?

1268
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:36,107
I told the truth.

1269
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,358
- The truth?
- Yes!

1270
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:40,486
Place your hand on this and swear.

1271
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,530
Why swear?
What does this have to do with her?

1272
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:44,949
I'm not scared.
What do I have to say?

1273
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:48,661
You said her husband didn't know
my wife was pregnant.

1274
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,162
- Yes.
- Swear it.

1275
01:26:50,287 --> 01:26:53,040
I swear on this Qoran
that day at their house,

1276
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:57,128
her husband was in the kitchen
and didn't hear what your wife and I said.

1277
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:01,465
OK?
Anything else I should say?

1278
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,221
He's crazy.

1279
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,727
Call your husband.
Don't go alone.

1280
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:15,563
No, I don't want him to know.
I'm sorry.

1281
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:18,274
Why are you all standing here?

1282
01:27:19,608 --> 01:27:21,152
Hello?

1283
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,822
Hello, Ms Qahraei.

1284
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:28,367
I had left you a message.

1285
01:27:28,492 --> 01:27:30,911
Can you please pick up?

1286
01:27:35,499 --> 01:27:39,378
The lady that took care of my dad,

1287
01:27:39,503 --> 01:27:43,424
apparently that day you gave her
the number for a gynaecologist.

1288
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:46,802
I wanted to ask you
for that number to call

1289
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:50,389
and see if she went
to see the doctor that week

1290
01:27:50,514 --> 01:27:53,184
and what her problem was.

1291
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:56,520
I would appreciate
you calling me back. Thank you.

1292
01:28:11,827 --> 01:28:14,079
What do you want to do?

1293
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,082
With what?

1294
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,252
You want to keep this up?
Everyday a new fight?

1295
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:22,213
Why? What happened?

1296
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:23,881
He went to her school today

1297
01:28:24,006 --> 01:28:26,217
and embarrassed her
in front of everyone.

1298
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,513
What did he say?

1299
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:35,267
He screamed
"Her dad killed my child."

1300
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:39,563
How can she go back to that school?

1301
01:28:40,564 --> 01:28:43,150
Do you know what you are doing?

1302
01:28:43,275 --> 01:28:44,568
What I am doing?

1303
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:49,990
He's making threats.

1304
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:51,992
He wouldn't dare!

1305
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,204
Termeh, go to your room.

1306
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:04,088
What if he kills your child
on her way to school?

1307
01:29:05,714 --> 01:29:07,007
What would you have me do?

1308
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:08,676
Run off abroad with you?

1309
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:12,137
To hell with abroad.
Why can't you talk normally?

1310
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:13,973
This is about Termeh

1311
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,392
and the situation you've put her in.

1312
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,477
I've put her in?

1313
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:21,272
You have some nerve accusing me!

1314
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:22,773
Who left home?

1315
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:24,567
Who filed for a divorce?

1316
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:25,985
You said
leave whenever you want.

1317
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,903
Why did you come back?

1318
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:30,197
I didn't.
I'm here because of her situation.

1319
01:29:30,322 --> 01:29:31,282
Her situation's fine.

1320
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,743
- You have two choices...
- Don't try to intimidate me.

1321
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,036
What intimidation?

1322
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,956
Either you clear up the situation...

1323
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:41,333
- No, I know what to do.
- Didn't you hit her?

1324
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,961
Didn't she fall?
Didn't her baby die?

1325
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:46,171
Yes! I killed her child.

1326
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:49,383
Why are you so stubborn?
Pay the blood money and end it.

1327
01:29:49,508 --> 01:29:51,677
- I won't be forced into paying.
- Why forced?

1328
01:29:51,802 --> 01:29:53,095
Put yourself in their place.

1329
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,307
- I'm not responsible for their troubles.
- Their child died!

1330
01:29:56,432 --> 01:30:00,811
And my dad has been hurt.
He doesn't even speak anymore.

1331
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,772
He didn't speak much before.

1332
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,775
I was happy
with the few words he spoke.

1333
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,444
Is it as bad as losing a baby?

1334
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,488
Where were you
to see I caused it?

1335
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:15,075
- Then how did she lose it?
- I don't know.

1336
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,996
There might be a chance
that her husband did something

1337
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:22,166
and now she wants to blame me.

1338
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,169
Her child said that day
she had gone to the doctor.

1339
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:28,881
Why couldn't she wait two hours
to go to the doctor?

1340
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,467
Why did she tie the old man
to his bed and leave?

1341
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,886
The examiner said
her child died due to a blow.

1342
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:36,972
How do we know
it was a blow from me?

1343
01:30:37,097 --> 01:30:41,060
I won't accept it
till it's been proven to me.

1344
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:45,564
Fine, let me take Termeh.

1345
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:49,193
Shame on you
for putting pressure on me now.

1346
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,402
I am worried about her.

1347
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:53,530
Your child wants to live here.
She has to stay here and learn.

1348
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,075
Learn what?
Fighting and obstinacy?

1349
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,744
To learn not to be a coward like you

1350
01:30:58,869 --> 01:31:01,538
who gives in so easily.

1351
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:04,750
He knows who to frighten.
Why doesn't he threaten me?

1352
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:05,876
Yes, I'm a coward.

1353
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:10,047
Your whole life,

1354
01:31:10,172 --> 01:31:12,549
instead of solving problems,

1355
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:17,513
you've either run away
or raised your hands and given in.

1356
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:21,308
Just say why you want
to leave this country.

1357
01:31:21,433 --> 01:31:23,102
You're afraid to stay.

1358
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:26,230
I was gone one week
and you couldn't manage.

1359
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,482
I couldn't manage
and I'm responsible.

1360
01:31:29,441 --> 01:31:33,570
Give me Termeh
and you do what you want.

1361
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:38,409
Termeh, sweetie,
you don't have to stay.

1362
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:40,869
Go wherever you like.

1363
01:31:45,499 --> 01:31:47,751
You still don't want to come?

1364
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:00,389
"He sells it for twenty a kilo.

1365
01:32:00,514 --> 01:32:04,560
"If everyday he sells 270 kilos..."
Write 270.

1366
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:10,941
Then, how much profit
does he make in one day?

1367
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:14,194
How do you solve this?

1368
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:16,238
Did you lie?

1369
01:32:17,614 --> 01:32:19,158
What?

1370
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,410
Did you lie?

1371
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,663
About what?

1372
01:32:26,206 --> 01:32:29,918
When you said
you didn't know she was pregnant.

1373
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,588
Why?

1374
01:32:33,922 --> 01:32:36,717
You said that you didn't hear
Ms Qahraei

1375
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:38,677
and Razieh speaking.

1376
01:32:38,802 --> 01:32:39,928
Yes.

1377
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:45,684
Then how did you know
that Ms Qahraei gave her the number?

1378
01:32:45,809 --> 01:32:48,771
Didn't she say it at the same time?

1379
01:32:57,029 --> 01:32:58,572
OK.

1380
01:32:59,656 --> 01:33:03,035
If we want to calculate the profit...

1381
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:09,958
Yes, I knew.

1382
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:15,047
Your mum was telling the truth.

1383
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:20,344
When they were talking in the hall,
I heard everything

1384
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,012
from the kitchen.

1385
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,307
Then why did you say
you didn't?

1386
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,314
Do you know what would happen
if I said I knew?

1387
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:38,153
One to three years in prison.

1388
01:33:38,987 --> 01:33:42,741
I only thought
of what would happen to you...

1389
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:45,202
who you'd stay with.

1390
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,247
I said I didn't know.

1391
01:33:50,749 --> 01:33:52,751
If you knew, why did you hit her?

1392
01:33:52,876 --> 01:33:56,755
I knew she was pregnant
but at that moment I didn't.

1393
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,633
I had forgotten it.
I wasn't paying attention.

1394
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,058
So tell them this.

1395
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:14,648
The law doesn't care about this.

1396
01:34:14,773 --> 01:34:17,526
Either I knew or I didn't...

1397
01:34:24,366 --> 01:34:25,909
Look at me.

1398
01:34:26,743 --> 01:34:29,663
If you want me to
I'll tell them.

1399
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,593
Hi.

1400
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:32,351
Didn't I say
not to come to the front?

1401
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:54,498
Ms Qahraei!

1402
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:07,010
What are you doing?

1403
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:09,930
Ms Qahraei, wait...

1404
01:36:10,889 --> 01:36:15,018
If you pull over
I'll just explain something to you.

1405
01:36:15,143 --> 01:36:17,312
Please let me...

1406
01:36:17,437 --> 01:36:19,314
Dad!

1407
01:36:22,609 --> 01:36:24,444
Who's responsible
for my child's safety now?

1408
01:36:24,569 --> 01:36:26,363
Without a witness there's no case.

1409
01:36:26,488 --> 01:36:29,616
So without a witness
I should wait for him to kill her

1410
01:36:29,741 --> 01:36:31,201
and then come to you?

1411
01:36:31,326 --> 01:36:33,787
How should I know
you are telling the truth?

1412
01:36:33,912 --> 01:36:35,706
Why should I lie?

1413
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:39,001
Bring my daughter and father here
just to lie?

1414
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,460
Is she here now?

1415
01:36:40,585 --> 01:36:41,628
Yes, outside.

1416
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:43,755
Ask her yourself.

1417
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:48,677
I'm afraid to leave her at school.
I'm afraid to leave my dad at home.

1418
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:50,554
Is the plaintiff here?

1419
01:36:51,596 --> 01:36:53,181
Did you finish writing?

1420
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,683
Almost.

1421
01:36:54,808 --> 01:36:57,144
You didn't know
his wife was pregnant?

1422
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,854
No, I didn't.

1423
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:02,232
When she was speaking to the tutor,
you didn't hear them?

1424
01:37:02,357 --> 01:37:03,442
No, I didn't.

1425
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:06,486
You didn't, huh?

1426
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,697
What I'm saying is...

1427
01:37:08,822 --> 01:37:11,366
The tutor came
and revoked her testimony.

1428
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,161
She says you knew.

1429
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:16,663
- She said I knew?
- Yes, she came yesterday.

1430
01:37:16,788 --> 01:37:18,332
He threatened her...

1431
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:20,751
Answer me.
Did you hear her or not?

1432
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,419
I said no.

1433
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:24,546
How did you know
about the doctor's number?

1434
01:37:24,671 --> 01:37:26,214
My daughter told me.

1435
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,382
What did she tell you?

1436
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:30,010
That she got the number
from her teacher.

1437
01:37:31,094 --> 01:37:33,138
Go tell her to come in.

1438
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,224
Now?

1439
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,352
And wait outside.

1440
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:40,354
What question?

1441
01:37:44,983 --> 01:37:46,860
What does he want to ask?

1442
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:51,740
I don't know.
Give me that.

1443
01:37:59,414 --> 01:38:01,291
So what do you have to say?

1444
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:02,959
You haven't asked me anything.

1445
01:38:03,794 --> 01:38:06,296
Didn't your dad tell you
what I want to ask you?

1446
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:07,589
No.

1447
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:09,049
What grade are you in school?

1448
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:10,884
Sixth.

1449
01:38:11,009 --> 01:38:14,388
The day your tutor came to your house

1450
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:17,391
and asked the lady
about her pregnancy,

1451
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,893
were you there?

1452
01:38:20,018 --> 01:38:23,939
Not then, I had gone to get my books.

1453
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,565
Then how did you know

1454
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:29,861
she got the doctor's number
from your tutor?

1455
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:33,448
She gave her the number later,
when she was leaving.

1456
01:38:33,573 --> 01:38:34,825
In front of you?

1457
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,243
Yes.

1458
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:37,953
Why didn't you tell
your dad sooner?

1459
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,413
What?

1460
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:43,166
That she got the doctor's number
from your tutor.

1461
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:46,294
I didn't think it was important
for my dad to know.

1462
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:51,299
And did you tell your dad
or did he hear it?

1463
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:55,846
That she gave the number?
I told him.

1464
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:57,264
You told him?

1465
01:38:57,389 --> 01:38:58,473
Yes.

1466
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,810
OK.

1467
01:39:52,235 --> 01:39:54,362
What crime did I commit?

1468
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,697
Nothing. You're right.

1469
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,617
He's not accepting his responsibility.

1470
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:01,870
I admit that he's to blame
but in the end what will happen?

1471
01:40:01,995 --> 01:40:06,625
One or two years in court
for a payment plan of the blood money.

1472
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,085
But why?
That's what upsets me.

1473
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:11,129
Why do you think
it's for the money?

1474
01:40:11,254 --> 01:40:12,547
When did I say such a thing?

1475
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:15,717
You think I am a bum
and my kid died

1476
01:40:15,842 --> 01:40:17,427
and I don't understand anything.

1477
01:40:17,552 --> 01:40:19,221
I never said anything like that.

1478
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,014
Let's see what she's saying.

1479
01:40:21,139 --> 01:40:22,432
There's no other way.

1480
01:40:22,557 --> 01:40:25,435
Your child won't come back.

1481
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,604
My husband won't get hanged.

1482
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:30,106
Her husband didn't do it on purpose.

1483
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:34,110
They're good people
for giving you a solution.

1484
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:37,614
Take the money and settle it.
You can use it in your situation.

1485
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:41,952
Right now we'll decide on an amount
and I'll get my husband's approval.

1486
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:47,123
Now we have to get his approval?
For God's sake leave us alone.

1487
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:52,462
You act like you don't need the money.

1488
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:53,922
Take a look at yourself.

1489
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,924
Don't let him go.

1490
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:02,305
Wait a second.
I want to talk to you.

1491
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,024
Will you stay?

1492
01:41:56,568 --> 01:41:58,111
Mum...

1493
01:42:00,196 --> 01:42:02,365
Let me speak to him.

1494
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:14,252
Come sit.
I want to talk to you.

1495
01:42:16,838 --> 01:42:18,715
I can hear you.

1496
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,428
I went and spoke to her husband today.

1497
01:42:24,095 --> 01:42:25,847
Sit down.

1498
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:37,734
I managed

1499
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:40,445
to get him to agree

1500
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:43,114
to take fifteen million
instead of forty million.

1501
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:46,618
Three five-million checks
in exchange for his consent.

1502
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:48,495
How dare you speak to him
about money?

1503
01:42:49,287 --> 01:42:51,164
I can't handle the stress
of my child's safety.

1504
01:42:51,289 --> 01:42:52,999
You don't get it.

1505
01:42:53,124 --> 01:42:55,919
Just now when you were late,
I was worried sick.

1506
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:58,797
Why are you interfering?

1507
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,508
I didn't come here to fight.

1508
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:03,677
Oh God,
why can't I make her understand?

1509
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:07,472
Didn't you say it was my fault,
that I introduced her,

1510
01:43:07,597 --> 01:43:10,725
that if I hadn't left,
none of this would've happened?

1511
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,644
So let me fix it then.

1512
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:16,064
If I pay, it means
I have accepted it was my fault.

1513
01:43:16,189 --> 01:43:17,148
But he has consented.

1514
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:18,817
He won't let us be.

1515
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:21,653
- He won't, anyway.
- Why should I bribe him?

1516
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,363
Think of it
as my dower money.

1517
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:27,450
If I had to
I would beg and borrow

1518
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:29,619
to get your dower money.

1519
01:43:29,744 --> 01:43:32,580
But I don't have the money
to pay for extortion.

1520
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:36,376
Our child is going through adolescence.
She is suffering.

1521
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:42,841
So you understand
the sensitivity of her adolescence.

1522
01:43:42,966 --> 01:43:44,926
If she was suffering
she wouldn't have stayed.

1523
01:43:45,051 --> 01:43:47,804
Why do you think she stayed?

1524
01:43:47,929 --> 01:43:49,973
Did she choose you?

1525
01:43:51,474 --> 01:43:53,435
To keep us from separating.

1526
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,732
She knows I won't go anywhere
without her.

1527
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:02,861
She is suffering
but she doesn't show it.

1528
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:09,909
Call them now and say
I won't pay

1529
01:44:10,034 --> 01:44:13,079
until it's been proved to me
that I am responsible.

1530
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:15,623
I'll sell my car.

1531
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:17,459
Don't sell it for my sake.

1532
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,127
It's not for you.

1533
01:44:19,252 --> 01:44:21,463
If your child is not worth...

1534
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:24,632
Why are you talking nonsense?
Money's not the issue.

1535
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,052
I won't rest till my child's safety
is guaranteed.

1536
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:30,930
You don't have the right
to do anything.

1537
01:44:31,055 --> 01:44:32,515
Understand?

1538
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:36,019
If I had done nothing
you would be in prison.

1539
01:44:39,856 --> 01:44:42,817
Come to court
and get back the bail.

1540
01:44:42,942 --> 01:44:45,528
I don't want to be out
because of it.

1541
01:45:03,963 --> 01:45:06,132
Get up, Termeh.

1542
01:45:06,257 --> 01:45:07,467
Get up, let's go.

1543
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:09,052
Get up, I tell you.

1544
01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:10,720
Mum, please.

1545
01:45:12,847 --> 01:45:14,557
I don't want you to stay here.

1546
01:45:14,682 --> 01:45:16,100
No, Mum, I won't let you.

1547
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:20,104
Is fifteen million more important
than your child's life?

1548
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:21,731
I won't let you do this.

1549
01:45:21,856 --> 01:45:23,441
If your child is not important...

1550
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:26,444
Mum, please listen,
why are you doing this?

1551
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:27,987
You said you would stay.

1552
01:45:28,112 --> 01:45:31,282
I was stupid!

1553
01:45:31,407 --> 01:45:33,076
Mum, please...

1554
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:35,286
I'll wait in the car.

1555
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:49,509
Go there for a few days
till your exams are finished.

1556
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,928
Your grandparents are there.

1557
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:54,430
You'll have more fun.

1558
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,474
Didn't you say
it's not serious?

1559
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,477
It got serious.

1560
01:46:00,645 --> 01:46:02,355
Termen...

1561
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,107
Honey...

1562
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:07,944
If you cry I'll cry too.

1563
01:46:08,069 --> 01:46:10,363
Why won't you pay them
so she'll come back?

1564
01:46:10,488 --> 01:46:13,491
This has nothing to do
with her coming back.

1565
01:46:13,616 --> 01:46:15,952
It does.
She had come to stay.

1566
01:46:16,077 --> 01:46:18,913
Her stuff was in the car,
I saw it.

1567
01:46:58,953 --> 01:47:00,705
If you think I am guilty

1568
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:02,373
go get your mum.

1569
01:47:02,498 --> 01:47:05,335
We'll call them and go pay them.

1570
01:48:22,036 --> 01:48:23,496
I have doubts.

1571
01:48:23,621 --> 01:48:25,790
Didn't he throw you?

1572
01:48:25,915 --> 01:48:27,458
Yes.

1573
01:48:28,042 --> 01:48:30,545
Did something happen at home?

1574
01:48:31,546 --> 01:48:33,506
No. Even before,
my child wasn't moving.

1575
01:48:35,216 --> 01:48:36,759
Before he threw you?

1576
01:48:42,765 --> 01:48:45,810
You mean
your child had already died?

1577
01:48:45,935 --> 01:48:48,271
I don't know. Maybe.

1578
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:50,481
Had something happened?

1579
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:56,029
I'm not sure but...
the night before, I had pain.

1580
01:48:57,613 --> 01:49:00,074
- Have you ever lost a baby before?
- No.

1581
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,787
I was hit by a car.

1582
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:15,590
You father-in-law
had gone into the street.

1583
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,592
I went after him.

1584
01:49:18,342 --> 01:49:20,928
He was crossing the street
to come back.

1585
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:25,099
I ran to stop him
but I got hit instead.

1586
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:28,102
The pain started that night.

1587
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,315
Does your husband know this?

1588
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:36,694
Why don't you come say this
in court?

1589
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:43,534
My husband will kill me
if he finds out I told you this.

1590
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,789
Since yesterday
when he promised his creditors,

1591
01:49:47,914 --> 01:49:49,290
he's been waiting.

1592
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:54,170
What do we have to do
with all this?

1593
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,258
It's my fault.

1594
01:50:03,012 --> 01:50:06,933
Yesterday when he said
you've promised him this money,

1595
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:10,103
I got really scared.
I called a few people.

1596
01:50:10,228 --> 01:50:12,980
They say if I have doubts
then it's a sin to take it.

1597
01:50:14,398 --> 01:50:17,318
If we don't pay
my husband's innocence must be proved.

1598
01:50:17,443 --> 01:50:21,239
I made you swear
not to repeat any of this!

1599
01:50:21,364 --> 01:50:23,574
But your husband
won't leave us alone.

1600
01:50:23,699 --> 01:50:25,451
I fear for my child.

1601
01:50:25,576 --> 01:50:27,787
I'm afraid
that if I take this money

1602
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:30,164
something will happen to my child.

1603
01:50:30,289 --> 01:50:32,083
What do you want me to do?

1604
01:50:33,626 --> 01:50:35,503
Don't pay this money.

1605
01:50:36,587 --> 01:50:37,630
Don't.

1606
01:50:45,429 --> 01:50:47,682
Will your husband leave us alone?

1607
01:51:20,923 --> 01:51:23,843
Give me that.
Bring some plates.

1608
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,305
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

1609
01:51:48,117 --> 01:51:51,162
When you revoke your complaint,

1610
01:51:51,287 --> 01:51:54,373
we'll give you these three checks.

1611
01:51:54,498 --> 01:51:55,583
God bless you.

1612
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:58,211
Hojjat, get a pen and paper

1613
01:51:58,336 --> 01:52:01,339
so we can write everything down
and sign it.

1614
01:52:01,464 --> 01:52:03,466
I want to say something first...

1615
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:05,509
Say a prayer and finish it.

1616
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:08,888
I have already agreed
and will honour my word.

1617
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:12,099
I just want his wife
and my daughter to be here

1618
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:14,518
when I speak.

1619
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,439
Where is she?

1620
01:52:20,608 --> 01:52:21,984
Thank you.

1621
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,445
Please, also call my daughter.

1622
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,202
Come in. Your father wants you.

1623
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,964
Termeh, come and sit here.

1624
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:45,132
Excuse me, sir.

1625
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:57,228
Look...

1626
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,690
I wrote the checks
and [I'll give them to you.

1627
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:02,817
There's no problem.

1628
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:04,235
I need to ask a favour.

1629
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:08,364
Ma'am, you are a devout person.

1630
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:12,994
Swear on the Qoran
that I caused your miscarriage.

1631
01:53:21,836 --> 01:53:23,796
Bring a Qoran.

1632
01:53:23,921 --> 01:53:25,464
Go get it.

1633
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:45,609
Come quickly
or they'll suspect something.

1634
01:53:46,902 --> 01:53:49,280
His creditors are here for the money.

1635
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:51,490
You'll ruin our reputation.

1636
01:53:53,492 --> 01:53:55,369
I won't swear.

1637
01:53:56,912 --> 01:54:01,083
Didn't you say you went to get his father
and a car hit you?

1638
01:54:02,501 --> 01:54:04,378
Why aren't you coming?

1639
01:54:05,296 --> 01:54:07,173
She's afraid to swear.

1640
01:54:08,257 --> 01:54:09,467
Why?

1641
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:13,262
[... I have doubts.

1642
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:20,644
Oh God...

1643
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:24,148
Azam, go sit with them.

1644
01:54:27,526 --> 01:54:31,489
Why are you saying this now?

1645
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:34,408
I swear I told Azam.

1646
01:54:35,743 --> 01:54:38,412
Tell me exactly what happened.

1647
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:44,710
The day before, a car hit me.

1648
01:54:44,835 --> 01:54:47,755
And that night I had a lot of pain.

1649
01:54:57,431 --> 01:55:00,393
- Let's go, it'll be my sin.
- No.

1650
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:01,894
It's a sin. I asked.

1651
01:55:02,019 --> 01:55:04,980
What sin? He's consented.
Let's go.

1652
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:07,650
I am scared we'll be punished.

1653
01:55:07,775 --> 01:55:11,404
More punished than this?
Look at my situation.

1654
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:15,199
Have mercy on me.
On our child.

1655
01:55:15,324 --> 01:55:19,370
I'm afraid of something happening
to our child.

1656
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:20,746
Let's go.

1657
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:22,039
I can't.

1658
01:55:22,164 --> 01:55:23,666
Let's go.

1659
01:55:26,293 --> 01:55:28,170
I can't.

1660
01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:34,677
Don't hit yourself!

1661
01:55:53,904 --> 01:55:57,700
Why did you come here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1662
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:00,661
Didn't I say
we don't want your money?

1663
01:56:00,786 --> 01:56:03,664
How will I live in this house?

1664
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:07,626
Why did you do this to me?

1665
01:57:34,713 --> 01:57:36,257
Come on.

1666
01:57:41,095 --> 01:57:42,638
Let's go.

1667
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:00,197
Hello. Come in.

1668
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:12,418
So what's your decision?

1669
01:58:12,543 --> 01:58:17,840
Your parents have left it up to you
to decide who you want to live with.

1670
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:20,843
With your father or your mother?

1671
01:58:21,969 --> 01:58:23,512
Have you decided?

1672
01:58:23,637 --> 01:58:25,097
Yes.

1673
01:58:25,222 --> 01:58:27,308
- Have you?
- Yes.

1674
01:58:37,818 --> 01:58:39,486
Have you decided or not?

1675
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,155
Yes.

1676
01:58:43,115 --> 01:58:44,658
And what is it?

1677
01:58:46,577 --> 01:58:48,454
Do I have to say it now?

1678
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:52,750
- If you haven't decided...
- Yes, I have.

1679
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:59,381
- If you haven't decided yet...
- I have.

1680
01:58:59,506 --> 01:59:00,549
And?

1681
01:59:01,925 --> 01:59:05,512
Would you prefer them
to wait outside?

1682
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:07,556
Can they?

1683
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:10,684
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1684
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:13,896
You too, ma'am.
