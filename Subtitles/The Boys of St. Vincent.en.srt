1
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:27,201
â™ª

2
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,775
Come on in, son.

3
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,777
Come on.

4
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:49,544
Go on, close the door.

5
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:47,899
That book I gave you, kevin,
have you finished it yet?

6
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,162
Not yet, brother
mac, almost though.

7
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,164
What do you think,
do you like it?

8
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:52,905
Yeah, I likes it a lot.

9
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,254
Like, kevin, like.

10
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,603
I like it a lot.

11
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:57,237
Not I likes.

12
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,090
You know when we goes
to confession, I mean go,

13
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:09,312
well, I was wondering, do the
brothers go to confession too?

14
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,402
Indeed we do, my boy.

15
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,490
We confess our sins,
ask the lord

16
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:16,144
for his forgiveness,
we say our hail marys,

17
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,518
just like everybody else.

18
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:29,941
It was a dark, dark night.

19
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,291
And there was
a bit of a wind up,

20
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,926
just enough
to rustle the leaves.

21
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,689
Can we make that sound,
rustling leaves? Come on.

22
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,343
How does that sound?

23
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,693
That's it, that's it.

24
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,521
Now, uncle jim

25
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,959
was afraid of no man,

26
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:53,380
but there was something about
that night that made him uneasy.

27
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,663
When he came around the bend,

28
00:04:56,687 --> 00:05:02,234
he saw a light in the middle
of a bridge he had to cross.

29
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:07,021
And the closer he got, the
brighter the light shone out.

30
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:11,591
When uncle jim put one foot
on that bridge,

31
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,986
he froze like a pillar, because
the light was coming toward him.

32
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,381
It was just...
suspended in the air

33
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,340
and coming closer and closer.

34
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,124
So moved to one side

35
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:23,951
and the light moved with him.

36
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,823
Then he moved to the other side,

37
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,371
and the light moved as well.

38
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,569
Then that light
came rushing at him,

39
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,527
and uncle jim,
the same uncle jim

40
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,051
who was afraid of no man,
was so scared

41
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:40,751
that he ran off the bridge
and took shelter underneath it.

42
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,938
What's this?
Someone come to help me?

43
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,767
Come on, my son, you're no
good to me in there.

44
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,576
I need you out here
to hold this wrench for me.

45
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,580
Come on.

46
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:08,605
There's no need of me
coming down at all

47
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,346
if there's someone already
here to do the work.

48
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,697
Seeing as we're both here,
let's do it together.

49
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,113
Here you go.

50
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,311
Stand up on there.

51
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,728
Are you tall enough?

52
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,731
Now.

53
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:25,994
Hold that tight.

54
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,844
It's no good if you let it slip.

55
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:33,238
What are you doing

56
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,022
down here on your own?

57
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,241
What's your name anyway?

58
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,634
Kevin.

59
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,050
Kevin reevey.

60
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,291
Yeah, ok, and, uh...

61
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:43,945
and what?

62
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,338
What are you doing

63
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,687
down here on your own?

64
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,472
Nothing.

65
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,299
Nothing?

66
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,085
That's not a lot,
to be doing nothing.

67
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,261
You're not afraid of the dark?

68
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:56,958
No.

69
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,419
I like it down here.

70
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,573
What do you think of that?

71
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,226
Good or what?

72
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,533
Yeah, sir.

73
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,882
Thank you, sir.

74
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,494
Come down here often?

75
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:18,022
Just before the sun came up...
the light was gone.

76
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,938
Was it the devil, bro'?

77
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:23,288
It may well have been, child.

78
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,072
But you know

79
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,901
what protected him, don't you?

80
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,555
All of you together now.

81
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,647
What protected uncle jim...
that night under the bridge?

82
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,781
The rosary.

83
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right, saying the rosary.

84
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:44,091
In the name of the father,
and the son and the holy ghost.

85
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,484
Amen.

86
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,486
Good.

87
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,402
Did you hear the one about the
sheep and the lonely shepherd?

88
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,535
Mr. finn, I'd rather hear the
one about the broken door.

89
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:56,452
No, bro', you'd rather hear
the one about the sheep.

90
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,498
I called a couple of stores, and
the part is going to cost $150.

91
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,240
I thought you said you could
repair anything

92
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,894
that needs fixing, mr. Finn.

93
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,896
Well, there are things in life
broken that can't be fixed.

94
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,550
This is one of those things.

95
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,944
Ha, ha, ha, I see.
You're a philosopher, mr. Finn.

96
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:11,945
Indeed I am, brother lavin,
indeed I am.

97
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,339
Now, there was this fellow

98
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,060
who was trying to fix
his poor old broken arm.

99
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:27,483
I've promised
a slide show, gentlemen,

100
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,921
which will be presented after
the 100th anniversary dinner.

101
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,706
And brother glackin, I want
you to take charge of it.

102
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,273
Oh, great.

103
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,622
I don't have enough to do

104
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,276
already, I suppose.

105
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,886
It's already been decided.

106
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,086
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

107
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:48,025
Now, as for the hockey team,

108
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm planning... to...
play mike... at centre.

109
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:04,825
All right, that's it!

110
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,218
Lights out, come on!

111
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:07,959
Everybody in your pyjamas!

112
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,308
Five more minutes, bro'.

113
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:10,962
You say your prayers, please.

114
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,616
Put all your toys in here.

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,226
Come on! Hurry up!

116
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,619
Not yet.

117
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,751
Come on.

118
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,361
Hey, eddie, get him.

119
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,798
Eddie, you could have got him.

120
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,408
No more bathroom.

121
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,062
That should all be done by now.

122
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,194
Come on, please.
Put on your pyjamas.

123
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,326
Kneel down ald
we say our prayers.

124
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,068
Kevin?

125
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,332
Brother lavin would like to see
you in the office, please.

126
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,377
But I'm real tired, bro'.

127
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,249
And I'm getting ready for bed.

128
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,642
Can't it wait till the morning?

129
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,557
What did I say?

130
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,471
Did I say brother lavin would
like to see you in the morning?

131
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,865
No, bro'.

132
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,519
I din't say that, did I?

133
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,936
So go on now.

134
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,686
There you go.

135
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,840
And you cleaned your ear, huh?

136
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,263
Good morning, gentlemen.

137
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,701
Paws out!

138
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:42,705
Good, good, good.

139
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,924
Good, good, good.

140
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,665
If you washed them
that wouldn't happen.

141
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,711
Good, good.

142
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,583
Good, good, good.

143
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,238
Flip.

144
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,611
Good.

145
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,546
Good.

146
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,157
Good.

147
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,811
Good.

148
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,160
That shirt belongs
in the laundry.

149
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,814
Get another one.

150
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,598
Good. Do up the button. Good.

151
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,580
Good.

152
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,958
It's good.

153
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:23,006
And what about you, young man?

154
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,921
Is your little split pea brain
functioning enough this day

155
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,271
to know which foot goes where?

156
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,620
I'm not sure, bro.

157
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,274
Let me see.

158
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,627
That's about
the size of it, my son.

159
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,282
Back in line.

160
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,718
Tuck that shirt in.

161
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,135
Good.

162
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,767
Good.

163
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,464
Good, good, good, good, good.

164
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,988
Get moving.

165
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:52,165
And for god's sake, watch
your language out there.

166
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,560
Remember, you carry the good
name of st. Vincent with you.

167
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,781
Got any clothes
for the orphanage, missis?

168
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,173
We're collecting clothes
for st. Vincent.

169
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:00,871
Hang on a moment, my love,

170
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,785
and I'll see what I got.

171
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,961
What do you think?

172
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,267
Where did you get that?

173
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,921
I made it myself.

174
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,270
Kevin, you must learn
how to take care

175
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:13,012
of yourself in this
mean old world... watch.

176
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,275
Here you go, sweethearts.

177
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,929
Thank you.

178
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,365
Thanks, missis.
I almost forgot.

179
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,019
You wouldn't have
any spare change

180
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,585
for the christmas turkey?

181
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,675
I'm quite sure we'll find
something around here for that.

182
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,092
Just a minute now.

183
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,812
Now, will that do you, boys?

184
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,465
That's great, missis.

185
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,858
Thanks a lot.

186
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,468
You're welcome, boys.

187
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,993
I just wish my own youngsters
were as polite as ye.

188
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:40,213
Thanks again.
Got to run.

189
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,041
Bye.

190
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,719
See what I mean, kevin?

191
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,655
She gave us a lot, buddy.

192
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,919
Yeah?

193
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,921
You know, when we goes
to confession,

194
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:52,922
are you going
to tell them about this?

195
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:56,186
No, boy... don't have nothing

196
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,840
to do with them priests,

197
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,474
my son, can't trust them.

198
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,207
Oh, whoa, yeah!

199
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,688
Hey, hey, hey!

200
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,299
Ring the alarm.

201
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:23,909
We've got a lady
in the orphanage.

202
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,369
Yeah!

203
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:32,265
Ah, these aren't for ladies,
these are for men.

204
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,919
Yeah, boxing.

205
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,268
Boxing, I'm real good at boxing.

206
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,270
I'll beat you up,
I'll beat you up.

207
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:38,055
You're no good.

208
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,273
I'll kick it out of you.

209
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,666
Ok, who's going to fight me?

210
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,276
Come on.

211
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,148
Come on, let's go!

212
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,279
Get your older brother, steven.

213
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,673
Come on, come on, come on!

214
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:01,164
Go, steven, go!

215
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,687
You'll be beating up
on your brother.

216
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,123
Heh, come on!

217
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:08,171
Kevin, you have to go
to brother lavin's office now.

218
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:09,674
Now?

219
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,135
Hey, come on!

220
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,484
Hey, watch me, oof, oof, oof!

221
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:20,313
Yeah! Yeah!

222
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,662
Hey, come on.

223
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:26,232
Hey, steven!

224
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,625
Yeah!

225
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,521
All-time champion!

226
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,211
Kevin reevey!

227
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,063
Hey, hey!

228
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,031
Hey.

229
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,621
No!

230
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,275
Please, no!

231
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,234
Leave me alone.

232
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,888
Don't take me back
there, please.

233
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,282
Ain't no place else

234
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,742
you can go, lad.

235
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,863
Kevin?

236
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,237
Could you wait
in the office, please?

237
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,632
Take off the hat.

238
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,181
Thank you very much

239
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:12,747
for bringing the child
home, gentlemen.

240
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,184
It's too cold to be out.

241
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,750
Well, brother lavin,

242
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:18,535
he certainly didn't
want to come back.

243
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,927
He kicked up some racket.

244
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,581
No doubt.

245
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,366
One thing these youngsters
have in common

246
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,672
is an insatiable need
for attention.

247
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,370
Good evening.

248
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,699
Good night.

249
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,716
Come here.

250
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,463
First of all...

251
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:58,381
let's take off your jacket.

252
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,700
Come here.

253
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,101
Kevin...

254
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,194
it's ok, kevin.

255
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,117
You're home now, child.

256
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,425
Mama loves you.

257
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,836
She loves you.

258
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:16,392
Oh, god, she loves you.

259
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,397
My mother's dead

260
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,963
and always will be.

261
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,763
What?

262
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,702
You're not my mother.

263
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,730
What?

264
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,800
You're not my mother.

265
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,700
What?

266
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,856
You're not my mother.

267
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,315
Ah!

268
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:16,103
If you choose to behave
like the other boys,

269
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,672
then you will be punished
like the other boys.

270
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,283
Ah!

271
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,050
Ugh!

272
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,311
Shh.

273
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,706
Shh.

274
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,213
Shh.

275
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,925
Let's go, gentlemen!

276
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:42,581
Everybody up, let's go, go, go!

277
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,279
Move, let's go!

278
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,890
Let's go, come on, it's time!

279
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:50,328
When I said everybody up,

280
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,289
I think I meant
everybody up, let's go!

281
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:54,855
Come on, move your carcasses!

282
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,204
Let's go, let's go!

283
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,597
Come on, move!

284
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:01,644
Up, up, up, up!

285
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:04,255
Come on! Sun's
been up for hours!

286
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,562
You, up! I said up!

287
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,195
Let's go!

288
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,262
Get your carcass up!

289
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,026
Move it, move it!

290
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:19,207
Come on, move, move,
move, go, go, go, go.

291
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,036
Out! Move, move!

292
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,694
I said move!

293
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,332
It's ok, kevin.

294
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,949
You can stay in bed today.

295
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,736
Ok?

296
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:00,850
Ok, let's move.

297
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,155
Let's move over to the teeth.

298
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,983
Brush your teeth, come on.

299
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:04,681
Come on, go, go, go.

300
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,464
Who made the world?

301
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,945
God.

302
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,034
Who is god?

303
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,340
The creator and son

304
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:16,735
and the lord of heaven
and earth and all things.

305
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,869
How many gods are there?

306
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,001
There is but one god

307
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:25,875
who will reward the good
and punish the wicked.

308
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,704
Where is god?

309
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,923
God is everywhere,

310
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:35,362
but is said to be in heaven
with his angels and saints.

311
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,277
Now, we can do better
than that, boys.

312
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,671
Where is god?

313
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,891
God is everywhere,

314
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,633
but is said to be in heaven
with his angels and saints.

315
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:47,026
Very good.

316
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,680
Very good.

317
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:50,726
Now, let's see. Jimmy.

318
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,379
Yes?

319
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:55,319
What is heaven?

320
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,867
The kingdom of god's glory
and of his angels and saints.

321
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,285
Very good, very good.

322
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:15,098
Come on, I'm real starved.

323
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:18,623
Come on, bud, you got to eat,
get your strength back.

324
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:24,000
Keep it under the blankets, ok?

325
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,677
Got to go.

326
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,137
See you later.

327
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,119
How you doing, mike?

328
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:36,728
Not bad, son.
Yourself?

329
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:40,689
Fine. I'll stay that way if you
don't tell anybody you seen me.

330
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:41,690
Never get it out of me.

331
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,867
I never been here,
know what I mean?

332
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,129
They could pull
out my fingernails,

333
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,610
and I'll never sell you
down the river, how's that?

334
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:49,983
Thanks, mike.

335
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,571
Got to go.

336
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:55,075
See you.

337
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,289
How come you're not up, kevin?

338
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,706
You sick or what?

339
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,339
Come on, you got
to say something.

340
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,950
What's wrong with you?

341
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,411
Come on, let me see that
smiling face of yours.

342
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,682
What happened to you?

343
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,878
I'm telling you, brother,
he doesn't look very good.

344
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:42,925
A day in bed is all

345
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,622
the boy needs,
mr. Finn.

346
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,623
Jesus, brother,
have you seen him?

347
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,407
I think he needs
some ice or something.

348
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:51,194
Why don't you go up and
take a look at him yourself?

349
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:52,022
Just hold on,
mr. Finn.

350
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:55,328
How long have you been here?

351
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,679
A couple of weeks?

352
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:00,203
Boys are a tough lot.

353
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:01,813
They recover quickly.

354
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,815
Not trying to say
anything, brother,

355
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,861
but that boy needs
to see a doctor.

356
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,211
And what in god's name
could the boy have done

357
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,845
to get beaten like that?

358
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,912
Just who in hell
do you think you are?

359
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:16,306
How do you know
the boy was beaten?

360
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,568
Do you know the boy
was beaten? Do you?

361
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:20,005
Are you a doctor?

362
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:21,616
No, you're a janitor, mr. Finn.

363
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,226
That is your job here.

364
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,577
Now, you go and do it and
let me get on with my work.

365
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,690
Or do I find myself
another janitor?

366
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,028
Don't.

367
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:44,551
I don't want to go.

368
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:49,078
Well, my son, you're going
whether you like to or not,

369
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:51,017
'cause this is not good enough.

370
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,006
What seems to be

371
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,268
the problem, young man?

372
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,966
He's been beaten, doc,
that's the problem.

373
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,055
Go on, kevin,
tell him what happened.

374
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,317
I'm going to have
to examine the boy.

375
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:15,191
Would you mind
waiting outside, please?

376
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,478
I'll be outside the
door, kevin, ok?

377
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,352
Hi, kevin.

378
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,810
Good.

379
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,204
Can I help you, brother?

380
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:29,858
Yes, I hope so.

381
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,598
I am brother lavin
from st. Vincent.

382
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:34,340
Apparently one of our boys was
brought in, a kevin reevey.

383
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:35,951
He's with the doctor... down the

384
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,256
hall, second door to your left.

385
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,717
Thank you.

386
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:02,958
You stupid, stupid
son of a bitch.

387
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,329
What do you think you're doing?

388
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:06,983
He had to see a doctor.

389
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,375
He had to see a doctor?

390
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,464
You don't even know
the trouble you're in.

391
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,075
I could have you
charged with abducting

392
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,729
a child, you stupid imbecile.

393
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,427
You don't have to be
getting on with that.

394
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,385
I don't have to?

395
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:20,691
I'll get on with
whatever I choose.

396
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:23,370
And you are no longer welcome
in st. Vincent, mr. Finn.

397
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,089
What?

398
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,961
You're fired,
you meddling moron.

399
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,267
Just the sight of
you makes me sick.

400
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,312
You brought pain
and chaos to our home,

401
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:36,663
and the boys hate you
for it, they've told me.

402
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,970
That is not true,
and you know it.

403
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,711
You're a goddamn nutcase,
that's what you are.

404
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,147
You get out of here.

405
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:44,043
Don't let me see you again,
or I'll have you arrested.

406
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,416
You might call me
a stupid imbecile,

407
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,463
and you might call me a moron,

408
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:57,380
but let me tell you
something right now, bro'.

409
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,948
Those boys have a friend in me.

410
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,626
And in you, they have nothing.

411
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,079
You can take him with you.

412
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:24,320
Poor child.

413
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:28,977
Brother, I have
no idea who did what.

414
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,284
But I think you have a problem
with somebody down there.

415
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,938
He didn't say who it was?

416
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,157
No, he wouldn't
tell us anything.

417
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:38,334
Perhaps you can, uh,
find out more from the boy.

418
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,640
But the child is
terrorized, I'm convinced.

419
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:43,208
I had no idea.

420
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:45,254
No doubt, it's one
of the older boys.

421
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:45,908
They can be very brutal

422
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,517
to the younger ones.

423
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:51,216
The nurse here will give
you the papers to sign,

424
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,262
and, uh, I'll bring
the boy down in a minute.

425
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,916
Fine.

426
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,767
Thank you.

427
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,245
Kevin.

428
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,705
Come here.

429
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:29,322
That is for being a good boy.

430
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:35,110
A few days rest, and you're
going to be as good as new.

431
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,027
Go on.

432
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,314
Well?

433
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,968
Thank you, bro'.

434
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,428
You're welcome.

435
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:56,542
Kevin, if I punish you,

436
00:31:56,566 --> 00:32:00,048
it's only to help you learn
what is right and what is wrong.

437
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,966
I'll always be
here to protect you.

438
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,752
And you are very special to me.

439
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,800
Understand?

440
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:19,609
Let's go get something to eat.

441
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,026
Come on.

442
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,676
It's past your bedtime.

443
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,940
It's past my bedtime.

444
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,942
Shh, close your your eyes.

445
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,640
That's it. Keep out the light.

446
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,555
It's time for bed.

447
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,948
Everybody else is asleep.

448
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,471
Please, bro'.

449
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,126
Get up early in the morning.

450
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,781
It's past your bedtime now.

451
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,155
Come on, now, steven.

452
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,811
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

453
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,879
Have nice dreams.

454
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,578
You're supposed to be asleep.

455
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:16,951
Not supposed to be awake.

456
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:34,597
Are you ok?

457
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,338
Has he been at you?

458
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,711
Has he?

459
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:40,951
Get your hands off me!

460
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:43,499
Back to your seat.
You know that.

461
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,305
Iunny, get back!

462
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,678
Get back here!

463
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,429
What are you all looking at?

464
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:07,045
What are you looking at?

465
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,254
I've got no parking
spaces in the back.

466
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,300
That pervert glackin's been
after my brother again.

467
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,998
If he touches him again, I'm
going to knock out his teeth

468
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,956
and shove them up his holy arse.

469
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,263
Hey, you watch your
language, young man.

470
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:35,962
Foul mouth,
threatening a brother,

471
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:39,662
disrespectful of god at mass
and god knows what else.

472
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,079
10 of the best on each, brother.

473
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,581
No tears, mr. Lunny?

474
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,998
Perhaps you haven't yet
learned your lesson.

475
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,372
Hands out again, please.

476
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,971
Who did this to you?

477
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:14,694
Glynn. I swear I'm going
to kill one of them bastards.

478
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,327
Lay your hands on there

479
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,917
till I get some ice.

480
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,058
Now, this will freeze them and
keep the swelling down for it.

481
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,975
Bunch of goddamned perverts.

482
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,370
Ok, let me wrap this up.

483
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,118
Now, are you going to tell me
what's going on around here?

484
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,230
Stevie.

485
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:53,927
Glackin's after him.

486
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:56,059
I tried to do something

487
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,563
about it, and look.

488
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,807
Look, I got fired, ok,

489
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,549
for taking young kevin
to the hospital.

490
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,097
And now this?

491
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:13,511
I want you

492
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:19,343
to tell me exactly what you
mean by perverts, brian.

493
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,127
They're after us,

494
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,999
especially the young ones,

495
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:25,654
in their beds at
night, you know?

496
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,419
No, I don't know.

497
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,684
Oh, Jesus christ almighty.

498
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,577
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

499
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,579
I'm not lying, mike.

500
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,960
Jesus, brian.

501
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,205
Yes, sir, can I help you?

502
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,555
Who's the person in charge
here? maybe I can help you.

503
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:58,904
Are you in charge?

504
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:00,819
No, but I can probably...

505
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:01,951
Well, you can't help me then.

506
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:05,171
Sir, if you tell me
what it is, maybe I can.

507
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:09,437
Listen, my love, there's
a manager or director

508
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,353
or some goddamned thing in here,
I don't care what he's called.

509
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:13,919
That's who I want to see.

510
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:15,617
My name is mike finn.

511
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:16,922
I wasthe janitor
at st. Vincent.

512
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:20,404
You go, and you find him

513
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:21,710
now!

514
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,563
'Cause I ain't leaving
till I talk to the fella.

515
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,024
Well, we have our procedures

516
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,810
to investigate
complaints, mr. Finn.

517
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:37,203
And this is not the way
to go about it.

518
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:40,946
What the hell
are you talking about?

519
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,992
I'm telling you they're
beating the living daylights

520
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,994
out of them boys
and going around at night,

521
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,604
bothering them in their beds.

522
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:48,302
Now, what I want to know is

523
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,000
how are you going
to put a stop to it?

524
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:55,047
As I've already told you,
mr. Finn, we cannot do anything

525
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,615
until you go to the proper
district office to fill out

526
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,401
a complaint form.

527
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:02,054
Now, once that is done,

528
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,883
the form will be evaluated
by our review panel.

529
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:09,279
I'm supposed to go
and fill out a form?

530
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,585
That's what you're
going to do about it?

531
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:14,110
Well, you just can't come
barging in here, making wild

532
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,179
statements about things you
haven't even seen yourself.

533
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,681
Spreading rumours
about one of the most

534
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,726
hallowed institutions
of this city.

535
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,773
Now, I'm sorry, I must insist
that you follow the rules.

536
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,514
They, they have been
developed for very...

537
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,366
Mr. finn, where are you going?

538
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,042
I tell you where I'm not going.

539
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,698
That's to your district office
to fill out no goddamned form.

540
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,158
No, sir.

541
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,268
Ha, ha, I said to her, I said,

542
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:45,315
"lady, what are you
giving it to me for?"

543
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:46,143
"Don't forget the surgeon!"

544
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,319
Ah, here it is.
Here it is.

545
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,755
Look how beautiful.

546
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,366
The all new and very

547
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,715
accommodating st.
Vincent orphanage.

548
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:56,152
Excellent, excellent.

549
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,764
And just how much is
this going to cost me?

550
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:04,552
Ah, well, minister, the
renovations are budgeted

551
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:09,992
at 450,000, and the rink
at half a million, so the total

552
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:12,647
government grant will have
to be in the neighbourhood

553
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:15,301
of $1 million.

554
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:19,088
Is that all?

555
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:23,005
St. vincent has always had one
of the finest teams in the city.

556
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:23,833
Now that they'll finally
have their own rink,

557
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,704
they may be just unbeatable.

558
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,314
And learn to skate.

559
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,142
And speaking of those

560
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:34,059
whose path to heaven is assured,
we all know our esteemed

561
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,147
chief kennedy.

562
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:39,282
Nay, not a blemish
resides in his soul,

563
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,327
nor has a drop
ever passed his lips.

564
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,981
Certainly not.
Pour the man a drink.

565
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,679
Please do, ha, ha.

566
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,594
Chief kennedy is another
of our respected citizens

567
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,117
who got training
with the brothers.

568
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:50,012
And I have the bruises
to prove it.

569
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:56,299
Now, now, chief,
let's have a toast.

570
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,996
Hear, hear.

571
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,172
Gentlemen, to brother
lavin's renovation plans.

572
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,609
Salute grazie dio.

573
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,175
Salute.

574
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,873
God bless.

575
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,223
Have a spin for a quarter.

576
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,094
Step right up.
Get your tickets inside.

577
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,270
Every spin is a prize.

578
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,359
Merry christmas.
That's it. Come on in.

579
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:15,057
Merry christmas.

580
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,407
You look like you need
the turkey. Come on in.

581
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,714
Come on in. Merry christmas,
merry christmas.

582
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:21,933
Come one, come all.

583
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,718
Two for a nickel,
four for a dime,

584
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,371
10 for a quarter.

585
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,591
How you doing, ma'am?
Step right up.

586
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,332
Hey!

587
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,986
Are they all gone?

588
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,553
Yes, they're almost all gone.

589
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,511
We've got two more here.
Quick, quick.

590
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,947
Are they all gone?

591
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,558
All gone! They're all gone!

592
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,909
All right, mr. Premier,

593
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:42,563
spin the wheel, please!

594
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,347
Yes, brother, I will!

595
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:45,696
I'll spin the wheel.

596
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,786
Here we go!

597
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,659
And where she stops,
nobody knows!

598
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,530
Ha, ha, ha!

599
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:57,055
Number...

600
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,145
one!

601
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,712
Number one!

602
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,477
You won!

603
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,527
Two for a nickel!

604
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:29,261
Well, if it isn't
detective noseworthy

605
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:30,698
of the royal frigging
newfoundland frigging

606
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:33,265
constabulary.

607
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:34,658
How are you doing, mike?

608
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:36,268
Not so bloody good.

609
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,357
Come on in. Have a drink.

610
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,881
Is that why you called me, mike?

611
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:42,516
To have a drink with you?

612
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,975
Look, marty, I know
you're not catholic,

613
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,325
but Jesus, mary and Joseph, man,

614
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:50,326
those bastards are
at them young fellas,

615
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,024
and something's got
to be done about it,

616
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:55,244
church or no goddamned church.

617
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,811
Have you ever seen
anything yourself?

618
00:42:56,835 --> 00:43:00,510
Have I seen anything?

619
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,860
I've seen a young fella's
hands so smashed up,

620
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:03,861
they looked like hamburger meat.

621
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:06,255
Brian lunny, talk to him.

622
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:07,062
He'll tell you plenty of stuff.

623
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,701
Now, uh, this boy you took to
the hospital, kevin reevey.

624
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,137
What was the doctor's name?

625
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,357
That's another thing.

626
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,185
Why would lavin have me fired

627
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,274
just for taking a young
kid to the hospital?

628
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,537
The doctor, mike?
Do you remember his name?

629
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,930
Jesus, I don't know.

630
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:30,932
He threw me out of the room,

631
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,586
looking at me like
I done something.

632
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,936
Then that high and mighty
fella from the government

633
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,241
asking me to fill out
forms for christ's sake.

634
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:39,331
You got to be able
to read and write

635
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:40,637
to know what's right and wrong?

636
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:48,340
My god, we can't use that.

637
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:49,951
We look like a
crowd of refugees.

638
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:53,694
Like prisoners of war.

639
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:55,086
I can tell you one thing.

640
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:55,653
You can plan some party.

641
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,959
Can you imagine?

642
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,179
A hundred years of good works.

643
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,617
I vow and promise

644
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:09,361
to protect every living thing
that god has put on this earth.

645
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:12,843
I'll protect, uh,
butterflies and flowers,

646
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,759
children, rich and poor.

647
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:18,830
I'll even protect
crab lice, ha, ha.

648
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:25,924
Any and every living
and non-living thing.

649
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,948
I'll protect the
bones of dead relatives

650
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:33,496
and the, the insects
that feed on them.

651
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:42,220
I vow, I vow
I vow, I vow, I vow.

652
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:43,681
Bravo!

653
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,359
Ok, eddie, we're here.

654
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:52,317
Now, if you hears
or sees anything,

655
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:53,928
flick this switch here,
and that'll let us know.

656
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,997
And always keep a lookout.

657
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:25,046
That's the wine.

658
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,917
You idiot, I know where that is.

659
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:28,551
The bottles, where's
the bottles, boy?

660
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:45,240
Come on, hurry up.

661
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,764
Take it easy, will you...
I'll get 'em all.

662
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:51,072
Hurry, hurry.

663
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:52,638
Let's go.

664
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,012
Come on, come on.

665
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:08,722
Oh!

666
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,373
Thank you.

667
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,791
You will say the grace,
brother maclaverty.

668
00:46:39,622 --> 00:46:41,557
Bless us, oh, lord, and these
thy gifts which from thy bounty

669
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:44,647
we are about to receive
through christ, our lord.

670
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,257
Amen.

671
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:48,564
And, and forgive us,
lord, for the

672
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:51,175
wrong we do, and be merciful for

673
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,177
the path we've chosen.

674
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:58,704
We at this table ask
your forgiveness, amen.

675
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:01,055
What was that all about?

676
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,492
Have you taken it upon yourself

677
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:05,886
to change our regular
grace, or is there some

678
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,323
dark spot on your soul

679
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:10,542
you wish to discuss
at the breakfast table?

680
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,004
Just rambling, brother.

681
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,770
Here you go.

682
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,554
I think he's in trouble.

683
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:25,993
Come on, lunny, you little
frigger, fill it up, boy.

684
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:28,256
What do you think this is, my
son, a garden party, do you?

685
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,345
That's how much you get
for what you paid.

686
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:34,697
That's it, boys, put it
in the bag, that's right.

687
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,438
If you want some more,
come back, eh?

688
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:38,092
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:38,702
Yeah, yeah.

690
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:41,095
That's it, boys.

691
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:41,705
Anybody for seconds?

692
00:47:41,729 --> 00:47:44,011
That's it, boys.

693
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:44,621
Anybody for seconds, come on.

694
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:47,014
Drink up, drink up.

695
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:49,668
Now, a globe is simply a ball

696
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,366
with a picture of
the earth on it.

697
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:57,328
Ok, now, on the picture of
the globe in your book,

698
00:47:57,352 --> 00:48:02,812
find the line that runs around
the middle of the earth.

699
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,814
Everyone see it?

700
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:06,468
Yes.

701
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:07,817
Kevin reevey

702
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,558
to the office.

703
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,821
Kevin reevey to the office.

704
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,238
Kevin reevey.

705
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:18,610
Come on, kevin, let's go.

706
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:22,092
Hurry up.

707
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,965
Now, this line is
called the equator.

708
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:25,880
It divides the earth in half.

709
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,080
The upper half is called?

710
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,039
There's a policeman in my office

711
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,152
who wants to talk to
you about the hospital.

712
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:11,359
Anything you tell him,
I will know about it.

713
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,646
Do you understand?

714
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:46,984
Kevin reevey?

715
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:58,928
Brian?

716
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:00,060
Brian?

717
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,845
Can I, uh, have a talk with you?

718
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,716
In private, please.

719
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,133
Come on, it's all right.

720
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,984
What did he ask you?

721
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,594
He told me I'm a part of
a police investigation,

722
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:16,641
and I'm not supposed to tell
anyone what we talked about.

723
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:19,905
I said, what did he ask you,
and what did you say?

724
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:21,559
He told me that if anyone

725
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,605
so much as touches me,
to contact him.

726
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,910
So, you want to touch me?

727
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:26,608
You want to hit me, hey?

728
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:28,305
Is that what you want to do?

729
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,678
'Cause I'm not telling
you nothing!

730
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:55,028
What was done to you
is a crime, kevin.

731
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,160
Whoever did that can
be put in jail.

732
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,857
Jail?

733
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,406
Yeah, if you tell me who did it.

734
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:13,307
Were you beaten because you
ran away from the orphanage?

735
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:16,223
Who told you I ran away?

736
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:19,791
I talked to the officers who
brought you back here, kevin.

737
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:21,358
All right?

738
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,317
Now, the last thing they saw

739
00:51:23,341 --> 00:51:25,082
was brother lavin telling
you to wait in his office.

740
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,177
The next day, you were
taken to the hospital.

741
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,683
Can I go now?

742
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:44,425
It's ok, kevin.

743
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:46,427
Just take it easy,
now, all right?

744
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:47,843
Things are going to be ok.

745
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:55,305
Thank you, kevin.

746
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:57,742
Run along now.

747
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:59,701
Straight back to
class, now, kevin.

748
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:02,660
No detours.

749
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:05,576
If I have any more questions,
I'll be in touch.

750
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,883
Detective, if there's something
going on with these boys,

751
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,624
I think I should know about it.

752
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,930
As I've told you, I'm
following up some leads.

753
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,584
I'm afraid I can't
go beyond that.

754
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:17,110
I hope you got what you wanted
and that will be the end.

755
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,112
I'm afraid I cannot have this
kind of thing going on here.

756
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,984
Now, on that, I agree with you.

757
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,097
This is no place to
conduct police interviews.

758
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,514
I'm telling you,
that's what the cop said.

759
00:52:30,538 --> 00:52:34,431
They're all going
to jail, if, and only if,

760
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:36,738
you guys tell them what's
been happening around here.

761
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:38,131
I don't know, brian.

762
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,568
You shouldn't have
given them names.

763
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:41,439
Christ, lavin will

764
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,875
take the skin right off of us.

765
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:49,011
Chicken, chicken.

766
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:59,282
Do you mind if I
take a look at that?

767
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,676
No.

768
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,136
Thank you.

769
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:12,643
Kevin had a hard life before
he came to the orphanage.

770
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:16,038
He was brought up with alcohol
and fighting, and then there

771
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:20,303
was the fire which absolutely
destroyed the child.

772
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:23,872
Watching his parents
being carried out dead.

773
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:26,918
Now, the doctor who saw kevin

774
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:29,704
filed an official report
of suspected abuse.

775
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:32,707
Yes, I know.

776
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,709
What are you going
to do with it?

777
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:35,840
It's already been dealt with.

778
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:38,278
Everything having to
do with the orphanage

779
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:41,237
gets sent to the director.

780
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:45,067
This is not the first
report, you know.

781
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:49,637
Reports having to
do with beatings?

782
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:53,554
Beatings and...

783
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:56,600
they go upstairs, and that's
the last we ever hear of them.

784
00:53:56,624 --> 00:54:05,783
Have you ever had any reports
of brothers touching boys?

785
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:08,656
There have been rumours.

786
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,877
Look, I'm the social worker
assigned to the boys in the

787
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:15,532
orphanage, and I can't even get
in there to see the boys.

788
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:20,276
Brother lavin says it would
disrupt their routine.

789
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,061
Really?

790
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:25,760
There's nothing I can do.

791
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:27,414
Have you ever tried to go

792
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:29,614
over the catholic church
in newfoundland?

793
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,727
This brian lunny has been making

794
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:39,991
some serious
allegations, brother.

795
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,995
Do you know of
anything going on?

796
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:47,042
No.

797
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:47,957
I don't believe a word of it.

798
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:50,350
What I do believe is he's

799
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,873
a sullen and resentful
young delinquent.

800
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,483
What if it is true?

801
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:57,294
What then?

802
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,623
Then glackin will have
to be dealt with.

803
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:05,016
But I tell you he
is simply making up

804
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,670
a story about his little brother

805
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:09,934
to hide his own
incipient criminality.

806
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,327
I don't think you
fully understand

807
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,286
what is going on here.

808
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,941
This is a copy of
the witness statement

809
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:21,424
which the police department has
been kind enough to send over.

810
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:23,121
Peter, do you realize
what happens when

811
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:25,167
a police investigation
gets underway?

812
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:28,997
Word of it starts
getting around.

813
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:31,869
All sorts of rumours start up.

814
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,219
I am getting calls.

815
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,830
Now the police want

816
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:38,223
to interview more boys.

817
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:38,964
And not at

818
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:40,791
the orphanage, you see?

819
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:42,924
I will deal with it.

820
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:46,884
That's not good enough, peter.

821
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:50,671
The monsignor will be looking
into this matter on my behalf.

822
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:51,086
He'll keep you informed.

823
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,852
Have a good night's rest, peter.

824
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:00,966
I have the feeling
you're going to need it.

825
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,237
Your grace.

826
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:17,175
Peter, please.

827
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,853
Sit a moment.

828
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,967
I'd like to read some
of the words from this...

829
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,664
this boy's statement.

830
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:32,452
"I have been beaten lots
of times by brother glynn."

831
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,279
"He smashes lots of boys,"

832
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:38,675
"and he's after some
of the little ones."

833
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:43,767
"I saw him rubbing mike
sproule's private parts."

834
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,925
"Brother glackin is after
my little brother, stevie."

835
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:52,254
Everybody up please,
immediately!

836
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:55,518
Down to the gymnasium
right now, come on!

837
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,346
Up, up, up, come on!

838
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,739
You, get up, you, get up!

839
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:00,436
Come on!

840
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,177
Down to the gymnasium,
quickly, please.

841
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:02,787
Forget your slippers.

842
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:05,093
Down to the gym!

843
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:06,466
Go, go, come on!

844
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:27,115
There are rumours

845
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:32,927
being spread around
by certain people.

846
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:41,042
Anyone who is spreading
these rumours

847
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:46,003
is a traitor to the orphanage,

848
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:52,164
a traitor to you
and a traitor to god.

849
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:03,368
Whatever happens inside the
walls of this orphanage

850
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:09,679
is to stay inside the
walls of this orphanage.

851
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:13,814
That is a sacred rule,

852
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:20,714
a rule more sacred than
any rule you will ever hear.

853
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:24,631
Understand this.

854
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:29,569
There are people outside

855
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:34,835
who want to see
this orphanage close.

856
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:37,664
These...

857
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:45,019
these rumours are
the way to do it.

858
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:47,369
If these

859
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:53,114
hellish fantasies are believed
by the devils outside,

860
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:57,727
people will stop donating money.

861
00:58:57,751 --> 00:59:00,774
People will stop
donating clothing.

862
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,428
You will be forced out
onto the street,

863
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:07,500
and you will have nowhere
to go but into the gutter.

864
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:18,705
If I hear or hear of anyone who
is spreading these evil lies

865
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:25,973
from hell or talking to anyone
outside, I can assure you

866
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:30,567
that by god...

867
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:39,706
by god, they will be punished.

868
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:55,742
Now, mike,

869
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,526
what about brother glynn?

870
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,310
Has he ever touched you?

871
00:59:58,334 --> 01:00:01,138
Yes.

872
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:04,359
What has he done?

873
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:11,322
He took me to my dorm, put me
on his knee and spanked me.

874
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:12,802
And then?

875
01:00:12,826 --> 01:00:19,853
And then he rubbed me all
over and all over my bum.

876
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,768
What else?

877
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:25,336
Sometimes he even does
it on my private part.

878
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,990
What does he do on

879
01:00:26,014 --> 01:00:28,296
your private part?

880
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,646
He rubs me.

881
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,171
What else does he do?

882
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:37,740
Sometimes he takes me into his
bed and puts me on top of him

883
01:00:37,764 --> 01:00:42,876
and says rub me
on his private part.

884
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,747
Does he do this often?

885
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:47,794
Yes.

886
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:51,319
Now, what about brother mac?

887
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:56,977
No, he never done
any of that stuff.

888
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:59,370
Sometimes I wake up in
the middle of the night

889
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:01,982
and he's in bed with me...

890
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:06,464
rubbing and trying, you know.

891
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:14,603
Kissing, trying to... trying
to stick it up me bum.

892
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,107
Anything else about glackin?

893
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:20,827
You sure?

894
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:23,656
Yes, sir, he comes to my bed

895
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,831
and he leans right in over me.

896
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:27,311
So I knows it's him.

897
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:28,183
I can see his face.

898
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:30,358
Sometimes he wants me to look

899
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:32,447
at him when he's doing it.

900
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,405
And brother glynn?

901
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:37,191
Yeah.

902
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:37,845
Brother maclaverty?

903
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:41,151
No, not brother mac.

904
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:43,588
What about brother nichol?

905
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:46,156
Yeah, he's got a stick.

906
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,723
Does he hit you with it?

907
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:49,769
All over.

908
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:50,466
Even your face?

909
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:53,816
Yeah.

910
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,863
And brother white?

911
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:59,692
Not me, but some of the others.

912
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,737
What about brother loomy?

913
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,174
No.

914
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:06,157
And, uh, what
about brother lavin?

915
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,664
No.

916
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:17,274
You're sure.

917
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:18,146
There's no need

918
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,084
to be scared, you know.

919
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:38,852
Let's talk about

920
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:41,114
some of the others.

921
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,767
No, it's not ok.

922
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,160
You can't say I said anything.

923
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,814
I never saw him do anything.

924
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:48,251
I never opened me mouth
about brother lavin, right?

925
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,297
It's fine.

926
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:51,689
I understand.

927
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,431
No more about it, ok?

928
01:04:54,455 --> 01:04:56,607
Now, let's talk about
brother maclaverty.

929
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,218
Listen here.

930
01:04:58,242 --> 01:04:59,697
Brother mac's number one.

931
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:03,223
Him, brother porter and brother
quinlan are the best kind.

932
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:04,572
They've always been good to us.

933
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:06,182
So no one's been

934
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:06,880
at you, is that right?

935
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:10,708
Not glynn, not glackin?

936
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,362
That's right.

937
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:13,190
I'd let them have it

938
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:15,888
if they tried anything on me.

939
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,151
Mm-hmm.

940
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:19,761
You're sure.

941
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:21,763
Yes, I'm sure...
I told you already.

942
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:23,093
I don't let them.

943
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:54,970
It's unbelievable.

944
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:56,406
I've never seen
anything like it.

945
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,147
Noseworthy, I want
to see evidence.

946
01:05:57,171 --> 01:05:59,322
I've got enough to make arrests.

947
01:05:59,346 --> 01:06:00,889
As soon as I...

948
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:02,282
Hold on a second
there, noseworthy.

949
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:03,848
You're not going
off half-cocked.

950
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,241
You know what we're up against.

951
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:07,156
I want a report
on what you've got.

952
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,810
How can I write a report

953
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,246
when I haven't finished
my investigation?

954
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,031
I've got to interview every lad.

955
01:06:11,055 --> 01:06:13,249
Those boys came from two dorms.

956
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:14,903
There are other dorms and other

957
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,252
brothers in charge
of those dorms.

958
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:17,950
Then there's brother lavin.

959
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,255
I'm convinced the
boys are terrified.

960
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:21,170
What is all this istuff?

961
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:23,346
Ineed to arrest,
ineed to interview.

962
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,044
This is sensitive
stuff, noseworthy.

963
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:25,566
I can't have the police force

964
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:28,656
look like we're out to crucify
catholics, now can I?

965
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,353
You're catholic sir.

966
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:31,964
Do you think I'm crucifying you?

967
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,313
Don't get smart
with me, noseworthy.

968
01:06:33,337 --> 01:06:34,923
There's no use talking to you.

969
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,925
Get me a report of
what you've got.

970
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:39,058
Now, justice and social
services are waiting for it,

971
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,668
and I'm waiting for it.

972
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,800
And in the meantime,
I want to see

973
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:46,239
a copy of those
witness statements.

974
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:48,284
Glackin, glackin, glackin!

975
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:49,894
That's enough, boys.

976
01:06:49,918 --> 01:06:51,505
That's enough, come on.

977
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,376
Get to your beds,
it's time for prayers.

978
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,053
Awww!

979
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,555
Do we have to?

980
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,103
Yes, you have to.

981
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:03,106
Where's brother glackin, bro'?

982
01:07:04,716 --> 01:07:07,521
Brother glackin has been

983
01:07:07,545 --> 01:07:09,131
relieved of his duties.

984
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,133
I'll be replacing him
for the time being.

985
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:12,550
Yeah!

986
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:18,140
Boys.

987
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:19,600
Boys, that's enough.

988
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:56,265
I can assure you it is
a very fine facility.

989
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:58,354
These men are sick.

990
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:00,748
They need proper
medical treatment

991
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:02,750
in a spiritual setting.

992
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:08,538
They have acknowledged
breaking their vows.

993
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:13,698
It's the first step towards what
we hope will be a full recovery.

994
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,635
Good day, gentlemen.

995
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,594
Thank you very much.

996
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,291
Giancarlo.

997
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:24,056
Monsignor.

998
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:31,909
You know, it stinks.

999
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:33,824
They should be facing

1000
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:36,436
criminal charges.

1001
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,265
But the grant's already
been announced.

1002
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,441
We can't be seen giving
a million dollars

1003
01:08:41,465 --> 01:08:43,095
to a bunch of perverts.

1004
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,817
They should be in jail, ed.

1005
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:49,318
This is your official

1006
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:51,886
release form
from st. Vincent.

1007
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,105
You are to report to the social

1008
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,238
welfare office on harvey road.

1009
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:59,676
And I want you off the premises

1010
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,243
before the day is out.

1011
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:03,332
I was gettin' out
of here, anyways.

1012
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,899
And I'm not going to any
goddamn welfare office.

1013
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:06,596
I'm going to get a job.

1014
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,426
And I'm going to get my brother
out of this hell hole.

1015
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,080
The only mark
you'll make, lunny,

1016
01:09:11,104 --> 01:09:13,386
is with your fingerprints,

1017
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,039
stealing something.

1018
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:18,173
Oh, yeah, well,
wherever the hell I'm going,

1019
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,523
I'm going to tell them about
you goddamn perverts

1020
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:22,525
and what you've
been doing in here.

1021
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:23,484
Oh, no, you're not.

1022
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:25,093
You see, you got
a big mouth, lunny,

1023
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,964
and you're going
to have to learn

1024
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:29,402
to keep it shut tight.

1025
01:09:29,426 --> 01:09:31,055
Your younger brother is going

1026
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:33,014
to be with us for
a good many years,

1027
01:09:33,038 --> 01:09:34,798
and if I hear about you saying

1028
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,452
so much as one word...

1029
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:38,174
do I have to spell it out?

1030
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:42,047
You miserable bastard.

1031
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:49,422
Can't wait to go to toronto.

1032
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:50,119
Don't get too excited yet.

1033
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:52,381
It's going to take a while.

1034
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:54,383
Yeah, I know,
but I'm going sometime, right?

1035
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:56,646
What do you think,
I'm going to leave you

1036
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,300
in this goddamn place?

1037
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:01,303
No way. As soon as I get
straightened away, you're gone.

1038
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,957
You'll be all right.

1039
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,611
Just stay away from them.
That's all.

1040
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:06,265
I can look after myself.

1041
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:08,963
I'll kick the bastards in
the nuts if they comes near me.

1042
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:10,660
I knows what to do.

1043
01:10:10,684 --> 01:10:12,077
Yeah, you're tough, stevie.

1044
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:15,317
Hey, how much money you got?

1045
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:17,082
I don't know. I'm ok.

1046
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:22,672
Here. You gotta eat, boy.

1047
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,326
It's a long bus ride.

1048
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,936
Don't be foolish. Put that away.

1049
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,746
Look, there's a lot more
where that came from.

1050
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:32,053
Take care of yourself, huh?

1051
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:36,208
Ok, here we go.

1052
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,861
The speech ends,
and you've taken places

1053
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:40,299
in the back of the hall.

1054
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:43,302
Now, I will be up front,
over here on the side.

1055
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:44,433
Ok, now don't forget,

1056
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:46,000
you're holding
a million-dollar cheque, ok?

1057
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:48,350
So hold it proudly. That's it.

1058
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:49,482
Now, keep your eyes on me.

1059
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:52,291
Ready?

1060
01:10:53,945 --> 01:10:56,706
Slowly.

1061
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:58,317
Slower.

1062
01:10:58,341 --> 01:10:59,970
That's it.

1063
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,668
Want everybody
to have a good look.

1064
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:04,018
Ok, come right ahead,
right up here on the stage.

1065
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,454
That's it. Watch your step.

1066
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,109
Ok, now...

1067
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:09,937
you turn around.

1068
01:11:09,961 --> 01:11:13,810
Ok, so we can get
a good picture. That's it.

1069
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,421
Excuse me, brother.

1070
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:16,770
Yes, brother?

1071
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:18,424
A small addition, brother.

1072
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,382
A gift will be given
to the premier.

1073
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:22,036
What a lovely idea.

1074
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,559
Well, well, well, well, well,
let's see, now.

1075
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:27,302
We'll need a boy to step forward
and present the gift.

1076
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:28,675
Oh, me, me, me...

1077
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,698
how about kevin?

1078
01:11:31,722 --> 01:11:33,308
An excellent idea.

1079
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:35,005
Ok, kevin, uh...

1080
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:37,660
brother, would you mind
standing in for the premier?

1081
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:39,836
Certainly not.

1082
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,317
Ok, you stand right there,
just ahead a little bit.

1083
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,276
There you go,
ok, right there, fine.

1084
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,321
Now, kevin,

1085
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:47,583
you come out around.

1086
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:50,717
You have your gift
for the premier in your hands.

1087
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:53,023
Go forward, and you present
your gift to the premier.

1088
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,721
That's it.

1089
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:57,225
Now, mr. Premier,
you shake hands with kevin.

1090
01:11:58,879 --> 01:12:02,163
Kevin, shake hands.

1091
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:03,231
Kevin?

1092
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,211
Yeah, there, yes.

1093
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:08,648
Oh, that's a very nice picture.

1094
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,650
Now, uh,

1095
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:12,304
you return to your place.

1096
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,697
Brother, would you mind bringing
kevin back to his place?

1097
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:17,352
You come forward
to the edge of the stage.

1098
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:18,919
That's it. Stop there.

1099
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,921
Now, the archbishop
will rise, go forward,

1100
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,618
and you will present him
with the cheque

1101
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,359
for $1 million, ok?

1102
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:25,926
Now, he may want to ask you
a few questions

1103
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,276
from your catechism text.

1104
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,452
Uh, eddie, who is god?

1105
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:33,281
The creator and sovereign
lord of heaven and earth

1106
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:35,152
and all things.

1107
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:36,763
And, mikey, what is heaven?

1108
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:41,333
The kingdom of god's glory
and of his angels and saints.

1109
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,160
Exactly.

1110
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:45,815
Then you move back the stage.

1111
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:48,165
Ok.

1112
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:49,950
You stop there. Fine.

1113
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:53,083
Ok, now, you come forward.

1114
01:12:53,107 --> 01:12:54,607
Just come forward a little bit.

1115
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:56,589
Ok.

1116
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:07,810
Everything ok?

1117
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:10,378
Anything wrong?

1118
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:13,076
I think he was
coming after me again.

1119
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,818
Who?

1120
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,931
Brother lavin.

1121
01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:23,328
Want to tell me about it?

1122
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,095
What did you say?

1123
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,183
Did you say anything at all?

1124
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:36,036
I told him
that he wasn't my mother.

1125
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,652
What did he do after that?

1126
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,196
Did he say anything?

1127
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,136
He picked me up
and he threw me on the wall.

1128
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:56,013
Did he hit you?

1129
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,256
Did he hit you with his hands?

1130
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,500
With a belt.

1131
01:15:06,197 --> 01:15:08,654
What end of the belt?

1132
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:10,593
The buckle.

1133
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:20,666
Uh, does brother lavin...

1134
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:24,670
Has he ever done this with
any other boys that you know of?

1135
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:27,740
No, he says that I'm his boy.

1136
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:38,708
Has this kind of thing
been going on for a long time?

1137
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,407
Do you remember the first time
it ever happened?

1138
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:00,599
Great.

1139
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:07,234
Do I have to go back

1140
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:09,279
to the orphanage?

1141
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:11,262
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1142
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,503
You know,
when your parents died,

1143
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:18,051
the court put you
in the custody of the brothers.

1144
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,708
But it's going to stop, kevin.

1145
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,104
We'll put an end to this stuff,
I promise you.

1146
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:32,065
I can't give you
your family back, but trust me.

1147
01:16:33,676 --> 01:16:35,329
It's all over.

1148
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,463
You got my word.

1149
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:41,553
All right?

1150
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:52,888
You're going to come back
and see me, right?

1151
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:55,282
I promised you, didn't I?

1152
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:57,197
Let's go.

1153
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:57,851
Yes, oh, yes, he's here now,

1154
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,006
as a matter of fact.

1155
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:03,203
Yes, I'll call you.

1156
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:04,924
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

1157
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:09,339
Now, I don't know
everything that's

1158
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,646
been going on
in here, but I will.

1159
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,953
You can count on that.

1160
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:16,303
I want to make sure
that you understand that

1161
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:17,391
you and every
other person in here

1162
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:20,307
are the subject
of a police investigation

1163
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:22,309
into very serious
criminal matters.

1164
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,311
Such as?

1165
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:26,313
Gross indecency,
physical assault,

1166
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:28,924
indecent assault.

1167
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:31,318
Shall we start with that?

1168
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,667
Don't be absurd, detective.

1169
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:35,322
Now, you listen here.

1170
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:37,324
I have brought this boy
back here personally

1171
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:38,630
to make sure that
nothing more happens to him.

1172
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:43,591
It is over!

1173
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:46,942
That boy is under
my very personal protection.

1174
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:47,943
Don't you come in here
threatening me.

1175
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:50,337
You have no authority here.

1176
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:52,295
You know it, and I know it.

1177
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:54,646
So if you would quickly remove
yourself from the premises,

1178
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,213
we can get on with
the job of repairing

1179
01:17:57,237 --> 01:18:00,173
some of the damage
you people have caused.

1180
01:18:00,197 --> 01:18:01,609
Is that right?

1181
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,219
That is right.

1182
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:04,830
Well, let me tell you something.

1183
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:07,963
I have some paperwork to do,
and then I will come back here

1184
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:08,835
with all the authority I need.

1185
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:13,906
Now, this is not it, lavin.

1186
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:18,147
If you touch that boy
before I get back here,

1187
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:22,001
I'll rip that Jesus throat
right out of your neck.

1188
01:18:25,004 --> 01:18:25,590
Here you go.

1189
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:28,331
Joseph...

1190
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:30,314
and his walking stick.

1191
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:37,036
Have you seen kevin?

1192
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,646
No, bro'.

1193
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,063
Me neither.

1194
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:44,913
Lying little thieves.

1195
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,610
Ye shall not enter
the kingdom of god.

1196
01:18:46,634 --> 01:18:49,439
Do you hear me!

1197
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:51,378
Your punishment will be eternal!

1198
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:03,086
Move, move!

1199
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,136
Kevin!

1200
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:16,099
Kevin!

1201
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:39,862
You foolish... foolish child.

1202
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,303
Foolish, foolish child!

1203
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,677
Why?

1204
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:58,378
Why, why, why, huh?

1205
01:19:58,402 --> 01:20:00,772
Why?

1206
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,060
Why, why?

1207
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,261
Please, bro',
don't hit me, bro'.

1208
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:13,872
I'll do whatever you wants, mom.

1209
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,264
Please, mom, I'll be good, mom.

1210
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:19,118
Please, mom, please, mom.

1211
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:45,710
I love you.

1212
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,907
Peter.

1213
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:52,021
What in the name of god
are you doing?

1214
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:57,306
Come here, child.

1215
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,742
Let him go.

1216
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:01,441
Come here.

1217
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:03,249
Come here. Let him go.

1218
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:11,625
Go up to your dorm, kevin.

1219
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:13,129
Go on. Go on, boys.

1220
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,598
You're a sick, evil man, peter,

1221
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:31,016
and a disgrace to the order.

1222
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:37,346
By the authority invested in me
as superintendent...

1223
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,566
Don't speak to me

1224
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,133
about authority.

1225
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:47,511
You will have nothing more
to do with these children ever.

1226
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,544
Ready?

1227
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:02,850
Ready, ready, ready? Let's go.

1228
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:03,460
Let's go, ok, ready?

1229
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:05,853
Here we go.

1230
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:09,837
Watch your sticks, now,
watch your sticks.

1231
01:22:12,318 --> 01:22:14,253
Go, steve, go, steve!

1232
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:18,368
Come on steve.
Get up, steve, get up, get up.

1233
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:28,964
Nice goal!

1234
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:31,792
Oops, beg your pardon.

1235
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:33,620
Nice to see you again.

1236
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:35,796
How are you?

1237
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:41,367
Mary, hold all the calls,
would you?

1238
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:43,567
He's wating for you in here.

1239
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:01,388
My uncle's coming over.

1240
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:03,476
He's going over to happy's.

1241
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,868
Is he? My uncle's coming over.

1242
01:23:04,892 --> 01:23:05,392
He's really nice...

1243
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,895
What?

1244
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:20,188
My name is brother davitt.

1245
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:27,239
I'm going to be
your new superintendent.

1246
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:31,721
These are brothers bilton
and brother graham,

1247
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,420
who will be taking over
dorm duties

1248
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:38,796
from brothers glackin and glynn,
who have been transferred.

1249
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:48,129
This institution has been put
into the gravest of danger.

1250
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,523
And it is going to be
my mission to rectify

1251
01:23:50,547 --> 01:23:52,394
the good name of st. Vincent.

1252
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:58,792
And I can assure you all,
I intend to do just that.

1253
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:02,752
There will be no more visits
from the police.

1254
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:08,652
It is time to put
the past behind us.

1255
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:11,133
This is your home...

1256
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:16,810
and will be treated
with the reverence

1257
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:20,272
its history deserves.

1258
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,368
Gentlemen, my office, please.

1259
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:33,957
Come on, eat up, gentlemen.

1260
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:36,984
We haven't got all day.

1261
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:46,081
"He made me put his bird
in my mouth"?

1262
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:52,106
You will rewrite
this piece of pornography.

1263
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:54,456
I can't send out
something like this.

1264
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,285
You'll take out all references
to sexual matters.

1265
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:58,895
Now, is that clear?

1266
01:24:58,919 --> 01:24:59,854
I didn't make up
this stuff, chief.

1267
01:24:59,878 --> 01:25:02,638
Those are sworn statements

1268
01:25:02,662 --> 01:25:04,031
made by the boys.

1269
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:05,946
You get orders, I get orders.

1270
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,102
The case is closed.

1271
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,909
Oh, no, I don't believe it.

1272
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:16,522
This comes straight
from the department of justice.

1273
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:18,176
There will be no arrests.

1274
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,265
Apparently, the brothers
involved will be sent

1275
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:23,050
somewhere for treatment.

1276
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:24,573
What about the boys?

1277
01:25:24,597 --> 01:25:29,665
Noseworthy, I need a nice
clean report for the files.

1278
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:33,756
And you're going to write it up,
or you're out on the street,

1279
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,671
out of a job.

1280
01:25:34,695 --> 01:25:37,412
Is that clear?

1281
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:41,764
I told the little kid he
wouldn't be buggered any more.

1282
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:45,551
What the hell do I tell him now,
that the high holy church

1283
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:47,248
and a bunch
of criminal politicians

1284
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:48,795
don't give a damn about him?

1285
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:06,267
And what about the other
brothers we didn't get yet

1286
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:08,182
'cause you closed
this investigation

1287
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:10,121
just when it was
getting started?

1288
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,891
You are this close
to being charged

1289
01:26:20,915 --> 01:26:24,633
with insubordination right now.

1290
01:26:24,657 --> 01:26:28,768
And that goes
for the rest of you.

1291
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:31,553
If I hear one more word
about this case,

1292
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:33,971
I'll have the person responsible
charged under the police act.

1293
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:59,842
We all carry scars
of one kind or another.

1294
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:01,931
I can only pray
that ours will be

1295
01:27:01,955 --> 01:27:04,436
less visible than others.

1296
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:11,680
But we do have them,
and your understanding

1297
01:27:11,704 --> 01:27:14,533
of our problem is...

1298
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:19,016
but all I can say is that I'm...

1299
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:23,020
I'm deeply, deeply grateful.

1300
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,956
Enough said.

1301
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,460
Another drink.

1302
01:27:56,923 --> 01:27:58,597
I'm going to sleep now, bro'.

1303
01:27:58,621 --> 01:28:00,840
Yes, will you go
to sleep now, steven?

1304
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:12,741
Don't do that, bro'.

1305
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:15,788
I don't like it.

1306
01:28:15,812 --> 01:28:18,771
Shhh, you go to sleep now.

1307
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:55,697
...kevin, this is mr. Premier.

1308
01:28:55,721 --> 01:28:57,351
Hello, kevin.

1309
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,658
A humble gift
from the boys of st. Vincent.

1310
01:28:59,682 --> 01:29:01,336
Thank you very much.
