00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,500
{\an8}You know Crystal, right?

512
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,500
{\an2}You know Crystal, right?

513
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,167
{\an8}The new nurse.

514
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,167
{\an2}The new nurse.

515
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,292
{\an8}She was giving an old man
<font color="#FFFFFF"a sponge bath...

516
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,292
{\an2}She was giving an old man

517
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,917
{\an8}when suddenly,

518
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,917
{\an2}when suddenly,

519
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,292
{\an8}she let out a scream!

520
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,292
{\an2}she let out a scream!

521
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,625
{\an8}Why?

522
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,625
{\an2}Why?

523
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:54,375
{\an8}She looked down and...

524
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:54,375
{\an2}She looked down and...

525
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,042
{\an8}his 'thing' was standing all the way up!

526
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,042
{\an2}his 'thing' was standing all the way up!

527
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,875
{\an8}She'd never seen one standing before!

528
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,875
{\an2}She'd never seen one standing before!

529
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,125
{\an8}She ran out of the room.

530
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,125
{\an2}She ran out of the room.

531
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,500
{\an8}And then?

532
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,500
{\an2}And then?

533
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:08,167
{\an8}Then Prabha came in and scolded him,

534
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:08,167
{\an2}Then Prabha came in and scolded him,

535
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,417
{\an8}he got so scared...

536
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,417
{\an2}he got so scared...

537
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,125
{\an8}I don't think

538
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,125
{\an2}I don't think

539
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,917
{\an8}it'll ever stand up again!

540
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,917
{\an2}it'll ever stand up again!

541
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,250
{\an8}Boss sent me
<font color="#FFFFFF"to pick up his watch.

542
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,250
{\an2}Boss sent me

543
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,625
{\an8}Mr. Aslam?

544
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,625
{\an2}Mr. Aslam?

545
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,125
{\an8}Two minutes.

546
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,125
{\an2}Two minutes.

547
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,667
{\an8}Don't they look great on me?

548
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,667
{\an2}Don't they look great on me?

549
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,500
{\an8}Anu?

550
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,500
{\an2}Anu?

551
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,917
{\an8}Have you seen many?

552
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,917
{\an2}Have you seen many?

553
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,792
{\an8}Many what?

554
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,792
{\an2}Many what?

555
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,292
{\an8}What Nurse Crystal saw
<font color="#FFFFFF"at the hospital today.

556
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,292
{\an2}What Nurse Crystal saw

557
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:30,500
{\an8}What's up with you?
<font color="#FFFFFF"Are you jealous?

558
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:30,500
{\an2}What's up with you?

559
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,667
{\an8}No, I'm just asking.

560
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,667
{\an2}No, I'm just asking.

561
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,375
{\an8}Why are you acting like a virgin?

562
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,375
{\an2}Why are you acting like a virgin?

563
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,792
{\an8}Mister?

564
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,792
{\an2}Mister?

565
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,667
{\an8}Your watch.

566
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,667
{\an2}Your watch.

567
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,875
{\an8}Your watch is ready.

568
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,875
{\an2}Your watch is ready.

{\an8}The balance is 5,000 rupees.

570
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,250
{\an2}The balance is 5,000 rupees.

571
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,833
{\an8}Shobhna said if we pay off the guard,
<font color="#FFFFFF"he won't bother us.

572
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,833
{\an2}Shobhna said if we pay off the guard,

573
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,250
{\an8}Are you sure?

574
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,250
{\an2}Are you sure?

575
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,417
{\an8}Don't be such a wuss.

576
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,417
{\an2}Don't be such a wuss.

577
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,958
{\an8}Let's go see.

578
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,958
{\an2}Let's go see.

579
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,875
{\an8}There's nobody here.

580
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,875
{\an2}There's nobody here.

581
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,833
{\an8}When did he last phone you?

582
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,833
{\an2}When did he last phone you?

583
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,375
{\an8}It's been over a year.

584
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,375
{\an2}It's been over a year.

585
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,000
{\an8}Maybe longer...

586
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,000
{\an2}Maybe longer...

587
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,875
{\an8}Nurse?

588
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,875
{\an2}Nurse?

589
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,625
{\an8}When people go abroad,

590
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,625
{\an2}When people go abroad,

591
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,000
{\an8}they can lose their minds,

592
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,000
{\an2}they can lose their minds,

593
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,458
{\an8}or their memory.

594
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,458
{\an2}or their memory.

595
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,458
{\an8}That's how it is.

596
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,458
{\an2}That's how it is.

597
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,250
{\an8}What will you do now?

598
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,250
{\an2}What will you do now?

599
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,417
{\an8}I'll tell you what, call him.

600
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,417
{\an2}I'll tell you what, call him.

601
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,250
{\an8}- Me, call him?
<font color="#FFFFFF"- Yeah.

602
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,250
{\an2}- Me, call him?

603
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,875
{\an8}If I meet that husband of yours,

604
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,875
{\an2}If I meet that husband of yours,

605
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,000
{\an8}I swear,

606
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,000
{\an2}I swear,

607
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,875
{\an8}I'm gonna box his ears.

608
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,875
{\an2}I'm gonna box his ears.

609
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,750
{\an8}It's a real shame.

610
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,750
{\an2}It's a real shame.

611
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,333
{\an8}It says here the builder
<font color="#FFFFFF"is suing you for trespassing.

612
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,333
{\an2}It says here the builder

613
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:53,042
{\an8}They could begin demolition
<font color="#FFFFFF"any day now.

614
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:53,042
{\an2}They could begin demolition

615
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,625
{\an8}Are other tenants
<font color="#FFFFFF"in the same situation?

616
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,625
{\an2}Are other tenants

617
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:02,417
{\an8}The ones with papers
<font color="#FFFFFF"have been given new flats.

618
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:02,417
{\an2}The ones with papers

619
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,917
{\an8}When the cotton mills shut down,

620
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,917
{\an2}When the cotton mills shut down,

621
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,292
{\an8}my husband was allowed to stay on.

622
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,292
{\an2}my husband was allowed to stay on.

623
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,583
{\an8}Then you must have papers!

624
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,583
{\an2}Then you must have papers!

625
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,542
{\an8}He never told me
<font color="#FFFFFF"about any papers.

626
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,542
{\an2}He never told me

627
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,208
{\an8}Now that he's dead,
<font color="#FFFFFF"I can't ask him, can I?

628
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,208
{\an2}Now that he's dead,

629
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,875
{\an8}Isn't there another solution?

630
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,875
{\an2}Isn't there another solution?

631
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,125
{\an8}Look Parvati,

632
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,125
{\an2}Look Parvati,

633
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,250
{\an8}the problem is
<font color="#FFFFFF"you don't really have a case.

634
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,250
{\an2}the problem is

635
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:40,375
{\an8}Because there is no proof
<font color="#FFFFFF"that you have lived there.

636
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:40,375
{\an2}Because there is no proof

637
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:44,292
{\an8}But can't you just ask my neighbours?

638
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:44,292
{\an2}But can't you just ask my neighbours?

639
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,125
{\an8}I've lived there 22 years,

640
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,125
{\an2}I've lived there 22 years,

641
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,000
{\an8}what do I need papers for?

642
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,000
{\an2}what do I need papers for?

643
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,417
{\an8}That won't hold up in court.

644
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,417
{\an2}That won't hold up in court.

645
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,667
{\an8}There, we need papers.

646
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,667
{\an2}There, we need papers.

647
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,667
{\an8}Can't you find any document
<font color="#FFFFFF"with your name on it?

648
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,667
{\an2}Can't you find any document

649
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:05,292
{\an8}That bastard!

650
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:05,292
{\an2}That bastard!

651
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,583
{\an8}I will kick his ass!

652
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,583
{\an2}I will kick his ass!

653
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,417
{\an8}I'll show him.

654
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,417
{\an2}I'll show him.

655
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,458
{\an8}Who does he think he is?

656
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,458
{\an2}Who does he think he is?

657
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,500
{\an8}How dare those builders
<font color="#FFFFFF"cut off my electricity!

658
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,500
{\an2}How dare those builders

659
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,042
{\an8}It's so damn dark!

660
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,042
{\an2}It's so damn dark!

661
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,292
{\an8}These are just old medical reports.

662
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,292
{\an2}These are just old medical reports.

663
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,625
{\an8}How is your son doing?

664
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,625
{\an2}How is your son doing?

665
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,375
{\an8}It's been a long time.

666
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,375
{\an2}It's been a long time.

667
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,542
{\an8}You had gotten him chocolates too.

668
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,542
{\an2}You had gotten him chocolates too.

669
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,542
{\an8}Those, he gobbled up.

670
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,542
{\an2}Those, he gobbled up.

671
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:18,917
{\an8}You used to be so terrified
<font color="#FFFFFF"of the Head Nurse.

672
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:18,917
{\an2}You used to be so terrified

673
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,333
{\an8}That terror, Nurse Lissy.

674
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,333
{\an2}That terror, Nurse Lissy.

675
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,625
{\an8}Don't remind me.

676
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,625
{\an2}Don't remind me.

677
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,917
{\an8}Why not move in with your son?

678
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,917
{\an2}Why not move in with your son?

679

{\an8}One day,
<font color="#FFFFFF"Father asked me to come back home.

{\an8}When I got there,
<font color="#FFFFFF"they'd already fixed my marriage.

880
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,667
{\an2}When I got there,

881
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,625
{\an8}Didn't you try to

{\an8}Not at all!

888
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:22,500

{\an8}He had just a few days of leave.

890
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,250
{\an2}He had just a few days of leave.

891
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,667
{\an8}When we tried to talk,
<font color="#FFFFFF"there were always relatives around.

892
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,667
{\an2}When we tried to talk,

893
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,375
{\an8}How could you marry a total stranger?

00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,375
{\an2}How could you marry a total stranger?

895
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,958
{\an8}I don't think I could.

896
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,958
{\an2}I don't think I could.

897
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,583
{\an8}You might think you know someone,

898
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,583
{\an2}You might think you know someone,

899
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,000
{\an8}but they can also become strangers.

900
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,000
{\an2}but they can also become strangers.

901
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,833
{\an8}Soon after the wedding,
<font color="#FFFFFF"he left for Germany.

902

{\an2}Soon after the wedding,

903
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,250
{\an8}In the early days,

904
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,250
{\an2}In the early days,

00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,625
{\an8}he used to call.

906
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,625
{\an2}he used to call.

907
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,875
{\an8}But gradually,
<font color="#FFFFFF"the conversations grew less frequent.

908
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,875
{\an2}But gradually,

909
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,208
{\an8}I don't know what happened.

910
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:55,208

{\an8}there was nothing left to say.

914
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:06,375

915
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:14,500
{\an8}I think of him

916
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:14,500
{\an2}I think of him

917
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,625
{\an8}in this faraway country.

918
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,625
{\an2}in this faraway country.

919
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:26,625
{\an8}I think of him working
<font color="#FFFFFF"alone in this large factory.

920
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:26,625
{\an2}I think of him working

921
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,583

923
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,958
{\an8}so far away.

924
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,958

{\an2}- Workers' unity!

1017
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,417
{\an8}All these years
<font color="#FFFFFF"I walked past this place,

1018
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,417
{\an2}All these years

1019
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,708
{\an8}but I've never eaten here.

1020
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,708
{\an2}but I've never eaten here.

1021
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:51,542
{\an8}Today I've done it.

1022
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:51,542
{\an2}Today I've done it.

1023
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,542
{\an8}I'm going to miss this place.

1024
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,542
{\an2}I'm going to miss this place.

1025
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,125
{\an8}But it's like this place isn't real.

1026
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,125
{\an2}But it's like this place isn't real.

1027
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:08,458
{\an8}What do you mean?

1028
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:08,458
{\an2}What do you mean?

1029
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,542
{\an8}You only seem to be real
<font color="#FFFFFF"if you have papers.

1030
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,542
{\an2}You only seem to be real

1031
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:18,500
{\an8}You could just vanish into thin air,

1032
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:18,500
{\an2}You could just vanish into thin air,

1033
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,583
{\an8}and no one would even know.

1034
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,583
{\an2}and no one would even know.

1035
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,833
{\an8}We would know, Parvaty.

1036
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,833
{\an2}We would know, Parvaty.

1037
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:31,083
{\an8}All of us at the hospital,
<font color="#FFFFFF"we'll miss you.

1038
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:31,083
{\an2}All of us at the hospital,

1039
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,208
{\an8}You're a very good lady, Nurse.

1040
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,208
{\an2}You're a very good lady, Nurse.

1041
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,667
{\an8}I'm gonna do it!

1042
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,667
{\an2}I'm gonna do it!

1043
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,167

1047
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,500
{\an8}When did your shift end?

1048
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,500
{\an2}When did your shift end?

1049
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,375
{\an8}I didn't see you around.

1050
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,375
{\an2}I didn't see you around.

1051
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,958
{\an8}Nurse, I'm off.

{\an2}Don't have them now!

1059
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:34,750
{\an8}I won't be able to face you
<font color="#FFFFFF"if they're awful.

1060
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:34,750
{\an2}I won't be able to face you

1061
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,375
{\an8}My contract here is ending soon,

1062
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,375
{\an2}My contract here is ending soon,

1063
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,875
{\an8}and I'm thinking of not renewing it.

1064
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,875
{\an2}and I'm thinking of not renewing it.

1065
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,833
{\an8}You'll be leaving us then?

1066
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,833
{\an2}You'll be leaving us then?

1067
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,875
{\an8}So what's your plan now?

1068
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,875
{\an2}So what's your plan now?

1069
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,833
{\an8}Can we go somewhere to talk?

1070
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,833
{\an2}Can we go somewhere to talk?

1071
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,958
{\an8}Mumbai is nice....

1072
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,958
{\an2}Mumbai is nice....

1073
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,417
{\an8}But I never got used to it.

1074
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,417
{\an2}But I never got used to it.

1075
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:24,000
{\an8}And I have a problem
<font color="#FFFFFF"with the language too.

1076
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:24,000
{\an2}And I have a problem

1077
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,375
{\an8}Hindi isn't hard to learn.

1078
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,375
{\an2}Hindi isn't hard to learn.

1079
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,375
{\an8}Maybe.

1080
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,375
{\an2}Maybe.

1081
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,750
{\an8}But it's not just that.

1082
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,750
{\an2}But it's not just that.

1083
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,375
{\an8}I've been here
<font color="#FFFFFF"for so many months now,

1084
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,375
{\an2}I've been here

1085
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:44,625
{\an8}but yesterday
<font color="#FFFFFF"I forgot to get off at my stop.

1086
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:44,625
{\an2}but yesterday

1087
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,750
{\an8}I went all the way
<font color="#FFFFFF"to the end of the line...

1088
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,750
{\an2}I went all the way

1089
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,375
{\an8}by mistake.

1090
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,375
{\an2}by mistake.

1091
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,500
{\an8}Prabha?

1092
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,500
{\an2}Prabha?

1093
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,250
{\an8}I'm...

{\an2}I wanted to know...

1101
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,375
{\an8}if I should stay?

1102
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,375
{\an2}if I should stay?

1103
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:30,958
{\an8}I mean...

1104
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:30,958
{\an2}I mean...

1105
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,958
{\an8}If there was a reason
<font color="#FFFFFF"for me to stay here...

1106
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,958
{\an2}If there was a reason

1107
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,375
{\an8}But Doctor, I'm married.

1108
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,375
{\an2}But Doctor, I'm married.

1109

{\an2}I know...

1111
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,250
{\an8}But still...

1112
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,250
{\an2}But still...

1113
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,708
{\an8}May I go, Doctor?

1114
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,708
{\an2}May I go, Doctor?

1115
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,125
{\an8}I'll miss my train.

1116
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,125
{\an2}I'll miss my train.

1117
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,333
{\an8}Some people call this
the city of dreams,

1118
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,333
{\an2}Some people call this
the city of dreams,

1119
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,375
{\an8}but I don't.

1120
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,375
{\an2}but I don't.

1121
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:37,167
{\an8}I think it's the city of illusions.

1122
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:37,167
{\an2}I think it's the city of illusions.

1123
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:43,792
{\an8}There's an unspoken code
in this city:

1124
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:43,792
{\an2}There's an unspoken code
in this city:

1125
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:50,500
{\an8}even if you live in the gutter,
you're allowed to feel no anger.

1126
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:50,500
{\an2}even if you live in the gutter,

01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,542
{\an8}People call this,
"The Spirit of Mumbai."

1128
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,542
{\an2}People call this,
"The Spirit of Mumbai."

1129
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,125
{\an8}You have to believe the illusion,

1130
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,125
{\an2}You have to believe the illusion,

1131
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,292
{\an8}or else you'll go mad.

1132
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,292
{\an2}or else you'll go mad.

1133
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,500
{\an8}Parvaty, there's no electricity here?

1134
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,500
{\an2}Parvaty, there's no electricity here?

1135
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,875
{\an8}She made us carry her junk
<font color="#FFFFFF"all this way.

1136
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,875
{\an2}She made us carry her junk

1137
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,833
{\an8}Is she planning on
<font color="#FFFFFF"doing operations here?

1138
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,833
{\an2}Is she planning on

1139
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,083
{\an8}Parvaty?

1140
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,083
{\an2}Parvaty?

1141
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,250
{\an8}Is this still good?

1142
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,250
{\an2}Is this still good?

1143
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,500
{\an8}Perfectly good!

1144
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,500
{\an2}Perfectly good!

1145
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:01,167
{\an8}Prabha, have a sip.

{\an8}Close your eyes and gulp it down.

01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,167
{\an2}Close your eyes and gulp it down.

1149

{\an8}It will make you feel relaxed!

1150

{\an2}Just try it and see.

1155
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,208
{\an8}How is it?

1156
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,208
{\an2}How is it?

{\an2}Where on earth have I landed myself!

1163
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,208
{\an8}Stuck in this weird place,
how did I get here?

1164
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,208
{\an2}Stuck in this weird place,
how did I get here?

1165
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,458
{\an8}Should I cry or should I laugh?

1166
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,458
{\an2}Should I cry or should I laugh?

1167
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:59,083
{\an8}Will someone save me?

1168
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:59,083
{\an2}Will someone save me?

1169
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:45,583
{\an8}How much for the mackerel?

1170
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:45,583
{\an2}How much for the mackerel?

1171
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,708
{\an8}50 rupees.

1182

{\an8}What?

1184
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:00,792
{\an2}What?

1185
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,458
{\an8}Who are you trying to fool?

1186
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,458
{\an2}Who are you trying to fool?

1187
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:05,125
{\an8}Just look at the size of these fish!

1188
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:05,125
{\an2}Just look at the size of these fish!

1189
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,875
{\an8}Prabha?

1190
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,875
{\an2}Prabha?

1191
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,625
{\an8}Could you ever move back
<font color="#FFFFFF"to your village?

1192
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,625
{\an2}Could you ever move back

1193
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
{\an8}I don't think I could.

1194
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
{\an2}I don't think I could.

1195
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,208
{\an8}I didn't think
<font color="#FFFFFF"you'd come today, Anu.

1196
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,208
{\an2}I didn't think

1197
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,583
{\an8}It was a big help to Parvaty.

1198
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,583
{\an2}It was a big help to Parvaty.

1199
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,458
{\an8}I didn't mind.

1200
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:39,458
{\an2}I didn't mind.

1201
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,208
{\an8}I like her.

1202
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,208
{\an2}I like her.

1203
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,958
{\an8}Prabha?

1204
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,958
{\an2}Prabha?

1205
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,625
{\an8}I have something to tell you.

1206
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,625
{\an2}I have something to tell you.

1207
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:36,250
{\an8}My parents are sending me photos of guys
<font color="#FFFFFF"for marriage proposals.

1208
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:36,250
{\an2}My parents are sending me photos of guys

1209
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:40,042
{\an8}But I don't want to get married now.

1210
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:40,042
{\an2}But I don't want to get married now.

1211
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,583
{\an8}Have you tried talking to them?

1212
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,583
{\an2}Have you tried talking to them?

1213
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,708
{\an8}As if they would listen!

1214
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,708
{\an2}As if they would listen!

1215
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,625
{\an8}So what will you do?

1216
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,625
{\an2}So what will you do?

1217
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,792
{\an8}I don't know.

1218
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,792
{\an2}I don't know.

1219
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,875
{\an8}Maybe run away.

1220
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,875
{\an2}Maybe run away.

1221
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,625
{\an8}It's no use, Anu.

1222
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,625
{\an2}It's no use, Anu.

1223
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,500
{\an8}You can't escape your fate.

1224
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,500
{\an2}You can't escape your fate.

1225
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,583
{\an8}I'm very tired.

1226
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,583
{\an2}I'm very tired.

1227
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,500
{\an8}I want to rest.

1228
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,500
{\an2}I want to rest.

1229
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,792
{\an8}Are you sure?

1230
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,792
{\an2}Are you sure?

1231
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,208
{\an8}Aren't you coming with us?

1232
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,208
{\an2}Aren't you coming with us?

1233
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,583
{\an8}No, Prabha. I want to rest.

1234
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,583
{\an2}No, Prabha. I want to rest.

1235
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:58,750
{\an8}Let her be.
<font color="#FFFFFF"She did carry those heavy bags.

1236
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:58,750
{\an2}Let her be.

1237
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,958
{\an8}Not everyone can hold their liquor.

1238
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,958
{\an2}Not everyone can hold their liquor.

1239
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:39,458
{\an8}Prabha!

1240
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:39,458
{\an2}Prabha!

1241
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:41,625
{\an8}Come in!

1242
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:41,625
{\an2}Come in!

1243
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,083
{\an8}I should get back now.

1244
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,083
{\an2}I should get back now.

1245
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,625
{\an8}Will you be long?

1246
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,625
{\an2}Will you be long?

1247
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:11,708
{\an8}Not long.

1248
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:11,708
{\an2}Not long.

1249
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,708
{\an8}Save some for later.

1250
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,708
{\an2}Save some for later.

1251
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,375
{\an8}Parvaty?

1252
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,375
{\an2}Parvaty?

1253
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
{\an8}How long will you be gone?

1254
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
{\an2}How long will you be gone?

1255
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,583
{\an8}I only need to tell them

1256
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,583
{\an2}I only need to tell them

1257
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,375
{\an8}I'm here for the job.

1258
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,375
{\an2}I'm here for the job.

01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:50,750
{\an8}I'll be back by 5 o'clock.

1260
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:50,750
{\an2}I'll be back by 5 o'clock.

1261
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,458
{\an8}Then I think we should leave now.

1262
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,458
{\an2}Then I think we should leave now.

1263
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,875
{\an8}What nonsense!

1264
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,875
{\an2}What nonsense!

1265
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,250
{\an8}- You have a ticket for tomorrow.
<font color="#FFFFFF"- Yes, but...

1266
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,250
{\an2}- You have a ticket for tomorrow.

1267
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:05,625
{\an8}You came all this way,
<font color="#FFFFFF"of course you should stay!

1268
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:05,625
{\an2}You came all this way,

1269
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,875
{\an8}How did you find this place?

1270
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,875
{\an2}How did you find this place?

1271
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:29,000
{\an8}It's like she's been
<font color="#FFFFFF"stuck here forever.

1272
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:29,000
{\an2}It's like she's been

1273
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:38,792
{\an8}As if she's waiting
<font color="#FFFFFF"for something to happen.

1274
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:38,792
{\an2}As if she's waiting

1275
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,000
{\an8}She looks like you!

1276
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,000
{\an2}She looks like you!

1277
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:56,250
{\an8}I like this place.

1278
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:56,250
{\an2}I like this place.

1279
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,375
{\an8}Seems like another world.

1280
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,375
{\an2}Seems like another world.

1281
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,458
{\an8}Shiaz?

1282
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,458
{\an2}Shiaz?

1283
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,708
{\an8}Do you ever think about the future?

1284
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,708
{\an2}Do you ever think about the future?

1285
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:51,417
{\an8}What do you mean?

1286
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:51,417
{\an2}What do you mean?

1287
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,667
{\an8}I mean...

1288
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,667
{\an2}I mean...

1289
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,500
{\an8}In 10 or 15 years...

1290
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,500
{\an2}In 10 or 15 years...

1291
01:25:56,667 --> 01:26:00,083
{\an8}what will your life be like?

1292
01:25:56,667 --> 01:26:00,083
{\an2}what will your life be like?

1293
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:04,750
{\an8}Am I there with you?

1294
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:04,750
{\an2}Am I there with you?

1295
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,750
{\an8}What's come over you?

1296
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,750
{\an2}What's come over you?

1297
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,125
{\an8}I don't know.

1298
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,125
{\an2}I don't know.

1299
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:16,500
{\an8}I never used to think about
<font color="#FFFFFF"stuff like this.

1300
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:16,500
{\an2}I never used to think about

1301
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,792
{\an8}But I feel like

1302
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,792
{\an2}But I feel like

1303
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:21,750
{\an8}the future is here
<font color="#FFFFFF"and I'm not prepared for it.

1304
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:21,750
{\an2}the future is here

1305
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:33,375
{\an8}Why don't my parents understand
<font color="#FFFFFF"what I want?

1306
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:33,375
{\an2}Why don't my parents understand

1307
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,083
{\an8}Maybe we can talk to them?

1308
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,083
{\an2}Maybe we can talk to them?

1309
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,250
{\an8}We can try to convince them,
<font color="#FFFFFF"maybe they'll agree.

1310
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,250
{\an2}We can try to convince them,

1311
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:49,708
{\an8}If I tell them,
<font color="#FFFFFF"they'll never let me see you again.

1312
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:49,708
{\an2}If I tell them,

1313
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:58,500
{\an8}Shiaz,

1314
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:58,500
{\an2}Shiaz,

1315
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,833
{\an8}I feel so scared.

1316
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,833
{\an2}I feel so scared.

1317
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:21,000
{\an8}I've been scared
<font color="#FFFFFF"ever since I met you.

1318
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:21,000
{\an2}I've been scared

1319
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:29,875
{\an8}I'd ask myself if it was right,
<font color="#FFFFFF"my being with you.

1320
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:29,875
{\an2}I'd ask myself if it was right,

1321
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,125
{\an8}Or if it would've been best
<font color="#FFFFFF"for us to stay apart.

1322
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,125
{\an2}Or if it would've been best

1323
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,458
{\an8}But when I'm with you,

1324
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,458
{\an2}But when I'm with you,

1325
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,750
{\an8}I don't know what it is...

1326
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,750
{\an2}I don't know what it is...

1327
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,500
{\an8}I don't feel afraid at all.

1328
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,500
{\an2}I don't feel afraid at all.

1329
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:00,375
{\an8}As if this is
<font color="#FFFFFF"the most natural way for us to be.

1330
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:00,375
{\an2}As if this is

1331
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:17,208
{\an8}It all gets too heavy
<font color="#FFFFFF"for me sometimes.

1332
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:17,208
{\an2}It all gets too heavy

1333
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:55,875
{\an8}Shiaz?

1334
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:55,875
{\an2}Shiaz?

1335
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,125
{\an8}There's graffiti here in Malayalam.

1336
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,125
{\an2}There's graffiti here in Malayalam.

1337
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:04,167
{\an8}OUR LOVE
<font color="#FFFFFF"IS LIKE THE ENDLESS SEA

1338
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:04,167
{\an2}OUR LOVE

1339
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,500
{\an8}You wrote it, didn't you?

1340
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,500
{\an2}You wrote it, didn't you?

1341
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,958
{\an8}Somebody help!

1342
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,958
{\an2}Somebody help!

1343
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:30,417
{\an8}He's not breathing.

1344
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:30,417

{\an8}I would come out
<font color="#FFFFFF"after 3 or 4 days

1460
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:22,542
{\an2}I would come out

{\an8}as if in a daze.

1462
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,458
