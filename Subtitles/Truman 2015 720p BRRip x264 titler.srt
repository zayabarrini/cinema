1
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,667
How are you?

2
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,084
Glad to see you.

3
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,292
I can see that...
You've got an erection.

4
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,084
Come in!

5
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,667
No wonder I get criticized
at neighbors' meetings!

6
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:56,584
Don't you remember Truman?
He won't bite you.

7
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,001
Truman,
your uncle's afraid of you.

8
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,417
Where's your luggage?

9
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,834
At the hotel,
at the end of the street.

10
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,126
At the hotel?
Why don't you stay here?

11
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,334
You snore and your
dog doesn't like me...

12
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:13,667
Why the hell didn't you tell
me you were coming?

13
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:17,292
Paula told me a surprise
would do you good.

14
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,292
Yes, I know...

15
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:22,917
You talk to my cousin
behind my back.

16
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,542
You don't tell me much,
so what should I do?

17
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,042
I feel bad for not coming earlier.

18
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:32,459
You should!

19
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,126
I hope you find it hard
to sleep at night.

20
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,459
Well, I do have trouble sleeping.

21
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,334
I'm spending a fortune on
therapy because of you.

22
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,542
Good.

23
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,501
I've even changed therapists.

24
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,584
- Really?
- Yes.

25
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,084
Me too.

26
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,751
I have a kind of
spiritual guide now.

27
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,959
A spiritual guide?

28
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:58,542
Yeah, a shaman from the
Amazon who lives in Vallecas.

29
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:06,709
I bought a few things
at the airport.

30
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,001
That's some really great whisky,
you'll love it.

31
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,917
How nice.

32
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,792
- Besides...
- What's this?

33
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:21,959
Ah, that's a drawing
from my kids.

34
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:30,167
Now see, these are the
things we'll have to avoid,

35
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,542
otherwise...

36
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:39,001
How many days can you stay?

37
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,709
- Four.
- Only four?

38
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,209
Yes, I have to be back
next Monday.

39
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:47,084
We got any money?
I'm broke.

40
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,834
Yes, we can do
whatever you want.

41
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:53,292
You hear that? We're going to
have a great time together.

42
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,542
You're not here to talk
me into anything, right?

43
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:02,584
No need to get so defensive,
Julián.

44
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,084
Paula asked you to come and
change my mind, didn't she?

45
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,501
No, I came because
I wanted to see you.

46
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,626
- Besides...
- Besides?

47
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,001
It's true that when you told
me what you'd decided,

48
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:18,876
I thought maybe...
maybe we could talk about it.

49
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,251
- Really?
- Yeah. Can't we?

50
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,709
You can head back
to Canada right now!

51
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,834
- You can go back to your penguins.
- Julián, listen.

52
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:29,376
Look, take the chocolates, the whisky...
No, I'll keep the whisky.

53
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,667
Go back now, if you hurry,
you'll make the return flight.

54
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,292
Screw that.

55
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,751
You know how much
my ticket cost?

56
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:45,417
I'll stay four days,
you'll have to put up with me.

57
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,751
Go with your uncle.
I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.

58
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:02,292
I'll join you in 20 minutes.
I have an appointment with the doctor.

59
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,209
Are you a friend of Julián's?

60
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,834
Yes.

61
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,959
Why?

62
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,251
Give him this,
he ordered it days ago,

63
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,209
but I never see him.

64
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,167
Okay.

65
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,084
That's 50 euros.

66
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,584
Oh, yes... of course.

67
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,292
Here.

68
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,834
Is Julián all right?

69
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,876
Yes, he's at home.

70
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,459
Good.

71
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,542
It's just that I haven't
seen him for days,

72
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:45,626
and when I saw you with Truman,
I thought maybe he got worse or...

73
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,084
No, he's fine.

74
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:53,834
Great... I'm glad.

75
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,042
- Tell him I said hi.
- I will.

76
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:14,376
So?

77
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,417
- Great.
- Really?

78
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,751
Wait a minute.
Come here, Truman.

79
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,042
- Can I leave him for a while?
- Of course.

80
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:29,792
I'll be back soon.
Thanks.

81
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,251
My neighbor,
she always looks after him.

82
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,542
Shall we go?

83
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,001
- Walking?
- Yeah.

84
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:44,042
First, I need to see the vet.
It's just some blocks away.

85
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:45,167
Okay.

86
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,792
CAT MISSING

87
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,334
Which one should I put?

88
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:57,042
- What for?
- To put him up for adoption.

89
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,167
Do you want to put
him up for adoption?

90
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,334
Of course.
What should I do?

91
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,167
What about your cousin?

92
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,501
No, not Paula.

93
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:09,001
She lives in a small apartment,
she has a cat.

94
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:12,501
I'm worried, really.
I haven't told him yet.

95
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,042
- What?
- What will happen.

96
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:22,501
- To whom?
- Truman. I tell him everything.

97
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,334
Dogs aren't plants, Tomás.

98
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:28,376
You have no fucking idea.
They have personality.

99
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,834
Yes, I've realized.

100
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,334
Earlier at the park, Truman asked
me about the bears in Canada.

101
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,542
See?

102
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,376
Tomás, I have two children.

103
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,709
One of them's called Truman.

104
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,501
- Julián, he can see you now.
- Thank you.

105
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,459
- Hi, Julián.
- Hi.

106
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,751
Sorry I can't spend
more time with you,

107
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,209
but you can see...
I'm doing a test.

108
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:12,459
Thank you very much...
Sorry, Tomás, a friend.

109
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,709
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,834
- It's just a question.
- Tell me.

111
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,292
- Is it his paw again?
- No, no, his paw's perfect.

112
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:26,251
I wanted to ask you...
about something else.

113
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:32,309
How do you think dogs
experience loss... grief?

114
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:40,626
You mean if someone dies?

115
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,501
Their owner, for example.

116
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,709
How could we help him?

117
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:47,292
Well, just like when
they're abandoned,

118
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,459
the animal suffers
from the separation.

119
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,834
What might happen to him?

120
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,334
Would you both
like to sit down?

121
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,626
- Yes.
- No, that's okay.

122
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,876
Well... he might be
kind of aloof,

123
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,417
and he might have
psychosomatic reactions,

124
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,501
like digestive problems,
irritable behavior...

125
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,876
I'm looking for a family
to adopt him.

126
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
What do you think?
Should I look for a similar...

127
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,251
I mean,
a man on his own like me,

128
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:27,542
or a complete change,
such as a family with kids?

129
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:31,417
I don't know,
I really don't, Julián.

130
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:35,751
Do you think he could adapt
to living with other dogs?

131
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,334
It's not what he's used to.

132
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:41,334
It would be easier if he didn't
have to learn new habits.

133
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,501
It'd be important for him
to feel really looked after,

134
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,959
to feel that he's loved.

135
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,126
One last thing.

136
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,042
When I have to
leave him definitely,

137
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:54,084
do you think I should leave him
one of my T-shirts,

138
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,917
or some clothes that smell like me,
is it a good idea?

139
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:03,334
Well, having his own things,
like a blanket to lie on,

140
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,542
or a ball, a toy, that'd be fine,
it'd be good for him,

141
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,876
I'm not sure about your things,
I don't know...

142
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,751
I could ask a colleague who specializes
in animal psychology for his opinion.

143
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,542
I'd be very grateful.

144
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,792
I'll do anything to help him.

145
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:26,084
I also want to pay for
several visits in advance.

146
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,084
I want his new owners
to bring him to you.

147
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:33,751
I want to be sure that, even if his
new home is far away from here,

148
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,042
that they'll bring him here.

149
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:38,876
Don't worry, Julián.
We'll take care of him.

150
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,376
He'll be fine, I promise.

151
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,376
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

152
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,834
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

153
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,209
Warn me ahead of time
before the next scene like that.

154
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,376
I'm going to tell you
something important.

155
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,542
Okay.

156
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:13,459
The only things that matter
in life are relationships.

157
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,376
Love.

158
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,667
Family, you and me,
Truman and me...

159
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:23,001
I need some breakfast
before going on with the day.

160
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:26,042
Who would have thought

161
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,167
we'd be friends
for so many years?

162
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,626
I wouldn't have, really.

163
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:36,459
You know the main thing
I've learned from you?

164
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:40,042
What you've taught me
all these years unknowingly?

165
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,834
Why don't we keep walking?

166
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:44,792
Because I'm saying
something important,

167
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,501
can't you wait
one more minute?

168
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:47,709
Why are you here?

169
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:51,042
I want to have breakfast,
so that I'm ready.

170
00:16:55,917 --> 00:17:00,084
What's that important thing
you've learned from me? Let's see.

171
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:04,584
You never expect
anything in return.

172
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,501
You never want a payback.

173
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,042
You're generous, unlike me.

174
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,001
Thanks.

175
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:20,417
- And me?
- What?

176
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,084
What have you
learned from me?

177
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,417
From you?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

178
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,501
Maybe illegal things...

179
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,042
To be brave.

180
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:42,001
You've always faced
everything squarely.

181
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,209
Like now.

182
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:54,876
You see, this alone made the trip
from the North Pole worth it already.

183
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,542
Sorry I'm late, Julián.

184
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,959
Don't worry, doctor.

185
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:31,459
I know you'd rather see my cousin,
she's cuter than my friend here,

186
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:35,126
but he's come for a few days
and I just can't shake him off.

187
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,751
He came from Canada.

188
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,876
- Hello.
- Hello.

189
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,334
To say goodbye.

190
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,001
Well...

191
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:49,084
As I told you, we should start
another round of chemotherapy.

192
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,876
We're going to change
the medicine,

193
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:54,542
to try to have a greater
effect on the tumors.

194
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:59,042
As I told you the last time we met,
I'll schedule you for a CAT scan,

195
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:03,501
to see how far those new
tumors on the liver have gone.

196
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:07,917
Could you come in tomorrow or
the day after for some tests?

197
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,501
And I'll schedule the
CAT scan for Friday?

198
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,876
No.

199
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,917
I've come to tell you
I'm not coming back.

200
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:22,667
Julián, when we talked about
the test results the other day,

201
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,501
I gave you the
impression that...

202
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:27,292
We've done everything we could,
haven't we, doctor?

203
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,667
Yes.

204
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,001
We've fought hard these
past few months, right?

205
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:40,001
I don't want to spend whatever
I have left in and out of the hospital.

206
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:44,542
I'll miss the nurses very much,
that's for sure, but...

207
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,001
I'm done.

208
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:53,376
I've been fighting this
lung cancer for a year,

209
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,542
and when I was taking
some time off,

210
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:59,376
this son of a bitch goes on
excursion all over my body.

211
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,542
What good will it do
starting chemo again?

212
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,792
I mean,
if I start the treatment again,

213
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,167
will I be cured?

214
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,334
I know people don't usually
ask these things, but I do.

215
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,251
Will I be cured?

216
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,376
No.
I don't think so.

217
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,209
I'm going to die anyway,
no matter what I do, right?

218
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:27,584
Yes.

219
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,417
Why should I go on with it?

220
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:38,542
To gain some time, Julián.

221
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,126
Of course, of course.

222
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:42,709
How long are
we talking about?

223
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,376
You promised to keep silent.

224
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:49,042
You think I flew across the globe
to keep silent? How long?

225
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,334
It's hard to say,

226
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,042
but it'll be quicker
without the treatment.

227
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:58,376
Well, it might be worth it.

228
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:03,417
I've already made up my mind,
you know that.

229
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,709
Sometimes we react impulsively,
and we make decisions,

230
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:10,709
but then after thinking it over calmly,
you see things differently.

231
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,667
I've been thinking this
over calmly for a year.

232
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:15,959
You're the one
who just got here, Tomás.

233
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,209
I should have come with Paula.

234
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:28,084
If we don't continue with chemo,
how much longer can he hold on?

235
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,751
It's hard to say...

236
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,626
It'll depend on how the disease
plays out in the final stages.

237
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,501
Right.

238
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,126
Do I need to sign any papers?

239
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,667
Er... no...

240
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:46,709
I'll write a report for
the hospital committee,

241
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:50,417
I'll explain your decision,

242
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,917
and if you want, we could meet
in two weeks to see how you are.

243
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,834
- Do you agree?
- All right.

244
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,917
Prescribe all the drugs
you can, okay?

245
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:03,876
Well...

246
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,959
I brought you something.

247
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,417
It's a very bad movie
I made a few years ago,

248
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,751
but since you told me
you like crime stories.

249
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:16,834
- Yes. You didn't have to, Julián.
- I know.

250
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:19,876
- Thanks for everything, doc.
- You're welcome.

251
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,042
Bye.

252
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,792
Thank you.

253
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,834
I didn't mean to reproach
you for anything before.

254
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,959
- Okay.
- We're all doing the best we can.

255
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:56,667
No one's to blame.

256
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:03,084
Well, my wife is.
She's to blame.

257
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:08,251
She made me come,
I didn't want to.

258
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:10,667
I knew something was fishy...

259
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,167
Do you think I felt like
coming with you to...?

260
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:15,376
No, I suppose not.

261
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:22,667
She said if I didn't come now,
I'd regret it later...

262
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,709
so I had no choice.

263
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:32,042
- Where are we going?
- To eat, weren't you hungry?

264
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,709
We're going to a
friend's restaurant.

265
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,001
Pay.

266
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,584
Where are you going, Tomás?

267
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:52,251
- Hello.
- Hello.

268
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:03,126
I'm looking for books
about animal psychology.

269
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,167
Pets.
Dogs.

270
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:11,876
- Behavior patterns...
- Yes. Follow me.

271
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:17,959
All the books about animals
and pets are here.

272
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:22,084
You have nutrition,
dog behavior, health.

273
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,542
This is everything we've got.

274
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,376
- Great, thank you.
- You're welcome.

275
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,584
This one looks good,
doesn't it?

276
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:53,126
I'm giving you these two.
Okay?

277
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,417
Thank you.

278
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,584
This one?

279
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,376
"Death, a New Dawn. "

280
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:12,209
"The author makes
us understand

281
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:15,917
that death is an experience
similar to birth. "

282
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,792
Sounds interesting,
don't you think?

283
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,292
This one.

284
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,667
"Helping to Die. "

285
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:37,042
If I were going to Thailand,
I'd need a map, that's the same.

286
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:38,626
I'm a bit dizzy.

287
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,667
Let's go.

288
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:08,917
Who is it?

289
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,084
Someone who has
chosen to ignore me.

290
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,417
Maybe he didn't see you.

291
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:19,126
No, he did see me,
but he's pretending otherwise.

292
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,584
He's an actor.

293
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,417
We've worked together
many times.

294
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:32,167
He's not really a friend, but...
and his wife saw me, too.

295
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:34,501
Well...

296
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,834
Why wouldn't they say hi?

297
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,667
Because people don't
know what to say to me.

298
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,584
They smell death
and they get scared.

299
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,042
- Got it.
- They don't know what to do.

300
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:53,001
They prefer to avoid me.
I guess it's logical.

301
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:55,459
I guess. Can we change
the subject while we eat?

302
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:56,667
Yes, sorry.

303
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,167
- Be right back.
- Julián.

304
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:03,501
Julián...

305
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,376
- Gerardo.
- Julián!

306
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,084
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

307
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:12,042
Please, don't bother...

308
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,459
How's everything?

309
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:20,667
- Fine, fine.
- Glad to hear it.

310
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:23,626
She's swamped with work.

311
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:27,209
Not me, but... What about you?
Are you at the theater?

312
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,834
- That's right.
- We'll come see you sometime.

313
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:33,042
Don't wait too long,
my run's almost over.

314
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,792
We'll see when we can go...
Are you eating here?

315
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:39,292
Yes, over there,
at that table back there.

316
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,417
We just got here,
we didn't see you.

317
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:47,876
Yeah, you saw me,
but you pretended you didn't.

318
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,959
Come on, Julián.

319
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:53,751
I'm not asking you to call me
and ask how I'm doing,

320
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:57,417
but if we run into each
other like today,

321
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:00,876
saying hi, giving a hug,
some good wishes...

322
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,709
would be appreciated.

323
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,751
I think we won't meet again,

324
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:12,251
so... I'll leave you.
Don't want to bother you.

325
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:30,876
- Better?
- Better.

326
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,751
- Paula.
- No, no.

327
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,501
Paula, come on.
Aren't you good friends?

328
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:46,417
DANGEROUS LIAISONS
EXTENDED RUN

329
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,292
I'm begging you,
take leave.

330
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,292
Please consider my
plea and go away.

331
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:59,626
My mother will be here
any minute and...

332
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:02,126
if she found us like this,
we'd both be in serious trouble.

333
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:14,126
Why does my heart
beat so strongly

334
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,876
when I write to you?

335
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:21,292
Don't get desperate.
Your friend, Cecil.

336
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,626
Do you like it there?

337
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,876
Have you ever thought
of coming back?

338
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,751
No, never.

339
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,126
You're very certain
about things.

340
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,751
- It seems so, doesn't it?
- Yes.

341
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,917
Haven't you ever considered
going back to Buenos Aires?

342
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:57,292
I did last year,
when my ex and I split up...

343
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,876
I really considered it,
but it's impossible.

344
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,542
Separating Valentina from
her father wouldn't be right.

345
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:09,042
He's having another baby soon.
Valentina's happy she'll have a brother.

346
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:10,709
What can I do about it?

347
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:14,417
It serves me right for getting involved
with a Spaniard, it was my fault.

348
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:23,917
Thank you for answering all
my emails all these months.

349
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:28,917
I'm good, I'm a very efficient
secretary, aren't I?

350
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:36,001
What did the doctor tell him?

351
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,792
You think he could reconsider?

352
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,334
No.

353
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,084
In fact, he went to the
doctor to say goodbye.

354
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,334
Haven't you had
a talk with him?

355
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:52,126
He listens to you,
he values your opinion, Tomás.

356
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,709
Yes.

357
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,417
I tried.

358
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:01,709
- But...
- But what?

359
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,334
I didn't have any
good arguments.

360
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:08,084
I didn't know they were
necessary to keep on living?

361
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,542
What could I do?

362
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:15,042
Hey, don't get angry...

363
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,167
No, I'm not angry,
I'm tired.

364
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:25,001
Julián has lots of friends,
they invite him to parties...

365
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,876
But then each one
has their life...

366
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:32,376
Real friends are far away...
or just come for a visit.

367
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:39,501
No, you're right.

368
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:44,334
And I'm sorry.
It took me a long time to come.

369
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,126
I know...

370
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,126
He's the first of my friends
who is dying and...

371
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,709
I don't know how to...

372
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:08,792
I brought you a gift,
some chocolates,

373
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:10,584
but I'll give them to Truman.

374
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,959
Julián, what's wrong?

375
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:19,626
Well, what do you think?
I'm sleeping.

376
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,876
It's 4:00 in the morning.

377
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,626
No, no,
I don't want to talk.

378
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:32,167
Okay, let's see.

379
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,126
Why do you want me
to open the window?

380
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:41,126
<i>So that you smell the marijuana
you bought me, it's excellent.</i>

381
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:44,167
<i>I got so hungry... Come over
to my place. Aren't you hungry?</i>

382
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:49,126
<i>- I don't want to eat, I want to sleep.
- Yes, so do I, but I can't.</i>

383
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:52,001
<i>And when I finally do fall asleep,
I just keep dreaming...</i>

384
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:54,834
<i>Mostly about my parents.</i>

385
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:58,209
<i>I was reading one of those
instructive books you got me,</i>

386
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:02,917
<i>and it says it's normal to dream
about dead people in my situation.</i>

387
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,376
<i>You know why?</i>

388
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,126
Yes... No... Well,
I don't remember right now.

389
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,334
<i>Because it seems
to be a way</i>

390
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:14,876
<i>of subconsciously preparing
ourselves for the journey.</i>

391
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,584
<i>Thinking about who's
going to come meet us.</i>

392
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,209
They're going to meet you?

393
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:22,001
<i>- Of course.
- I see, and where?</i>

394
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:25,626
<i>I don't know yet,
I'm still on the first chapter.</i>

395
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:30,126
<i>And you...</i>

396
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:32,376
<i>Who would you want
to come meet you?</i>

397
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,459
My mother, I guess.

398
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:43,834
Or Marilyn Monroe.

399
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,501
<i>I never got along too well
with my dad, you know that,</i>

400
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:52,209
<i>but it'd make me
feel safe if he came.</i>

401
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:55,751
<i>My mother was so flighty,
she's sure to be late or get lost.</i>

402
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:59,667
Weren't you an atheist?

403
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,792
<i>Very, yes, I used to be very atheist.
Not anymore.</i>

404
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:04,292
I see...

405
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:12,709
<i>Well, I'll keep reading.</i>

406
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:18,709
<i>Sleep well.
Thank you for coming.</i>

407
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,334
<i>I love you.</i>

408
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,667
Good morning, sir.
Here's your breakfast.

409
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,501
Yes, leave it right there,
please, thanks.

410
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:07,084
I ordered scrambled
eggs and orange juice.

411
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,959
That's what you have for
breakfast in Greenland, right?

412
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:18,876
I want to give
Truman a quick bath.

413
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:21,626
He hasn't gotten one in a while,
because I don't have a bathtub.

414
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,542
And Paula won't let me do it in hers,
I don't know...

415
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:29,917
Hurry up! We're meeting
an adoptive family.

416
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,376
What's your son's name?

417
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:49,376
- Sasha.
- What a nice name.

418
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:53,042
We adopted him in Russia,
he was three years old.

419
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,667
Have you had a dog before?

420
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:58,459
No, honestly, my wife didn't want one,
but we finally convinced her.

421
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,001
Sasha is really excited about it.

422
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,876
So Truman,
do you like the house?

423
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:06,751
It's very nice, very nice.

424
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,459
I was telling them we've
never had a dog before...

425
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,417
No, we had a cat.

426
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:14,251
I've always liked cats better,
specially in an apartment...

427
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:18,251
But since we moved here,
I have no excuse.

428
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,042
He seems very well-behaved.

429
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:23,251
And very clean.
I sent him to a private school.

430
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:28,167
I'm having a hard time finding
someone who wants him.

431
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:31,292
Almost everyone wants puppies.

432
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,084
That won't be a problem for you?

433
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,751
No, it's part of the therapy.

434
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:36,959
It is?
Therapy?

435
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:41,042
Yes, the idea is adopting an
animal like we adopted him.

436
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:45,167
It seems that identification between
them could be very beneficial for Sasha.

437
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:47,959
That's interesting, isn't it?

438
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,959
Yes, very much.

439
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,126
Why do you want
to get rid of him?

440
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,292
Well, no...

441
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:56,167
I'm going on a trip...
on a long trip,

442
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:59,792
and... I can't take him with me.

443
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:03,584
Well, you can come visit
him when you're back.

444
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,084
Thank you,
that would be nice.

445
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,751
You'll see when
you meet Sasha...

446
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:12,709
It's really quiet here.
It's as if we're not in Madrid.

447
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,251
Why don't you leave
him here with us?

448
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,751
To see how it goes.

449
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,084
Right now?

450
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:23,667
Yes, to try for a day,
to see if he gets along with Sasha.

451
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,917
Yes, yes...
But I didn't bring anything.

452
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,959
Not even his toothbrush
or pajamas...

453
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,001
I think it's a good idea.

454
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,417
Don't you think?

455
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,792
Since we're here...

456
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:39,334
To see how Truman feels too, right?

457
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,209
I don't know.

458
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,709
Why not?

459
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:45,792
- Why not?
- Maybe another day.

460
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,376
When?

461
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,501
Listen, we'll take
good care of him.

462
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:05,501
He's not used to sleeping alone,
or outside.

463
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:08,251
Maybe he could sleep
in the boy's room.

464
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:11,042
- Of course.
- He drinks a lot.

465
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:15,334
You could give him dog food
but I usually boil rice,

466
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,917
and add small pieces
of red meat.

467
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:21,126
He really likes that.
And muffins.

468
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,209
- Muffins?
- Yes.

469
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,334
- Coffee?
- Yes.

470
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,584
- Well...
- Well...

471
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,501
I'll call you tomorrow
to pick him up.

472
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:44,876
Or we'll bring him to you.

473
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:51,084
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

474
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:54,042
Be good, Truman.

475
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,042
Don't make me look bad.

476
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:02,584
- Bye.
- Bye.

477
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,209
Come on, let's go.

478
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,126
It's been so many years.

479
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,709
We sleep together,
have showers together...

480
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,459
- Enough, enough...
- Okay.

481
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:32,376
Tonight you're staying
at my place.

482
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,667
I don't like sleeping alone.
You can sleep on the sofa...

483
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:36,876
Wherever you want.

484
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,292
What are we going
to do here?

485
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:08,334
If you want, you can wait at the park.
It won't be fun.

486
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,626
Who did you say you talked to?

487
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:43,251
A woman. I talked to her
a couple of weeks ago.

488
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,459
I said I'd come to see her,
but I couldn't make it until today.

489
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,167
I guess it was Beatriz.
She's not here today.

490
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:51,292
- If you don't mind, I'll help you.
- Yes, of course.

491
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,042
Basically what I need
is an estimate.

492
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,376
What kind of burial?
Who's the deceased?

493
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:58,417
- Me.
- Oh.

494
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,417
It will be me.

495
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:04,209
He accompanies me and helps
me with all the procedures.

496
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:07,167
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

497
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:09,292
One moment, please.

498
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,126
Will you come with me, please?

499
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:51,417
What had you arranged
with my colleague?

500
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:54,042
Well, nothing, in fact.

501
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:57,542
I'm not sure whether I want...

502
00:42:57,626 --> 00:43:02,167
a regular funeral or cremation.

503
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:07,751
I see. Well, that's
a very personal decision.

504
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,792
Regarding prices,
they are quite similar.

505
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:14,292
It depends on the quality
of the materials,

506
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,459
both of urns and coffins.

507
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:21,584
Do you have a family niche
or plot to be buried in?

508
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:24,126
- No.
- No.

509
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:28,834
We have some urns
for storing the ashes

510
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:32,751
in the family home,
so that they are on display.

511
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:37,917
These urns have different designs,
and very good details.

512
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:43,294
We also have biodegradable urns,
which are buried like coffins.

513
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:49,459
And finally, urns made of salt,
which dissolve in the sea.

514
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,209
No, not in the sea.

515
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:54,126
- No?
- No.

516
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:57,417
If you prefer, we have
the White Porcelain option,

517
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:02,010
it's this one with golden
ornamental ribbons,

518
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:04,922
which give the urns solemnity.

519
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:09,792
Excuse me, I have a question.
Aren't they a bit small?

520
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:13,417
I mean,
do all the ashes fit in there?

521
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,834
Of course, yes.

522
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:22,251
Well, they end up...
in just a tiny bit.

523
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,005
I'll show you now...

524
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:34,142
the souvenirs
and memorial cards.

525
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,501
We can suggest an assortment
of poems if you want.

526
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:42,376
Some cards play music
when you open them.

527
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,542
- Music?
- Yes.

528
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:46,834
Classical music,
people like it a lot.

529
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:51,042
We also handle the flowers,
the ceremony,

530
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:53,251
whether it's religious or not.

531
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:57,292
If you want live music,
we have a small quartet.

532
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:59,209
What else?
Ah, yes, very important.

533
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:03,334
We make DVD with photos...

534
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:07,001
and images of the person,

535
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:10,084
which are shown
at the ceremony.

536
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:18,209
I'd love it if you could send
me several estimates,

537
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:19,792
with everything that's
included in them.

538
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:21,959
Could it be by email?

539
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,501
Certainly, of course.

540
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:27,251
Let me load your information
into the computer.

541
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:29,584
- Yes.
- This way, please.

542
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,084
I can leave you some
money if you need it.

543
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,834
No.

544
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,584
You'll need it.

545
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:01,876
How much have you
got in the bank?

546
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,084
In the bank, nothing.

547
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:08,251
I owe money to the treasury department,
and they'd keep it all anyway.

548
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:10,792
The only bit I've got is
in a cookie jar...

549
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:14,751
I don't want to tell you where
because I don't trust you yet.

550
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:17,584
I won't offer it again.

551
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,834
Tell you what.

552
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:24,209
Before you leave,
without me noticing it,

553
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:28,709
you can leave me some money
somewhere... and that's it.

554
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:33,584
If I see Marilyn,
I'll tell her about you.

555
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:39,251
What are you doing?

556
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:42,001
- Nothing, I'm hiding.
- Why?

557
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:50,376
- Is he sitting down yet?
- He's sitting down, yes.

558
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:51,876
Who is it?

559
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:54,751
A friend.

560
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,042
A friend?

561
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:02,001
What did you do?

562
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:06,709
I slept with his wife, and soon
after they divorced, that's all.

563
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:11,876
He's heading this way.

564
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,126
- He's coming over?
- Yes.

565
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,876
If I were you,
I'd stop playing the fool.

566
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,209
Julián...

567
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:21,667
- Hello, Luis... How are you?
- Fine.

568
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,209
- Such a long time...
- I'm fine.

569
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:25,417
I didn't see you.
Did you just get here?

570
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:28,959
Yes, we've just come in.
I wasn't sure if it was you.

571
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:32,584
How are you?

572
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,959
Well, very well.
Working, like always.

573
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:39,417
- Hello.
- Still got your studio?

574
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,751
Yes, I've got a French
partner now.

575
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,834
He gets me a lot of work.

576
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:47,792
I'm glad to hear it.

577
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:50,042
Julián...

578
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:52,209
I'm really sorry about
what's happening to you.

579
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:55,542
I just heard recently and...

580
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:57,959
I'm really sorry you're
going through this.

581
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,459
I just wanted to tell you.

582
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:02,959
I often think of you.

583
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,251
Thank you, Luis.

584
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,167
Keep your spirits up.

585
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,876
I'll let you get on
with your meal.

586
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:27,417
Thanks.

587
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,417
Sorry to interrupt...

588
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:53,959
I was just leaving and...

589
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,959
I wanted to say goodbye.

590
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,251
This is Mónica.
This is Julián.

591
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:01,209
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

592
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:08,251
Thank you for saying
hello earlier.

593
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:13,126
After what happened,
that you said hello the way you did,

594
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:15,167
I didn't expect it.

595
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:17,792
I'm really thankful.

596
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:21,084
I'm very moved
and I want to apologize.

597
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,084
No, it's not necessary, Julián.

598
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:27,167
Yes, it is necessary,
it really is.

599
00:49:28,876 --> 00:49:31,959
I want to apologize because
you were my friend,

600
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:34,917
and what I did
was despicable.

601
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,333
And I especially apologize,

602
00:49:37,623 --> 00:49:40,978
for not saying I was
sorry at the time.

603
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,751
Especially for that.
I could have done it, couldn't I?

604
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:48,834
I accept your apologies.
Thank you.

605
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:53,001
However, if that hadn't happened,
I wouldn't have met Mónica.

606
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:54,251
She's pregnant.

607
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:57,084
Really?
That's great.

608
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,876
Congratulations.
She's pregnant.

609
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,084
Congratulations.

610
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,959
- Thank you.
- Well, I take back my apology.

611
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:07,709
Sorry.

612
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,626
Goodbye.

613
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:19,209
You're like an extinct species,
you know that, don't you?

614
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:24,042
You could stuff me and put
me in a display cabinet.

615
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,084
That's a good idea.

616
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:30,459
I could get back
the money you owe me.

617
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:02,084
Mr. Alfredo, how are you?

618
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,542
- Am I interrupting?
- You never interrupt.

619
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:07,167
My friend Tomás is
visiting me for a few days.

620
00:51:07,209 --> 00:51:10,292
Mr. Alfredo's the producer of the play,
and the owner of the theater.

621
00:51:10,376 --> 00:51:13,251
- Nice to meet you.
- The theater has no owner, Julián.

622
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:15,251
Have a seat, please.

623
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,126
I've learned about
your disease.

624
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:33,459
When I was told, one week ago,
I started crying.

625
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:38,917
And I have no
words of comfort.

626
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:40,084
Thank you.

627
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:44,126
But I also...

628
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:47,084
I also got mad at you.

629
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:50,834
I got mad because I thought

630
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,584
I should've been the
first person to know.

631
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:57,501
We're friends, aren't we?

632
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,584
Of course.

633
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:04,459
Who gave you your first
job here in the theater?

634
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,126
You did, Mr. Alfredo.

635
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,959
And back then, nobody was
hiring Argentine actors.

636
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,709
Nobody.

637
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:13,209
I didn't mean to upset you.

638
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:18,084
I know, I know...
dear Julián.

639
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:28,876
Julián, what you
need now is rest.

640
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:34,126
Stay at home,
let others take care of you.

641
00:52:34,209 --> 00:52:38,792
I have to see to it
that this boat stays afloat.

642
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:42,084
So everyone can get paid
at the end of the month.

643
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:47,126
It's been very hard
to find someone else.

644
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,709
He won't be as
good as you are,

645
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,834
but after some training,
he learned his lines.

646
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:59,959
We've arranged that he'll start
at the end of the month.

647
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:02,876
You still have a few days
to say goodbye.

648
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,751
You understand, don't you?

649
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:20,876
I think of you all the time.

650
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:38,459
What was that?

651
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:41,376
I'd say he's just fired you.

652
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:48,709
Everything's going to hell.

653
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,834
Argentine rock.

654
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,334
- Paula.
- Yes, Paula.

655
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:39,292
You talk to her, come on.
She wants to get today's report.

656
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,251
You answer...
You two get on well...

657
00:54:42,334 --> 00:54:44,709
Hello...
Hello.

658
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:21,542
Good morning, it's Julián.

659
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:23,584
Yes, the dog's owner.

660
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:28,376
No, I wanted to know
what time I could pick him up.

661
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:30,959
Did he eat?

662
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,459
Yes.

663
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:35,209
Great, great, no problem.

664
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:42,417
Oh, I see...

665
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:47,251
No, that's no problem at all...

666
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:51,542
Okay, right.

667
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:52,834
Thank you.

668
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,834
See you tomorrow.

669
00:55:56,209 --> 00:55:58,167
What's wrong?

670
00:55:58,251 --> 00:55:59,334
Nothing, nothing...

671
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:02,292
They asked if he can
stay for another day.

672
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:04,667
The Russian boy got
home late yesterday,

673
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:06,792
they spent very little
time together...

674
00:56:06,876 --> 00:56:09,876
They want to take them
to a park to play today.

675
00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:12,209
Well, that's good, isn't it?

676
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,417
Means things are going well,
it's a good sign.

677
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,917
Yes, I don't know...
I guess.

678
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,667
What do you want to do?

679
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,792
What surprises have you
got lined up for me today?

680
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:27,751
None, I was going to pick
up Truman and that's it.

681
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:32,334
How old is your son?

682
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:36,042
Nico?

683
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:38,417
Twenty-one.

684
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:41,167
- He'll be 22 tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

685
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:44,917
Well, we can ask him to dinner.
Let's celebrate it.

686
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,751
To dinner?
When?

687
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:49,459
Well, today if you want.

688
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:53,084
If I want...
I'd love it but...

689
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:56,459
If you want to be alone
with him, I can...

690
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,876
No, no,
he'd be glad to see you,

691
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:01,626
I always quote you
as as an example,

692
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,417
I don't know of what, but I do.

693
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:06,917
We get the tickets online,
don't we?

694
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:12,251
- What tickets?
- For the plane.

695
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:13,917
What plane?

696
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,584
Nicolás lives in Amsterdam,
Tomás.

697
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,959
Nico lives in Amsterdam?

698
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:20,959
Yes, he's studying there,
I told you that.

699
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,251
Well, I didn't remember.

700
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:25,292
So you want us to go
there for lunch?

701
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,501
It was your idea.

702
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:32,459
Yes, yes, but I didn't
know he was in Holland.

703
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:34,667
Well, what's the problem?
It's near, we'll be back soon.

704
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,709
- Yes, sure... What?
- What?

705
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,292
You want us to go there,
have lunch and come back?

706
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:45,334
- Isn't it a good idea?
- it is, and very original, too.

707
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:47,626
Hey, you asked me
what I wanted to do.

708
00:57:47,709 --> 00:57:48,751
- Yes.
- I told you...

709
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:52,417
"I want to go to Amsterdam
to see Nicolás, my son. "

710
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:53,709
I haven't seen him in a while.

711
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,292
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- Yes.

712
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:58,126
Plus I'd get out of Madrid,
which will be good for me.

713
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:02,126
But if it's not true we can
do whatever we want...

714
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:05,417
- You said we had money.
- That's right.

715
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:06,709
So...

716
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:11,167
Don't worry.
I'll go when you leave, that's okay.

717
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:14,292
We can make some sandwiches
and go to the park to row.

718
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:16,334
We can rent a rowboat.

719
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,584
We'll have a great time!
Don't worry.

720
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,584
They're not serving anything,
not even coffee or water.

721
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:39,709
I told you that.

722
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:42,626
I was about to show them my
test results, maybe that way...

723
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:47,542
- Have I said thank you?
- Yes, my leg hurts.

724
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:54,376
How's Nico?

725
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:58,209
- How's he coping?
- He's better now.

726
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,876
He doesn't talk much
about his feelings...

727
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:05,376
He's nothing like
me in that sense.

728
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,542
But he's fine.

729
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,501
He doesn't know the
whole story anyway.

730
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:12,667
What doesn't he know?

731
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:18,292
He thinks the cancer's
under control.

732
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:21,709
I haven't told him
about this last month,

733
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,251
or that I'm quitting chemo...

734
00:59:24,334 --> 00:59:25,626
What for?
There's no need.

735
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:28,917
I want him to be calm,
there'll be time to...

736
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,626
What's wrong?
Why do you have that look?

737
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:33,917
What look?

738
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:37,084
The one you had,
as when you disagree.

739
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:39,626
Well, maybe I do disagree,
that's all.

740
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,959
- He's happy now, he's happy...
- I know.

741
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:44,834
He's with his girlfriend,
living abroad...

742
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:49,376
He's had a rough year.
What good is it to upset him?

743
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:54,459
I don't see why people insist
on making others suffer.

744
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,876
He has the right to know it.

745
00:59:56,959 --> 01:00:00,001
Did I ask for your opinion?
I don't think so.

746
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:01,959
Everyone says what they think,
gives me advice.

747
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:04,167
They're all fucking clueless.

748
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:07,501
Fuck everyone else.
I paid for the tickets, I'm here.

749
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:08,792
I'll give you my
opinion if I want to.

750
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:12,501
When you're dying,
call me and we'll talk, fuck you!

751
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:22,209
Julián.

752
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,417
Julián.

753
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,251
I'm reading, don't bother me
or I'll call the flight attendant.

754
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:38,084
Okay, I'm sorry,
you're right.

755
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,167
Each person...

756
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,292
Each person dies
as best they can.

757
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:47,584
So what's the plan?
What did you arrange with Nico?

758
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:50,584
Want me to find a
restaurant for lunch?

759
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,501
To ask about local dishes
to celebrate?

760
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:55,917
I don't know,
I haven't heard from him yet.

761
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:59,834
What do you mean?
He doesn't know we're coming?

762
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:02,959
I guess he does,
I left him another message.

763
01:01:03,709 --> 01:01:05,042
What if he's not there?

764
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:08,459
Why so much trouble?

765
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:11,501
It's not that hard
to make sure before...

766
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,751
Why wouldn't he be there?
He lives there.

767
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:16,792
Maybe he's gone away
with his girlfriend, I don't know.

768
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:20,292
Maybe they rented some bicycles,
it's common there, and went to Belgium.

769
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,667
- I don't know, Julián.
- Why don't you go jerk off?

770
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:24,709
You're very nervous,
it'll calm you down.

771
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,167
Go and jerk off.
Do you remember how to do it?

772
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:28,334
I can ask the flight
attendant for help.

773
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:49,084
What are you doing?

774
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:51,584
Looking for his boat,
this is the right street,

775
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,584
but I don't know
where his boat is.

776
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:57,459
- I think it's this one.
- He lives on a boat?

777
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,209
Let's see.

778
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:09,751
Er... Is Nico home?

779
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,792
- Shall I translate?
- Please.

780
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:20,209
He's not here.
He left early.

781
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:28,376
He's left by bike.

782
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:31,501
Hello, how are you?

783
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:35,292
Hi... Fine.

784
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,042
Ask him how to get
to the university.

785
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:53,834
Where's he going?

786
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,667
To write down the address.

787
01:02:55,751 --> 01:02:58,376
He said we can take
the tram right there.

788
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:04,084
I bet they spend the
whole day smoking pot,

789
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:06,917
listening to music, fucking...
I envy them...

790
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,376
Being young is the best.

791
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:36,834
Maybe we're here for a reason,
you know?

792
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:42,292
Maybe you're right and...

793
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:45,834
I should tell Nico everything.

794
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:47,459
I should.

795
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:54,542
Wouldn't it be better if the
two of you were alone?

796
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,501
You can talk calmly...
I'll say hello but then I leave.

797
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,667
You have lunch together...

798
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,376
No, no, I think it'll be
good if you are there.

799
01:04:00,459 --> 01:04:04,584
I'll signal you when the time
comes and you go to smoke...

800
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,792
I don't smoke.

801
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:09,126
Well, go to the bathroom,
I don't know.

802
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:10,959
OK.

803
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:19,459
What signal? Like what?
So I don't...

804
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:23,709
A gesture.
Something simple.

805
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:27,126
- Nothing else.
- Okay.

806
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:44,459
Nico, have you heard
my messages?

807
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:46,876
In Amsterdam, I told you.

808
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,709
Now at the university, exactly.

809
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:51,251
I don't know, first floor,
the hall...

810
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:53,167
What?
You can see me?

811
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:54,417
Where are you?

812
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:06,792
Dad, what are you doing here?

813
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:08,292
Give me a hug.

814
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:14,209
- What's up? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing's wrong.

815
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:15,917
I've come with Tomás.
Remember Tomás?

816
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,876
Yes, hello, Tomás.

817
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,876
He's here in Amsterdam
for a conference,

818
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:24,251
and he invited me, I accepted,
and this way I get to see you, too.

819
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:25,459
- It's your birthday tomorrow.
- Yes...

820
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:28,251
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

821
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:31,459
It just came up all of a sudden,
I hadn't planned it before...

822
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:33,042
And I wanted to surprise you.

823
01:05:33,126 --> 01:05:35,292
- I see...
- I left you a message.

824
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:38,542
Yes, but surprises...
I don't...

825
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:40,501
I haven't heard
the messages either.

826
01:05:40,584 --> 01:05:42,292
I see.

827
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:45,001
Well, I thought we
could go out to lunch,

828
01:05:45,084 --> 01:05:46,751
for a little celebration.

829
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:49,876
Yeah, but I've made plans,
and then I've got an exam.

830
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:52,876
And tonight we're going
to a concert...

831
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:55,792
If you had called ahead...

832
01:05:57,709 --> 01:06:01,584
Don't worry, please,
that's all right.

833
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,834
We'll hang out for
as long as you can.

834
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:07,292
Just having seen you is enough for me.
I could head back right now.

835
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:08,751
That's it.

836
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:13,501
How's Truman?
His leg's better?

837
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:15,917
Yes, he's better.

838
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:17,834
- Everything's fine.
- Yes?

839
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,334
Everything's fine.

840
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:21,376
I was getting lunch now.

841
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:24,917
- If you want something quick.
- Yes. Let's go then.

842
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,292
Er...
Sophie's coming.

843
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,459
Great.

844
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:32,042
In fact, I came here
to meet your girlfriend.

845
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:34,834
I already know you.
Let's go.

846
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:54,209
What a nice place.

847
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,501
You always come here?

848
01:06:55,584 --> 01:06:59,251
Yes, sometimes...
The Wi-Fi...

849
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,959
- I met Sophie here.
- Did you?

850
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:07,959
You like her.

851
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:10,834
You're really involved
in the relationship...

852
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:20,459
- What's this?
- A gift.

853
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:22,917
I couldn't come empty-handed,
could I?

854
01:07:24,834 --> 01:07:30,001
It's a hip flask... for whisky or
whatever you put in your drinks.

855
01:07:30,084 --> 01:07:34,042
I used to do that.
Truman chose it.

856
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:35,626
Thanks, Dad.

857
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,167
I don't drink much,
but thanks.

858
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:42,709
Nico...

859
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:47,542
What?

860
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:53,834
How's everything going?
Things okay?

861
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:55,042
- Yes.
- Really?

862
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:57,001
Yes...

863
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:01,084
Great.

864
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,292
Thanks.

865
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:15,292
Dad...

866
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:22,459
I said all that before,
but I'm glad you came.

867
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:24,209
I know.

868
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,626
I'll carry this.

869
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,542
What's your conference about?

870
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:57,334
- Which one?
- The one you're here for.

871
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,084
Robotics.

872
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,167
- Robotics?
- Yes.

873
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:08,334
I work for a company in Montreal
which creates prototypes,

874
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:10,376
and I teach at university.

875
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:13,834
I went to get a doctorate,
and I stayed...

876
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:15,042
Watch out.

877
01:09:15,126 --> 01:09:18,209
Why... No, I don't think
I'll stay in Amsterdam.

878
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:21,917
I said that when I went to Madrid,
and how long have I been there?

879
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:23,209
Think about it.

880
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:27,542
No, I think...

881
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:31,251
I'll go live in Buenos Aires
for a while.

882
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:35,042
Why?
I didn't know it...

883
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:39,834
I've only been there
a couple of times and...

884
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:46,751
How long have you had
this plan, this idea?

885
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,292
For a while now.

886
01:09:53,376 --> 01:09:54,751
I'll get a smoke.

887
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:21,292
Why didn't you tell me
your father was coming?

888
01:10:21,376 --> 01:10:22,667
I didn't know he was.

889
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:25,917
It was a birthday surprise.

890
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:29,542
Ah... Do you want to be alone?
Am I interrupting?

891
01:10:29,584 --> 01:10:30,751
- Not at all.
- No.

892
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:33,042
- You're sure?
- Sure.

893
01:10:33,126 --> 01:10:35,542
I can't smoke these ones...

894
01:10:35,626 --> 01:10:37,834
Sophie, this is Tomás,
a friend of my father's.

895
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,459
- Hello.
- Hello.

896
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:43,126
- Where are you from?
- Paris.

897
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,626
Well, let's see.

898
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:48,459
Let's order something,
whatever you want, it's on us.

899
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:52,501
Will you be here for long?
You can stay on the boat.

900
01:10:52,584 --> 01:10:56,084
That would be great
but no, thank you, Sophie.

901
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,167
We're going back
to Madrid today.

902
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:01,126
This was a lightning visit,
to see Nico,

903
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:04,959
and celebrate his birthday...

904
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:06,709
You make a very good couple.

905
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:10,167
Very good.

906
01:11:10,209 --> 01:11:11,292
Okay, Dad.

907
01:11:11,376 --> 01:11:13,334
No, "Okay, Dad" no,
that's the truth.

908
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:16,126
And it's because of her,
she's much cuter than you.

909
01:11:16,209 --> 01:11:20,501
Although I imagined her differently.
I don't know, more Dutch.

910
01:11:20,584 --> 01:11:22,334
Dutch?
I told you she was French...

911
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,042
Yes, but...

912
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:27,376
The same happened to me.

913
01:11:27,501 --> 01:11:32,209
- Really?
- Yes, Nico tells me about you.

914
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:36,292
- He talks about me?
- Yes, always.

915
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,167
That's weird,
he never tells me anything.

916
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,459
That's why I had to
come to meet you.

917
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,542
Are you feeling better now?

918
01:11:43,584 --> 01:11:47,792
Yes, much better.
Thanks for asking.

919
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:52,626
Why don't we order some
drinks and have a toast?

920
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:54,334
- Yes...
- It's Nico's birthday.

921
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,209
- That's why we're here.
- Happy birthday.

922
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,667
When are you
coming to Madrid?

923
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,209
When I finish my exams.
You already asked me that.

924
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:22,626
Oh, yes.

925
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:28,834
Promise me this time you'll
come with Sophie, okay?

926
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:32,626
You can stay at my house. You'll have
privacy. I'll go to your mother's.

927
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:35,126
I'd like to see that,
you and mom together.

928
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:37,084
How much have
you got on you?

929
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,251
- How much what?
- Euros.

930
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:42,251
No, Dad.

931
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,459
Dad, it's not necessary.

932
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:47,042
Yes, yes, it is necessary.

933
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:51,209
I haven't sent you money
for weeks... It's necessary.

934
01:12:51,251 --> 01:12:54,584
You can have dinner
somewhere nice.

935
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:57,875
Money's not an issue. He owes me a lot,
I'm always lending him.

936
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,959
That's true.

937
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,501
Well, thanks.

938
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:05,001
- We have to go.
- Yes.

939
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:06,292
- Tomás...
- Bye.

940
01:13:06,376 --> 01:13:08,334
- Bye.
- It was nice to meet you.

941
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,167
The pleasure is all mine.

942
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,084
- Look after him for me.
- Yes.

943
01:13:13,126 --> 01:13:14,542
- Bye.
- Bye.

944
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:17,584
Well, it was a short visit,
but it was worth it.

945
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,376
- Yes.
- Wasn't it?

946
01:13:21,334 --> 01:13:22,751
Well... We'll see each other
in a few weeks.

947
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:24,459
Okay.

948
01:13:33,292 --> 01:13:35,959
- Your lighter.
- Ah, it's okay...

949
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,376
Bye.

950
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:16,251
I couldn't...
I tried, I did try but...

951
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,501
It's okay.

952
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,251
You'll have another chance.

953
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:23,376
- Just a minute.
- Where are you going?

954
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,584
To cry a little... alone...

955
01:14:26,334 --> 01:14:27,751
I'll be...

956
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:37,917
Don't you answer?

957
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:40,167
No, it's the theater.

958
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:42,376
- You have a show?
- Yes.

959
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:46,834
- Did you forget?
- No, I didn't.

960
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:50,292
But don't worry,
there's no problem.

961
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,542
They've got somebody else,
don't they?

962
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:55,376
I'm sure he'll answer.

963
01:15:55,459 --> 01:16:00,001
I'm going to get drunk tonight,

964
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:04,126
and so are you,
you deserve it.

965
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:06,917
Thanks.

966
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,917
What?

967
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,292
Nothing.

968
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:42,459
All this.

969
01:16:43,584 --> 01:16:45,001
It's your fault,
you know that.

970
01:16:45,084 --> 01:16:46,292
What?

971
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:48,251
Amsterdam, that he's so happy,
all this...

972
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:50,126
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

973
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,084
When are you leaving?

974
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:45,584
Day after next.
Tomorrow's my last day.

975
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,417
Come over to my place
for dinner.

976
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:50,084
I don't want to be alone with him,
I'm fed up with him.

977
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,459
So am I.

978
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,709
I'll try but...

979
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:57,251
I'll cook, don't worry.

980
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:58,751
Then maybe I'll come.

981
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,126
- Really?
- Yes.

982
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:02,542
- Great.
- Okay.

983
01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:04,584
Well, good night.

984
01:18:12,376 --> 01:18:14,667
Your vitamins,
don't forget to take them.

985
01:18:29,917 --> 01:18:31,917
Where are we sleeping tonight,
honey?

986
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:52,542
Truman...

987
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,126
How did the Russians treat you?

988
01:19:54,209 --> 01:19:56,709
Badly, can't you see
he's swollen, his breath stinks,

989
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,292
I don't know what
they gave him.

990
01:19:58,334 --> 01:20:01,042
You have breakfast here often?

991
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:04,626
No, I'm with another candidate,
she's in the restroom.

992
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:07,667
She might adopt him. She phoned
this morning, you were snoring.

993
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:10,917
It's good to have
more options.

994
01:20:11,001 --> 01:20:12,834
Since the Russian
doesn't want him.

995
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:15,001
- He doesn't?
- No.

996
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:16,917
Why?
What did they tell you?

997
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:21,917
Apparently...
the boy is afraid he'll die.

998
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,459
- The boy is afraid he...
- Yes.

999
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:29,834
Yes, because Truman is old...
The boy couldn't take another loss.

1000
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,626
They hadn't considered that,
not even the therapist.

1001
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:37,584
Now they want a puppy,
or a turtle, a parrot...

1002
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,501
What was I saying?

1003
01:20:40,584 --> 01:20:42,542
That your husband
doesn't like dogs.

1004
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:43,917
Not my husband,
my ex-husband.

1005
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:45,126
Yes, sorry.

1006
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:47,126
My friend Tomás.
Elena.

1007
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,751
Hi.

1008
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:51,459
Have you got a deck
or a balcony...

1009
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:54,334
so Truman can
get outside a bit?

1010
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:56,792
I've got a patio with a tree.
He'll love it.

1011
01:20:56,876 --> 01:21:00,251
- That's good.
- It's not very big but... I love dogs.

1012
01:21:00,334 --> 01:21:02,792
When are you leaving?

1013
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,750
- Where to?
- Canada.

1014
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:08,792
I told her we're moving to
Montreal in a couple months.

1015
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:12,251
Perfect, I'd like to fix
up the patio a bit.

1016
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:15,917
When you come to Madrid,
you can always come visit him.

1017
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:19,459
- Thank you very much.
- You can come to dinner.

1018
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,001
That's very kind of you.

1019
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,542
I'd ordered another beer!
A long time ago!

1020
01:21:23,626 --> 01:21:26,376
Maybe you're deaf?

1021
01:21:26,459 --> 01:21:30,542
- I'll bring it right over.
- I have to go now. Forget it.

1022
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:34,542
- I've got to run.
- Yes.

1023
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:37,709
Call me tomorrow or whenever you want,
and you come to see my house.

1024
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:39,626
I'll call you.
My pleasure.

1025
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:42,459
Thanks.

1026
01:21:42,542 --> 01:21:43,917
I'll call you in a few days.

1027
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:45,709
Bye.

1028
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,667
She's a woman, Truman,
you'll get used to it.

1029
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:59,084
- You must be kidding.
- Why?

1030
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:03,459
You're not leaving Truman
with that woman.

1031
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:05,459
What's wrong with her?

1032
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:08,792
She's a racist, did you see
how she treated the waiter?

1033
01:22:08,876 --> 01:22:11,376
Think about it.

1034
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:16,459
Yes, I will.

1035
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:21,417
I don't know what they fed him,
he'll be like this all week. Let's go.

1036
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:22,667
Can I have the check, please?

1037
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:42,876
Truman, my friend,
how are you?

1038
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:51,542
Gloria...

1039
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:57,625
My God...
What a surprise!

1040
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,459
What are you doing here?

1041
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:03,751
Are you back from Canada?

1042
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:05,751
No, no...

1043
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:08,042
I'm just here for a few days.

1044
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:10,417
I came to see Julián.

1045
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:12,251
Where is he?

1046
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:13,667
At the pharmacy.

1047
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,417
Julián didn't tell me
you were coming.

1048
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:17,209
Well, we don't talk
that often...

1049
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:20,042
It was a surprise visit...

1050
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:22,417
- And I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Well, well, well...

1051
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:25,792
My ex-wife and my best friend
together, what's this?

1052
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,834
Gloria.
How are you?

1053
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:31,959
Fine, fine...
I spotted Truman here alone...

1054
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,376
Did Nico tell you?

1055
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:38,042
No, what?

1056
01:23:38,084 --> 01:23:39,792
We were in
Amsterdam yesterday.

1057
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:41,042
We gave him a surprise.

1058
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:44,667
Really?
You went to see him?

1059
01:23:44,751 --> 01:23:48,542
We couldn't stay long,
because they had an exam,

1060
01:23:48,626 --> 01:23:52,292
but we had a drink,
we had lunch and celebrated...

1061
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:53,667
We talked.

1062
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:57,876
I'm glad, Julián.

1063
01:23:57,959 --> 01:24:00,959
That's a weight off my back.
I didn't know how to handle this.

1064
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:06,001
Nico called me last weekend.
I know you wanted to tell him,

1065
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:08,542
but he just kept on asking
more and more questions...

1066
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,459
He realized something
was wrong.

1067
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:12,501
So I told him.

1068
01:24:13,876 --> 01:24:16,084
- Haven't he told you?
- Yes, of course.

1069
01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:22,917
I told him about your decision
so he can be prepared.

1070
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:29,834
- I'm sorry if...
- No, no. Don't worry.

1071
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:33,459
We didn't talk so much
because Sophie was there...

1072
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:36,709
but... everything was fine.

1073
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:39,917
I'm glad to hear it.
Nico needed to see you.

1074
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:42,834
He was devastated.
He wanted to call you,

1075
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:44,917
but he didn't dare to
speak on the phone.

1076
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:46,542
- I understand.
- You know him.

1077
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:48,876
He follows every
test you get done.

1078
01:24:54,209 --> 01:24:58,376
Nico promised he'd bring
Sophie to Madrid soon.

1079
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:00,917
Let's hope so.

1080
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:07,876
Well... I've got to go,
it was great to see you, Tomás.

1081
01:25:07,959 --> 01:25:10,167
- Take care.
- You too.

1082
01:25:11,084 --> 01:25:13,251
- Call me if you need anything.
- Of course.

1083
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:17,959
The inseparable friends.

1084
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,292
Come here.

1085
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:35,667
Julián, let's go.

1086
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:51,876
Thanks.

1087
01:25:58,709 --> 01:26:00,251
Do you want anything else?

1088
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:06,501
Are you okay?

1089
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:09,334
I'm a bit upset.

1090
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:11,542
Why?

1091
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,334
Because you're
leaving tomorrow.

1092
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:21,667
And I won't ever
see you again.

1093
01:26:21,751 --> 01:26:24,167
I hate goodbyes,
I'm not going to the airport.

1094
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:26,376
I want to make it clear.

1095
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:28,126
I don't want you
to come either.

1096
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,751
- Fine, we'll say goodbye on the street.
- Fine.

1097
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:34,792
You take a taxi and go back
to the North Pole, that's it.

1098
01:26:34,876 --> 01:26:36,209
I think it's a great idea.

1099
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:46,751
How come I didn't realize,
when he hugged me?

1100
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,417
Why didn't I realize?

1101
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:51,667
Call him.

1102
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:56,959
Yes.

1103
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:01,917
I'll go to the bathroom.

1104
01:27:13,584 --> 01:27:16,084
That was fast, I thought
you went to the bathroom.

1105
01:27:20,584 --> 01:27:22,584
I've just peed on myself.

1106
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:32,417
It's okay, don't worry,
let's go home.

1107
01:27:32,501 --> 01:27:35,792
I used to be a romantic hero,
Tomás.

1108
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,626
A romantic hero.

1109
01:28:23,459 --> 01:28:27,126
It's delicious, Tomás.
When are you going to learn?

1110
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:29,876
What for?

1111
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:32,917
I invite you to dinner
and you never come.

1112
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:35,209
I never come because you
end up ordering pizza.

1113
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:38,750
What's wrong with pizza?
It's not any pizza, it's a special one.

1114
01:28:38,834 --> 01:28:41,709
It's this thin and made
in a wood-fired oven.

1115
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:43,542
It's delicious.

1116
01:28:43,626 --> 01:28:48,417
When we lived together,
he never cooked.

1117
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:50,459
- I imagine.
- Never.

1118
01:28:56,251 --> 01:28:59,376
Since you're in such
a good mood,

1119
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,334
I'll tell you something.

1120
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,876
Oh, here we go.

1121
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:07,959
- No farewell speeches.
- No. This is not a speech.

1122
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:11,959
So what is it,
one of your secrets?

1123
01:29:13,751 --> 01:29:16,459
- In a way, yes.
- What secrets?

1124
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:23,709
Sorry, we're all ears.

1125
01:29:31,084 --> 01:29:36,084
It's just that I've decided
I won't wait until the end.

1126
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:39,876
- What do you mean?
- Julián...

1127
01:29:42,584 --> 01:29:46,917
Nothing...
It's just that...

1128
01:29:47,001 --> 01:29:51,709
When things start to get ugly,
really ugly,

1129
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:53,376
I'm going to lie in my bed,
take some pills

1130
01:29:53,459 --> 01:29:56,084
a doctor friend of mine
gets for me, and...

1131
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:02,417
- That's it, just that.
- Just that?

1132
01:30:02,501 --> 01:30:04,417
Why are you telling me?
I don't understand.

1133
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:06,584
Why should I know it?

1134
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:09,876
Screw you, Julián! You made
me come over to hear this?!

1135
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:14,292
No, no, in fact, I've been meaning
to tell you for a while.

1136
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:16,417
But it's...

1137
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:21,459
just ending it all a bit earlier.

1138
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:26,584
We'll save ourselves all that
damned agony at the end.

1139
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:30,834
I don't want you to end
up wiping my ass, Paula.

1140
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:32,751
Not even my son.

1141
01:30:32,834 --> 01:30:35,501
Or worse,
to die in a hospital...

1142
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:39,709
full of nurses wanting
to get a picture with me.

1143
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:44,167
Julián, is it because
of what happened today?

1144
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:46,751
- No...
- What happened today?

1145
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:51,584
I peed myself.

1146
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:54,126
So what?

1147
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:59,751
Okay, maybe I made a mistake,
I'm sorry,

1148
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:03,167
I shouldn't have told you,
a letter would have been enough.

1149
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:05,584
You already spoke,
you've already made the mistake,

1150
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,001
don't play martyr now.

1151
01:31:07,084 --> 01:31:08,501
- Paula, please...
- What? I'm tired, too.

1152
01:31:08,584 --> 01:31:10,042
It's hard for me, too.

1153
01:31:10,126 --> 01:31:12,876
- Okay.
- Don't get angry, please.

1154
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:17,126
I want you to tell me
this is one of your jokes.

1155
01:31:17,209 --> 01:31:18,667
What pills?
I don't understand.

1156
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:20,751
Some pills...

1157
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:25,876
Great.

1158
01:31:25,959 --> 01:31:28,376
How long have you been
considering this?

1159
01:31:28,459 --> 01:31:34,376
Since the day I got my test results,
and they told me I was dying.

1160
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:35,584
Since then, Paula.

1161
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:38,334
Why don't you just die then
and leave me alone?!

1162
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:40,084
If that's what you want!

1163
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:45,209
What about you?
Don't you have anything to say?

1164
01:31:48,251 --> 01:31:50,626
Right, you're just visiting him,
aren't you?

1165
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:57,876
I'll be here if he wants.

1166
01:31:57,959 --> 01:32:01,501
No, I don't want
you to come back.

1167
01:32:01,584 --> 01:32:03,584
I'll do it on my own.

1168
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:09,167
I wanted you to know so it
didn't catch you unawares.

1169
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:13,834
Well, I'm glad you told me.

1170
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:17,376
And I'm glad I came.

1171
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:21,376
You can go to hell!
Both of you!

1172
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:29,751
It's our Italian blood.

1173
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:32,334
She'll be okay.

1174
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:35,251
You can take it if you want.

1175
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:38,292
It's mine.

1176
01:33:38,376 --> 01:33:40,292
I know,
that's why I'm telling you.

1177
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:44,292
What time is your
flight tomorrow?

1178
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:48,667
At... 12:30.

1179
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:49,834
Okay.

1180
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:54,042
So I'll come to
the hotel at 10:00.

1181
01:34:05,376 --> 01:34:06,709
See you tomorrow.

1182
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:10,709
They've gone fast...
these four days.

1183
01:34:12,542 --> 01:34:14,959
I feel like we haven't
really talked much,

1184
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:18,501
and I would have liked...

1185
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:26,959
Thank you for the envelope.
It's too much money.

1186
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:34,209
Do you want me
to walk Truman?

1187
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:37,584
No, no, it's not necessary,
thanks.

1188
01:34:38,834 --> 01:34:40,626
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

1189
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,709
- Is Julián at home?
- Of course. Why?

1190
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:09,917
I thought you were going out,
you have such a great time together.

1191
01:35:10,001 --> 01:35:12,459
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my phone.

1192
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,459
Can you wait a minute, please?

1193
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,876
- What for?
- I don't know.

1194
01:35:17,959 --> 01:35:19,917
So we can say goodbye.

1195
01:35:23,209 --> 01:35:25,042
- Bye.
- Bye.

1196
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:26,917
I'll keep you posted.
Or not.

1197
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:29,542
I don't think you'll like
what's going to happen soon.

1198
01:35:29,626 --> 01:35:31,751
- It's no one's fault.
- No.

1199
01:35:31,834 --> 01:35:33,667
We're all doing
the best we can.

1200
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:35,917
Some more than others.

1201
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:38,876
Don't try to make me feel guilty,
because you won't succeed.

1202
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:40,584
- I'm sure of that.
- You know why?

1203
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:42,709
I have no idea.

1204
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:45,917
Because I'm proud of Julián,
I'm proud of him.

1205
01:35:46,042 --> 01:35:49,376
How nice,
have you told him that?

1206
01:35:49,459 --> 01:35:51,376
No, I couldn't.

1207
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:56,251
I tried, but I couldn't.

1208
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,834
I would have started crying.

1209
01:35:57,917 --> 01:35:59,292
Heaven forbid!

1210
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:05,042
Let's not part like this.

1211
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:07,709
We don't deserve it.

1212
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:15,417
Shall we go up to your room?

1213
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:19,001
Yes.

1214
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:38,000
Truman, come here.

1215
01:40:28,834 --> 01:40:30,292
Makes sense.

1216
01:40:33,542 --> 01:40:35,917
- I left my phone at your house.
- Yes, I noticed.

1217
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:38,834
- Have you called a cab?
- No, we're taking my car.

1218
01:40:38,876 --> 01:40:40,792
- Yes?
- Yes.

1219
01:42:15,834 --> 01:42:18,334
Will you wait or...?

1220
01:42:18,417 --> 01:42:19,584
Shall we say goodbye here?

1221
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,334
- Yes.
- It's a good place.

1222
01:42:30,251 --> 01:42:32,209
- We'll keep in touch.
- Sure.

1223
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:39,834
Here.

1224
01:42:40,626 --> 01:42:42,042
And also this.

1225
01:42:42,834 --> 01:42:46,751
- What?
- These are Truman's papers.

1226
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:49,084
And his ticket.

1227
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:53,626
I talked to the company to see
if he could travel with you,

1228
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:56,417
but he's too big,
he has to go in the cargo hold.

1229
01:42:56,501 --> 01:43:00,459
They assured me you'll
get a container for dogs.

1230
01:43:00,501 --> 01:43:04,417
They'll take him
when you check in.

1231
01:43:04,501 --> 01:43:06,459
These are...

1232
01:43:07,334 --> 01:43:10,334
all the vaccinations he's received
over the years, his tests, everything.

1233
01:43:10,459 --> 01:43:12,251
And this one.

1234
01:43:12,334 --> 01:43:16,917
This one is really important,
I did it this morning.

1235
01:43:17,001 --> 01:43:21,459
The vet certifies that Truman
does not have rabies.

1236
01:43:21,542 --> 01:43:25,501
This is vital. They'll ask for this
at customs in Canada.

1237
01:43:25,584 --> 01:43:27,417
Understand?

1238
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,584
- Here.
- Julián...

1239
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:34,876
I gave him some pills this morning,
which will relax him.

1240
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:39,126
Don't worry if he drools
or looks half drunk.

1241
01:43:39,209 --> 01:43:40,542
It's okay.

1242
01:43:43,376 --> 01:43:48,084
Give him a bath when you get home.
That will be good for him.

1243
01:43:49,501 --> 01:43:53,334
And tell your Viking children
to treat him well, okay?

1244
01:43:55,542 --> 01:43:56,751
Please.

1245
01:44:01,876 --> 01:44:03,376
Truman.

1246
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:18,917
Please, go.
