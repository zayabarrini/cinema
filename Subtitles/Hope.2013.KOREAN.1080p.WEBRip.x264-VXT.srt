00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,822
HOPE

2
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,014
HOPE’S STORE
STATIONERY - GROCERIES

3
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,524
When’s the meeting?

4
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,025
What?

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,610
You’re ready already?

6
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,198
Okay, okay. Hold on.

7
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,825
Man--

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,579
<i>You never came to</i>
<i>the PTA meetings last year.</i>

9
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,248
<i>If you’re late,</i>
<i>you’ll get on their bad side.</i>

10
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,085
I’m almost ready.

11
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,296
I didn’t even do the breakfast dishes.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,049
<i>Do that later and come out now.</i>

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
Okay, okay.

14
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,263
I’m ready! I’m leaving! I’m on my way.

15
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,684
I’m going! I’m on my way!

16
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,061
Where do I go?

17
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,229
Dog meat?

18
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,274
I can’t eat that.

19
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,903
SAFETY FIRST

20
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,011
It’s time for our lunch break.

21
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:03,266
Today’s menu is chicken soup.

22
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,311
I, the factory manager,
will eat last as always.

23
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:13,359
Please only take one piece
for those behind you.

24
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,611
Hey, you!

25
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,866
Don’t eat two pieces like last time
or I’ll kill you.

26
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,534
Dong-hoon?

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,869
Let’s eat together.

28
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,037
Okay.

29
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,625
Cheers everyone.

30
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:38,217
Summer break is coming up.
What should we get the teacher?

31
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,886
How about a dress?

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,013
-Good idea.
-Great.

33
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,349
What do you think, Mi-hee?

34
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,142
Huh?

35
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,063
How about a flowerpot?

36
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,439
Forget it.

37
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,275
These days, we give gift cards.

38
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,778
Right.

39
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,822
How much should we give?

40
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,075
You decide, Vice President.

41
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,785
-Of course.
-Yeah.

42
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,244
Let’s go.

43
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,621
I’ll text you how much we’ll pitch in.

44
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,083
-It was good.
-Yeah.

45
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,252
-I’m full.
-Did we collect money today?

46
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,255
-How much do we pay?
-We ate a lot.

47
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,884
Hope’s mom, you’ll pay?

48
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,178
-Me?
-Why not?

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,599
How about you and I
split the bill this time?

50
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,392
I didn’t even eat!

51
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,856
She’s too busy at the store
and never came out much.

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,194
She always said
she should treat you ladies.

53
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,488
Should we give Hope’s mom a chance then?

54
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,698
Why not?

55
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,992
-Thanks, Hope’s mom.
-Thanks.

56
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,705
How much you got?

57
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,086
I have 20,000 won.

58
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,171
Take credit cards?

59
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,386
198,000 won? That’s insane.

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,430
Damn women ate a whole dog.

61
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,516
It’s to get on their good side

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,895
or else your kid will get left out.

63
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,062
WATERMELON 20,000 won

64
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,357
Why’s it so dang expensive?

65
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,154
Tell your husband
to give Hope’s dad a raise.

66
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,407
He’s only the manager, not the boss.

67
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,871
By the way, aren’t you going to tell him?

68
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,957
How can he not tell?
Looks like it’s a boy.

69
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,543
He has no interest in me.

70
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,506
Then how’d you end up getting pregnant?

71
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,636
Honestly, we did it once in three years
and it happened.

72
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,472
Three years?

73
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,017
My husband is always all over me.

74
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,769
He can’t get enough of me.

75
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,940
How can I raise two when one is so hard?

76
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,357
Don’t say that.

77
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,611
Have the baby. It’ll grow on its own.

78
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,908
None left?

79
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,701
Nope.

80
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,372
No sense of loyalty.

81
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,134
Im Dong-hoon, is it good?

82
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:25,969
Yup.

83
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,975
-I only ate one, honest.
-The bones can’t be from one.

84
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,315
-Like it?
-It’s good.

85
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,817
Don’t you get food at home?

86
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,112
Yeah, I do. Just rice though.

87
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,575
I’m so skinny, but my wife’s getting fat.

88
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,663
Good for you, pal.
I can’t eat at home or here.

89
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,665
I only get rice at home and here.

90
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,129
And my three sons say I stink
and won’t ever come to me.

91
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,550
Want it?

92
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,928
-Forget it, man.
-Fine.

93
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,857
Give it to me. You got three of the same.

94
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,319
But this is a rare card.

95
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,612
Yours isn’t.

96
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,990
Want it?

97
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,742
Let’s trade with this.

98
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,495
This one for five of those.

99
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,165
Young-seok, you cheapskate.

100
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,085
-No deal, cheapskate.
-Let’s go.

101
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,063
What?

102
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,066
What?

103
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,246
Wait for me!

104
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,387
Dang!

105
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,514
I died again! This sucks!

106
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey, Han Young-seok.

107
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,352
What?

108
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,771
That’s not yours. Don’t hit it.

109
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,318
I paid to play on this. What’s it to you?

110
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,613
Why you little--
Don’t try bossing me around!

111
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,200
Little?

112
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,791
Fine. Your face is way bigger. So there.

113
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,752
Wanna die!

114
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,422
Mommy, I’m home.

115
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,549
Hi, Hope.

116
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,560
Young-seok is the problem.

117
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,437
What are you grumbling?

118
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,153
Try this. Ahh.

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,409
I don’t get this at all.

120
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,660
Get what?

121
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,830
It’s a math question.

122
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,917
I can solve most questions,

123
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,171
but I have no clue with this.

124
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,174
How can a second grade math question
be so hard?

125
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,925
Read it again.

126
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,760
Should I ask Daddy?

127
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,928
Daddy?

128
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,681
He probably won’t know more than me.

129
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,600
Come eat!

130
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:07,981
“Young-su has nine pencils
and Jin-hee has three.

131
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:13,487
How can they have
the same number of pencils?

132
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,115
Write your answer.”

133
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,700
What did you write?

134
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,161
Nothing.

135
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,912
Why?

136
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:27,502
Just add nine and three together,
then divide by two.

137
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,339
It’s not that easy.

138
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,468
Think that Young-su is Young-seok

139
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,554
and Jin-hee is me.

140
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,181
Young-seok?

141
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:45,395
There’s no way
Young-seok would give the pencils.

142
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:51,568
For us to have the same,
he’d have to give me three pencils.

143
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:57,406
There’s no way he’d ever give me anything.

144
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,493
That’s not the answer.

145
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,956
Dong-hoon, say something.

146
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,462
Listen to your mom.
Don’t start fighting with her.

147
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,178
Spicy noodles give me ulcers.

148
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,181
-Don’t eat it then.
-I didn’t say I won’t.

149
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,019
Forget it. Go watch baseball.
I’ll raise Hope by myself.

150
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,856
Really?

151
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,361
Listen good to your mom.

152
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,324
Stupid.

153
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,082
Let’s get you to bed.

154
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,838
<i>Kokomong, the sausage</i>

155
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,301
<i>Silly, playful Kokomong</i>

156
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,305
<i>A whiz inventor, Kokomong</i>

157
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,475
<i>Leader of the kids, Kokomong</i>

158
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,770
Young-seok, you waiting for Hope?

159
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,399
No way. I’m not waiting for her.

160
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,108
Then what are you doing here?

161
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,903
I’m waiting for the boys.

162
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,155
-Let’s go!
-Okay. Let’s go.

163
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
But Hope will be out soon.

164
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,496
Daddy, do you know how to tie hair?

165
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,665
Of course I do.

166
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,000
Come here.

167
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,421
Sit down.

168
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,800
GWANG-SIK

169
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,767
I’m on my way out.

170
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,853
Your second child’s sick?

171
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,525
The flu? Oh, no.

172
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,777
I can get there in 20 minutes.

173
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:05,283
Sign for the goods,
then open the warehouse.

174
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,370
Okay. Bye.

175
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,957
Ouch! Forget it!

176
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,709
Why?

177
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,629
-I’ll tie it up pretty.
-Forget it!

178
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,257
I always just pin my hair.

179
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,136
Mommy’s always busy.

180
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,099
You look prettier with your hair pinned.

181
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,651
Hope went to school, right?

182
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,153
-She’s still home.
-Oh, no. She’s late.

183
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,156
-Got it.
-The other kids already went?

184
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,159
I gotta go check on stuff coming in.

185
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,702
Where’s the umbrella?

186
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,580
-Look under the counter.
-Okay.

187
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,377
Hope, you’ll be late!

188
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,898
What the--

189
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,378
WILL BE RIGHT BACK

190
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,175
I’m all wet! Run!

191
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,137
Hey, this way!

192
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,306
It’s cold!

193
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,976
Hope!

194
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:55,937
Yeah?

195
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,314
Don’t pout.

196
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,943
I’ll tie your hair pretty tomorrow.

197
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,570
You always say that.

198
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,739
All grown up?

199
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,991
Talking back to your mom.

200
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,247
Want Mommy to walk you to school?

201
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,251
Forget it.
I can run there in three minutes.

202
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:25,257
Don’t go down muddy alleys
and take the big road.

203
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,009
I was going to anyway.

204
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,098
Take the big road!

205
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,893
VIENNA PIANO

206
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,813
If we’re late, we’re dead! Run!

207
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,526
It’s pouring! I’m so cold!

208
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,781
Wait for me! Slow down!

209
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,461
Hey! Hurry up!

210
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,222
Wait up!

211
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,783
Going to school?

212
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,539
That’s a pretty umbrella.

213
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,922
Mind sharing it with me?

214
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,595
But... I’m late for school.

215
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,611
Come in!

216
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,699
They’re coming in now.
I’ll count everything.

217
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,449
Don’t worry.

218
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,744
Be careful!

219
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,254
Why’s the gas bill so high?

220
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,801
Yeah?

221
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,720
<i>Where are you?</i>

222
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,304
At home.

223
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,431
<i>Oh, my, my, my.</i>

224
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,559
What? Something happened?

225
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,397
There are cops everywhere
outside the school.

226
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,316
<i>The school?</i>

227
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,655
I came by to give Young-seok his umbrella.

228
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,657
But you know
the construction site near here?

229
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,037
One girl was found half dead here.

230
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,750
<i>Hello? You hear me?</i>

231
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,506
Hello?

232
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>This is Inspector Seo.</i>

233
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,886
<i>Are you Im Hope’s father?</i>

234
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,097
Yes, I am.

235
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:47,394
<i>Hope’s hurt badly.</i>
<i>We’re taking her to Chang-won Hospital.</i>

236
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,940
The hospital?
My daughter should be in school.

237
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,317
<i>She’s going in and out of consciousness.</i>

238
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,279
<i>Please come as fast as you can.</i>

239
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,492
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

240
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,538
EMERGENCY

241
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:14,130
How was she when you first found her?

242
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,926
She had severe facial injuries
and was bleeding all over

243
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,552
and barely conscious.

244
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
Then who made the report?

245
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,808
-We got a call from 911.
-Really?

246
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,810
She called us directly.

247
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,365
Are you Hope’s mother?

248
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,286
Please calm down, ma’am.

249
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:56,296
The CT scan shows many cuts
and lacerations from the rectum to colon.

250
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,091
She needs surgery.

251
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,092
IM HOPE

252
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:04,596
<i>We may have to remove</i>
<i>parts of the large and small intestines.</i>

253
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,310
Hope!

254
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,708
IN SURGERY

255
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,547
What happens now?

256
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,384
The forensics results will come soon.

257
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,848
We’ll find the culprit. Don’t worry, sir.

258
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:53,770
Constable Lee, stay here
and keep reporting on her status.

259
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,992
It happened by the school?

260
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,369
How’d you know?

261
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,038
Which road was she on?

262
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,291
Was it the big road?

263
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,376
What do you mean?

264
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,838
I told her to go that way.

265
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,176
I sent her out alone in the rain.

266
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,971
Cut it out.

267
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,938
Did Young-seok’s mom know it was Hope?

268
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,359
She called me,
said a girl was dying near the school.

269
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,320
-Stop it.
-I can’t.

270
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:47,407
If she tells one person it was our Hope,

271
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,034
I’ll rip her mouth off!

272
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,411
Please.

273
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,126
My little girl--

274
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,299
Im Hope’s guardian, please?

275
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,717
Did the surgery go well?

276
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,261
Someone had better come in now.

277
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,596
Just one, please.

278
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,559
Stay here. I’ll be right back.

279
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,991
Listen carefully.

280
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,578
We have to remove
the large intestine and anus.

281
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,374
If we don’t do it now, she could die.

282
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,212
Sir, she’ll live
if we make an artificial anus.

283
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,506
An artificial anus?

284
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,758
A colostomy to put
the small intestine outside.

285
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,929
She’ll have to live like that for life.

286
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,855
Please save her.

287
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,060
What happened?

288
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,901
Is she alive?

289
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,662
Daddy, you came?

290
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,249
Yes.

291
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,836
Where’s Mommy?

292
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,466
We’re taking turns. She’s right outside.

293
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,095
We’ll always be here. Don’t worry.

294
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,140
Okay.

295
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:49,150
The doctor says you’re all right, Hope.

296
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,067
Yeah.

297
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,656
What about work?

298
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,868
Work?

299
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,373
I’m all done.

300
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:13,299
I thought Mommy and you would be busy.

301
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:20,013
The bad man should be caught.

302
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,768
I was really hurt.

303
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,191
So I just called 911.

304
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,401
Good.

305
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,487
When did you get so smart?

306
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,408
He was wearing beige pants.

307
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,329
And a vest with many pockets.

308
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,706
Who?

309
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,084
The bad man.

310
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,547
He should be caught.

311
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:59,176
Let’s talk about that later. Okay?

312
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,223
It was near the school.

313
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:08,770
I’m so sleepy. What if I forget?

314
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,939
It’s okay.

315
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,695
The police say they almost caught him.

316
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,948
-Really?
-Yes.

317
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,576
After you get a good sleep,

318
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:30,292
Daddy and the police will catch him.

319
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,878
Go to sleep, sweetie.

320
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,923
Okay, Daddy.

321
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,470
My throat feels dry.

322
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,182
And I feel like I have to poop.

323
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,311
Yes, sir.

324
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,689
Yes, Chief.

325
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,199
Results came for the fingerprints
found at the scene.

326
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,703
Did they find him? Arrest him?

327
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,708
We found a match out of ex-cons
and located his whereabouts.

328
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,089
Why aren’t you arresting him?

329
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,885
Constable Lee, why did you bring him here?

330
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,474
Have a seat, sir.

331
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,017
Who’s the bastard?

332
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,935
Where does he live?

333
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,481
I’m not allowed to give you any details.

334
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,567
You have his prints! You know who he is!

335
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,238
But we can’t arrest him
with just his fingerprints.

336
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
He’s here? Who is it?

337
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,501
There’s not enough evidence.
I can’t arrest him without a warrant.

338
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,586
Why can’t you get a warrant?

339
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,879
Sir?

340
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,384
The fingerprints could be
from anyone passing through.

341
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,344
We need more definite evidence
for a warrant.

342
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,180
What more evidence do you need?

343
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,225
Like surveillance camera footage or DNA.

344
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,272
There were no cameras at the scene
and no DNA yet.

345
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:05,447
If the victim testifies
and identifies him,

346
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,866
we won’t need a warrant.

347
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,118
Testify?

348
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,499
Can you arrest him now?

349
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,045
She can’t get investigated like that.

350
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,255
It’s just testifying.

351
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,134
Whatever. She’s your child.

352
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,054
You want her to recall that horrific day?

353
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,641
You call yourself a father?

354
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,645
Don’t you have any feelings?

355
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,980
Feelings?

356
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,446
Fine. Let’s say I don’t.

357
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,531
Ma’am?

358
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,535
Sunflower Center helps
sexually abused children.

359
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,289
They help children deal with the trauma.

360
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,127
Why did this happen to our little girl?

361
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:05,548
If the cops would have watched
those guys better,

362
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,424
this wouldn’t have happened!

363
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,094
Sit down.

364
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,013
We have to get that bastard!

365
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,474
Please calm down.

366
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,810
How can we?

367
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:32,408
Please go home
and bring her toys and journals.

368
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:34,578
What?

369
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,789
That’s what the therapist asked for.

370
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,208
I’ll try to convince your wife.

371
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,194
KOKOMONG

372
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,407
KOKOMONG

373
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,215
Must you do this now?

374
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,719
We have to catch the culprit.

375
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,222
It’s only been three days.

376
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,976
She’s psychologically unstable.

377
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,562
Are you sure?

378
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,982
It’ll be the same no matter when.

379
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,901
It’s not easy for her.

380
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,906
I won’t do it
without the parents’ consent.

381
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,503
Hope

382
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,798
asked to catch the culprit.

383
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,428
Are you sure about this?

384
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,725
Yes.

385
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,607
Sweetie?

386
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,859
Can you talk?

387
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,366
You don’t want to?

388
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,625
Then you can just nod.

389
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,545
Can you see me?

390
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,930
<i>Kokomong, the sausage</i>

391
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,266
<i>Silly, playful Kokomong</i>

392
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,855
I’m pretty, aren’t I?

393
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,448
As you see,

394
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:05,205
Im Hope can state opinions
and is clearly conscious.

395
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,876
Sweetie?

396
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,754
It rained a lot that day, right?

397
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:25,266
You met a bad man on the way
to school and had a close call?

398
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,315
About the bad man--

399
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,777
Think you can tell me?

400
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,749
Hope?

401
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,959
Is this the man?

402
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,464
What makes you think this is him?

403
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,635
The face.

404
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,888
Eyes.

405
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,432
Mouth.

406
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,768
Really?

407
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,937
Just in case,

408
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:58,985
can you choose from other pictures too?

409
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,199
Hope?

410
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,829
Can you point him out again?

411
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:17,419
Hope? Can we give it another try?

412
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,880
Good girl.

413
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,822
As time goes,
she could behave differently.

414
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,658
She could suddenly start screaming

415
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,161
or not talk at all.

416
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,207
What do you mean?

417
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,172
She needs both physical
and emotional healing.

418
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,175
It may be hard
with just the family’s help.

419
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:10,098
The whole family
may all need treatment too.

SUNFLOWER CENTER

421
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,935
Call me.

422
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,607
What are you doing?

423
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:24,946
Don’t scare us with things
that didn’t even happen.

424
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,780
What’s with you?

425
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,118
If you’re done, I suggest you leave.

426
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,976
<i>Who is it?</i>

427
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,019
I came to get the dishes.

428
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,938
<i>I left them outside.</i>

429
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,523
I don’t see them. Where?

430
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,027
<i>Of course they’re there.</i>

431
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,448
You son of a--

432
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,917
Must we do this?
I don’t want the room with six patients.

433
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,545
We don’t have a choice.

434
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,303
Yes, Constable Lee.

435
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,098
Yes.

436
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,852
Thank you.

437
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,524
-I’d better go to the police.
-Did they catch him?

438
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,443
I’ll be back.

439
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,005
Chief!

440
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:10,259
Chief! Chief!

441
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,720
Sir, you can’t come here!

442
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,514
Let me in.

443
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,349
Chief!

444
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,810
Why’d he come here?

445
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,562
Let me in!

446
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,690
-You can’t, sir!
-Let me in!

447
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,358
-Let me in!
-Wait!

448
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,653
-Let me see his face!
-Sir, are you the victim’s father?

449
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,489
Sir, an interview, please!

450
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,325
Sir!

467
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:45,354
Choi abducted a girl
close from the school,

468

took her to a nearby place
and assaulted her.

-The girl was just eight years old.
-Really?

475
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,591
I heard she’s in this hospital.

476
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,762
Are you out of your mind?

477
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,807
You got her to testify for this?
We’re moving her.

00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,195
Wait. Not that way.

No! Stop!

Did I do something wrong?

486
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,996
Of course not.

509
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,634
-Her breathing is unstable.
-Help her breathing.

510
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,886
Bring the respirator.

511
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,972
-She’s bleeding!
-Saline!

512
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,766
Her heartbeat is too high!

513
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,313
Call pediatrics.

514
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:25,741
I was going to tell you.

515
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,998
After what happened to Hope, I lost track.

516
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,382
Are you mad?

517
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,888
Why?

518
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,560
How can you not tell me for five months?

519
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,982
By chance,

520
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:02,069
were you not going to give birth?

521
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,155
They said the baby’s fine.

522
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,208
Don’t cry.

I know it must be hard for you, sweetie.

525

But Mommy’s sick.

526
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,553
She can’t come by often.

527
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,934
You said you wanted a sibling, right?

528
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,901
There’s a little brother
or sister in Mommy’s tummy.

529
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,488
Know what that means?

530
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,789
Aren’t you hot?

531
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,253
You don’t like Daddy?

532
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,966
Don’t know?

533
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,136
Hope, are you embarrassed?

534
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,685
It’s Daddy. Don’t be--

535
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,693
I’ll be outside

536
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,364
so you can cool off.

537
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,618
Don’t cover your face.

538
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:31,636
The therapist asked me
to give this to you.

539
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,350
The woman from Sunflower Center
who was here before.

540
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,392
Oh, my.

541
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,357

00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,776
Well, I’m--

543
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,158
-It’s nothing.
-Are you okay?

544
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,460
It comes to 2,870,000 won.

545
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,431
The trial is set
for 11:00 am next Tuesday.

546
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:17,324
Dong-hoon? Hold on. It’s too noisy here.

547
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,745
<i>Why didn’t you call me earlier?</i>

548
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:22,996
<i>Hello?</i>

549
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,749
<i>Still there?</i>

550
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,167
About my severance--

551
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,711
What are you talking about?

552
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,506
You’re on vacation. What severance?

553
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,926
I’ve been here for two weeks.

554
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,804
I don’t know when it’ll end.

555
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,682
-There’s the trial too.
<i>-Be honest.</i>

556
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,477
If it’s ’cause of money,

557
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,774
I have some cash set aside
my wife doesn’t know about.

558
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,817
You can use it.

559
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:55,696
You helped out a lot last year
when my mother-in-law died.

560
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,240
Fool. Don’t say that.

561
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,953
Do I have to beg to lend you my money?

562
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,956
If you need to borrow, just ask.

563
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,709
<i>Need money or not, pal?</i>

564
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,336
I need it.

565
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,755
<i>Fine, then.</i>

566
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,882
<i>I’ll lend it to you.</i>

567
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,927
I gotta go back to work.

568
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,398
I’m going too.

569
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,399
I’m fine.

570
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,110
You’re not fine.

571
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,071
You had a close call.

572
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,655
A close call?

573
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,868
But I have to see that bastard’s face.

574
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,536
How can I trust you and rest here?

575
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,414
Then I’m not going.

576
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:51,167
-Are you threatening me?
-You should talk.

577
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,420
Threatening me with the unborn baby?

578
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,422
-What?
-My kid’s hurt.

579
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,175
And my pregnant wife
thinks she can run around.

580
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,928
What am I supposed to do?

581
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,683
You came?

582
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,478
Thank you.

583
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,448
Didn’t eat anything, did you?

584
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,126
You said...

585
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,921
when I called that morning...

586
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:41,135
that I knew everything
and called on purpose.

587
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,390
That if I told even one person,

588
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,643
you’d rip my mouth off.

589
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,272
I guess word travels fast.

590
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,608
I didn’t say I’d rip it off.

591
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,904
I said I could rip it off.

592
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,292
Trying to act strong,

593
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,336
you couldn’t even cry, could you?

594
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,507
You act way tougher.

595
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,056
You--

596
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,309
You think it’s my first time
coming here today?

597
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,270
I came more than 10 times.

598
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,773
I just watched from afar and left.

599
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,776
Why?

600
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,072
You should have come to see me.

601
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,159
I was dying to see you.

602
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,037
You said you’d rip my mouth!

603
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,332
I didn’t say that.

604
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,557
Try some food.

605
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,814
Stop crying, girl.

606
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,485
Is this laundry?

607
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,993
Stop crying and eat.

608
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,413
DEFENDANT

609
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,499
Around 8:30 AM on July 19, the defendant

610
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:41,505
dragged the eight-year-old victim
to a nearby construction site,

611
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,049
assaulted her face and abdomen,

612
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,176
choked her,

613
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,890
then sexually assaulted
her genital parts. Correct?

614
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,103
I don’t remember at all.

615
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:01,025
I worked all night and came home at dawn.

616
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,694
I drank alcohol and slept.

617
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,448
Then, can you explain
the bloodstain on your clothes?

618
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,910
Bloodstain?

619
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,537
There was blood?

620
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:18,541
I submit forensic results stating
the blood belonged to the victim.

621
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,879
And video of the victim’s
identification of the culprit.

622
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,802
VICTIM’S TESTIMONY

623
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,221
DNA ANALYSIS

624
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:35,976
The shoes and vest the prosecution claims,

625
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,519
are they yours?

626
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:43,025
Yes, but I lost them a few days ago.

627
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,444
Where did you lose them?

628
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,113
About three days ago,

629
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:52,867
I left them at the construction site,
but they disappeared.

630
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,953
When did you find them?

631
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,539
They were outside my house
on the day of the arrest.

632
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,211
Objection. The defendant just claims
to have lost and found them.

633
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,671
There is no evidence to support that.

634
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,673
Is there evidence to prove it?

635
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,092
We’re searching, Your Honor.

636
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:14,514
We’ll ask the construction workers
and find proof.

637
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,392
Then present it when you find it.

638
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:20,561
The next hearing will be
at 3:00 PM on September 25.

639
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,940
Court is adjourned.

640
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,611
You bastard!

641
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,448
You call yourself human!

642
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:36,120
After what you did to her! You bastard!

643
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,829
You don’t remember?

644
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,791
You son of a bitch!

645
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,672
<i>Memorized your moves?</i>

646
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,924
Yes, I did.

647
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,009
Me too.

648
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,719
But I can’t.

649
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:57,890
Don’t worry.
If you miss anything, I’ll jump right in.

650
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:58,891
Ready?

651
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:02,937
It’s okay if you make mistakes.
Just make big moves.

652
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:04,523
One at a time.

653
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,838
Hello, everyone!

654
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,799
I’m Kokomong.

655
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,219
Let’s invent something great today too.

656
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:39,014
Hello? I’m pretty Aromi.

657
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,768
Why am I so beautiful?

658
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,274
Ta-da. I’m Kero.

659
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,320
Want to see the new dance I made?

660
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,703
All our friends are here.
What will happen today?

661
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,622
Let’s go to Refrigerator Land.

662
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,715
<i>Let’s roll together</i>

663
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,885
<i>Let’s gather together</i>

664
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,889
<i>Kokomong is calling</i>

665
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,391
<i>It’s time for fun</i>

666
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,726
<i>It’ll be fun</i>

667
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,896
<i>-Let’s roll together</i>
<i>-Hurrah</i>

668
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,483
<i>-Let’s gather together</i>
<i>-Hurrah, hurrah</i>

669
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:36,823
<i>Hold Kokomong’s hand and run like the wind</i>

670
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,785
<i>Kokomong, Kokomong</i>

671
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,913
<i>I love Kokomong</i>

672
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,750
<i>Today and tomorrow</i>

673
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,254
<i>Let’s play together every day</i>

674
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,590
<i>-Let’s roll together</i>
<i>-Hurrah</i>

675
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,261
<i>-Let’s gather together</i>
<i>-Hurrah, hurrah</i>

676
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:01,306
<i>Hold Kokomong’s hand and run like the wind</i>

677
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,309
<i>Run like the wind</i>

678
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,277
Hey.

679
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,112
How did the trial go?

680
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:18,030
There’s no result on the first day.

681
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,950
-When’s the next trial?
-A month later.

682
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,661
What are you doing with this on?

683
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,038
Can’t you tell?

684
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,082
I thought you hated that therapist.

685
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:32,254
Who cares, when she’ll help my child.

686
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,884
Young-seok’s mom.

687
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,554
-You came?
-Yes.

688
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,849
When you’re done drinking,
go trade with the egg.

689
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:45,934
Okay.

690
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,860
Water, please.

691
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:58,530
-You came?
-Yes.

692
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,156
You too?

693
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,951
Yes.

694
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,413
I spent the whole day with the sisters.

695
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,039
Sisters?

696
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,792
Yes, sisters.

697
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,506
Women fight easily and get close easily.

698
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,299
I see.

699
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,677
My role is kind of important.
I’d better go back in.

700
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,222
-Of course.
-Bye.

701
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,824
Aromi.

702
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,660
Kokomong.

703
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,871
Eat lots.

704
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:56,380
Drawing pictures and compliments
won’t open up her heart.

705
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:02,344
Kids relieve stress by laughing
and playing till they sweat.

706
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:09,224
It’s 19,000 won an hour per costume
for two hours.

707
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:12,270
You borrowed four costumes.

708
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,314
It comes to 152,000 won.

709
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:17,275
One helper costs 10,000 won per hour.

710
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,819
So for two hours that’s 80,000 won.

711
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,698
But since the ladies helped,
it comes to 172,000 won.

712
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,284
Just give us 150,000 won.

713
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,328
Why does it cost so much?

714
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,747
It’s all for a good cause.

715
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,338
-It’s 150,000 won.
-Right.

716
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,054
Do you take Visa?

717
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,890
-Visa?
-Yes.

718
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,268
Sure.

719
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,439
Here you are.

720
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:03,405
How much is it to borrow this for the day?

721
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,074
It’s 70,000 won for the day.

722
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,454
For a week, it’s 350,000 won.

723
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:12,913
-Well--
-Yes?

724
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:18,753
Can you give a discount
or accept installments?

725
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,548
-Installments?
-Yes.

726
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,509
Hold on.

727
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:33,351
This is kind of old.

728
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:37,021
We don’t use it much.

729
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,149
So?

730
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,492
Just use it and give it back later.

731
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,244
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

732
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,039
Cheer up, sir.

733
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,584
-Thank you.
-Sure.

734
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,631
Thank you.

735
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,182
My daughter

736
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,895
experienced the same thing as Hope.

737
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,608
When she was 16, she committed suicide.

738
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,238
That same year,

739
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,578
I drove my car into the river to die.

740
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,955
As you can see,

741
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,876
I just lost my legs.

742
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,004
And I’m still alive like this.

743
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,342
The man who did that to my daughter

744
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,057
is still alive and roaming free.

745
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,023
Can you sleep well?

746
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,651
You don’t look good.

747
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,781
I can’t sleep much.

748
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,453
Five months?

749
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,580
Six months?

750
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,126
It’s due in November.

751
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,577
MY FRIENDS WENT HOME

752
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:00,517
REFRIGERATOR

753
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,403
REFRIGERATOR LAND?

754
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,387
YOU GO HOME TOO

755
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,658
YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING

756
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:35,444
Now that Hope is eating,
we’ll cut back on her IV.

757
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,228
YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING

758
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,007
Now.

759
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,427
I’m going to ask some questions.

760
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,848
And you answer, okay, Hope?

761
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,267
Good.

762
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:51,645
Let’s put one on since you answered.

763
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:00,071
Want me to put one first?

764
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:07,746
You’re not talking much these days?

765
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,461
Hope?

766
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,547
Can you talk today?

767
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,473
Would you like to put one on?

768
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,607
This is the night sky.

769
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:42,071
When the night sky
gets filled with butterflies,

770
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:46,075
Hope will be able to speak again.

771
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,203
And sleep well again.

772
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:53,332
And also be able
to solve hard math problems.

773
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,460
Isn’t that amazing?

774
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,926
Hope?

775
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,971
Can you write?

776
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,857
YES

777
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,032
<i>Hope, what’s today’s date?</i>

778
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,870
AUGUST 24

779
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,456
That’s right.

780
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,334
You must be on summer break.

781
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,301
How many days till school starts?

782
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,642
Three days?

783
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,564
What do you want to do most
when school starts?

784
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,651
Can I go to school?

785
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,987
Of course.

786
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:14,247
THAT’S A LIE

787
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:18,208
<i>Why do you think it’s a lie?</i>

788
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,586
<i>Why do you think you can’t go?</i>

789
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,590
<i>I’m embarrassed.</i>

790
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,178
What are you embarrassed of?

791
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:39,772
WHAT HAPPENED

792
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,860
That day?

793
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:48,781
I’m not going to tell my friends.

794
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:56,705
You think they know or don’t know?

795
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,791
I think they know.

796
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,930
Give me one.

797
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:17,560
I can have it all?

798
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,812
No changing minds.

799
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:21,771
Let’s go.

800
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,191
See ya.

801
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,199
<i>Where will you say you went</i>
<i>when you were away?</i>

802
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,451
<i>I thought</i>

803
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,455
<i>I’ll say I went to my cousin’s</i>
<i>with my parents.</i>

804
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:41,250
<i>Or went on a trip.</i>

805
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:48,132
If I don’t explain well,
bad rumors could start.

806
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:08,235
CLASSROOM RULES

807
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:13,699
<i>What didn’t you like most</i>
<i>about being sick?</i>

808
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,495
Missing school.

809
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:23,126
And my parents being unable to go to work.

810
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,462
<i>Spending lots of money.</i>

811
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,976
HOW TO TALK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER

812
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,566
<i>The man asked me to share my umbrella.</i>

813
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:53,281
I thought of just leaving.

814
01:14:55,866 --> 01:15:01,164
But he was all wet in the rain
and I should share.

815
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,250
So I did.

816
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:10,214
People say it’s my fault
and nobody praised me for sharing.

817
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:16,720
Oh, my.

818
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,012
COLLECTION BOX

819
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,013
Good job.

820
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,267
I’m beat.

821
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,768
Give it to me.

822
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,564
-Just 10,000 won, please.
-Okay.

823
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:38,534
What do you want to do most
when you leave the hospital?

824
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:44,123
Go to school and meet my friends.

825
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,126
And see the baby being born.

826
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,465
But I won’t be able to go to school...

827
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:58,221
and I’m worried my homework isn’t done.

828
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,770
When the baby’s born, I want to hold it.

829
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,399
But with this on,

830
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:17,531
I’m worried I’ll get
dirty stuff all over the baby.

831
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,578
<i>What if the baby is so cute,</i>

832
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:29,502
<i>my parents only love the baby?</i>

833
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:33,172
I’M SLEEPING. COME AGAIN.

834
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,613
It’s Kokomong!

835
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:09,833
Ever have a thought like this?

836
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:17,633
Hoping things will be like
before when you wake up.

837
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,305
Yesterday, I thought that.

838
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:28,477
<i>I felt like things will go back to normal</i>
<i>when I wake up.</i>

839
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:34,900
<i>So I took all my pills.</i>

840
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,697
And prayed before going to bed.

841
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:45,661
But when I woke up, nothing changed.

842
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,923
How do you feel then, Hope?

843
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:06,139
Granny used to say when she’s frustrated,

844
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:12,730
“I’m gonna die.”

845
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:20,196
But now I think I know what she meant.

846
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:27,827
“I’m gonna die.”

847
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:29,788
What do you think it means?

848
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:37,588
Why was I born?

849
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,914
Look, Hope. Isn’t it pretty?

850
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,333
Blow it out.

851
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,004
HAPPY GOING HOME.

852
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,675
-Congratulations, Hope.
-Thank you.

853
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:31,600
We haven’t been home so long, I’m nervous.

854
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,602
Are you?

855
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:40,942
Can’t we stay here?

856
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,820
Why?

857
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:46,532
Worried about going home?

858
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,540
Ready?

859
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,875
Finished paying?

860
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:01,672
Gwang-sik lent me his car. Let’s go.

861
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,133
Hope?

862
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,471
Wanna go down with Daddy?

863
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,440
I’ll go first.

864
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:51,764
DANGER

865
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,772
What’s wrong? Are you carsick?

866
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:04,443
We’re almost home. Okay?

867
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,571
It’s okay, Hope.

868
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,331
We’re here.

869
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,044
Take her in. Hurry.

870
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,880
Hope, let’s go in.

871
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,007
That’s good.

872
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,345
It’s okay, Hope.

873
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,891
It’s all right, Hope.

874
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,893
Hurry in.

875
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:42,355
Let’s go. We’re home.

876
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,444
It’s okay. We’re home.

877
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:56,161
TO HOPE

878
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,632
Young-seok, did you come to see Hope?

879
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:53,968
Did Hope come home?

880
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,345
Sure.

881
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,180
Wanna see her?

882
01:22:57,264 --> 01:23:03,019
No, I was just passing by and wondered...

883
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:09,359
I heard you won’t play with her
’cause she said your face is too big.

884
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,319
Aw, man.

885
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,864
Who says rumors like that?

886
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,785
Hope’s mom told me.

887
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:21,329
I’m going crazy.

888
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:22,831
Why?

889
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,836
What’s the matter?

890
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:34,760
I came to walk to school
with her that day.

891
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,388
If we went together,

892
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:43,101
nothing would have happened.

893
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:52,861
What’s with you, boy?

894
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,657
It’s okay. Don’t cry.

895
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,868
It’s all right.

896
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,955
Want some candy?

897
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,167
Let’s go inside.

898
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,339
“Greet teachers respectfully.

899
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,258
Don’t run in the hallways.

900
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:22,515
Book report due tomorrow.

901
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,145
Bring consent forms
for extracurricular activities.”

902
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,149
I can take her there.

903
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,527
<i>The baby’s about to pop out.</i>
<i>I’ll take her.</i>

904
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,196
Let’s put this on.

905
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:37,906
Good.

906
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,783
It’s not that far.

907
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:42,160
<i>Mom, I wanna go with Hope.</i>

908
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,830
<i>Hear that?</i>

909
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,040
Heard that?

910
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,919
Okay, then.

911
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,046
We’re all dressed and ready.

912
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,674
That’s a good girl.

913
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:59,093
We’re all set.

914
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:03,306
Mommy, the crackling sound is too loud.

915
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,809
Are you worried about that?

916
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:28,682
If the colostomy bag
ever falls off or leaks,

917
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,059
please call me.

918
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,185
Of course.

919
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:37,567
And can she avoid
direct contact with male teachers?

920
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,863
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.

921
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:46,451
The teachers will take caution.
Don’t worry.

922
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:51,790
Do you think the children will make fun?

923
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:57,462
With you doing all this,
they’ll all be good too.

924
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:03,301
I’ll come dressed more suitably next time.

925
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:07,765
So sorry.

926
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:11,810
Take care.

927
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,396
I’ll be going.

928
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,184
What if the bad man comes again?

929
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,437
I’m scared. I hope he gets punished.

930
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:19,460
Isn’t today your day off?

931
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,545
Oh, no.

932
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,049
Hope didn’t go to school?

933
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:28,428
Didn’t I tell you?
We’re seeing the therapist today.

934
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,597
Oh, right.

935
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:47,780
Hang in there.

936
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:51,952
She says Hope is getting a lot better.

937
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,662
I’m okay.

938
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,044
<i>How is Hope’s father doing?</i>

939
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:05,132
He leaves before Hope gets up.

940
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:10,888
I feel so sorry for him.

941
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,847
Worrying about him,

942
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,018
you’ve gotten a lot better.

943
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,691
Of all the kids in the world,

944
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:28,113
why’d this happen to our little girl?

945
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:35,120
I wish the same thing happens
to all the kids in the world.

946
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:42,169
Then Hope wouldn’t stand out
and be in pain more.

947
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,089
And?

948
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:50,302
But after thinking like that,

949
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,472
I’d feel sorry for the baby.

950
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:04,191
This happened to Hope
because I’m so evil to the bone.

951
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:09,154
I think.

952
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,662
Whenever I clean her colostomy bag,

953
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,045
I wonder when it’ll be over.

954
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,053
Did her grandmother live with you?

955
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,265
Yes.

956
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:42,020
My mom lived with us
till she died last year.

957
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:47,609
She used to say,
“I’m gonna die” all the time?

958
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,196
How did you know?

959
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:56,325
She said that when she moved
because of her arthritis.

960
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:59,621
When I asked Hope
what she thought that meant,

961
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,790
she thought for a while

962
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:09,631
and said it meant, “Why was I born?”

963
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,772
Hi, Young-seok.

964
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:34,322
Hope can’t walk fast,
so you go a step behind her, okay?

965
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,199
-Okay.
-Good.

966
01:31:37,034 --> 01:31:40,036
I can go by myself.

967
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,831
I’ll walk behind you.

968
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,376
Don’t come near me.

969
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,421
Fine. Go first.

970
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,299
See you later.

971
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,842
Thanks, Young-seok.

972
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,979
Where are you off to again?
You should eat lunch.

973
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,272
I’ll be back.

974
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,692
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere.

975
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:07,415
Hope?

976
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,418
What’s inside that bag?

977
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,379
Why do you want to know?

978
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,843
Want some candy?

979
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,513
-Yes.
-Me too.

980
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,520
I gotta go home. Bye.

981
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,022
See you tomorrow.

982
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,597
Hope!

983
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:11,396
The Kokomong over there,

984
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,441
is that your new friend?

985
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:22,199
Is it a boy or a girl?

986
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:41,133
I have no idea.

987
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:44,011
Kokomong is just Kokomong.

988
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:47,515
Hope?

989
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:52,437
I just want to say, don’t be sick.

990
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,944
Sorry about before.

991
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,243
We’re still friends, right?

992
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,119
Yup.

993
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,080
See you tomorrow.

994
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:19,881
Kokomong!

995
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,609
You--

996
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:50,995
Are you

997
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:56,250
Daddy?

998
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,381
You’re Daddy, right?

999
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:08,262
Answer me.

1000
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:20,274
Because of me--

1001
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:27,740
Are you not talking
because I wasn’t talking to you?

1002
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,626
Aren’t you hot?

1003
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,429
Let’s go home.

1004
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:13,160
-I’m home.
-Hi, Hope.

1005
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,454
Oh, my!

1006
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,915
What’s this?

1007
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,834
It’s Daddy.

1008
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:28,760
What the heck!
What are you doing in there?

1009
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:10,384
Mr. Im Dong-hoon?

1010
01:38:11,428 --> 01:38:12,929
Registered mail.

1011
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,023
SUBPOENA FOR IM HOPE

1012
01:38:25,107 --> 01:38:29,570
Why does Hope have to
go to court to testify?

1013
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:34,576
The Defense submitted Hope’s
psychological records as evidence.

1014
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:40,748
The judge said her testimony
video is not reliable.

1015
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:45,461
It’s going to kill her.

1016
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:50,675
Still, if she doesn’t testify now,
things could get worse.

1017
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:58,599
The sly bastard is claiming
physical and mental weakness.

1018
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,308
What?

1019
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:04,647
He wrote petitions saying
he can’t remember when he’s drunk.

1020
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,983
If that gets recognized,

1021
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:12,279
he’ll get 15 years maximum
or get off in just eight or nine years.

1022
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:16,909
Think it over, sir.

1023
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:22,665
If Hope testifies before the judge,
he’ll be cornered.

1024
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:33,467
CORRECTIONAL CENTER

1025
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,892
<i>You sent</i>

1026
01:39:41,518 --> 01:39:43,603
three petitions?

1027
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,730
Yes.

1028
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,066
I don’t remember it.

1029
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,652
I’m frustrated too.

1030
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,404
After what you did,

1031
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:56,824
how can you not remember?

1032
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:01,704
Whenever I drink, I can’t remember.

1033
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:07,752
They force me to remember,
so my head hurts.

1034
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:09,879
Your head hurts?

1035
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:16,218
If I really did that, I deserve to die.

1036
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:23,184
Doing that to a kid can’t be human,
but an animal.

1037
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,778
Did you come to settle?

1038
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:43,621
Settle?

1039
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:48,417
I would love to be able to settle.

1040
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:52,171
But I don’t have anything.

1041
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,968
If I get out soon, maybe I can make money.

1042
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:01,639
You know what I mean?

1043
01:41:05,602 --> 01:41:07,228
You went there.

1044
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,855
You remember.

1045
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,065
You know my daughter.

1046
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:14,151
Think I’d let you walk, bastard?

1047
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,240
Please be polite to me.

1048
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:24,871
Wondered why she was so cheeky.

1049
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:28,082
Guess she takes after Daddy.

1050
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,669
Think wisely.

1051
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:36,173
How long do you think I’d be in here?

1052
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,927
I’ll get out someday.

1053
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:43,847
So what!

1054
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,516
What will you do?

1055
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:51,104
Come out, you bastard!

1056
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:52,523
Come here.

1057
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,095
My wife said

1058
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:28,851
she wished the same thing
happened to all the kids.

1059
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:35,107
I thought that was really bad of her.

1060
01:42:38,027 --> 01:42:39,737
But now I think that.

1061
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,784
I know how you feel.

1062
01:42:45,702 --> 01:42:48,746
You can’t. You didn’t go through it.

1063
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,622
Dong-hoon?

1064
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,459
Can you think differently?

1065
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:56,838
That it was an accident?

1066
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:03,927
Like she was walking one day
and got hit by a car.

1067
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,304
An accident.

1068
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:06,806
What?

1069
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,515
An accident?

1070
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:13,687
Think of it that way
so your family can move on.

1071
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:17,775
Stop the car.

1072
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:19,401
Dong-hoon?

1073
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:20,611
Stop the car.

1074
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:22,780
Man--

1075
01:43:30,747 --> 01:43:34,291
If it was your kid,
can you call it an accident?

1076
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,628
I need to walk.

1077
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:54,854
By chance,

1078
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:58,440
did you take insurance on me?

1079
01:43:58,524 --> 01:43:59,984
What insurance?

1080
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:02,153
Life insurance?

1081
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,446
Something like that.

1082
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,367
I have no intention
and no money for insurance.

1083
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,954
I’ll work you like a dog forever.

1084
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:14,665
In 10 years, how old will Hope be?

1085
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,169
Why?

1086
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:26,635
The bastard could get out
in eight or nine years.

1087
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,262
That’s insane.

1088
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:32,308
Hope won’t even be 20.

1089
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:39,565
If the trial goes wrong,

1090
01:44:41,943 --> 01:44:44,528
I’ll deal with him on my own.

1091
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:49,116
You’ll kill him or something?

1092
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,869
Why not? I could.

1093
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:07,717
Since the Defense motioned against
the victim’s video testimony,

1094
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,137
I call Im Hope to the stand.

1095
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:23,901
Hope?

1096
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,070
Do you know why you’re here?

1097
01:45:29,115 --> 01:45:30,824
Why did you come?

1098
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:35,537
To punish the bad man.

1099
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:41,710
Do you remember taking the video
with the police in the hospital?

1100
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:45,505
Yes.

1101
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:48,341
You must’ve been in a lot of pain then.

1102
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:49,634
Yes.

1103
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,678
But you still remembered?

1104
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,679
Yes.

1105
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:58,019
You saw pictures
and pointed out the bad man.

1106
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:04,525
Could you do that again?

1107
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:10,364
Hold your hand up
when his picture comes up.

1108
01:46:11,032 --> 01:46:12,116
Yes.

1109
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:43,772
Hope?

1110
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,818
Is this the man?

1111
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,575
No more questions.

1112
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:01,415
Hope?

1113
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:05,585
On that day,

1114
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:08,672
can you tell me what the man smelled like?

1115
01:47:11,008 --> 01:47:12,843
Did he smell like cigarettes?

1116
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:18,765
How about alcohol?

1117
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:22,478
Yes.

1118
01:47:22,979 --> 01:47:24,021
How much?

1119
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:32,529
Did it smell a lot?

1120
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:42,706
No more questions.

1121
01:48:14,696 --> 01:48:19,285
The defendant could not prove
losing the shoes and vest.

1122
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:25,540
The victim’s blood marked shoes
and vest belong to the defendant.

1123
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:29,378
The defendant’s fingerprints
were also found at the scene.

1124
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:32,256
I never went there.

1125
01:48:33,715 --> 01:48:36,218
All the evidence points to you.

1126
01:48:36,302 --> 01:48:41,348
<i>Although painful to recall,</i>
<i>the victim came and identified you.</i>

1127
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:42,849
Hope?

1128
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:45,017
Are you okay?

1129
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:48,689
<i>I ask you one last time.</i>
<i>You really can’t remember?</i>

1130
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:51,775
Did I really go there?

1131
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,612
Do you accept the charges?

1132
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,614
Did I do it?

1133
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:03,620
If I did, I deserve to die.
I’ll take due punishment.

1134
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,624
But I really don’t remember anything.

1135
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:16,467
I submit evidence of
the defendant’s alcohol addiction.

1136
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:28,770
Defendant, make your final statement.

1137
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:36,445
I really don’t remember anything.
I’m innocent.

1138
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:41,325
Are you finished?

1139
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:43,201
No, sir.

1140
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:48,081
Your Honor, I didn’t do it.
I was too drunk.

1141
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:51,168
I don’t remember anything.

1142
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:53,170
It’s possible I didn’t do it!

1143
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,088
I’m innocent.

1144
01:49:56,173 --> 01:49:58,842
I’m wrongfully charged.

1145
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:09,478
Sexual assault case 2012-211.
I’ve reached a verdict.

1146
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:18,195
Defendant Choi Jong-sool

1147
01:50:19,821 --> 01:50:23,325
brutally assaulted an eight-year-old.

1148
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:26,703
Then choked her and raped her.

1149
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:31,124
The assault is ruthless
to the point of torturing.

1150
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,085
<i>Resulting from this,</i>

1151
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:39,591
<i>the victim has been wounded</i>
<i>with a permanent disability.</i>

1152
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:45,013
<i>He is responsible for scarring</i>
<i>the victim and family for life.</i>

1153
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:51,728
Also having a past record of abuse,
he must be punished severely.

1154
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:53,521
That’s right.

1155
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:54,731
However,

1156
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,693
<i>the defendant was intoxicated,</i>

1157
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,488
and his impaired state is recognized.

1158
01:51:04,866 --> 01:51:06,493
To the defendant Choi,

1159
01:51:07,453 --> 01:51:12,040
under the Act on Special Cases
concerning sexual assault, Article 9,

1160
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,502
Article 7

1161
01:51:16,462 --> 01:51:18,297
and Article 14,

1162
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:22,174
he is sentenced to 12 years.

1163
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:23,760
Just 12 years.

1164
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:33,437
Information on the defendant
will be made public for five years.

1165
01:51:34,896 --> 01:51:39,025
And the request for the victim’s
compensation is overruled.

1166
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:42,112
<i>How can this happen?</i>

1167
01:51:43,572 --> 01:51:44,948
Wait!

1168
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,786
Why go easy on him because he’s drunk?

1169
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,163
Then drunk driving shouldn’t be charged!

1170
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:57,085
Drunk driving is wrong,
but you go easy on almost killing a kid!

1171
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,299
You call this a trial?

1172
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:05,802
A child almost died.

1173
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,722
And she’s our child.

1174
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,310
I’m here and her dad’s here.

1175
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,771
And the one responsible is here.

1176
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:19,190
There’s evidence too.

1177
01:52:21,026 --> 01:52:23,278
But just 12 years?

1178
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:24,571
Order.

1179
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:31,370
You know how old she’ll be
in just 12 years?

1180
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,349
Daddy!

1181
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:01,358
Daddy, let’s go home.

1182
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:21,337
Let’s go home, please?

1183
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:25,674
Let’s go home.

1184
01:53:27,343 --> 01:53:28,719
Damn.

1185
01:53:42,608 --> 01:53:44,234
Let’s go home.

1186
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:48,697
Let’s go home.

1187
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:51,367
Get up.

1188
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,702
Let’s go home.

1189
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:50,401
Here he comes.

1190
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:52,361
Oh, my!

1191
01:55:52,446 --> 01:55:55,823
What a big boy!

1192
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:57,950
-Dad?
-Hmm?

1193
01:55:58,034 --> 01:55:59,786
His face is big too.

1194
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:02,623
Men should have big heads.

1195
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:07,669
But not as big as yours.

1196
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:12,048
Looks like it’s going to be big.

1197
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,676
Who named him?

1198
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:19,139
I named Hope. Mi-hee named him.

1199
01:56:19,765 --> 01:56:21,432
What is it?

1200
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,351
Happy.

1201
01:56:24,853 --> 01:56:26,478
Im Happy?

1202
01:56:26,563 --> 01:56:28,856
Yup. Im Happy.

1203
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,900
-Happy?
-Look here.

1204
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:33,319
He’s looking at us.

1205
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:35,739
-Isn’t he smart?
-You’re silly.

1206
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:46,666
The loneliest person is the kindest.
The saddest person smiles the brightest

1207
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:50,837
because they don’t want others
to feel the same pain.

1208
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:52,005
- Anonymous -

1209
01:56:52,631 --> 01:56:56,092
<i>I felt like I needed to go home today</i>

1210
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,263
<i>and left after second period.</i>

1211
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:05,977
<i>My friends may think it was weird.</i>

1212
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:10,899
<i>What should I say on Monday?</i>

1213
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:14,695
<i>I’m worried about that.</i>

1214
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:19,658
<i>I wish I wasn’t sick.</i>

1215
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:24,830
Throw it to third!

1216
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:26,664
Get him!

1217
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:30,293
You worked all night? Aren’t you sleeping?

1218
01:57:31,086 --> 01:57:32,879
I’ll watch this, then sleep.

1219
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,175
Yelling at a rerun.

1220
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:40,011
They’re making me tired.

1221
01:57:48,228 --> 01:57:51,147
<i>I made an airplane today.</i>

1222
01:57:51,732 --> 01:57:56,737
<i>I made it for my brother. It looks great.</i>

1223
01:57:57,696 --> 01:58:03,702
<i>I’m good at making</i>
<i>and fixing things like Daddy.</i>

1224
01:58:06,872 --> 01:58:10,416
If that fool didn’t make
an error, it’d be over.

1225
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:13,879
Go Lotte.

1226
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,842
Give up on Lotte.

1227
01:58:19,217 --> 01:58:21,344
What? They’re winning.

1228
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:24,848
But they lost 7-8.

1229
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:28,268
Don’t tell me that.

1230
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,855
Do you have to tell me now?

1231
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:35,275
Man, I can’t sleep now.

1232
01:58:56,587 --> 01:58:59,841
<i>You being born is a blessing.</i>

1233
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:16,149
<i>It’s all right</i>

1234
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:21,738
<i>You can stand again</i>

1235
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:27,202
<i>More than the past</i>

1236
01:59:29,329 --> 01:59:33,458
<i>The future is more important</i>

1237
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:38,338
<i>I swallowed my tears</i>

1238
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:43,593
<i>Because I’m not alone</i>

1239
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:49,057
<i>I know that well</i>

1240
01:59:51,267 --> 01:59:54,270
<i>I’m so thankful</i>

<i>I’m scared</i>

<i>I’m afraid</i>

1249
02:00:57,793 --> 02:01:04,549
<i>But I’ll live on</i>

1250
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:12,640
