Fuck her.

24
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,370
- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

25
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,507
- Fuck her.
- This is how business is done, man.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,841
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

27
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,243
You'd think we were
taking clients out

28
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,378
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

29
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,846
Which we can't even do anymore.

30
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,182
PAUL: Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

31
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,349
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

32
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,817
I think it's because
the golf club

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,885
doesn't let women play there.

34
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,721
- So?
- (snickers)

35
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,590
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

36
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,626
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,730
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

38
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,397
Jesus.

39
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,466
Oh, hey,
would you look at that?

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,402
- Good God Almighty.
- JIM: Yikes.

41
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,471
PAUL: Why don't you get
some dignity, sweetheart?

42
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,205
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

43
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,609
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

44
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,409
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

45
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:16,110
(groans quietly)

46
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,348
She's kind of hot.

47
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,349
PAUL:
(scoffs) A hot fucking mess.

48
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:21,550
(chuckles)

49
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,919
Hey. Let's talk to Brian.

50
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,486
I think he might be
amenable to the idea

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,788
if we all present
a very nice...

52
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,889

You know, like, you'd think
you'd learn by that age, right?

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,764
Where even are her friends?

57
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:37,432
Just kind of ran off somewhere?

58
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,502
Leaving her laying around
for anyone to pick up.

59
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,941
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.

60
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:46,776
Yeah? Maybe.

61
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:49,579

- you had it in you.
- To see if she's okay.

00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,651

329
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:57,101
Like, what it's like to be
a guy in the world.

330
00:14:57,134 --> 00:15:00,205
Just this gritty,
low-life, fucked-up love story.

331
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,173
And it all takes place
in New York

332
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,442
over the course of one night.

333
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:06,644
You know what?

334
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm gonna stop talking about it.

335
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,581
I don't want to jinx it.

336
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:12,149
You do coke, right?

337
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,652
- (slurring): Mm, not really.
- Oh, come on.

338
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,621
(inhales deeply)
I got work in the morning.

339
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,657
Oh, whatever. So do I.

340
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:21,225
(grunts)

341
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,394
Here.

342
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,096
Get right.

343
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:26,764
No.

344
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,899
Just put your nose up to this.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,470
No, here. Maybe just...

346
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,004
(Cassandra groans quietly)

347
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:36,307
Okay, that didn't work.

348
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:43,414
Hey. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

349
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,383
There you go.

350
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:55,427
Oh, my God,
you are so, so pretty.

351
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,695
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

352
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,264
Do you mind me asking?

353
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:01,633
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

354
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,269
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

355
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,037
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

356
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,038
It's just this
soul-sucking system

357
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,543
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

358
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,046
(Neil snorting)

359
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:17,381
(sniffing, exhales)

360
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,383
I want to see you.

361
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,051
- (sniffs) The real you.
- (thunder rumbling)

362
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:25,221
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

363
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:29,626
(gags)

364
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,596
I don't feel good.

365
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,666
Could you get me
a glass of water?

366
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah. Sure.

367
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,373
(cabinet opens, glass clinks)

368
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,109
- (faucet running)
- (thunder rumbling)

369
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:49,278
(footsteps approaching)

370
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,380
(sighs):
Are you fucking kidding me?

371
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,619
Hey.

372
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,385
Hey, you.

373
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,023
Hey!

374
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,491
(chuckles):
Hey.

375
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:02,726
There you are.

376
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,260
You fell asleep.

377
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,336
(softly):
Good girl.

378
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,606
Feel better?

379
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,108
No.

380
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,644
You know, I, um...

381
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:23,113
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

382
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,781
And I am so glad that I did.

383
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,084
I feel such a connection
to you.

384
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,118
Could you call me a cab?

385
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:31,320
You just got here.

386
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,523
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

387
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,459
Don't go.

388
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,260
Stay.

389
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,395
My God, you are so...

390
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,064
I need to go.

391
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,099
No, you don't want to go home.

392
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,368
- I need to go home.
- (thunder rumbling)

393
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:49,673
(inhales sharply)

394
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,075
(Neil panting quietly)

395
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:55,645
(exhales heavily)

396
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,484
- (normal voice): Hey, Neil.
- Yeah?

397
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,155
I said I need to go home.

398
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:08,157
Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

399
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,326
What is this?

400
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:10,861
Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

401
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:12,328
Why do you say that?

402
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,163
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

403
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,598
- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

404
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,700
Fuck.

405
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeah.

406
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,236
Well, I'm not.

407
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,137
But that's good, isn't it?

408
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:23,339
- I think you should leave.
- Oh.

409
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:25,576
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

410
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:28,311
I just... I'm really high.

411
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,314
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

412
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,847
I don't know what I'm doing.

413
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,284
(inhales sharply)
I think you should go.

414
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,253
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

415
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,288
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

416
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,490
I'm a nice guy.

417
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,393
Are you?

418
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,828
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

419
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,330
A connection?

420
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,164
Okay.

421
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:52,101
What do I do for a living?

422
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,770
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

423
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,539
How old am I?

424
00:18:57,773 --> 00:19:00,509
How long have I lived
in the city?

425
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:04,212
What are my hobbies?

426
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,684
What's my name?

427
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,388
All right.

428
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,290
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

429
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,826
What do you want from me?

430
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,694
To say that I'm an asshole?

431
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,631
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

432
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,865
- Whoa.
- (thunder crashes)

433
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,901
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

434
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:26,368
You really need to calm down.

435
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,571
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

436
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,806
while I was passed out.

437
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,339
You do get points for that.

438
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:33,809
A few guys, meh...
eh, they don't mind so much.

439
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:38,513
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

440
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:40,651
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

441
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:43,251
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

442
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,520
I don't know. Are you?

443
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,556
I am a nice guy.

444
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,191
You keep saying that.

445
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,861
You're not as rare as you think.

446
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,762
You know how I know?

447
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,329
No.

448
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,733
Because every week,
I go to a club,

449
00:19:57,768 --> 00:20:02,873
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

450
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,976
- And every...
- (grunts, shudders)

451
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,278
...fucking week,
a nice guy like you

452
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:13,415
comes over to see if I'm okay.

453
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,555
You want to fuck me still?

454
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:21,723
(whispers):
No, thank you, ma'am.

455
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:23,826
CASSANDRA:
Hmm.

456
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,728
No one ever does.

457
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:29,699
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

458
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,601
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

459
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,571
(door opens, closes)

460
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,273
(sighs heavily)

461
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,786
Night, Nina.

462
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,493
- (birds chirping outside)
- (clock ticking)

463
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,530
What's this?

464
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,269
Mom, what's this?

465
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,705
What do you mean?

466
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,576
This gift.

467
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,546
It's your birthday, Cassie.

468
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,784
Oh.

469
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,354
Yeah.

470
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:28,423
What kind of...

471
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,459
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

472
00:21:30,492 --> 00:21:33,028
Oh, sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

473
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:35,597
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

474
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,500
CASSANDRA:
It was just a mistake, Mom.

475
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,067
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

476
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,836
It's not a big deal.

477
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,471
SUSAN:
Not a big deal?

478
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:44,573
Not a big deal?

479
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:48,376
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

480
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,346
You don't want to have a party?

481
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,347
You don't want to see
your friends?

482
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,083
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

483
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,919
Don't joke about it. Don't.

484
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,556
Do you know how strange this is?

485
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,660
You, you're still living
here at home.

486
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,796
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

487
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:09,597
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

488
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,101
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

489
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,803
- STANLEY: Okay.
- SUSAN: And you...

490
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,904
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

491
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,941
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

492
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:21,710
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

493
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:24,479
- Okay?
- SUSAN: All my friends, they ask about you.

494
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,615
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

495
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,984
I-I don't know
what happened here.

496
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,821
I don't... (sobs)

497
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,957
(crying)

498
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,759
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

499
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,094
Okay?

500
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:40,895
Go ahead.

501
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,932
SUSAN:
Yeah.

502
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,278
Oh, I hope you like it.

503
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:02,517
Thank you.

504
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,488
- <i><font color="#80FFFF">(bell jingles)</i></font>
- GAIL: <i><font color="#80FFFF">Whoa.</i></font>

505
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,157
- CASSANDRA: Yeah.
- That's direct.

506
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,659
A real kick in the cunt.

507
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,028
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,330
It's definitely the fanciest

509
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,133
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

510
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,067
So, why don't you?

511
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,002
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

512
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,471
- Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...
- (door opens)

513
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,607
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Single White Female</i></font> some girl.

514
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,876
Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

515
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,811
- (door closes)
- I can't afford it, Gail.

516
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,413
Not on what you pay me.

517
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,148
Not even a weird guy's basement.

518
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:36,184
So take this other job, then.

519
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,185
Take any job.

520
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,453
Are you firing me?

521
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,455
Maybe I should.

522
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,790
Look, you're making
the assumption

523
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,492
that I want any of it.

524
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,661
If I wanted a boyfriend

525
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,596
and a yoga class
and a house and kids

526
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,898
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

527
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:54,035
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

528
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,836
I don't want it.

529
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,472
But you must want something.

530
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,708
- (door opens)
- RYAN: Hey.

531
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,144
- (Ryan clears throat)
- Oh. You.

532
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,913
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

533
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:06,914
(Ryan chuckling)

534
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,483
She spat in my coffee last time.

535
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,553
I'm back because, um,

536
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:16,089
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

537
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,058
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

538
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,192
I know.

539
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,230
So I spent a few hours composing

540
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:23,798
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

541
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,068
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

542
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,203
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

543
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,540
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

544
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,076
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

545
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:40,080
so I thought I'd try you again.

546
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,215
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

547
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,618
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

548
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,520
a phone ring in the back.
(chuckles)

549
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:49,958
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

550
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,925
(Gail laughing)

551
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,696
Um, look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

552
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,732
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

553
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,734
Right. Yeah.

554
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,935
Me, neither.

555
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,839
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

556
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:10,111
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

557
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,546
(Cassandra chuckles)

558
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,247
Dating's horrible.
Everyone's horrible.

559
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,583
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

560
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:16,851
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

561
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,586
You went on a date with my mom?

562
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,721
(laughs) Look,

563
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:22,256
I always liked you
at med school.

564
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,624
Okay?

565
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,727
I genuinely like you,

566
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,162
and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

567
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,031
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

568
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,901
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

569
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:37,005
and you can leave,
no questions asked.

570
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,772

- (door opens)
- (footsteps)

578
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,554
Hey.

579
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,890
You're all dressed up.

580
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,624
Where you going?

581
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,759
I'm going out for lunch.

582
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,895
With who?

583
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,630
A friend.

584
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,798
STANLEY:
Cassie.

585
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,803
You look very pretty, honey.

586
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,106
Thank you, Dad.

587
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,208
- (door closes)
- (chuckling)

588
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,710
CASSANDRA (laughing):
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Where... where did she get</i></font>

589
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,979
- a skeleton's hand from?
- She got it...

590
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,813
It was her, uh...
it was her grandfather's.

591
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,847
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

592
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:25,185
but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

593
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,256
pulled it out
and then waved it at me.

594
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,855
(both laughing)

595
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,625
And I am done.

596
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,794
And I'm wondering why
I told that story.

597
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,797
Hey. There is nothing more
romantic than a disturbed woman

598
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,598
pulling a skeleton's hand
out of her vagina.

599
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,800
That's true.
That's very true.

600
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,670
No one ever pulls anything
out of anywhere where I work.

601
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,071
Right, so you didn't want to...

602
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,174
- What?
- Carry on with med school or...

603
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,607
No.

604
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,211
Really? Why not?

605
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:52,746
I wanted to do something else.

606
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,980
Why?

607
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:54,980
(laughs) I don't know.

608
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,317
You were so good, though.
You knew everything.

609
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,319
- You...
- I didn't know everything.

610
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,688
You did.
You were incredible.

611
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,090
I was... I was awful. I...

612
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,859
Remember I removed the
wrong kidney from my cadaver?

613
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,162
And look at you now...
operating on children.

614
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,864
Yes. I got better.

615
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,367
Thank God. But you, you were
way ahead of everybody.

616
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,002
You-you would have been
a great doctor.

617
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,375
Just didn't want it enough,
I guess.

618
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,979
Um...

619
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,747
You want to get coffee
or something?

620
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,982
We, um... we have some time
before the movie.

621
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,352
I can tell you about the guy
who got his dick

622
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,720
trapped in a tambourine.

623
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,321
- (laughing)
- Oh, my God.

624
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:37,324
(Cassandra laughing)

625
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,693
Do you think people think
you're my daughter from behind?

626
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:41,994
(chuckles)
'Cause of the height.

627
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,762
- The height, I'm saying.
- (laughs): No.

628
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,798
It's like a fear
I have in public,

629
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,400
- if I'm with a woman.
- (laughs)

630
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,836
My fear is that, like,
if I kiss her,

631
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,873
like, people will be like,
"Stop kissing that child."

632
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,741
- I shouldn't yell this part, but...
- (laughs): No.

633
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,678
I mean, try not being
so tall, maybe.

634
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,680
- Don't be tall.
- Maybe, yeah.

635
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,249
- Yeah.
- It's kind of flashy.

636
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,817
(Ryan chuckles)

637
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,153
Whoa. This is...
this is a weird coincidence.

638
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,387
What?

639
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,123
I think...

640
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,223
No.

641
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:12,759
Yeah, this is my apartment.

642
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,760
(Ryan chuckles)

643
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,896
What a weird, weird coincidence.

644
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,031
Yeah. Do you want to...

645
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,432
I mean, we're here.

646
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,170
Do you want to go up,
have a drink or...

647
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,305
Sure. Why not?

648
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,740
Too soon. Sorry. I wasn't...

649
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,075
No, let's go upstairs.

650
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:32,045
I don't want to go up
if you don't want to...

651
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,779
I-I misread things.
I'll-I'll drive you home.

652
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,248
You know what?
You're at your place.

653
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,316
I can call a cab.

654
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,750
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

655
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,451
Okay, I feel like
I fucked this up.

656
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,954
No, it's not you.

657
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,009
(birds cawing)

658
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,848
(sighs)

659
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,521
WOMAN (over P.A.): Pediatric
assistant to admitting.

660
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:17,123
- (door opens)
- (quiet chatter, phone ringing)

661
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,025
Need a pediatric assistant
to admitting, please.

662
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:22,229
- I'll let you know.
- Okay. Thank you.

663
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,097
Cassie, what...
(chuckles)

664
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,267
What are you...
what are you doing here?

665
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,970
Um...

666
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:35,241
I just came to pick up
my herpes medication.

667
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,808
You have herpes, too.

668
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,144
That saves us
an awkward conversation.

669
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,547
(both laugh)

670
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,549
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Dinkins, please dial 3751.

671
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,118
Dr. Dinkins, 3751.

672
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,921
So, I...

673
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,124
So, I'd like to see you again.

674
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,925
Oh.

675
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,060
- If that's cool.
- Yeah.

676
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,498
But we'd need to take it slow.
I understand...

677
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,866
Of course. Totally. I...

678
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,403
I can take it slow.

679
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,872
I can barely move,
if you'd like.

680
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:08,240
(chuckles softly)

681
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,409
Thank you.

682
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,808
Yeah. Sorry.
(chuckles softly)

683
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:11,943
I could write a poem.

684
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,178
- (laughs)
- This is awesome.

685
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,147
Uh, what are you doing? You want
to get dinner or something?

686
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,549
Are you working?

687
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,018
Well, no. Um...

688
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,854
(quietly):
He has leukemia, and, uh,

689
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,989
there's really nothing
I can do for him.

690
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,992
- Oh, my God.
- It's-it's over.

691
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,561
- I'm kidding. My shift's over.
- (laughing): Oh, my God.

692
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:31,329
- I'll grab my stuff, okay?
- Okay.

693
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,431
Okay.

694
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,900
(clears throat)
Don't leave.

695
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,135
- (Ryan clears throat)
- (laughs)

696
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,270
("Can't Help the Way I Feel"
by Lily & Madeleine playing)

697
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,307

699
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,810
- Oh, my God.
- What?

700
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,882
Are you seeing that guy?

701
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,951
No.

702
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,087
(Gail laughs)

703
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,855
Aw.

704
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,892
Good for you.

GAIL:

707
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,299
pediatric surgeon, huh?

708
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,234
Yes. Yes.

709
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,869
(clears throat softly)

710
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,338
You ever killed any children?

711
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,940
Uh, what? (chuckles)

712
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:16,075
While operating on them.

713
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,942
Have you ever killed
any children?

714
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,478
Uh, no. No.

715
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,546
Really?

716
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,613
- CASSANDRA: Gail.
- I...

717
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,550
Well, kids have passed
while I've been operating.

718
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,251
So that's a yes. Yes...

719
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,489
Gail, stop asking him
if he's killed children.

720
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,991
I will stop asking him
when he stops killing children.

721
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:37,229
That-that seems fair.

722
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:39,464
That seems fair.

723
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,432
I'll leave you two
lovebirds to it.

724
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,936
- Can you lock up for me, honey?
- Of course.

725
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,976
Now, if you two decide
to have sex on the counter,

726
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,877
the bleach is in the back room.

727
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,215
And I don't want to walk
in here tomorrow morning

728
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,218
and see ass prints
in the coffee grinds.

729
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,519
Got it?

730
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,121
Got it, lover boy?

731
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,056
Yeah.

732
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,923
Have fun, you two.
Oh, my God.

733
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,292
(Gail laughing)

734
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,362
(door opens)

735
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,964
(door closes)

736
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,567
She seems nice.

737
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,000
(both laugh)

738
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,270
She is. She's a good friend.

739
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,540
Are you... are you friends with
anyone from Forrest still or...

740
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,008
No.

741
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,310
Really? No one? No one?

742
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,944
Really, no one.

743
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,280
Oh, my God, I can't...
I can't...

744
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,349
I can't shake them off.
(chuckles)

745
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,287
You still hang out
with those guys?

746
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,388
They're not that bad.
They aren't, really.

747
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,955
Um, oh, my God.

748
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,125
Madison McPhee just had twins.

749
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,163
She's completely obsessed.

750
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:47,298
I don't remember Madison.

751
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,669
You...
I thought you were close.

752
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,704
You guys and that other girl.

753
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,406
No.

754
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,074
Huh.

755
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,210
Um, oh, my God.

756
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,580
Al Monroe is marrying
this bikini model.

757
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,750
He got this hideous tattoo
of her name to propose.

758
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,318
Amazingly, she said yes.

759
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,455
(chuckles)
Classic Al, you know?

760
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,323
Landing on his feet.

761
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,057
Al Monroe?

762
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,060
You... well,
you must remember Al.

763
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,996
Yeah, I thought
he moved to London.

764
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,364
Yeah, he was there for years,

765
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:23,535
but he just moved back
to get married.

766
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,269
You see him a lot?

767
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,740
Uh, we're not close,
but he's in the group.

768
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,608
We actually
see each other at work,

769
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,478
'cause he's a...
anesthesiologist.

770
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,413
Good for him.

771
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,080
And he's getting married?

772
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:40,151
I know. God help her.
(chuckles softly)

773
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:15,478
(quiet chatter)

774
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,791
Welcome to
the Hotel Saint Joan, miss.

775
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,291
Thank you.

776
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,862
One ginger ale
and one bottle of champagne.

777
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,498
- Don't worry. I can do that.
- Oh, but it's...

778
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,387
MADISON:
Cassie.

779
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,923
(laughs)

780
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:01,257
CASSANDRA:
Madison.

781
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,460
MADISON:
Oh, my God.

782
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,295
(both laughing)

783
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,764
Oh, you look amazing.

784
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,733
I almost didn't recognize you.

785
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,769
You look exactly the same.

786
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,804
- You're sweet. I look so old.
- No.

787
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,606
That's what having twins
will do to you.

788
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,675
It's tragic.

789
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,775
Do you have kids?

790
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,309
No.

791
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:22,277
You'll get there.
(chuckles)

792
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:26,215
Champagne?
What are we drinking to?

793
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,550
To old friends.

794
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:32,722
(Madison chuckles softly)

795
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,159
MADISON:
Mm.

796
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,929
Mm.

797
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,798
(sighs):
Ah.

798
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:45,635
Honestly, I thought I'd be
bored out of my skull

799
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,706
watching the kids,
but it's been great, actually.

800
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,809
Are we out already?
Can we get another bottle?

801
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,309
Thanks.

802
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:55,813
I haven't been day drunk
in forever.

803
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,847
- So fun.
- So fun.

804
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,784
(both laughing)

805
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:05,554
TBH, I know all guys say
they want wives that work,

806
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,858
but it's not true.

807
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,458
- No?
- No.

808
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:12,295
I mean, they all want
a feminist in college,

809
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:13,630
because it's cool
to have a girlfriend

810
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:14,998
- who cares about something.
- (chuckles)

811
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,465
And, statistically,

812
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,434
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

813
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,969
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

814
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,304
Really?

815
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:22,405
You know, when it
comes down to it,

816
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,974
all guys want the same thing.

817
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,809
And what's that?

818
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,012
(sighs) A good girl.

819
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,545
I don't seem to remember

820
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,614
you were that much
of a good girl in med school.

821
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:33,849
Well, Fred... Thanks.

822
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:35,485
Fred didn't know me at school.

823
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,987
He met me when I was
working at L'Oréal.

824
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,588
Poor Fred.

825
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:43,860
(laughs) What he doesn't know
won't kill him, right?

826
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,728
I'm glad everything
has worked out

827
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,963
so well for you, Madison.

828
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:47,963
Thanks.

829
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:49,532
- It really has.
- Yeah.

830
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,400
(both chuckle)

831
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,570
You know, I actually
wanted to meet you today

832
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,972
to talk about something
in particular.

833
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,507
I did wonder.

834
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:59,541
No one's heard from you
in, like, forever.

835
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,577
(both chuckle)

836
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,480
I wanted to talk to you
about why I dropped out.

837
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,349
Okay, sure.

838
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:09,753
You remember
what happened, right?

839
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,490
Um, s-such a long time ago now.

840
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:16,726
I know, but you remember.

841
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,396
I mean, vaguely.

842
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,766
Do you ever think about it?

843
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,001
Why would I?

844
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,471
Right. Why would you?

845
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,474
So, if a friend came to you now,

846
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:37,346
into your house, and told you
that they thought something bad

847
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,914
had happened to them
the night before...

848
00:38:38,947 --> 00:38:41,050
- Cassie...
- Something bad.

849
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,052
- It was years ago.
- What would you say?

850
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:44,920
It w... (scoffs)

851
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:48,356
- What would you say?
- Ugh. I'm so...

852
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,592
I feel a little weird.

853
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,996
Would you roll your eyes
behind her back

854
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:54,664
and dismiss the whole thing
as drama?

855
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:56,800
(laughs): I don't know
why you're mad at me.

856
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,501
Okay, I-I'm not the only one
who didn't believe it.

857
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,804
If-if you have a reputation
for sleeping around,

858
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,773
then maybe people
aren't gonna believe you

859
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:05,842
when you say
something's happened.

860
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,110
I mean...

861
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:10,847
it's crying wolf.

862
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,382
You thought it was crying wolf?

863
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,451
I don't make the rules.

864
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,420
Look, when you get that drunk,
things happen.

865
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,125
Don't get blackout drunk
all the time

866
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:24,425
and then expect people
to be on your side

867
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,695
when you have sex
with someone you don't want to.

868
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:28,864
I mean... (scoffs)

869
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,835
That's a shame.

870
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:35,570
I was hoping you'd feel
differently by now.

871
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,039
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

872
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,440
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

873
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,413
(sighs)

874
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,114
(slurring):
Look... look, don't be mad.

875
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,983
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

876
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:49,952
It's my treat.

877
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:51,686
Hello?

878
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,989
(Madison sighs)

879
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:54,858
Are you okay, Madison?

880
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,161
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

881
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:00,128
(gasps) Oh! Shit.

882
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,864
My God.

883
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,632
Sorry.

884
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,438
It really is so great
seeing you again.

885
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,440
You really haven't
changed at all.

886
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:14,978
That's great.

887
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,916
So?

888
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,686
She's over there.

889
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,023
Room 25.

890
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,757
Your money's in the envelope.

891
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:31,893
You sure about this?

892
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,896
I'm sure.

893
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,797
(door opens)

894
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,034
(door closes)

895
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,637
(cell phone vibrating)

896
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,675
(continues vibrating)

897
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:54,449
(line beeps)

898
00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,918
MADISON (recorded):

919
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:52,907
(music continues faintly
over stereo)

920
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:56,777
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

921
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,713
- CASSANDRA: Excuse me.
- Bye.

922
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:01,115
CASSANDRA:
Excuse me! Hi.

923
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:02,583
- Me?
- Yeah.

924
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,052
(chuckles):
Hi. Sorry.

925
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,186
What's up?

926
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,989
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

927
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:08,255
and I'm so late for work.

928
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:10,291
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

929
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:11,860
I guess. Why?

930
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,262
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

931
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:16,597
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

932
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,266
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

933
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,666
- and I...
- Music video?

934
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:21,135
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

935
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:23,771
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

936
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:25,873
- I may as well not...
- AMBER: Oh, my God.

937
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,875
Oh, my God.

938
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:28,242
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

939
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:29,677
You didn't see that.

940
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,677
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

941
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,579
Don't worry about it.

942
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:32,512
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

943
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:35,150
Oh, my God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

944
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:37,251
Oh, my God!
Are they there right now?

945
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,286
You need to calm down, please.

946
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,755
I can direct you. Please.

947
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,655
Sorry. No.

948
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,027
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

949
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:47,295
I can't.

950
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,764
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

951
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,664
I will never work again.

952
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,201
I swear I won't post anything.

953
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,335
I promise.

954
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,704
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

955
00:42:57,704 --> 00:42:59,173
Ugh! God, okay.

956
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:00,275
Get in. Fine.

957
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:02,244
But you have to be
cool about this.

958
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:04,179
No. Of course I will.

959
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:06,880
(Amber squeals excitedly)

960
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,050
Whoa.

961
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,717
You really are a fan.

962
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,818
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

963
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:13,155
dedicated just to George's dog.

964
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,322
What a crazy coincidence.

965
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:16,657
I know.

966
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,592
You know what?

967
00:43:18,626 --> 00:43:20,594
This... this is fate.

968
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:24,099
Sure seems like it, huh?

969
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,865
(engine starts)

970
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,034

971
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:28,170

972
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:36,610

973
00:43:36,643 --> 00:43:38,646
SECRETARY:
Yes?

974
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:44,050
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

975
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:55,829
- (door closes)
- Daisy.

976
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:57,864
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

977
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,132
Please sit.

978
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:03,304
My assistant says that
you are interested

979
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,271
in resuming med school.

980
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:06,673
That's right.

981
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:08,409
May I ask what prompted
your desire

982
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,177
to get back to your studies?

983
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,380
I guess...

984
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,949
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

985
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:17,117
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

986
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:19,987
It's an unusual request.

987
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:23,389
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

988
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,824
Oh.

989
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:27,260
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

990
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:28,362
Hmm.

991
00:44:28,394 --> 00:44:30,331
Nina Fisher.

992
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,965
You don't remember her?

993
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:36,202
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

994
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,938
Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

995
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:41,007
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

996
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,744
Oh, he's a...
he's a really nice guy.

997
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:44,878
Really smart.

998
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:46,713
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

999
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:47,947
So, you don't remember

1000
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,949
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

1001
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:51,452
I don't.

1002
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,822
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

1003
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:58,826
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

1004
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:01,161
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

1005
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,429
and in front of his friends

1006
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,032
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

1007
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:08,402
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

1008
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,405
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

1009
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,373
Was it reported?

1010
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:14,807
Yes.

1011
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:16,844
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

1012
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,079
You.

1013
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,449
But you can't remember, so...

1014
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,717
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

1015
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:27,021
You said it was too much

1016
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,123
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

1017
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,257
Well...

1018
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:35,795
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

1019
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:37,197
One or two a week.

1020
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,865
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

1021
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,467
but I can assure you,
at that time,

1022
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:43,204
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

1023
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:47,307
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

1024
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,807
It's so hard.

1025
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,777
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

1026
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:53,846
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

1027
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,949
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

1028
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,385
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

1029
00:45:58,418 --> 00:46:00,454
(chuckles): I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

1030
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,855
I just want to be clear.

1031
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:05,092
None of us want to admit

1032
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,992
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

1033
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:08,961
When we've made a bad choice.

1034
00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:11,097
And those choices,
those mistakes,

1035
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,101
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

1036
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:19,505
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

1037
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:21,507
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

1038
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,409
Ruin a young man's life

1039
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,079
every time we get
an accusation like this?

1040
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,947
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

1041
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:31,117
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

1042
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,951
Of course you do.

1043
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:34,786
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

1044
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,291
No arguing with that.

1045
00:46:37,324 --> 00:46:39,393
No.

1046
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:41,295
Thank you for your time.

1047
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:44,331
- Is your friend okay?
- No.

1048
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,864
She's not.

1049
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,568
But Al Monroe is.

1050
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:49,869
You'll be glad to hear
he's doing really well.

1051
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,938
- He's getting married, actually, so...
- Hmm.

1052
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:54,340
You know, I guess you did
the right thing.

1053
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:58,177
We have to give these boys
the benefit of the doubt.

1054
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,146
That's why I know
you won't mind that,

1055
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:03,115
three hours ago, I picked your
daughter Amber up from school

1056
00:47:03,148 --> 00:47:05,985
and introduced her to the boys
who live in that room now.

1057
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:08,288
- What?
- She is really pretty, huh?

1058
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,356
(chuckles): She looks
a lot older than she is.

1059
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,592
- I don't believe you.
- I noticed they had a few

1060
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,327
bottles of vodka
in their room, too.

1061
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,030
But I'm sure they'll take
good care of your daughter.

1062
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:18,599
She seemed excited, actually.

1063
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:23,068
(dialing)

1064
00:47:24,605 --> 00:47:27,407
- (line ringing)
- (phone vibrating)

1065
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,543
Oh, wait.

1066
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:31,443
(chuckles):
I have her phone.

1067
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:33,880
She'll be wanting that later.

1068
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:37,382
You're crazy.

1069
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,052
No.

1070
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,987
Tell me what room
my daughter is in right now.

1071
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:44,856
I told you...
the same room Nina was in.

1072
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,327
I told you
I don't remember that.

1073
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,960
Well, that's a shame.

1074
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:51,864
What are you doing?

1075
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:53,398
She is a young girl.

1076
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:57,170
I wonder if she looks so young
to those guys.

1077
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:59,572
You better tell me
what room she's in.

1078
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,875
Tell me what fucking room
she's in!

1079
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:05,077
Now, you sociopath!

1080
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,512
Tell me where she is!

1081
00:48:07,547 --> 00:48:09,349
- (muffled): Right now!
- (phone ringing)

1082
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:11,983
Tell me what room she's in!

1083
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:14,853
Please!

1084
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:19,025
Please tell me.

1085
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,371
You're right, okay?

1086
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:33,972
Is that what you want to hear?

1087
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:36,074
You're right.

1088
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,112
You're right.

1089
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:46,552
Look how easy it was.

1090
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:50,021
I guess you just had to think
about it in the right way.

1091
00:48:51,157 --> 00:48:52,657
- (whimpers)
- I guess it feels different

1092
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:55,061
when it's someone you love.

1093
00:48:57,295 --> 00:49:00,266
Tell me where
my daughter is, please.

1094
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:10,543
(laughs)

1095
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,043
Relax.

1096
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,545
Dean Walker,
do you really think

1097
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,146
I would do something like that?

1098
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:18,048
Luckily, I don't have as much
faith in boys as you do.

1099
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,184
Amber is sitting in a diner,

1100
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,621
waiting for her favorite
boy band to show up

1101
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,423
for a music video.

1102
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:27,293
It's the Castle Diner,
if you want to call and check.

1103
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:29,362
Or you should probably call,
actually,

1104
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:32,063
or she may never figure out
they're not coming.

1105
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,199
She's kind of an idiot, huh?

1106
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:36,436
Gorgeous, though.

1107
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,135
Who needs brains?

1108
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,706
They never did a girl any good.

1109
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:43,240
Great to see you again,
Dean Walker.

1110
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,114
(closing door echoes)

1111
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:53,452
- (horn honking)
- (vehicle passes)

1112
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:56,353
(horn honking repeatedly)

1113
00:49:56,387 --> 00:49:58,724
MAN (muffled):
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hey! You're blocking the road!</font>

1114
00:49:58,757 --> 00:50:02,193
Get out of the fucking road!

1115
00:50:02,226 --> 00:50:04,329
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1116
00:50:04,362 --> 00:50:07,065
Hey. Hey!

1117
00:50:07,097 --> 00:50:09,201
You're sitting in the middle
of the intersection.

1118
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:11,001
How'd you get your license?

1119
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:13,338
You blow the entire DMV?

1120
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:14,773
Hello.

1121
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:16,474
I'm talking to you.

1122
00:50:16,507 --> 00:50:18,342
Look at me, you stupid cunt.

1123
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:19,679
(snapping fingers)

1124
00:50:19,711 --> 00:50:22,146
Huh?

1125
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:23,547
You want to have a face...
Okay, yeah.

1126
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24,750
Come on over. Let's do this.

1127
00:50:24,784 --> 00:50:25,918
Where are you going?

1128
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:28,586
You're just gonna leave
your car in the intersection?

1129
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:30,387
You coming over here? Huh?

1130
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:32,356
Are you angry?

1131
00:50:36,393 --> 00:50:37,730
Holy shit!

1132
00:50:37,762 --> 00:50:39,798
Is that a fucking tire iron?

1133
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,166
You psycho!

1134
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:43,768
Just chill out, okay?

1135
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:46,371
Why don't you calm down.

1136
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:47,639
Oh! Okay.

1137
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,541
Whoa! Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

1138
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,210
Crazy fucking bitch.

1139
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:56,815
- Excuse me?
- (sighs)

1140
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,782
Fuck you.

1141
00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:00,784
(tires squealing)

1142
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:31,181
(sighs):
Fuck.

1143
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,661
Ryan, what are...?

1144
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:44,795
She lives.

1145
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,831
I'm just kidding. You weren't
answering your phone,

1146
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:49,134
- so I was...
- Oh, shit. The movie.

1147
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,503
Oh, I-I'm so sorry.
I had to work late.

1148
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:54,204
Yeah, I-I went by
the coffee shop.

1149
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,807
Gail said you took the day off.

1150
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,643
- Um...
- Everything all right?

1151
00:51:58,677 --> 00:52:00,177
Yeah. (laughs)

1152
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,213
No, I'm fine. I'm just in
the middle of something.

1153
00:52:02,246 --> 00:52:05,114
Totally. Got it.
We can make the movie still

1154
00:52:05,148 --> 00:52:06,182
if we skip dinner.

1155
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:08,286
Um, I'm a little tired.

1156
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,788
- Yeah.
- Um, do you mind if I call you tomorrow?

1157
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,855
Sure. Great.

1158
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:13,190
- Okay.
- Are you okay, though?

1159
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:15,527
You seem kind of...

1160
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,461
What?

1161
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:20,764
Uh... off.

1162
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:23,601
No, um, I'm fine.
I'm just...

1163
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:25,402
Too-too much... too much coffee.

1164
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:27,338
(chuckles):
Don't work in a coffee shop.

1165
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:28,806
Okay.

1166
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,507
All right, night.

1167
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,476
All right, good night.

1168
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,306
Here we go.

1169
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,577
- Yeah, but you watch your step here.
- Whoop!

1170
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,244
Now, when we get to the house,
you got to be quiet,

1171
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:10,447
'cause I don't know if
my parents are asleep or not.

1172
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:13,182
- Okay. Mm.
- We got to be respectful.

1173
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:15,552
This is fucking surge prices.

1174
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:17,655
1.2? That's...

1175
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:20,423
I mean, it's not that far.

1176
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:22,259
- You can walk, right?
- I don't know.

1177
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,661
Let's try. Let's go.

1178
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:24,929
Come on, now.

1179
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:26,463
- Whoop, there we go.
- (whoops, laughs)

1180
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,800
- You got it. That was fun.
- (laughing)

1181
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,802
Yeah. (chuckles)

1182
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:33,804
Cassie?

1183
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:35,405
- (scoffing chuckle)
- Ryan.

1184
00:53:35,438 --> 00:53:37,976
What are you doing here?

1185
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,344
I'm meeting friends

1186
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:44,581
'cause my schedule
cleared up last minute.

1187
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:45,849
Let me explain.

1188
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:47,284
It's fine. It's...

1189
00:53:47,317 --> 00:53:48,552
PAUL:
Uh, my bad, dude.

1190
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:50,922
I didn't know
the woman was taken, but...

1191
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:52,588
- She's...
- She's all yours, man.

1192
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,525
All mine? (chuckles)

1193
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:56,427
Uh...

1194
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,762
Do you know her name or...?

1195
00:53:58,795 --> 00:54:00,364
Claire?

1196
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:02,331
- Wow.
- Pretty close.

1197
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,934
(chuckles):
Okay. Have a good night.

1198
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:05,635
Don't go, Ryan. Wait, please.

1199
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:07,438
Cassie, if you didn't...
if you weren't interested,

1200
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,940
just, you could've just told me.

1201
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:11,708
(Paul chuckling)

1202
00:54:11,742 --> 00:54:13,710
That's ice-cold.

1203
00:54:13,744 --> 00:54:15,278
That was humiliating.

1204
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:17,715
Why don't you just
fuck off now, okay?

1205
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:20,650
Wait, are you sober?

1206
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,385
Oh, shit.

1207
00:54:22,418 --> 00:54:24,387
You're that psycho
that Jerry took home.

1208
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,755
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1209
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,557
You know what?
Not interested, sweetheart.

1210
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,726
Nah. Why don't you take
your crazy somewhere else.

1211
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,329
You're not even that hot.

1212
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:35,666
You're hardly dropping
panties yourself, Paul.

1213
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:39,235
When was the last time
you scored in daylight?

1214
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:41,838
Careful.

1215
00:54:41,871 --> 00:54:44,574
No, you be careful.

1216
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:47,376
I'm not the only one
who does this.

1217
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:50,646
And some of the other girls,
they really are crazy.

1218
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:52,750
(Paul scoffs quietly)

1219
00:54:52,782 --> 00:54:54,418
I-I don't believe you.

1220
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:58,387
There's a woman in this city
that carries a pair of scissors.

1221
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:02,025
You're-you're lying.

1222
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:04,628
Hmm. Try it out
next time you go out.

1223
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:06,730
See what happens.

1224
00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:10,333
Why?

1225
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,869
Why you guys have to ruin
everything?!

1226
00:55:12,902 --> 00:55:14,871
(whimpering)

1227
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:25,548
(birds chirping)

1228
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:36,893
Can I help you?

1229
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:38,728
I really hope so.

1230
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:41,664
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm no longer
practicing the law,

1231
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:43,934
if that's what you've come for.

1232
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,003
It's not about that.

1233
00:55:46,036 --> 00:55:48,871
I'm afraid it's
your day of reckoning.

1234
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:53,911
I've been waiting.

1235
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:55,646
Come in.

1236
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:04,054
CASSANDRA: <i><font color="#80FFFF">Your office told me
you're on sabbatical.</i></font>

1237
00:56:04,086 --> 00:56:05,822
It was very easy
to get your address.

1238
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,123
They just gave it to me.

1239
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:09,960
I told them to give it
to anyone who asked.

1240
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,594
That doesn't seem safe.

1241
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:14,329
No use hiding from the piper.

1242
00:56:15,463 --> 00:56:16,900
He has to be paid.

1243
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:19,036
I guess so.

1244
00:56:19,068 --> 00:56:23,072
You seem nervous, Mr. Green.

1245
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:25,474
I came here to talk to you
about something

1246
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,110
that happened seven years ago.

1247
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:29,045
You probably
won't remember a client

1248
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:31,148
named Alexander Monroe.

1249
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:34,550
You helped so many boys
like him.

1250
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,619
And you most certainly
won't remember the girl

1251
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:39,554
who you threatened and bullied
till she dropped her case.

1252
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:43,893
I remember her.

1253
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,697
Nina?

1254
00:56:48,764 --> 00:56:49,831
Was that it?

1255
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,603
I'm sorry, I don't remember
her full name, but...

1256
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:57,840
It was Nina, though, wasn't it?

1257
00:57:00,742 --> 00:57:02,079
Yes.

1258
00:57:02,112 --> 00:57:04,480
I remember her.

1259
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,521
Have you come here to hurt me?

1260
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:17,525
Do you want me to hurt you?

1261
00:57:18,927 --> 00:57:20,663
I think so.

1262
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:27,536
I-I had a... what I think
was a-an epiphany,

1263
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,742
but my doctors called it
a psychotic episode.

1264
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:37,646
And it was at work, so...

1265
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,916
so now I'm on a sabbatical.

1266
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:46,989
You know, I got a bonus for
every settlement out of court.

1267
00:57:47,023 --> 00:57:50,092
I got another bonus
for every charge dropped.

1268
00:57:50,126 --> 00:57:51,994
We all did.
There was a guy...

1269
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:53,297
(Cassandra gasps)

1270
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:57,632
His only job was to comb through
all their social media accounts

1271
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:00,536
for any compromising
information.

1272
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:03,606
He contacted old friends,
past sexual partners.

1273
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:05,675
Oh, you'd be amazed
how much easier it is now

1274
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,677
with the Internet
to dig up dirt.

1275
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,947
In the old days, we'd have to
go through a girl's trash.

1276
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,949
- Now one drunk photo at a party.
- (whimpers)

1277
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:18,019
Oh, you wouldn't believe
how hostile that makes a jury.

1278
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:20,489
(gasps, whimpers)

1279
00:58:20,523 --> 00:58:22,458
You got to help me.

1280
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,994
I can't sleep.

1281
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,597
I can't sleep.

1282
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,802
I haven't slept in...

1283
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:38,840
I'll never forgive myself.

1284
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,644
I want you to know that.

1285
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,018
I'll never forgive myself
for any of this.

1286
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,592
- I forgive you.
- (sighs heavily)

1287
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,001
I'm so sorry.

1288
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:08,036
(shuddering breaths)

1289
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,010
Go to sleep.

1290
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:35,030
Do I go in now?

1291
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:39,634
- No.
- Oh.

1292
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:42,804
I'm stilling getting paid,
though, right?

1293
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:45,974
Yeah.

1294
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,815
(engine starts)

1295
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,628
Cassie?

1296
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:15,737
Do you remember
Nina's 16th birthday party?

1297
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:19,007
Oh, my gosh.
How could I forget?

1298
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,842
I was such a mess.

1299
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,677
Nina threw up on the swing.

1300
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,947
Mm-hmm. Certainly not
her finest moment.

1301
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,682
And that boy
who stole your vase.

1302
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:31,152
And she made him bring it
back to you and apologize.

1303
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:32,219
(both laugh)

1304
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,822
He was so scared of her.

1305
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,922
She was holding onto his ear.

1306
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:37,358
"You better say you're sorry
to my mom, you asshole."

1307
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:39,059
(chuckles)

1308
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,829
What was his name?

1309
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:45,934
Simon or Steve or something.

1310
01:00:50,137 --> 01:00:52,139
Why are you here?

1311
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:58,112
I just wanted to see you.

1312
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:59,847
You need to stop this.

1313
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,416
It isn't good for any of us.

1314
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,784
It's no good for Nina.

1315
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:06,721
It isn't good for you.

1316
01:01:06,753 --> 01:01:09,224
Look, I know you feel bad
that you weren't there,

1317
01:01:09,257 --> 01:01:11,126
but you got to let it go.

1318
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:18,065
I'm just trying to fix it.

1319
01:01:18,099 --> 01:01:20,869
Oh, come on. You can't.

1320
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:23,670
Don't be a child, Cassie.

1321
01:01:24,438 --> 01:01:26,673
(Mrs. Fisher sighs)

1322
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:29,010
I'm so sorry
I didn't go with her.

1323
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:31,378
No.

1324
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:33,347
I'm sorry, too.

1325
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,099
Cassie.

1326
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:52,900
Move on.

1327
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:54,402
Please.

1328
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,804
For all of us.

1329
01:03:01,802 --> 01:03:03,271
<i><font color="#80FFFF">(doorbell rings)</i></font>

1330
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:08,141
Oh, great, it's you.

1331
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,077
Can I come in?

1332
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:14,315
Yep.

1333
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:17,851
Do you want something?
Do you want a coffee?

1334
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:21,255
Or another dude to go home with?

1335
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:22,523
Yeah, actually.

1336
01:03:22,556 --> 01:03:24,259
Do you have any douchebags
lying around?

1337
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:27,827
(chuckles) Yeah. There's
a racist on the eighth floor.

1338
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,963
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

1339
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:34,768
What do you want, Cassie?

1340
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,038
I came to apologize about...

1341
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,338
Oh.

1342
01:03:39,373 --> 01:03:42,409
I've been trying to think
about how to explain.

1343
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,110
(Ryan clicks tongue)

1344
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:45,878
(sighs)

1345
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,182
It's not that
I'm not interested.

1346
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:53,286
- Mm.
- I really am.

1347
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,121
I really, really am.

1348
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:56,422
Okay.

1349
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:57,958
Sorry if I'm confused.

1350
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:59,293
It... (chuckles)
You...

1351
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:01,295
Sorry, we...
we've been on a couple dates.

1352
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:06,333
Um, you won't kiss me
or touch me, which is fine.

1353
01:04:06,365 --> 01:04:09,869
And then I see you going home

1354
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:13,072
with some random creep
in a fedora.

1355
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:18,077
I admit, the fedora
was unforgivable.

1356
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,112
(chuckles)

1357
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:24,384
The other night...

1358
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:28,255
It's hard to explain it,
but it won't happen again.

1359
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:31,090
I promise,
it'll never happen again.

1360
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:34,460
Can we try again?

1361
01:04:34,494 --> 01:04:37,396
Can I, I mean.

1362
01:04:38,565 --> 01:04:40,333
I don't...

1363
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:42,268
I don't know.

1364
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:46,972
Are you okay?

1365
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,445
Um...

1366
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:55,148
- It's fine. I'm...
- (scoffs)

1367
01:04:55,181 --> 01:04:58,385
- I guess I'll see you around.
- (sighs)

1368
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,454
(door closes)

1369
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:39,159
(door opens)

1370
01:05:39,192 --> 01:05:41,394
- We're closed.
- (door closes)

1371
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:43,396
RYAN:
Good.

1372
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:56,443
Do you want to go to dinner,
you miserable asshole?

1373
01:06:01,715 --> 01:06:03,315
Yeah.

1374
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:34,213
Shit.

1375
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:36,449
("Stars Are Blind"

RYAN: First trip to

CASSANDRA:
Yeah.

1378
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,320
Big step.

- (laughing): That's weird.
- Literally weeks.

1420
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:35,501
Thank you.

1421
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:36,868
Sorry.

1422
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:38,570
They're okay.

1423
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:40,506
(crickets chirping)

1424
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:43,242
- (gentle music playing)
- Cheese?

1425
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:44,376
RYAN:
Would love it.

1426
01:08:44,409 --> 01:08:46,444
Yeah. Thank you.

1427
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,582
- Bread?
- Ah, yep.

1428
01:08:50,615 --> 01:08:52,451
Okay.

1429
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:56,154
Mm. Oh. Thank you.

1430
01:08:56,186 --> 01:08:57,855
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1431
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,725
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1432
01:08:59,757 --> 01:09:00,893
Susan works really hard.

1433
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:03,127
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1434
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:05,597
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1435
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:06,731
This looks delicious.

1436
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,867
- Oh. (gasps) Oh.
- Thank you.

1437
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,603
I made the sauce.

1438
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:12,637
RYAN:
The sauce is...

1439
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,341
Mm.

1440
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,510
The sauce is really good.

1441
01:09:19,645 --> 01:09:21,447
- Incredible.
- SUSAN: Mm.

1442
01:09:22,648 --> 01:09:25,484
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1443
01:09:25,516 --> 01:09:27,720
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1444
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,724
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.

1445
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:35,627
(chuckles awkwardly)

1446
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,864
(laughing)

1447
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,431
He's funny.

1448
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,301
- (Stanley continues laughing)
- Yeah.

1449
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,536
STANLEY:
That's funny.

1450
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:46,904
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1451
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,506
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1452
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:52,176
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1453
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,177
I said you were boring but rich.

1454
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:56,314
I am boring. Not that rich.

1455
01:09:56,346 --> 01:09:57,716
- (laughter)
- No? Well, in that case,

1456
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,917
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1457
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:00,283
(laughter)

1458
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:02,520
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1459
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:04,856
Uh, pediatric, so...

1460
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,658
children.

1461
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:08,225
What was your, uh...

1462
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,729
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1463
01:10:10,762 --> 01:10:13,197
- Gary?
- Um, no.

1464
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,332
Dr. Katzen-something.

1465
01:10:15,365 --> 01:10:17,568
CASSANDRA:
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1466
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:18,904
Yeah, well...

1467
01:10:18,936 --> 01:10:20,773
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1468
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:21,907
No.

1469
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:23,408
SUSAN:
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1470
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,545
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1471
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,847
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1472
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:30,983
You're just...

1473
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:33,251
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1474
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:36,253
It's not brain surgery.
(chuckles softly)

1475
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,654
- Well...
- (laughs)

1476
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:40,358
I get it. Yeah.

1477
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:41,826
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

1478
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:44,295
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1479
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:46,296
(laughing quietly)

1480
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:47,698
SUSAN:
Night, you two.

1481
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:49,399
CASSANDRA:
Night.

1482
01:10:53,904 --> 01:10:56,640
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1483
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:00,811
I know it was hard.

1484
01:11:02,046 --> 01:11:04,481
You know, your mom, she's...

1485
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:10,354
(chuckles): Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...

1486
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:12,489
Oh, my God, Dad.

1487
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:13,990
(chuckles):
He's not that nice.

1488
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,260
(laughs):
Yeah.

1489
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:19,296
Yeah, I must be tired.

1490
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:21,498
(sighs):
Okay.

1491
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:28,739
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1492
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,341
You know that.

1493
01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:32,577
We really miss her.

1494
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,847
(sighs)
But, God, we have missed you.

1495
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:43,020
See you tomorrow.

1496
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:45,756
(sighs, chuckles)

1497
01:11:53,064 --> 01:11:55,800
RYAN: <i><font color="#80FFFF">Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.</i></font>

1498
01:11:55,832 --> 01:11:57,033
- Sorry.
- (laughing)

1499
01:11:57,068 --> 01:12:00,070
(chuckles):
Your mom is extremely hot.

1500
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:02,338
Do you want her number?

1501
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:04,975
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1502
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:06,376
Ooh.

1503
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,310
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1504
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:10,547
Well, I hope that's not true.

1505
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:15,284
Can I... Mm.

1506
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,055
Can I tell you something?

1507
01:12:18,088 --> 01:12:19,856
Sure.

1508
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:24,394
I think you're amazing. I...

1509
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:26,530
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1510
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:27,931
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...

1511
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:29,867
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1512
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,036
I think you're incredible. I...

1513
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:34,639
I'm... (sighs)

1514
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:38,408
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1515
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:45,716
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1516
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,416
(softly):
Yes.

1517
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:47,918
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...

1518
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:49,519
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1519
01:12:49,552 --> 01:12:51,421
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1520
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:53,690
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1521
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:55,391
I'm cool.

1522
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,128
- (whispers): I'm so cool.
- (laughing)

1523
01:12:58,162 --> 01:13:00,529
Oh, I'm the coolest.

1524
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:02,899
(humming "Stars Are Blind")

1525
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:07,838
Cassie.

1526
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:10,106
Shit.

1527
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,375
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1528
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:13,911
Sorry. I, um...

1529
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:15,511
I tried calling.

1530
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:18,048
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.

1531
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:19,716
Your friend.

1532
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:22,618
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1533
01:13:22,652 --> 01:13:24,654
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1534
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,524
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1535
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:29,559
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1536
01:13:29,592 --> 01:13:31,493
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1537
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,864
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1538
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,634
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1539
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,171
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1540
01:13:40,203 --> 01:13:41,837
He didn't touch you.

1541
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:45,475
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

1542
01:13:45,507 --> 01:13:47,944
(sobs):
Oh.

1543
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:49,578
(sniffles)

1544
01:13:49,613 --> 01:13:52,515
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...

1545
01:13:52,548 --> 01:13:54,118
that I... that he and I, um...

1546
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,918
He just put you in bed.

1547
01:13:55,952 --> 01:13:58,688
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1548
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:01,024
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1549
01:14:01,056 --> 01:14:02,993
It wasn't nice.

1550
01:14:03,025 --> 01:14:04,493
Yeah, well...

1551
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,762
God. Look, there...

1552
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:08,131
(sighs)

1553
01:14:08,164 --> 01:14:09,932
I need to show you something.

1554
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:12,101
Okay.

1555
01:14:12,136 --> 01:14:14,404
Can we go inside?

1556
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:17,974
Yeah.

1557
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:27,716
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1558
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,618
No, thank you.

1559
01:14:43,065 --> 01:14:44,234
Oh.

1560
01:14:44,266 --> 01:14:48,570
After we had lunch and...

1561
01:14:48,604 --> 01:14:52,609
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1562
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:55,979
um, I thought about it.

1563
01:14:56,011 --> 01:14:58,213
About what you said about Nina.

1564
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:01,551
And how we all
just acted like...

1565
01:15:06,722 --> 01:15:09,893
And I remembered something.

1566
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,594
What?

1567
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:16,533
What?

1568
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,935
There was a tape.

1569
01:15:24,106 --> 01:15:26,109
- What?
- A stupid video.

1570
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:28,211
It just got sent around.

1571
01:15:28,243 --> 01:15:29,845
I got sent it.

1572
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:31,814
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1573
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:34,818
It was just gossip, you know?

1574
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,618
Gossip?

1575
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:42,759
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1576
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,260
You know what it was like.

1577
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:46,195
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1578
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:49,099
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1579
01:15:49,131 --> 01:15:50,934
But, um...

1580
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:56,840
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1581
01:15:56,872 --> 01:15:59,042
So, um...

1582
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,845
Here.

1583
01:16:02,878 --> 01:16:06,547
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...

1584
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:10,519
What?

1585
01:16:11,186 --> 01:16:13,588
Thought it was funny.

1586
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,229
You can have the phone, okay?

1587
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:22,698
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1588
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:25,034
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1589
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,802
Just leave me out of it.

1590
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:29,671
And...

1591
01:16:29,704 --> 01:16:32,007
please, will you do me a favor?

1592
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,110
Yeah.

1593
01:16:37,212 --> 01:16:40,548
Never fucking contact me again.

what are you doing here?

Are-are you okay or...

1634
01:19:13,534 --> 01:19:15,470
Can we go somewhere
to talk privately?

1635
01:19:15,503 --> 01:19:17,805
I'm working. (chuckles)

1636

We need to talk right now.

Okay.
What's... what's going on?

- Everything all right or...?
- I've been such an asshole.

What happened?

1640
01:19:28,082 --> 01:19:31,153
I really thought for a second
it was all gonna be okay.

Cassie.

I need you to do
something for me,

1664

and I want you to think
about it very carefully.

1665

01:20:33,582 --> 01:20:36,283
So, I can send it out right now,

1672
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:39,787
or you can tell me where
Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

What?

1674
01:20:43,323 --> 01:20:44,525
Why?

You don't need to know why.

You think
they'll fire you here?

Oh, fuck.

you work with kids, right?

1683
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:57,904
They have to be careful.
Things have changed so much

1684
01:20:57,938 --> 01:20:59,172

haven't they?

1685

Think about this, please.
Please.

01:21:56,262 --> 01:21:58,599
I can't...

1704
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:00,899
Are you gonna tell everybody?

1705
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:03,404
I don't know.

1706
01:22:03,436 --> 01:22:04,604
I don't know if I can live with

1707
01:22:04,637 --> 01:22:06,140
the threat of this
hanging over me.

1708
01:22:07,073 --> 01:22:09,510
I didn't even do anything.

1709
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:11,112
(laughs):
Okay.

1710
01:22:11,145 --> 01:22:14,347
Poor Ryan,
just an innocent bystander.

1711
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:17,283
Yeah.

1712
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:20,253
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1713
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:23,090
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

1714
01:22:23,123 --> 01:22:24,692
And then we both
won't be doctors,

1715
01:22:24,725 --> 01:22:26,327
you fucking failure.

1716
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,560
Nice.

1717
01:22:27,595 --> 01:22:29,895
Bye, Ryan.

1718
01:22:32,432 --> 01:22:34,301
(door closes)

1719
01:22:42,175 --> 01:22:45,378
(classical version of Britney
Spears's "Toxic" playing)

1720
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,037
(water splashes)

1721
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,039
(indistinct chatter)

1722
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:25,778
- (laughing): Oh, shit.
- Holy shit. What?

1723
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:27,779
Well, the doctor's here.

1724
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:30,283
(others cheering,
whooping, laughing)

1725
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,226
- Stripper time, baby! Let's go!
- (cheering)

1726
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,130
- Let's go!
- Nurse, I'm feeling sick!

1727
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,664
(laughing):
Please take my temperature.

1728
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:47,533
I told you guys no strippers.

1729
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,135
Anastasia's gonna lose her shit.

1730
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,336
(others groaning)

1731
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:52,271
All right, who ordered her?

1732
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:53,805
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1733
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,275
(chuckles)
No one's owning up?

1734
01:24:56,309 --> 01:24:58,110
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1735
01:24:58,144 --> 01:24:59,479
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1736
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,447
- (laughter)
- I take it you're the groom?

1737
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,149
Yeah.

1738
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,350
(men whooping)

1739
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,386
- Then sit the fuck down.
- (laughter, yelling)

1740
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:07,819
Oh, shit!

1741
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,689
Now.

1742
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:12,824
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1743
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:15,127
like the naughty boys you are.

1744
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,828
- MEN: Oh...
- JOE: Come on, come on.

1745
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,564
(laughter)

1746
01:25:18,597 --> 01:25:20,699
Everybody here?

1747
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:22,467
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1748
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:25,438
Oh, yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

1749
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,172
(laughter)

1764
01:26:13,519 --> 01:26:14,921
Time to go upstairs.

1765
01:26:14,953 --> 01:26:18,858
No, it's okay.
I don't, uh, w-want to.

1766
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,627
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1767
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:21,894
if you don't want me to,

1768
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:25,262
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1769
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,167
(sighs) Okay.

1770
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:31,536
- Okay, you guys.
- (cheering)

1771
01:26:33,305 --> 01:26:35,908
JOE: I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1772
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,877
She better not be able to walk!

1773
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:39,912
Leave some for us, man!

1774
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:40,979
(door opens)

1775
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:42,546
(men hollering,
dance music playing downstairs)

1776
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:43,649
(door closes)

1777
01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:45,685
Uh, so what do I, uh...

1778
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:47,618
Get on the bed.

1779
01:26:47,653 --> 01:26:48,854
Okay.

1780
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:50,322
I'm a little scared of you.

1781
01:26:50,354 --> 01:26:52,759
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1782
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,927
(grunting):
All right.

1783
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:57,796
Oh! Uh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1784
01:26:57,829 --> 01:26:58,864
I-I'm not sure about that.

1785
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,600
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1786
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,734
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1787
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,636
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

1788
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:08,506
(chuckling)

1789
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:11,542
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1790
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:12,811
I'm a gentleman.

1791
01:27:12,845 --> 01:27:14,613
- Are you? (laughs)
- Yeah.

1792
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:17,582
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1793
01:27:17,615 --> 01:27:18,951
are sometimes the worst.

1794
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:20,551
Ow. Oh.

1795
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,753
Sorry, can you, uh...
can you loosen these a little?

1796
01:27:22,787 --> 01:27:25,690
- You'll get used to it.
- Ooh.

1797
01:27:25,724 --> 01:27:27,525
(chuckles)

1798
01:27:27,559 --> 01:27:29,761
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1799
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,597
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1800
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:36,835
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1801
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:38,403
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1802
01:27:38,436 --> 01:27:40,404
- So I-I don't want any, uh...
- (chuckles)

1803
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:42,841
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1804
01:27:42,873 --> 01:27:44,975
do something
you don't want to do?

1805
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,679
- No.
- Exactly.

1806
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,448
(chuckles, snorts)

1807
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,615
Ay.

1808
01:27:51,649 --> 01:27:53,618
So, what's your name?

1809
01:27:53,652 --> 01:27:54,653
Candy.

1810
01:27:55,886 --> 01:27:58,590
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1811
01:27:58,622 --> 01:28:00,225
Nina Fisher.

1812
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:03,962
What did you say?

1813
01:28:03,994 --> 01:28:06,230
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1814
01:28:07,064 --> 01:28:08,934
Can you let me go, please?

1815
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:10,301
I'm sorry, I can't.

1816
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:11,802
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1817
01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,337
Was it Joe?

1818
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,806
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1819
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:16,975
I don't follow.

1820
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:19,010
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1821
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:22,012
(sighs)
Because she's dead, okay?

1822
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:23,481
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1823
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:24,448
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1824
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:26,350
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1825
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,284
This isn't funny.

1826
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:29,320
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1827
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,356
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1828
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,826
But I'm not doing anything.

1829
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:36,292
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1830
01:28:36,328 --> 01:28:37,496
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1831
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:39,765
Can you get up here, please?

1832
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:43,435
I don't think they can hear you.

1833
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:46,904
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1834
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:50,341
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1835
01:28:50,373 --> 01:28:54,411
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1836
01:28:54,445 --> 01:28:56,881
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1837
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,652
Do I know you?

1838
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:02,787
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1839
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,489
You were so popular.

1840
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:12,063
You're Nina's friend.

1841
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:13,430
Fuck!

1842
01:29:13,463 --> 01:29:14,832
You're Nina's friend.

1843
01:29:14,865 --> 01:29:17,002
So you did notice me after all.

1844
01:29:17,034 --> 01:29:18,536
I'm surprised.

1845
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:20,503
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1846
01:29:20,537 --> 01:29:22,405
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1847
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:23,942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... (sighs)
What do you want?

1848
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,609
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1849
01:29:25,644 --> 01:29:29,313
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1850
01:29:30,547 --> 01:29:33,417
Are y...
are you talking about...

1851
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:34,953
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1852
01:29:34,985 --> 01:29:36,087
I didn't do anything!

1853
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,689
W-We were kids.

1854
01:29:37,721 --> 01:29:39,925
Oh, if I hear that
one more time.

1855
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:41,425
Look...
(stammers, sighs)

1856
01:29:41,457 --> 01:29:42,860
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1857
01:29:42,894 --> 01:29:45,595
- Oh, yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1858
01:29:45,628 --> 01:29:46,832
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1859
01:29:46,864 --> 01:29:48,498
Look, I... (chuckles)

1860
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:50,734
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1861
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:52,670
b-b-but we-we did not...

1862
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:56,942
What?

1863
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,775
You know.

1864
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,444
No.

1865
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:03,113
She could barely
hold her head up.

1866
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,949
She had no idea
what was going on.

1867
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,150
It was a fucking party.

1868
01:30:06,184 --> 01:30:08,052
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1869
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:09,854
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1870
01:30:09,887 --> 01:30:13,356
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1871
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:15,961
What video?

1872
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,795
Oh, you don't remember?

1873
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:19,662
Your friend Joe taped it.

1874
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:22,432
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1875
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,467
in the cold light of day.

1876
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:29,006
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1877
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:30,807
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1878
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,010
Anything.

1879
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:33,844
Aw. Don't cry.

1880
01:30:33,877 --> 01:30:35,613
Really, don't fucking cry.

1881
01:30:35,645 --> 01:30:37,581
Tell me what you did.

1882
01:30:37,614 --> 01:30:39,015
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1883
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,018
She dropped out.

1884
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:43,887
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1885
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,756
I did, too, to take care of her.

1886
01:30:45,788 --> 01:30:47,690
- The two of us gone.
- (sobs softly)

1887
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,926
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1888
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,628
Did you ever feel guilty,

1889
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,497
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1890
01:30:53,529 --> 01:30:55,032
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1891
01:30:55,064 --> 01:30:56,466
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1892
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,568
getting accused like that.

1893
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,537
Can you guess what every woman's
worst nightmare is?

1894
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:06,976
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1895
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:08,645
because everyone had forgotten.

1896
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:11,148
- Fuck.
- But I haven't.

1897
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:14,652
You're out of your fucking mind!

1898
01:31:14,685 --> 01:31:17,220
I was so sad to leave, you know?

1899
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:20,490
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1900
01:31:20,524 --> 01:31:23,193
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1901
01:31:23,226 --> 01:31:25,429
I might want to get
back into it.

1902
01:31:26,095 --> 01:31:27,631
Stop.

1903
01:31:27,664 --> 01:31:29,867
- You know...
- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1904
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:31,201
Nina was extraordinary.

1905
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:32,670
So smart.

1906
01:31:32,703 --> 01:31:34,203
- (chuckles)
- Help!

1907
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,538
- Weirdly smart.
- (instruments scraping)

1908
01:31:35,572 --> 01:31:37,740
Help! Help me!

1909
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:38,676
Fuck!

1910
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:40,810
- (shushing)
- Help me! (sobs)

1911
01:31:40,844 --> 01:31:43,012
I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1912
01:31:43,046 --> 01:31:44,213
(crying):
Come on.

1913
01:31:44,247 --> 01:31:45,682
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1914
01:31:45,716 --> 01:31:47,251
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1915
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:50,453
Even when she was
four years old.

1916
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:55,259
She was fully formed
from day one.

1917
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:59,128
Same face. Same walk.

1918
01:31:59,162 --> 01:32:01,097
And funny.

1919
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:02,497
Like a grown-up is funny.

1920
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:04,868
- Kind of shrewd.
- (crying)

1921
01:32:05,735 --> 01:32:07,805
I was just in awe of her.

1922
01:32:07,837 --> 01:32:10,274
I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1923
01:32:10,306 --> 01:32:13,277
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1924
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:17,146
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1925
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,582
Nina.

1926
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:24,587
And then she wasn't.

1927
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:28,292
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1928
01:32:28,324 --> 01:32:29,960
She was yours.

1929
01:32:29,993 --> 01:32:31,161
(whimpers, gasps)

1930
01:32:31,194 --> 01:32:34,564
It wasn't her name she heard
when she was walking around.

1931
01:32:34,596 --> 01:32:36,565
- It was yours.
- (sobs softly)

1932
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:40,270
Your name all around her.

1933
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:43,239
All over her all the time.

1934
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,640
And it just...

1935
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,880
...squeezed her out.

1936
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:52,648
(panting, sobbing)

1937
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:55,319
So, when I heard
your name again...

1938
01:32:55,351 --> 01:32:59,622
your filthy fucking name...

1939
01:32:59,654 --> 01:33:04,328
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1940
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,262
Or thought it, even?

1941
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,297
Apart from me.

1942
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,835
And it made me so sad
because, Al...

1943
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:17,840
you should be the one
with her name all over you.

1944
01:33:18,841 --> 01:33:21,045
No. No.

1945
01:33:21,078 --> 01:33:22,944
Don't worry.
I've sterilized everything.

1946
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:24,913
- No.
- I really would have been a great doctor.

1947
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:26,582
- You're insane.
- (laughing): You know what?

1948
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:28,185
I honestly don't think I am.

1949
01:33:28,217 --> 01:33:29,918
I'll do this
as quick as I can, okay?

1950
01:33:29,952 --> 01:33:30,953
(gasping)

1951
01:33:30,987 --> 01:33:32,155
(grunts)

1952
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,158
Stop. Stop!

1953
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,625
- Get off me!
- No!

1954
01:33:35,658 --> 01:33:37,659
- Just stop fucking moving!
- (grunting)

1955
01:33:37,693 --> 01:33:40,229
- Just stop, please! Fucking...
- No!

1956
01:33:40,264 --> 01:33:41,631
You...

1957
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:44,033
(both grunting)

1958
01:33:46,135 --> 01:33:48,037
(both panting, grunting)

1959
01:33:53,842 --> 01:33:54,877
No!

1960
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:57,079
(grunts) Fuck!

1961
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:59,681
(Cassandra whimpering)

1962
01:34:05,121 --> 01:34:08,791
(muffled screaming, sobbing)

1963
01:34:23,139 --> 01:34:26,175
AL:
Stop. Stop.

1964
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,976
Shit. Shit.

1965
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:30,011
(panting)

1966
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:37,386
This is your fucking fault!

1967
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:40,021
- (grunting)
- (muffled whimpering)

1968
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:42,057
(panting frantically)

1969
01:34:46,328 --> 01:34:48,064
Fuck it.

1970
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:56,404
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1971
01:34:56,439 --> 01:34:58,341
- (panting)
- (muffled grunting)

1972
01:34:58,373 --> 01:35:00,143
(muffled whimpering)

1973
01:35:00,176 --> 01:35:03,145
Fucking stop fucking moving!

1974
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:05,280
Stop fucking moving!

1975
01:35:05,314 --> 01:35:07,783
(panting)

1976
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:14,023
(grunting)

1977
01:35:14,055 --> 01:35:16,759
(muffled whimpering)

1978
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,028
Stop.

1979
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:26,768
(grunting, panting)

1980
01:35:40,283 --> 01:35:42,217
(brief, muffled whimpering)

1981
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,189
(panting)

1982
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:02,804
(bed creaking)

1983
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:14,815
(quiet, shuddering breaths)

1984
01:36:19,154 --> 01:36:20,889
(sniffles)

1985
01:36:27,296 --> 01:36:29,797
(sobbing)

1986
01:36:37,573 --> 01:36:39,908
(sobbing continues)

1987
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:47,315
(birds chirping)

1988
01:36:55,557 --> 01:36:57,891
(flies buzzing)

1989
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,405
(grunts) Whoa.

1990
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:12,373
What a night.

1991
01:37:12,408 --> 01:37:13,875
Ooh.

1992
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,277
The fucking nurse?

1993
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:17,546
Are you kidding me?

1994
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:19,481
Nice.

1995
01:37:19,515 --> 01:37:21,283
(voice breaking):
Joe.

1996
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:23,519
Al, Al, please don't freak out,
all right?

1997
01:37:23,551 --> 01:37:25,153
Anastasia's never
gonna find out.

1998
01:37:25,185 --> 01:37:28,789
What happens on tour
stays on tour.

1999
01:37:29,423 --> 01:37:31,292
(crying):
She's dead, Joe.

2000
01:37:32,327 --> 01:37:33,395
Come on.

2001
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:35,564
I'm not kidding.

2002
01:37:35,597 --> 01:37:39,067
(laughing)

2003
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:42,037
All right, I got...
y-you're being ironic.

2004
01:37:42,069 --> 01:37:43,104
What?

2005
01:37:43,137 --> 01:37:45,407
You killed the stripper
at your bachelor party?

2006
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:47,175
What is this, the '90s?

2007
01:37:47,207 --> 01:37:49,077
Al, classic.

2008
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:51,479
(laughs) Come on.
You want me to get her

2009
01:37:51,512 --> 01:37:53,280
out of here
so you can get some sleep?

2010
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:54,582
All right.

2011
01:37:54,615 --> 01:37:57,319
All right, honey,
time for you to go.

2012
01:37:57,351 --> 01:37:59,287
- Come on.
- (Al gasps)

2013
01:38:01,655 --> 01:38:03,625
(laughs)
What is she doing?

2014
01:38:03,658 --> 01:38:05,327
Hey, honey, come on.

2015
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:06,961
We got to go.

2016
01:38:07,962 --> 01:38:09,863
Honey, what are we doing...

2017
01:38:09,898 --> 01:38:11,599
Jesus fucking Chr...

2018
01:38:11,632 --> 01:38:14,069
- Fuck. Is she dead?
- (Al whimpering)

2019
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,539
Al, why is
the fucking stripper dead?

2020
01:38:18,573 --> 01:38:20,041
I told you.

2021
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:21,443
Well, how did this happen?

2022
01:38:21,475 --> 01:38:23,211
(sobbing):
I don't know.

2023
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:31,653
Okay. Hey.

2024
01:38:31,685 --> 01:38:34,922
Al, this is not your fault.

2025
01:38:34,956 --> 01:38:36,490
I don't know.
It kind of seems like it is.

2026
01:38:36,524 --> 01:38:38,592
No, no, no, no.

2027
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:40,894
It's not. It's not.

2028
01:38:40,927 --> 01:38:42,997
Am-am-am I...

2029
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:45,233
- Am I gonna go to jail?
- What?

2030
01:38:45,265 --> 01:38:48,103
- What about the wedding and-and my job?
- No.

2031
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:51,171
Anastasia's gonna be
so upset with me.

2032
01:38:51,206 --> 01:38:52,140
Well, no, no.

2033
01:38:52,172 --> 01:38:54,542
Al, Al, Al, Al,
it was an accident, right?

2034
01:38:54,576 --> 01:38:56,478
I mean...

2035
01:38:56,511 --> 01:38:57,978
Hey!

2036
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:58,945
It was an accident.

2037
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:00,913
I mean, of course it was
a fucking accident.

2038
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:02,516
Yeah, of course
it was a fucking accident.

2039
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,650
No one's gonna go to jail,

2040
01:39:03,685 --> 01:39:05,653
because no one's ever
gonna find out.

2041
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:08,655
If anybody asks,
we all saw her leave last night.

2042
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:12,059
She stripped, and then she left.

2043
01:39:13,025 --> 01:39:15,662
- She left?
- She left.

2044
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:17,532
Okay. All right.

2045
01:39:17,564 --> 01:39:20,534
It's gonna be fine, all right?

2046
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:23,537
We're gonna take care of this.

2047
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:25,340
We just got to get rid
of the body

2048
01:39:25,372 --> 01:39:26,707
- before the others leave.

2049
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:28,342
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2050
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:29,610
It's okay. Look at me.

2051
01:39:29,644 --> 01:39:31,311
This is not your fault, Al.

2052
01:39:31,345 --> 01:39:33,448
- (sobbing): Thank you.
- You did nothing wrong.

2053
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,417
All right. All right.

2054
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:37,652
You did nothing wrong.

2055
01:39:37,685 --> 01:39:39,421
This is not your fault.

2056
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:41,355
Can you uncuff me?

2057
01:39:42,623 --> 01:39:45,292

do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

2074
01:40:58,364 --> 01:40:59,632
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2075
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:02,336
It was turned off
before she left.

2076
01:41:02,368 --> 01:41:04,505
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

2077
01:41:04,537 --> 01:41:06,273
to know where she was.

2078
01:41:06,305 --> 01:41:08,207
(sighs)
But it-it's...

2079
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:10,243
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

2080
01:41:10,277 --> 01:41:12,412
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

2081
01:41:12,445 --> 01:41:14,247
Stanley.

2082
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,818
I... You know, she's...

2083
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:20,052
she was getting better.

2084
01:41:20,087 --> 01:41:21,587
She was, really.

2085
01:41:21,622 --> 01:41:23,657
- She was getting better.
- STANLEY: Yes, she was.

2086
01:41:23,689 --> 01:41:25,626
She... Of course she was.

2087
01:41:25,658 --> 01:41:27,728
She'll come back.

2088
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:29,529
You know how she is.

2089
01:41:29,563 --> 01:41:31,163
She always comes back.

2090
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,798
Was she seeing anyone?

2091
01:41:32,832 --> 01:41:35,135
Did she have a boyfriend?

Yeah. (chuckles)

2101
01:41:55,822 --> 01:41:57,390
That's very commendable.

2102
01:41:57,423 --> 01:42:00,460
Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

2103
01:42:00,493 --> 01:42:02,127
Sure. Yeah.

2104
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:05,096
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

2105
01:42:05,131 --> 01:42:07,634
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

2106
01:42:09,368 --> 01:42:10,770
Yeah. Yes.

2107
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,104
(clears throat) Yes.

2108
01:42:12,137 --> 01:42:14,274
- How do you know her?
- We were...

2109
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:18,176
We were seeing each other.

2110
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,179
Were seeing each other?

2111
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:22,716
We broke up a few days ago.

2112
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:24,585
Define "a few days."

2113
01:42:25,618 --> 01:42:26,853
Last Thursday.

2114
01:42:26,886 --> 01:42:30,189
Have you had any contact since?

2115
01:42:30,221 --> 01:42:32,492
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

2116
01:42:32,525 --> 01:42:35,828
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

2117
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:37,597
I'm sorry, what?

2118
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,832
Why?

2119
01:42:38,864 --> 01:42:41,568
Because she's missing.

2120
01:42:41,601 --> 01:42:44,136
Since when?

2121
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,505
Since Friday.

2122
01:42:45,538 --> 01:42:47,640
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

2123
01:42:47,673 --> 01:42:49,909
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

2124
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:52,243
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

2125
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:54,412
going to this weekend?

2126
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,653
She mentioned, uh,
the work trip.

2127
01:42:59,685 --> 01:43:02,220
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

2128
01:43:04,256 --> 01:43:07,594
(sighs) N-No. No.

2129
01:43:07,627 --> 01:43:10,261
I'm sorry.

2130
01:43:10,296 --> 01:43:11,931
That's all right, Doc.

2131
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:13,899
Between you and me, it, uh,

2132
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:16,569
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

2133
01:43:16,603 --> 01:43:18,203
Mentally, I mean.

2134
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:21,539
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

2135
01:43:23,274 --> 01:43:25,845
Yeah, she was...

2136
01:43:25,878 --> 01:43:29,347
not in a good place.

2137
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:35,287
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

2138
01:43:39,457 --> 01:43:40,626
Yeah.

2139
01:43:40,659 --> 01:43:43,261
Uh, she could've.

2140
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,363
She could've, yeah.

2141
01:43:45,398 --> 01:43:48,266
I thought that might
be the case.

2142
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,469
Thank you for your honesty.

2143
01:43:50,502 --> 01:43:52,371
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

2144
01:43:52,404 --> 01:43:54,439
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

2145
01:43:54,472 --> 01:43:55,841
you know,
for an official statement.

2146
01:43:55,876 --> 01:43:57,844
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

2147
01:43:57,877 --> 01:43:59,244
Thank you for your time,
Doctor.

2148
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,313
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

2154
01:44:22,534 --> 01:44:25,604

01:44:34,947 --> 01:44:36,247
We're the best of friends.

2161
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,550
We've been through
thick and thin.

2162
01:44:37,582 --> 01:44:40,586
- (quiet laughter)
- And-and I just love him.

2163
01:44:40,618 --> 01:44:43,421
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

2164
01:44:43,456 --> 01:44:46,725
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

2174
01:45:10,381 --> 01:45:13,018
Come on her ass and her face
at the same time.

2175
01:45:13,051 --> 01:45:15,020
- That's nice.
- (sighs) Unbelievable.

2176
01:45:15,054 --> 01:45:16,387
- Everything just turned out so nice.
- Yeah.
