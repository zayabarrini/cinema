worry you.

Why don't you have a wee drink?

00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,230
No, thank you, not just now.

180
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:12,452
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.

181
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,916
I am here to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl...

182
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,920
...as doubtless, the harbour master
has already told you by now.

183
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:26,007
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

184
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,802
Would you pass that
among your customers, please?

185
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,264
Now, if any of you can give me
any idea as to her whereabouts,

186
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,142
I'd be most grateful
if you'd let me know.

187
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,565
No, I've not seen her.
Have you tried the mainland?

188
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:47,153
No, I've not see her.
I've not seen her at all.

189
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,618
No, I'm afraid
nobody's seen her, Sergeant.

190
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,543
Thank you. Are these
harvest festival photographs?

191
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,088
Aye, we have one taken
at the end of every summer.

192
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,050
- What happened to last year's?
- It got broke.

193
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,260
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.

194
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,055
Willow, show the Sergeant
to the dining room.

195
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,100
Thank you.

196
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,397
It's disgusting.

197
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,276
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?

198
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,320
Aye, it's just most of the food I've had,

199
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:34,534
the farmhouse soup, the potatoes,
broad beans, all come out of a can.

200
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,539
Broad beans, in their natural state,
aren't usually turquoise, are they?

201
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,835
Some things in their natural state
have the most vivid colours.

202
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,881
I-I-I... just wanted to know why,
that's all.

203
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,260
Now, I wonder what
you'll be wanting for afters?

204
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,471
- I'll have an apple.
- No apples.

205
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,476
No apples? On an island famous
for its fruit and vegetables?

206
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,979
I expect they've all been exported.

207
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,481
You can have peaches and cream,
if you like.

208
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,317
Aye, from a can, I suppose.

209
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,111
All right.

210
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,491

Food isn't everything in life, you know.

Now, uh, Daisy,

289
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,951
will you tell us what it is, please,
that the Maypole represents?

290
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,627
Really, Daisy.
You've been told often enough.

291
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,421
- Miss Rose, I know!
- I know!

292
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,216
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.

293
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,387
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.

294
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,806
It is the image of the penis,

295
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,059
which is venerated in religions
such as ours

296
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,604
as symbolising
the generative force in nature.

297
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,900
Oh, can I help you?

298
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,946
C-could I have a word with you,
please, Miss?

299
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,242
Certainly. Girls, open your desks
and take out your exercise books.

300
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,916
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall
report this to the proper authorities.

301
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,544
Everywhere I go on this island,
it seems to me I find degeneracy.

302
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,090
And there is brawling in bars,
there is indecency in public places,

303
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,135
and there is corruption of the young,
and now I see it all stems from here.

304
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,637
It stems from the filth taught here
in this very schoolroom.

305
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,891
I was unaware that the police had
any authority in matters of education.

306
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,478
Aye, aye, well,
we'll see about that.

307
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,274
Girls, could I have your attention,
please?

308

Well, as you can see.

Excuse me.

00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,920
...which I would like you
to pass around amongst yourselves.

314
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,883
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there
on the blackboard.

315
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,942
Rowan Morrison.

316
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,363
That's her name.

317
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,076
Now, do any of you recognise
either the name or the photograph?

318
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,828
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.

319
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,165
If she existed, we would know her.

320
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,169
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.

321
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,882
Thank you.

322
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,020
The little old beetle goes round and
round, always the same way, you see,

323
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,191
till he ends up right up tight
to the nail, poor old thing.

324
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,737
"Poor old thing"?

325
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,533
Then why in God's name
do you do it, girl?

326
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,078
I'd like to see the school register,
please.

327
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,831
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.

328
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,708
This is a police matter.

329
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,085
I'm afraid you'll have to have
a search warrant or permission

330
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,713
from Lord Summerisle himself.

331
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,882
I'm afraid you'll just have
to bear with me, won't you?

332
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,072
You're liars.
You are despicable little liars.

333
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:06,076
Rowan Morrison is
a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?

334
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,705
And that is her desk, isn't it?

335
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,416
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know...

336
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,043
And you are the biggest liar of all!

337
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,756
I warn you,
one more lie out of you,

338
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,593
and I will charge you with obstruction.

339
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,554
And, believe me, Miss Rose,
that is a promise.

340
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,225
Now...

341
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,145
...for the last time,

342
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,981
where is Rowan Morrison?

343
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,192
I would like to speak
to you outside, Sergeant.

344
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,486
Girls, get on with your reading.

345
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,199
It's the "Rites and Rituals of May Day",
chapter five. I won't be long.

346
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,037
Well?

347
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:56,460
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.

348
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,797
If Rowan Morrison existed,
we would know of her.

349
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,383
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?

350
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,638
- You would say so.
- Oh, come on, come on.

351
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,349
She's either dead, or she's not dead.

352
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,685
Here, we do not use the word...

353
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,859
We believe that
when the human life is over,

354
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,863
the soul returns to trees, to air,

355
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,033
to fire, to water, to animals.

356
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,538
So that Rowan Morrison
has simply returned

357
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,165
to the life forces in another form.

358
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:39,503
Do you mean to say
you teach the children this stuff?

359
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:44,842
Yes. I told you,
it is what we believe.

360
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,386
They never learn anything
of Christianity?

361
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,180
Only as a comparative religion.

362
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,183
The children find it
far easier to picture

363
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,186
reincarnation than resurrection.

364
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,732
Those rotting bodies
are a great stumbling block

365
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,527
for the childish imagination.

366
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,112
Why, of course.

367
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,072
And may I ask,

368
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,158
where is the rotting body
of Rowan Morrison?

369
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,453
Right where you'd expect it to be,
in the earth.

370
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,040
You mean, in the churchyard?

371
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,961
- In a manner of speaking...
- No! In plain speaking.

372
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,883
The building attached to the ground
in which the body lies

373
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,177
is no longer used
for Christian worship,

374
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:33,265
so whether it is still a churchyard
is debatable.

375
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:39,313
But forgive me. I must get back
to my girls. Good morning to you.

376
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,503
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan,

377
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,591
"protected by
the ejaculation of serpents"?

378
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,078
- Morning.
- Morning.

379
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,081
I see you plant trees
on most of the graves here.

380
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,710
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?

381
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,045
That's a rowan.

382
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,631
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.

383
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,431
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.

384
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,976
They're just a wee bit late
with the headstone.

385
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,353
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.

386
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,606
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?

387
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,028
The poor wee lassie's navel string,
of course.

388
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:55,490
Where else should it be
but hung on her own little tree?

389
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,119
Where does your minister live?

390
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,787
Minister?

391
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,129
"Minister"!

392
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:18,096
What a silly girl you are to make
all this fuss. It's just a little frog.

393
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,516
It'll do that poor sore throat good.

394
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,643
Anyone'd think
you didn't want to get better.

395
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,229
Now, in he goes!

396
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,530
And out he comes. There.
Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?

397
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,700
- It tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.

398
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,329
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Which one would you like?

399
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:47,709
There. He's got your horrid old sore
throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?

400
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,795
Can't you hear him croaking?

401
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,381
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?

402
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,135
I doubt it,
seeing you're all raving mad.

403
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,488
Good day.

404
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,449
I'd like to see
your index of deaths, please.

405
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,618
Do you have authority?

406
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,083
No, I meant from his lordship.

407
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,417
I don't need it.

408
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,255
I'm afraid you have to get permission
from Lord Summerisle.

409
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,466
Miss...

410
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,803
If you don't cooperate with me
here and now,

411
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,890
you may well find yourself inside
a police cell on the mainland tonight!

412
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,809
Have I made myself quite clear?

413
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,646
Please.

414
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,239
Thank you.

415
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,534
M, M, M, M...

416
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,580
"Benjamin and Rachel Morrison."

417
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,790
Rachel and Benjamin...

418
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,837
- Names from the Bible.
- Yes. They were very old.

419
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,176
But there's no record
of Rowan Morrison's death,

420
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,429
which means, of course,
there is no death certificate.

421
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,685
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.

422
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,442
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.

423
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,404
How did she die?

424
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:46,328
I don't know. I don't know
anything about her. Nothing.

425
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,544
Thank you.

426
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,762
Are you Mr Lennox,
the photographer?

427
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,891
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist,
secondly a photographer.

428
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,852
I understand you take the harvest
festival photographs every year.

429
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,563
- The ones I saw in The Green Man.
- Yes.

430
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,690
It's rather humdrum work, I'm afraid.

431
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,151
What happened
to last year's photograph?

432
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,403
Isn't it there with the others?

433
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,865
No, no, it's not. Apparently it's been
broken or damaged in some way.

434
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,994
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?

435
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,997
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.

436
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:35,335
Mr Lennox, you were among the people
to whom I showed the photograph

437
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,629
in the Green Man.

438
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,257
Is that the girl?

439
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,718
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!

440
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:48,682
It was only eight months ago. Surely
you remember if it was that girl or not.

441
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,477
Thank you.

- Expecting me?

456
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,800
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?

457
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,011
In there, sir.

458
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,557
Good afternoon, Sergeant Howie.

459
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,727
I trust the sight of the young people
refreshes you.

460
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,064
No, sir, it does not refresh me.

461
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

462
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,528
One should always be open
to the regenerative influences.

463
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,532
I understand you're looking
for a missing girl.

464
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,534
- I've found her.
- Splendid.

465
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,204
In her grave. Your lordship is
a justice of the peace.

466
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,123
I need your permission
to exhume her body,

467
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,500
have it transported to the mainland
for a pathologist's report.

468
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,462
You suspect... foul play?

469
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,506
I suspect murder
and conspiracy to murder.

470
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,217
In that case, you must go ahead.

471
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,096
Your lordship seems
strangely unconcerned.

472
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,849
I'm confident your suspicions
are wrong, Sergeant.

473
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:22,520
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.

474
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,481
Religious?

475
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,359
With ruined churches,
no ministers, no priests,

476
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,737
and children dancing naked!

477
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,288
They do love
their divinity lessons.

478
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:43,917
But t-they are... are naked.

479
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,710
Naturally. It's much too dangerous

480
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,755
to jump through the fire
with your clothes on.

481
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,551
Wh-what religion c-c-can
they possibly be learning,

482
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,845
jumping over bonfires?

483
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,639
Parthenogenesis.

484
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,266
What?

485
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,897
Literally, as Miss Rose would
doubtless say in her assiduous way,

486
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,192
reproduction without sexual union.

487
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,611
Oh, what is all this?

488
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,990
I mean, y-y-you've got
f-f-fake biology, fake religion.

489
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,285
Sir, have these children
never heard of Jesus?

490
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:26,459
Himself the son of a virgin,
impregnated, I believe, by a ghost.

491
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,879
Do sit down, Sergeant.

492
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:34,175
Shocks are so much better absorbed
with the knees bent.

493
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,635
Please.

494
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,100
Now, those children out there,

495
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,519
they're jumping through the flames

496
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,564
in the hope that the god of fire
will make them fruitful.

497
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,524
Really, you can hardly blame them.

498
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,151
After all, what girl would not prefer
the child of a god

499
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,572
to that of some acne-scarred artisan?

500
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,366
- And you encourage them in this?
- Actively.

501
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,202
It's most important that each
new generation born on Summerisle

502
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,539
be made aware that
here the old gods aren't dead.

503
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,791
But what of the true god

504
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,043
to whose glory churches
and monasteries have been built

505
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,546
on these islands for generations past?

506
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,840
Now, sir, what of him?

507
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,010
He's dead. He can't complain.

508
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,930
He had his chance,
and in the modern parlance, he blew it.

509
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,190
- What?
- It's very simple. Let me show you.

510
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,694
In the last century,
the islanders were starving.

511
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,614
Like our neighbours today,
they were scratching a bare subsistence

512
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,075
from sheep and sea.

513
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:46,372
Then in 1868, my grandfather
bought this barren island

514
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,625
and began to change things.

515
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,920
A distinguished Victorian scientist,
agronomist, free thinker.

516
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,759
How formidably benevolent he seems.

517
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:02,013
Essentially the face of a man
incredulous of all human good.

518
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,515
You're very cynical, my lord.

519
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,602
What attracted my grandfather
to the island,

520
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,731
apart from the profuse source
of wiry labour that it promised,

521
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,609
was the unique combination
of volcanic soil

522
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,654
and the warm Gulf Stream
that surrounded it.

523
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,781
You see, his experiments
had led him to believe

524
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,408
that it was possible to induce here
the successful growth

525
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,453
of certain new strains of fruit
that he had developed.

526
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,791
So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal,
he set to work.

527
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,543
The best way of accomplishing this,
so it seemed to him,

528
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,129
was to rouse the people
from their apathy

529
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,299
by giving them back
their joyous old gods,

530
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,259
and as a result of this worship,

531
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:44,555
the barren island would burgeon
and bring forth fruit in great abundance.

532
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,934
What he did, of course, was to develop
new cultivars of hardy fruits

533
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,103
suited to local conditions.

534
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,646
But, of course, to begin with,

535
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,898
they worked for him
because he fed them and clothed them,

536
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,944
but later, when the trees starting fruiting,
it became a very different matter.

537
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,905
And the ministers fled the island,
never to return.

538
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,741
What my grandfather
had started out of expediency,

539
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,786
my father continued out of... love.

540
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,081
He brought me up the same way,

541
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:15,044
to reverence the music and the drama
and the rituals of the old gods.

542
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,298
To love nature and to fear it,

543
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,469
and to rely on it and to appease it
where necessary.

544
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,931
- He brought me up...
- He brought you up to be a pagan!

545
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,770
A heathen, conceivably,
but not, I hope, an unenlightened one.

546
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:39,861
Lord Summerisle, I am interested
in one thing: The law.

547
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,364
But I must remind you, sir,
that despite everything you've said,

548
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,659
you are the subject
of a Christian country.

549
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:54,542
Now, sir, if I may have your permission
to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.

550
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,670
I was under the impression
I'd already given it to you.

551
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,881
Ah, there's your transport.

552
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,301

meeting a Christian copper.

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,722
Little Rowan loved the March hares.

563
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,307
Hmm.

564
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,726
It's sacrilege!

565
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:41,065
Only if the ground is consecrated
to the Christian belief.

566
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:46,195
Personally, I think it makes
a very lovely transmutation.

567
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,241
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?

568
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,996
Miss, I hope you don't think that
I can be made a fool of indefinitely.

569
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,415
Where is Rowan Morrison?

570
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,004
Why, here she is,
what remains of her physically.

571
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,173
Her soul, of course, may even now...

572
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,509
Lord Summerisle!

573
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,721
Where is Rowan Morrison?

574
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,851
Sergeant Howie, I think that...

575
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,980
you are supposed to be
the detective here.

576
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,782
A child is reported missing
on your island.

577
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,496
At first,
I'm told there is no such child.

578
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,876
I then find that there is, in fact,
but that she has been killed.

579
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:46,505
I subsequently discover that
there is no death certificate.

580
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,800
And now I find
that there is a grave.

581
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,387
There's no body.

582
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,017
Very perplexing for you.

583
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,439
What do you think could've happened?

584
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:10,196
I think Rowan Morrison
was murdered

585
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:14,200
under circumstances
of pagan barbarity,

586
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,619
which I can scarcely bring
myself to believe

587
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,455
as taking place in the 20th century.

588
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,460
Now, it is my intention tomorrow
to return to the mainland

589
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,088
and report my suspicions
to the Chief Constable

590
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,882
of the West Highland constabulary.

591
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,718
And I will demand
a full inquiry takes place

592
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,013
into the affairs of this heathen island.

593
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,018
You must, of course,
do as you see fit, Sergeant.

you won't be here tomorrow,

of our May Day celebrations here.

596
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,869

Wake up, Sergeant.

631
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,825
- What time is it?
- It's past nine.

632
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,791
I thought you were gonna
come and see me last night.

633
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,669
I invited you.

634
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,797
I'm engaged to be married.

635
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,549
Does that stop you?

636
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,554
Aye. Aye.

637
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,432
I must say,
you are a gallant fellow, Sergeant.

638
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,894
It's nothing personal.

639
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,647
Just that I don't believe in it.

640
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,274
Before marriage.

641
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,110
Suit yourself.

642
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,862
I expect you'll be going back today.

643
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,990
You don't want to be around here
on May Day.

644
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,410
Not the way you feel.

645
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,505

Good morning, Sergeant!

684
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,894
I need to get to my plane.

685
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,773
Oh, well, on May Day,
I'd better take you out myself.

686
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,406
That's it.

687
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,243
Here, right.

688
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,082
I shall be back shortly
with some more police officers.

689
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,034
Have a good flight, then!

690
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,426
Hey, you come back here!

691
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,639
I said, come back here!

692
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,817
What's the matter? Won't she go?

693
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,071
No. Has anyone been here?

694
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,156
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.

695
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,076
If any of the children had been
interfering with it,

696
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,786
I'm sure I would've seen them.

697
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,580
I warn you,
you're obstructing a police officer.

698
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:12,209
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.

699
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,129
You could maybe get old Sam there
to row you to the mainland.

700
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,674
You'd be back in a week.

701
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:26,139
Well, I'll just have to find
Rowan Morrison myself.

702
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,506
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.

703
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,137
Mr MacGreagor,

704
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,307
I trust we aren't going to have
to let out your costume again this year.

705
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:56,229
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does
seem to shrink a little each year.

706
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,452
My friends, enough now.

707
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:15,665
We shall all reassemble
outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp,

708
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,044
and then process through the village
and the countryside,

709
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,379
down to the beach
below the stones,

710
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,424
by the route which has become
sacred to our rite.

711
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,428
This year at the procession's end,
as has already been proclaimed,

712
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:32,432
a holy sacrifice will be offered up
jointly to Nuada,

713
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,726
our most sacred god of the sun,

714
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:38,355
and to Avellenau,
the beloved goddess of our orchards,

715
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,734
in order that we may furnish them
with renewed power

716
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,362
to quicken the growth of our crops.

717
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,407
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!

718
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,160
Hail the Queen of the May!

719
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,002
Why, Sergeant,
I thought you'd gone back.

720
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:05,215
Mrs Morrison, I don't know
if you know it or not,

721
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,301
but Rowan is not dead,
they've got her hidden somewhere.

722
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,928
They?

723
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,849
If you know where she is, I beg you
to tell me now before it's too late.

724
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,476
- Sergeant, I've already told you...
- In the name of God, woman!

725
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,353
What kind of mother are you,

726
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,522
that can stand by and see
your own child slaughtered?

727
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,942
Sergeant, if I were you,
I would go back to the mainland.

728
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,153
Stop interfering in things
that are no concern of yours.

729
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,991
I am going to search every house
in this place during the next few hours,

730
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,035
and if anybody, including you,
stands in my way,

731
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,913
they'll be arrested
as accomplices to murder.

732
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,001
You'll simply never understand
the true nature of sacrifice.

733
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,297
Heathens! Bloody heathens!

734
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,636
- Yes?
- Take those masks off!

735
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,930
- No.
- Take them off!

736
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,311
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house

737
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,771
for a missing child.

738
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:34,304
♪ Baa-baa black sheep,
have you any wool?

739
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:39,601
♪ Yes, sir, yes, sir,
three bags full

740
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,150
I-I'm sorry.

741
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,545
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.

742
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,089
John Barleycorn.

743
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,299
What's in here?

744
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,178
- What's that?
- That's my costume.

745
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,597
The salmon of knowledge.

746
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,602
Hello. You're back early.

747
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,229
Where are the other coppers?

748
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,691
There aren't any.
The plane wouldn't start.

749
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,530
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.

750
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:01,743
So he spent his time instead
turning the whole village upside down.

751
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:06,456
- Just give me a glass of whiskey!
- No wonder he's worn out.

752
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,583
Did you find the girl?

753
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,420
No, well, I can't say
I'm very surprised.

754
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,382
I'm going to rest in my bed
for half an hour.

755
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,676
I do not wish to be disturbed.

756
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,513
I'd stay there until tonight,
if I was you!

757
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,724
We don't much relish strangers
around today!

758
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,193
He's asleep.

759
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,737
I don't like to use it on him, really.

760
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,615
The laird said we're to take
no chances, didn't he?

761
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:44,536
I know, but with the Hand of Glory
there's no telling when you wake.

762
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,871
- He might sleep for days.
- All the better.

763
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,289
Shh!

764
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:52,168
We don't want him butting in.
Go on, light it up.

765
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,986
That'll make you sleep,
my pretty Sergeant.

766
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:27,287
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.

767
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,874
You best get on ahead.

768
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,459
They've given you girls
five minutes start, haven't they?

769
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,752
Goodbye.

770
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,460
What's the matter with you,
MacGreagor? You call that dancing?

771
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,880
Cut some capers, man.
Use your bladder!

772
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,633
Play the fool.
That's what you're here for.

773
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:08,304
I suppose you've been getting drunk
at your own bar.

774
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,364
That's more like it!

775
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,451
Good, good!

776
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:51,801
- Chop!
- Chop! Chop! Chop!

777
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,353
Chop! Chop! Chop!

778
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,919
Everyone must go through, MacGreagor.

779
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,130
It's a game of chance, remember.

780
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,510
Chop! Chop! Chop!

781
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,877
It's Holly. Well done!

782
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,338
It's wee Holly.

783
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:18,554
- Now, my friends, to the beach.
- To the beach!

784
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:40,201
O god of the sea,
I offer you this ale as a libation,

785
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:44,747
that you may bestow upon us
in the year to come

786
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:49,210
the rich and diverse fruits
of your kingdom.

787
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,759
Hail, god of the seas!

788
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,719
Accept our offering!

789
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:12,316
And now,
for our more dreadful sacrifice

790
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,611
for those who command
the fruit of the Earth.

791
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,289
It's Rowan.

792
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,881
What's the matter, Mr MacGreagor?

793
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,967
Now, don't be frightened.
I'm a police officer.

794
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,678
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, please.

795
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:44,432
I don't like it here. They're coming.
You know what they're going to do?

796
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,935
I know what they're going to do.
Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!

797
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,649
We can escape through the cave.
I know the way.

798
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,572
Quickly.

799
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,964
That's the way out, up there.

800
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,393
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.

801
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,785
We seem to have lost
our torch-bearing friends.

802
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,371
I'm sorry. It was worse
than I remembered it.

803
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,846
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.

804
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:07,473
Dear little Rowan.

805
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:20,444
Rowan, darling! Come on, now.

806
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:47,555
Welcome, fool.

807
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:52,268
You have come of your own free will
to the appointed place.

808
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,896
The game's over.

809
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,899
Game? What game?

810
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:02,194
The game of the hunted
leading the hunter.

811
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,239
You came here
to find Rowan Morrison,

812
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:08,993
but it is we who have found you
and brought you here,

813
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:12,997
and controlled your every thought
and action since you arrived.

814
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,500
Principally,
we persuaded you to think

815
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,295
that Rowan Morrison
was being held as a sacrifice

816
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,089
because our crops failed last year.

817
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:24,717
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.

818
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,846
Oh, yes. They failed, all right.
Disastrously so.

819
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:32,308
For the first time
since my grandfather came here.

820
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:37,354
The blossom came, but the fruit
withered and died on the bough.

821
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,567
That must not happen again this year.

822
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,321
It is our most earnest belief that
the best way of preventing this

823
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,949
is to offer to our god of the sun
and to the goddess of our orchards

824
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:53,245
the most acceptable sacrifice
that lies in our power.

825
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:58,125
Animals are fine,
but their acceptability is limited.

826
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:02,254
A little child is even better,
but not nearly as effective

827
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,882
as the right kind of adult.

828
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,429
What do you mean,
"right kind of adult"?

829
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:18,354
You, Sergeant,
are the right kind of adult,

830
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,899
as our painstaking researches
have revealed.

831
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:26,278
You, uniquely,
were the one we needed.

832
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,614
A man who would come here
of his own free will.

833
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,408
A man who has come here
with the power of a king

834
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,536
by representing the law.

835
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,121
A man who would come here
as a virgin.

836
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,208
A man who has come here
as a fool.

837
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,379
Get out of my way.

838
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,992
You are the fool, Mr Howie.

839
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:18,497
Punch, one of the great
fool-victims of history.

840
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:23,836
For you have accepted
the role of king for a day,

841
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,714
and who but a fool would do that?

842
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:32,428
But you will be revered
and anointed as a king.

843
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,856
You will undergo death and rebirth,

844
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,941
resurrection, if you like.

845
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,361
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours,

846
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,864
but that of our crops.

847
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,034
I am a Christian,

848
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,078
and as a Christian,
I hope for resurrection.

849
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:02,666
And even if you kill me now,

850
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:07,880
it is I who will live again,
not your damned apples.

that I believe in the life eternal,

as promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

857

as promised to us
by Our Lord, Jesus Christ!

859

That is good,
for believing what you do,

860
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:53,193
we confer upon you
a rare gift these days,

861
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,487
a martyr's death.

862
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:58,866
You will not only have life eternal,

863
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:02,536
but you will sit with the saints
among the elect.

864
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:04,997
Come.

865
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,752
It is time to keep your appointment
with The Wicker Man.

866
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,713
Now, wait!

867
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:17,009
Now, all of you,
just wait and listen to me.

868
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:22,306
And you can wrap it up any way you like.
You are about to commit murder.

869
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:26,685
Can you not see?
There is no sun god.

870
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:30,522
There is no goddess of the fields.

871
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:38,238
Your crops failed
because your strains failed.

872
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:43,243
Fruit is not meant to be grown
on these islands. It's against nature.

873
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:47,539
Don't you see that killing me is not
going to bring back your apples?

874
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,460
Summerisle, you know it won't.

875
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,505
Go on, man.
Tell them. Tell them it won't!

876
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,423
I know it will.

877
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:01,678
Well, don't you understand that
if your crops fail this year,

878
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,557
next year you're going to have
to have another blood sacrifice?

879
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:09,561
And next year, no one less than
the king of Summerisle himself will do.

880
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,814
If the crops fail, Summerisle,

881
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:16,693
next year your people will kill you
on May Day.

882
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,571
They will not fail.

883
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:25,911
The sacrifice of the willing king,
like virgin fool, will be accepted.

884
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:29,373
But don't you see, I'll be missed?
They'll come looking for me!

885
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:32,126
There will be no traces.
Bring him up, Oak.

886
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,628

accept our sacrifice
and make our blossoms fruit.
