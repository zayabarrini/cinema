1
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:46,124
"Revolutionary Martyr,
Company Commander Wu Baili"

2
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:50,707
"Huzhou, Zhejiang"

3
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,749
Who's in your urn?

4
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,540
Baili.

5
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,124
Wu Wanli,

6
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,457
you little bastard!

7
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,582
I'll tell your Dad to kick your ass!

8
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,790
Liu Shaoazi,

9
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:30,540
This one's for ratting me out to my Dad!

10
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,791
Wu Wanli,

11
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:45,582
get over here.

12
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,207
You have a gun?

13
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,707
I'm so scared.

14
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:55,582
You're quite heavy-handed.

15
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,332
Does it ring any bells?

16
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,415
Let go of me!

17
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:07,874
Little Bun,

18
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:10,332
who am I?

19
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:12,707
Qianli.

20
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,791
Dad!

21
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,624
Mom!

22
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,582
Dad!

23
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,332
Mom!

24
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,374
Dad!

25
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,957
Mom!

26
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,416
Qianli...

27
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,415
Qianli came back!

28
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,041
Dad,

29
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,624
Mom.

30
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,665
Baili... is gone.

31
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,290
Baili.

32
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,332
Eat.

33
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:21,582
Qianli,

34
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,957
you eat too.

35
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:29,749
What are you doing

36
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,582
Mom.

37
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:32,624
In the army?

38
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:34,082
I'm the company commander.

39
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:35,665
How many people do you command?

40
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,374
About 150.

41
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,499
You're a high official!

42
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:43,457
Yeah, a high official.

43
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,415
I heard from Limpy Chen down the river

44
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,624
that the government
allotted us 0.39 acres of land.

45
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,499
In 1947

46
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,415
when we fought in Mengyin County,

47
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,999
I saw a house with a front and back yard there

48
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,541
with flush gable roof

49
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,207
and purlins.

50
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:03,790
The eave can accommodate

51
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,999
five nests of swallows.

52
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,249
Our family has been floating on the water

53
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,915
for generations.

54
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,040
When we build a house there,

55
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,249
the villagers would certainly
see us in a new light.

56
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:17,582
Mom,

57
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,165
here's my subsidy.

58
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,999
If we start building on February 2 next year,

59
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,915
we can finish by the beginning of winter.

60
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,124
When I come back again,

61
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,749
we can find

62
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:33,707
a good wife for Wanli.

63
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:35,999
You're leaving again?

64
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,165
You're still going into battle?

65
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:39,915
Mom,

66
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,124
the war is already over.

67
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,916
There aren't any battles anymore.

68
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,291
No more battles.

69
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,499
Show me your gun.

70
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,540
Let me see it.

71
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:11,873
Don't point the gun at anyone.

72
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,540
I told you not to point the gun at anyone!

73
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,999
Order from the Corps Headquarters!

74
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,916
Order from the Corps Headquarters!

75
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,457
Attention all!

76
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,082
Who's Wu Qianli?

77
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,040
Present!

78
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:29,415
Emergency!

79
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:30,665
Your leave is canceled.

80
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,666
Report for duty first thing in the morning.

81
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,624
Roger that!

82
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:40,665
Qianli.

83
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,749
Qianli.

84
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,249
I'll come back by the beginning of spring.

85
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,207
Okay.

86
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,957
I'll build the house when I come back.

87
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,957
I want to go into battle with you.

88
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,582
Baili said

89
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,998
he and I fought enough for our family.

90
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:23,707
You don't have to join the army.

91
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:28,457
Little Bun,

92
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,624
wait till I come home.

93
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,165
Go back now.

94
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,916
"September 15, 1950"

95
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,374
"Incheon, Korea"

96
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,207
Since July 7 this year,

97
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,665
U.S. General MacArthur,

98
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,707
leading Marine forces,
announced war on North Korea.

99
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,165
In sweeping speed, U.S. Air Force

100
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,416
carpet-bombed the total terrain of the enemy.

101
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:29,957
Victory is estimated in the
brief span of a few weeks.

102
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,749
This is AFNK.

103
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,124
Bring in the latest news from the front.

104
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,374
We're close to the Yalu River
southwest factory zone.

105
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,791
In position,

106
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,874
target locked,

107
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,082
ready to drop.

108
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:39,957
Proceed with the mission.

109
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,374
Copy.

110
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,999
Base control, this is Blade Team.

111
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,124
We are over the shooting zone

112
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,665
crossing the Chinese border.

113
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,124
All targets are open,

114
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:58,957
request action to be confirmed.

115
00:11:58,957 --> 00:11:59,832
Over.

116
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:01,582
Blade Team.

117
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,749
Just take 8 wings to the second location

118
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,666
Our mission is to cut off their supply line

119
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,957
by any means necessary.

120
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:07,749
Over.

121
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,957
Blade Team, copy that.

122
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,541
"Antung Chinese Border"

123
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,499
Enemy plane!

124
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,249
Enemy plane!

125
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:04,582
"Wolmido Island, Incheon"

126
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,374
Perfect photo op for the press.

127
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:28,248
Is this a part of
MacArthur's next presidential campaign?

128
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,416
You think he'll become president after this war?

129
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:33,957
He's already tried twice.

130
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:37,957
Not a chance.

131
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,999
Look, it's the puking bears.

132
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,541
How are you gonna get on the boat back home?

133
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,207
If you're gonna barf, do it out of sight.

134
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,124
Don't embarrass the regiment.

135
00:13:56,624 --> 00:14:00,124
You remember what our regiment
did in Siberia, World War 1?

136
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:04,207
And when we helped stop the Japs
in the Philippines in World War II?

137
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,374
Our legacy, man!

138
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,207
Don't worry, boys,

139
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,374
this place ain't no Normandy.

140
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,165
This was a cakewalk.

141
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,582
Let the 1st Marine Division
prance around for the reporters

142
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,374
and we'll show these leathernecks
what a real battle looks like.

143
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,291
We will take Seoul back

144
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,790
and make Korea whole!

145
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,040
And I guarantee you,

146
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,290
this will be a fast war.

147
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,999
God willing, it will be over by Thanksgiving.

148
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,415
General,

149
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:54,873
does making Korea whole

150
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,957
mean that American forces
will cross the 38th Parallel?

151
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:02,040
If this is the best thing for Korea and the world,

152
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:05,082
then God will lead our path!

153
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,874
Are you confident about this operation, General?

154
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,415
Have you underestimated Kim [I-Sung?

155
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,082
He has Stalin and Mao behind him.

156
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,041
I never underestimate my foes.

157
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,874
I have my track record.

158
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:22,248
A stellar 1st Marine Division

159
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:25,373
and the best damn generals and soldiers

160
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,332
on the face of God's green earth.

161
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,499
I believe we will succeed.

162
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,499
I reckon we will have this
wrapped up well before Thanksgiving.

163
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,457
General,

164
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,374
you read my mind.

165
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:03,416
"BEIJING October 4, 1950"

166
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,124
September 15 to 19,

167
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,999
over 70,000 well-equipped U.S. soldiers

168
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,665
landed on Incheon.

169
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,332
By September 28,

170
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,374
the Korean People's Army

171
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:17,915
retreated to the North of the 38th Parallel.

172
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:19,415
The more serious matter is,

173
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,165
MacArthur visited Taiwan

174
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,124
as early as July 31.

175
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,624
According to our reports,

176
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,290
the 13th U.S. Air Force

177
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,374
will enter and be stationed in Taiwan.

178
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,124
This is the biggest
move of the U.S. in that aspect

179
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,165
since the 7th Marine Fleet
put a lockdown on Taiwan

180
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,207
on June 26 this year.

181
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,541
This is a complete violation of

182
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,916
the statement that the U.S. government issued

183
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,832
on January 5 this year.

184
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,374
On October 3,

185
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,124
which was yesterday,

186
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,249
the 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Division

187
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,582
of U.S. Ground Forces

188
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,166
were completely assembled

189
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,874
and ready to head north

190
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,374
across the 38th Parallel at any time.

191
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:54,582
This completely crossed our bottom line.

192
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,541
Did you all hear that?

193
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:01,332
If they cross the 38th Parallel,

194
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,541
are they going to cross the Yalu River too?

195
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:11,999
In fact, by being stationed in Taiwan,

196
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,790
the U.S. army has already invaded our territory.

197
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,540
They are now assembling forces
on the Korean Peninsula

198
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,207
and threatening our national security.

199
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:29,207
"October 5, 1950"

200
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:32,290
<i>"3.00 AM"</i>

201
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,248
Uncle Peng.

202
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:39,748
Anying,

203
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,749
is the Chairman asleep?

204
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:44,832
Not yet.

205
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,207
Dad guessed you would be here

206
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,665
and told me to wait for you at the door.

207
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,041
"Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance”

208
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:54,457
Come in.

209
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,624
A number of battleships will be deployed

210
00:17:57,624 --> 00:18:00,124
to join the United States Seventh Fleet.

211
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:01,457
Chairman.

212
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:06,166
Meanwhile, America will strengthen its
military power in Taiwan.

213
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,707
Peng,

214
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,707
you're still awake?

215
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,582
What do you think about this situation?

216
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,957
I want to hear your thoughts first, Chairman.

217
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,165
The country is newly established

218
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,582
and thousands of things are waiting to be done.

219
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,373
If it's for our current situation,

220
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:36,499
I really don't want to fight this war.

221
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,415
But if it's for the future

222
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,624
and the peaceful development

223
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,374
of our country over a few decades or a century,

224
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,957
we must fight this war.

225
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,874
The foreigners look down upon us.

226
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,374
Pride

227
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:06,290
can only be earned on the battlefield.

228
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,749
I agree.

229
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:11,248
I support your decision to aid Korea.

230
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,332
I'm relieved.

231
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,374
Chairman,

232
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:23,623
I'm thinking,

233
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,666
we should have an army
on the eastern front as well.

234
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,165
It can be stationed at the Lake Changjin

235
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,624
to fight against the U.S. army.

236
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,749
Uncle Peng.

237
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:35,832
Uncle Peng.

238
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:36,665
Let me guess.

239
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,416
I know what you want to say.

240
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:39,749
Let me be your first soldier,

241
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,374
Chief Commander Peng.

242
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:44,165
You have two brothers.

243
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:45,624
One of them is lost

244
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:46,540
and still yet to be found

245
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,207
in Shanghai,

246
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:50,832
right?

247
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:55,165
Yes,

248
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:56,624
in Shanghai.

249
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:57,790
The other one is sick.

250
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
You are the only one

251
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,165
who can stay by your father's side now.

252
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:01,623
Uncle Peng.

253
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,582
That's why you really shouldn't go, son!

254
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,498
Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children

255
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:07,915
are going off to war on one command.

256
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,874
Why shouldn't I go?

257
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,582
Peng,

258
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,623
let him

259
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:21,957
go with you.

260
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,707
Right now, the most important thing

261
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,457
is that on our western flank,

262
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,874
I Corps with the 1st Cavalry and 24th Divisions

263
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,666
will cross the 38th and take Pyongyang.

264
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,373
Mother, this is Fortune 7 Squadron Leader,

265
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,332
heading 359-er.

266
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,874
We've reached our IP.

267
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,374
Beginning bomb run at Target "Cast Iron".

268
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,957
Time over the target, estimated one minute.

269
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,457
In the meantime, the current plan

270
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:25,082
calls for us to take the port city of Hungnam

271
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:27,665
and drive north-west to the Yalu River.

272
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:28,707
Keep in mind

273
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,374
we'll be separated from our forces
at the Lake Changjin.

274
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,582
The U.S. Army marched north

275
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,207
and crossed the 38th Parallel.

276
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,290
The Yalu River is right in front of them.

277
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,540
If we ignore them,

278
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,582
our domestic and foreign enemies

279
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,499
would think we are weak and gullible.

280
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:11,498
We are in the same boat.

281
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,790
The comrades of Korea are asking for our help.

282
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:15,999
Thus,

283
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,249
throw out one punch now

284
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,707
to avoid a hundred punches in the future.

285
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:22,915
I declare

286
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,749
to appoint Comrade Peng Dehuai

287
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,291
as the Chief Commander of the
Chinese People's Volunteer Army

288
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,707
as well as the Political Commissar

289
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:33,873
to lead the army on this operation abroad.

290
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,249
"Eastern Front U.S. Temporary HQ"

291
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,291
Gentlemen,

292
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,916
our tanks have crossed the 38th

293
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,666
and our enemies have been overwhelmed.

294
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,041
Seems to me that victory has been set in stone.

295
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,791
It's time for us to plan our next move.

296
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:22,957
General,

297
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,166
the Air Force has taken control of the air space.

298
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,791
The 10th Corps has taken Hungnam Harbor

299
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:31,790
and we're ready to advance the Yalu River.

300
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,791
Sir, did the president really order us to
proceed to the Yalu?

301
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,082
Mr. Truman doesn't send orders,

302
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,666
only suggestions.

303
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,582
So what about Communist China?

304
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,291
They've deployed their soldiers

305
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,040
and they're attacking our boys.

306
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,916
How should we respond to this preemptive warning

307
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:50,290
and their actions?

308
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,582
General Walker,

309
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,832
we command well-trained soldiers,

310
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:56,082
not peasants.

311
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,332
If we're to end this war,

312
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,791
we must strike while the iron is hot.

313
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,499
"Volunteer Army HQ Taeyu-dong, Korea"

314
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:10,915
Commander,

315
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:12,374
we received a telegram.

316
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:16,040
The U.S. mechanized forces continued to
head north at a rapid pace.

317
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,957
If this carries on,

318
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:23,957
the enemies will soon be right at our doorstep.

319
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,624
Commander Peng,

320
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:27,249
the U.S. 1st Marine Division has already

321
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,332
landed at Wonsan.

322
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:32,207
Their division commander Major General Smith

323
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:34,998
is leading their 25,000 heavily-armed soldiers

324
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:39,165
to assemble from the eastern front
toward the Lake Changjin.

325
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,457
They want to form a pincer attack

326
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,832
with their forces on the western front

327
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,124
to achieve their goal of
fully occupying Korea.

328
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:50,832
Report to the Chairman immediately.

329
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,665
I intend to gather our forces on
the western front first

330
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,624
to defend against the U.S. army.

331
00:24:56,874 --> 00:24:59,040
At the same time,
request the Central Military Commission

332
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,915
to send the strategic forces to Korea immediately

333
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:03,540
and block the enemy

334
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,415
at the Lake Changjin on the eastern front.

335
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:07,874
Yes.

336
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,207
Send a telegram to Commander Peng

337
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:13,290
explaining that Kanggye and the Lake Changjin

338
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:16,207
should be taken care of by

339
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,124
Song Shilun's 9th Corps.

340
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:21,707
Their mission is to lure the enemy in

341
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:24,040
and seize the chance to annihilate them.

342
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,957
How many Type 38 Rifles do we have?

343
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,041
Sixteen.

344
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:31,957
What about Sten 99s?

345
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,332
We got them all.

346
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,624
Bring them all back.

347
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:35,290
Yes.

348
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:36,623
Company Commander,

349
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:38,207
Yu Congrong is brawling with some people.

350
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:38,832
With whom?

351
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:40,373
People from the Artillery Battalion.

352
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,207
Don't move.

353
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:44,124
Speak louder!

354
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,666
I can't hear anything.

355
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,707
You just do not capable.

356
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:48,582
Get down.

357
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,040
Yu Congrong!

358
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,332
Yang,

359
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:54,916
what's going on?

360
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:55,832
Battalion Commander Yang said...

361
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:56,415
Be quiet!

362
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:57,498
Company Commander.

363
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:58,957
Battalion Commander Yang said

364
00:25:58,999 --> 00:25:59,874
the battle in Chenguan Village

365
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:00,707
caused the 7th Company

366
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:01,540
to have too many casualties.

367
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,749
It's no big deal even if we won.

368
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,290
If it wasn't for the Artillery Battalion,

369
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,957
we couldn't even enter the battlefield.

370
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:06,998
They should be

371
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,415
taking the credit for the victory.

372
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,582
Battalion Commander Yang,

373
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:11,123
our 7th Company seized

374
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:13,249
8 out of the 11 cannons
for your Artillery Battalion.

375
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:14,540
We supported you,

376
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,499
didn't we?

377
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,332
You are really something.

378
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:19,082
What a great honor to end up with
SO many casualties!

379
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:20,957
What did you say?

380
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:21,832
Wu Qianli!

381
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,748
What are you doing?

382
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,790
Attention!

383
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:26,290
Division Commander,

384
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,916
we are planning a party
with the Artillery Battalion.

385
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,290
Stop fooling around,

386
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:31,998
the Commander is here.

387
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,332
Attention!

388
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:39,582
Commander,

389
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:40,707
I'm Wu Qianli,

390
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,498
Company Commander of the 7th Company.

391
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:44,249
I've heard of you.

392
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,499
The hero of our 9th Corps.

393
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:49,040
Your 7th Company is quite famous.

394
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,457
People call you the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

395
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:52,457
The Corps' Party Committee

396
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,498
was supposed to issue a pennant to you,

397
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:58,082
but now it'll have to wait
until the end of the war.

398
00:26:58,499 --> 00:26:59,165
Yes!

399
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,499
Salute!

400
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,416
At ease!

401
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,541
Comrades,

402
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,124
I met a boy

403
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,332
here today.

404
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:16,999
He insisted that your Division Commander

405
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:19,124
allow him to enlist in the army.

406
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:20,832
The Division Commander asked him,

407
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,957
"Why do you want to be a soldier?”

408
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:26,207
He said,

409
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,124
"My Dad said

410
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:30,457
the Communist Party

411
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,332
and Chairman Mao

412
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:34,790
allotted land to our family.

413
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,332
But someone is here

414
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,165
to take the land away from them.

415
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:42,665
We can't let that happen.”

416
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,582
That's how it is.

417
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,249
We just triumphed over the entire nation.

418
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,124
Before we even had time to rest,

419
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:54,124
the imperialist U.S.

420
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,874
started a war with Korea

421
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:58,790
at our northern border.

422
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:01,915
They intend to spread the heat of war

423
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:04,832
to our newly established China.

424
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:07,415
What should we do?

425
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,582
Fight!

426
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:11,999
That's right!

427
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,582
Chairman Mao and Chief Commander Zhu

428
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:17,457
ordered our 9th Corps

429
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:18,499
to head north,

430
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:20,707
resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea,

431
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,457
and defend our country!

432
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,416
Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

433
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,041
Defend our country!

434
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,457
Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!

435
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,957
Defend our country!

436
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,665
Go, go, go!

437
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:35,707
Our troops will run toward the sun.

438
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:39,373
Standing on our motherland's ground,

439
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:43,040
we are the hope the people long for.

440
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:46,624
Nobody can shoot us down.

441
00:28:50,874 --> 00:28:51,499
Wu Qianli!

442
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:52,374
Present!

443
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,374
Bring the 7th Company back.

444
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:54,207
Yes!

445
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,665
He's the boy the Commander just mentioned.

446
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:03,040
He said he's Wu Qianli's little brother.

447
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:05,915
I'll hand him to you.

448
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,707
Yes!

449
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:09,207
Get in there!

450
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,624
How did you find this place?

451
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,416
I secretly followed you.

452
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,916
How did you find the Division Commander?

453
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,749
He must be a high official if he's in a car.

454
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,416
You stopped the Division Commander's car?

455
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:21,915
I want to be a soldier.

456
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,041
Do Mom and Dad know?

457
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:24,665
No.

458
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,291
Get out of here!

459
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:37,207
Go.

460
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:48,832
All companies to the designated location!

461
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,415
Load the supplies!

462
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,916
One, two, three, four!

463
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,165
Mark time!

464
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:09,332
141 soldiers should have
reported to the 3rd Company.

465
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,790
130 soldiers actually reported for duty.

466
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:12,332
The rest are on their way back.

467
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:14,207
258 soldiers should have
reported to the Artillery Battalion.

468
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,832
221 soldiers actually reported for duty.

469
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,082
157 soldiers should have reported

470
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,498
to the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

471
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:19,540
Commander!

472
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,915
Mei Sheng from the 7th Company reports for duty.

473
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,457
157 soldiers should have reported

474
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,915
to the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

475
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,707
157 soldiers actually reported for duty.

476
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:29,874
Fall in!

477
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:30,957
Yes!

478
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:35,998
Company Commander,

479
00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:37,748
I need to pee.

480
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,291
Report before you speak.

481
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:41,790
If you need to pee,

482
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:42,749
do it here.

483
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:46,916
Qianli.

484
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,999
Company Commander,

485
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,124
I can do it now!

486
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:54,749
Don't touch me.

487
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:55,665
Go away.

488
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:56,707
Go away.

489
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,832
You already left the army. Why are you back?

490
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,457
Someone might feel uneasy without me.

491
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:03,873
You mean me?

492
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,582
I read the newspaper as soon as I got home.

493
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:08,999
Luckily,

494
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,874
I haven't filed the paperwork for my discharge.

495
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:12,999
I rode the bike for 12 hours

496
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:14,416
to get back here.

497
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,373
You should give me a massage when we're aboard.

498
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,082
Sure.

499
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:20,749
What are you doing?

500
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,248
Wait!

501
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,832
Someone seize him!

502
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,874
Order!

503
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:31,832
All units on board!

504
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:33,832
All units on board!

505
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:34,666
Yes!

506
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:36,290
On board!

507
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:49,749
Wu Wanli,

508
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:51,874
get down!

509
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:00,832
This way!

510
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,290
Hurry!

511
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,082
Over there.

512
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,374
Company Commander.

513
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:11,332
Here.

514
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:13,249
Get up there.

515
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:14,624
Come on,

516
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,541
Everyone here?

517
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:21,373
Yes!

518
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,332
"The 9th Corps will head to China-Korea Border"

519
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:10,582
"after training and consolidation in Shandong.”

520
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,832
That new recruit will be listed
under the Artillery Platoon.

521
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,290
Make an entry and register him later.

522
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:18,082
No.

523
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:18,999
We are not short of soldiers.

524
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:23,040
His name is Wu Wanli.

525
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:29,165
Please instruct him.

526
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:30,790
We are about to go into battle.

527
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:31,915
How am I supposed to teach him?

528
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:32,915
Teach him the same way

529
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,290
as you taught me.

530
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,082
Teach him how to survive.

531
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,165
Lei.

532
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:46,874
You stay with Platoon Leader Lei.

533
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:00,082
What are you looking at?

534
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,290
Why?

535
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,541
Are you shy?

536
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:06,915
Why do you want to be a soldier?

537
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,207
So my brother will take me seriously.

538
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:10,707
What are you talking about?

539
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,582
You're only tough enough

540
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:14,915
when your enemies take you seriously.

541
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:18,790
When will I get my gun?

542
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,832
You want a gun?

543
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,832
Seize one for yourself on the battlefield.

544
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:23,623
Isn't that right?

545
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,040
Yes.

546
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,916
Congrong.

547
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,624
Ping He, take this.

548
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,707
Your daughter?

549
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:40,998
Eight years old.

550
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,124
Four plus four equals seven to her.

551
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,874
Why did you bring back all your medals?

552
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:53,957
You're afraid of losing them?

553
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,290
If I leave these in Shanghai,

554
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,707
my family will miss me so much.

555
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,916
My wife rode her bike for
over 100 li to send me off.

556
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,207
She cried all the way.

557
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:06,623
She asked me when I would come home.

558
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,916
My parents

559
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:10,582
didn't persuade me to stay at all.

560
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:13,290
I promised them I would go home by Spring

561
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:15,540
to build a house for them.

562
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,415
He's too serious. Stop teasing him.

563
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,624
Come on,

564
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,707
little brat.

565
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:31,582
Let me introduce everyone to you.

566
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:32,707
My name is Yu Congrong,

567
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,290
The 1st Platoon Leader of the
7th Interpenetrating Company.

568
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:38,873
The enemies are usually ahead
when other people charges.

569
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:39,665
When I charge,

570
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,291
the enemies are ahead,

571
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,041
behind,

572
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,416
and all around me.

573
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,582
How's that?

574
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,332
Don't grab for a weapon.

575
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,582
You must regain the respect you lost on your own.

576
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,248
The person I'm introducing next is

577
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,874
the Artillery Platoon Leader.

578
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm Lei.

579
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,041
Baili and Qianli

580
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,791
are all trained under him.

581
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,166
Remember,

582
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,249
in the 7th Company,

583
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,290
he's the daddy.

584
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,416
He's Daddy Lei.

585
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,499
Call him Daddy Lei.

586
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:18,707
We're going to battle again.

587
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,749
What are you thinking?

588
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:23,291
What about you?

589
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:28,582
The reoccurring fear of the battlefield

590
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:30,874
is just like what's written in the books,

591
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,582
the fear you feel as a new recruit.

592
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:36,207
It feels

593
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,582
just like that.

594
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:50,915
Stop fighting

595
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:51,624
if you can't win.

596
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:52,415
Let go of me!

597
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,624
I'll Kill him!

598
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,124
The one behind you is

599
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,540
our sharpshooter, Ping He.

600
00:36:58,332 --> 00:36:59,582
Attention!

601
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:04,249
Get back here!

602
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,957
Where are we?

603
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:09,207
The 7th Interpenetrating Company!

604
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,207
The 7th Company

605
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:11,916
isn't supposed to be like this.

606
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,999
Am I in the wrong carriage?

607
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,540
I asked Yu Congrong

608
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,916
to test his character.

609
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:18,290
Qianli.

610
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,499
They are bullying me.

611
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:20,707
Bullying you?

612
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:21,748
Fight back then!

613
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:23,249
They outnumber me.

614
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,457
All the enemies the 7th Company comes across

615
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,415
outnumber us by a few times.

616
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,665
Can you go tell the enemies

617
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,790
that they outnumber us?

618
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:47,623
We're now holding an enlistment ceremony

619
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:48,999
for Comrade Wu Wanli.

620
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,290
Salute!

621
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:00,540
At ease!

622
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,249
Yu Congrong.

623
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:01,957
Here!

624
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,248
You're a seasoned comrade.

625
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:04,707
Tell Wu Wanli

626
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:07,248
how Company Commander Wu Baili passed away.

627
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:08,999
Yes.

628
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,040
Company Commander Wu Baili

629
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,416
actively attacked the enemy

630
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,416
with a small group of soldiers at Huaihai.

631
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,624
After overtaking the enemy bunkers,

632
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,457
he passed away

633
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,332
while protecting his comrades-in-arms.

634
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:25,832
What did the 7th Company do

635
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,332
after he died?

636
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:28,582
The 7th Interpenetrating Company

637
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,332
annihilated

638
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:30,165
and took captive

639
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,499
the enemy soldiers that
outnumbered them by six times.

640
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:34,290
The enemy bunkers that were supposed to

641
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,957
hold up our troops for over a year

642
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:37,207
only held up the 7th Company

643
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:38,290
for half a day.

644
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,832
Our frontline lies

645
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,998
behind enemy lines.

646
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,124
We may lose many, but because of that sacrifice,

647
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,374
the entire army's casualties are minimized.

648
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:48,082
We shouldn't brag about this.

649
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,040
The most important thing is to hang on.

650
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:52,999
We cannot be careless.

651
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,207
The U.S. army we are going to face

652
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,582
has the best equipment in the world.

653
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:01,582
This battle

654
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,707
will be extremely arduous.

655
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,624
But we need to strive for victory.

656
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,415
Do you understand,

657
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:10,582
Wu Wanli?

658
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,082
Wu Wanli,

659
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:13,832
you are now

660
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:15,373
the 677th soldier

661
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,332
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

662
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:19,249
You might say,

663
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:20,707
"There aren't so many people.

664
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:24,374
There are only over 100 here."

665
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,457
We are counting every soldier

666
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,332
since the establishment of the 7th Company,

667
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,123
including those who have died

668
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:35,873
or been discharged from injuries.

669
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,457
And now you are one of us.

670
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:38,832
I'm the 135th soldier

671
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,832
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company,

672
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:41,790
Mei Sheng.

673
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,499
The 221st soldier,

674
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:44,624
Yu Congrong.

675
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,082
The 280th soldier,

676
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:46,957
Ping He.

677
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:48,915
The 335th soldier,

678
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:49,874
He Changgui.

679
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,915
The 572nd soldier,

680
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:52,749
Li Chizheng.

681
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,124
The 657th soldier,

682
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:54,707
Liu Zhiyi.

683
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:55,957
The 533rd soldier,

684
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:56,540
Ba Long.

685
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,291
The 565rd soldier,

686
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:58,998
Xuan Qiang.

687
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:00,124
The 162nd soldier,

688
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,124
Wu Qianli.

689
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,249
The 161st soldier,

690
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:04,582
Wu Baili.

691
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,457
The 17th soldier,

692
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:08,248
Lei Suisheng.

693
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,166
What about you?

694
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:11,541
Let me tell you again.

695
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:12,498
There is no need.

696
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,873
He will remember when it's time.

697
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:15,832
I just wish he would...

698
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,207
I don't wish anything from him.

699
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,124
Wu Wanli,

700
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,457
you're afraid the seasoned soldiers
won't accept you.

701
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,582
let me tell you.

702
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:24,499
You will only know whether they accept you

703
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:26,998
when you get on the battlefield.

704
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,832
An egg that's been cracked from the outside

705
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:31,499
is destined to be eaten.

706
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:33,998
If you can crack the egg from the inside,

707
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:38,332
you might be an eagle.

708
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,541
I have an announcement:

709
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,499
due to Comrade Wu Wanli's violation of discipline

710
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:48,207
and the disturbance he caused,

711
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:49,498
the original plan
for the weapon presenting ceremony

712
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:50,540
has been canceled.

713
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:52,498
Dismissed!

714
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:54,999
I quit!

715
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:57,373
You never wanted me to be a soldier.

716
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,124
Fine,

717
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,582
I'll leave!

718
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:01,832
Wu Wanli

719
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:02,373
Stop moving!

720
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:03,165
Don't stop me!

721
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,332
Do you want to die?

722
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:05,665
Stop moving!

723
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:45,915
You will stand right here as your punishment

724
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,332
until the morning.

725
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:01,874
Take this.

726
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:03,707
Your brother agreed.

727
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,874
Remember,

728
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,124
never point the gun at your own people.

729
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:17,749
You'll take the bunk on top of mine.

730
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:18,874
Let's go.

731
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:22,124
The Company Commander told me
to stand until the morning.

732
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,666
It's not time yet.

733
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,041
You and your two brothers

734
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:28,790
are all so stubborn!

735
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:51,665
Bun...

736
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:54,499
Bun...

737
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:57,249
So good.

738
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,124
So good.

739
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,374
Time to eat!

740
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:12,040
Hey, what are you doing?

741
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:14,540
Bullets.

742
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:15,874
Go away!

743
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:17,665
You didn't give me any bullets yet.

744
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,166
Where are the bullet heads?

745
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,915
I'll give them to you when we get to Korea.

746
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:51,623
Don't forget.

747
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:57,207
"Ji'an East Station Chinese Border"

748
00:43:57,332 --> 00:43:57,915
Station Master,

749
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,166
where did you lose your arm?

750
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,332
Jinzhou.

751
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:02,582
Squad Leader!

752
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,082
Cut that out.

753
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:05,624
What do you want? Out with it.

754
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:08,332
I heard it's extremely cold across the river.

755
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:10,165
That's all you're wearing?

756
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,124
Why didn't you change into
padded uniforms in Shenyang?

757
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,249
There weren't enough.

758
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,791
Otherwise, we wouldn't need to bother you.

759
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:19,665
This is all of the insignias and badges

760
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,165
for all the officials and soldiers

761
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,832
of the 7th Interpenetrating Company.

762
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:24,957
We are turning them in by order.

763
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,124
If you can stay for two more days,

764
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,874
the 50,000 padded uniforms will arrive.

765
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:31,040
Let me, let me.

766
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:43,665
The 7th Interpenetrating Company is ordered

767
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,207
to transport 20 radio transmitters to Korea

768
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:47,499
and wait for orders there.

769
00:44:47,582 --> 00:44:48,582
We guarantee that we'll complete the mission!

770
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:56,124
Wu Wanli,

771
00:44:57,332 --> 00:44:58,415
look.

772
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:10,790
U.S. aircraft!

773
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,290
It's a U.S. aircraft!

774
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:14,415
A scout aircraft.

775
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:25,999
Get on board!

776
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:27,040
Thanks, bro!

777
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:28,582
The padded uniforms!

778
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:29,624
Take the padded uniforms!

779
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:30,749
Yu!

780
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:31,582
Take the padded uniforms!

781
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:32,707
Let's go!

782
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:33,832
Hurry!

783
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:34,665
The padded uniforms!

784
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:35,457
Let's go now!

785
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:36,749
Hurry!

786
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:37,624
7th Company, get on board!

787
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:38,415
Get on board now!

788
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:42,748
Hurry, hurry!

789
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,332
- Where's Wu Wanli?
- Wu Wanli!

790
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:45,040
- Where's Wu Wanli?
- Hurry!

791
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:45,999
- Get on board!
- Is everybody present?

792
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:46,790
The 2nd Platoon present!

793
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:48,373
The 3rd Platoon present!

794
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:49,665
Company commander, look!

795
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:51,249
Take the Padded uniforms!

796
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,749
Hold on!

797
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,541
Padded uniforms!

798
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:55,748
Get back!

799
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,749
Don't come anymore!

800
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:58,457
It's dangerous!

801
00:45:58,541 --> 00:45:59,541
Catch them!

802
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,666
Watch your step!

803
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:06,124
That's enough! Don't throw any more.

804
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:07,915
Caution!

805
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,207
Caution!

806
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:13,373
Padded uniforms!

807
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,749
Catch them!

808
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,082
Thank you!

809
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:18,623
Take care.

810
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:19,915
Get back!

811
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,040
Thank you!

812
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:28,832
Qianli,

813
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,665
I saw someone who was killed by a bomb.

814
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,665
Without the radio transmitters,

815
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,541
we can't communicate with the central government

816
00:46:37,582 --> 00:46:39,207
or the frontline troops.

817
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,040
Just like if we don't have maps,

818
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,499
there's no way to fight a war.

819
00:46:43,374 --> 00:46:44,290
Commander Peng,

820
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,124
the additional military radios

821
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:47,749
have been loaded onto the train at Ji'an.

822
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:51,165
The 9th Corps is responsible
for escorting them to the volunteer army.

823
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,332
What about the cipher clerks?

824
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:53,498
They will arrive at the same time.

825
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:56,082
"China-Korea Border Yalu River Bridge"

826
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:10,707
Why did the train stop?

827
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,624
Track repairing ahead.

828
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:27,999
Rest on the spot for 30 minutes!

829
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,998
Take a 30 minutes break. Alright.

830
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,166
Comrades, time is valuable!

831
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,165
Come on!

832
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,124
Speed up.

833
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:02,290
Who is that?

834
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:03,915
Tan Ziwei, the 3rd Battalion's commander.

835
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:05,332
He's from our company.

836
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:06,665
He's the 160th soldier.

837
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:08,207
He enlisted at the same time as Baili.

838
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:09,123
Baili?

839
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:09,790
Yes.

840
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,874
He used to be the sharpshooter of our company.

841
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:14,957
An undefeatable hero.

842
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:15,874
Battalion Commander,

843
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,457
the Division Commander wants to see you.

844
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:21,166
Platoon Leader,

845
00:48:22,124 --> 00:48:23,207
are we there?

846
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:25,457
Yes, we just passed the Yalu River.

847
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:27,790
What?

848
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:29,207
The bullet heads.

849
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,916
Oh, that.

850
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,041
I'll give them to you when
we get on the battlefield.

851
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:42,374
Come on, come to the back with me.

852
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,749
They are all sharpshooters.

853
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,290
Who's better, Ping He or him?

854
00:48:57,999 --> 00:48:59,207
Who's better, your brother or him?

855
00:49:00,624 --> 00:49:02,374
Nonsense, I have two brothers.

856
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:03,165
Two against one.

857
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:06,290
What's that?

858
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:08,623
Not gonna tell you.

859
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,832
I've just spotted a troop train.

860
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:15,540
Wheelhouse, this is Summer 19.

861
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:18,249
We spotted a train loaded
with North Korea troops

862
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:19,832
stopping in the valley.

863
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,499
Get inside now!

864
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,874
All units get on board
and get equipped!

865
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:25,999
All companies grab supplies
and get off the train!

866
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:28,624
Decentralize and spread out in battalions!

867
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:30,290
Take cover and cut through Nangnim Mountains

868
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,207
and reassemble at the Lake Changjin!

869
00:50:33,624 --> 00:50:34,415
Take the radio transmitters first,

870
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,666
cipher soldiers get off the train now!

871
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,666
How are you on ordnance?

872
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,166
I've still got a few GPs left over.

873
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:42,998
Drop them on the train,
eliminate that target.

874
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,582
The other two twenty-sixes can return to K-2.

875
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:10,749
Wanli,

876
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,041
go grab the food rations!

877
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:22,707
Retreat!

878
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:24,165
Retreat from the train!

879
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,374
Retreat from the train!

880
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,999
Stop unloading! Retreat!

881
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:36,040
Hurry! Hurry!

882
00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:39,290
Shan, take some more!

883
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:39,707
Okay.

884
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:40,916
Wanli,

885
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,665
stop taking supplies, go!

886
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,207
Wanli!

887
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,082
Qianli!

888
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,624
How can you run
while carrying this much?

889
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:49,332
Toss them!

890
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:51,707
Toss them now!

891
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,082
You want to be the target?

892
00:51:57,291 --> 00:52:01,291
Heading 185, altitude 350.

893
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,874
Maries are armed.

894
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,624
Check the gears.

895
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,582
Instructor,

896
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:13,373
our radio transmitters and
cipher soldiers are fine.

897
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:14,290
Great.

898
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:21,457
The enemy planes
will patrol this area for sure.

899
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,207
There are few plants and
no shelters nearby.

900
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:25,873
The most urgent thing is
to find a place to hide first

901
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:26,749
and then continue marching in the dark.

902
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,248
After crossing this river,
there should be places to hide.

903
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,665
To make it fast,
this is the only route we can take.

904
00:53:37,124 --> 00:53:38,124
On guard, 1st Squad.

905
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:39,374
The rest take a break.

906
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:41,249
Wanli,

907
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:44,040
why are you keeping so many shell cases?

908
00:53:44,874 --> 00:53:47,582
Platoon Leader said he'll give me the bullet heads
when we get to the battlefield.

909
00:53:47,582 --> 00:53:48,498
He lied to you.

910
00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:50,165
This is just a bunch of useless shells.

911
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:51,540
Really?

912
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:52,749
Why would I lie to you?

913
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:14,624
Great marksmanship!

914
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,416
That's nothing.

915
00:54:16,707 --> 00:54:18,082
You haven't seen me skipping stones.

916
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:20,915
Did Platoon Leader bully you again?

917
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,082
When I first join the Company,
he bullied me a lot.

918
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:25,373
Let me tell you,

919
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,665
his right ear is nearly deaf
because of explosions.

920
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:28,873
I always scold him near it.

921
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:30,749
You should try.

922
00:54:36,832 --> 00:54:39,623
Such a liar,

923
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:42,499
hope you get burnt by the cigarette.

924
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,749
You bastard!

925
00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:48,499
Platoon Leader.

926
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:50,041
Company Commander is looking for you.

927
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:51,248
Wait for me here.

928
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:56,707
Apologies.

929
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:58,248
My mistake.

930
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,624
It's the left ear.

931
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:07,665
Don't be mad anymore.

932
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:13,707
You're really something.

933
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:14,623
Of course.

934
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:50,957
Each platoon shall
proceed in the 466 battle formation.

935
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:54,665
Protect the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers
in between the 2nd and the 3rd platoons.

936
00:56:32,832 --> 00:56:33,832
Fighter planes!

937
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,332
In which direction?

938
00:56:39,957 --> 00:56:41,165
Right ahead of us.

939
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:42,207
We don't have time!

940
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:43,040
Take cover!

941
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:43,666
Get down!

942
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:13,332
Don't move

943
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,124
or we'll all die!

944
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:54,499
They're back.

945
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:55,790
Did they notice us?

946
00:57:58,332 --> 00:57:59,415
500 meters.

947
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:02,582
350 meters.

948
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:05,332
200 meters.

949
00:58:07,332 --> 00:58:08,082
We can't shoot!

950
00:58:10,082 --> 00:58:11,415
With an altitude of 30m and north wind,

951
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,624
I can hit it.

952
00:58:12,874 --> 00:58:13,415
I believe you.

953
00:58:14,582 --> 00:58:16,582
But the other one will call for more fighter planes.

954
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,249
Damn it Dutch, let's call it.

955
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:26,749
I'm not seeing anything moving down there.

956
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:30,457
I'm starting to worry about
ice forming around my cannons.

957
00:58:30,457 --> 00:58:30,915
Hey,

958
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,123
you see those stiffs?

959
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:34,623
How about a gun run?

960
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:35,249
Haha,

961
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:38,124
10 bucks says I strafe"em better!

962
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:39,124
Alright!

963
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,957
They made a turn.

964
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:20,957
You owe me 10, Dutch!

965
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:21,623
Damn it!

966
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,165
Again, make it 50!

967
00:59:57,249 --> 00:59:58,540
How far have we gone?

968
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,124
We can't die here!

969
01:00:00,749 --> 01:00:01,332
Come on,

970
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:03,665
let's kill those bastards!

971
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,541
I'm gonna Kill you!

972
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:08,415
Come on!

973
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:09,707
The 1st and the 2nd Platoons, take the right.

974
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:10,832
The 3rd and the 4th Platoons, take the left.

975
01:00:10,832 --> 01:00:11,623
Follow my orders!

976
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:13,332
Escort the radio transmitters
and cipher soldiers away first!

977
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:13,957
Roger!

978
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:53,416
Groundhog 2, Groundhog 4, this is Groundhog Leader.

979
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,582
Form on me.

980
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:59,291
7th Marines TAC-P reported troop
concentrations South of the 25-Northing.

981
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:01,582
Solid copy.

982
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:04,290
Live targets this time!

983
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,749
Let's tear them up!

984
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,874
You got it!

985
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,166
How are the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers?

986
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:54,373
8 damaged and 12 still usable.

987
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:56,874
Luckily, the cipher soldiers are all fine.

988
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,041
A soldier should never put his gun on the ground.

989
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:29,457
What is this?

990
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:31,707
I'm not telling you.

991
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:37,040
Qianli,

992
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:40,249
Zhang Xiaoshan has died.

993
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:51,540
You'll experience things like this

994
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,041
very often in the future.

995
01:03:01,249 --> 01:03:02,249
Where's his hometown?

996
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:04,998
Yimeng Mountain in Shandong Province,

997
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:06,874
Linyi City,

998
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:08,498
Gu Town.

999
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:11,582
He is two months younger than you.

1000
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:30,124
Let's go.

1001
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:45,290
We might encounter enemies ahead.

1002
01:03:47,332 --> 01:03:48,540
Don't be a show-off.

1003
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:56,582
"Nangnim Mountains"

1004
01:03:56,707 --> 01:04:00,373
Sir, I am not detecting any
radio transmission activity here.

1005
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:01,457
Impossible!

1006
01:04:01,457 --> 01:04:03,623
With that many Chinese soldiers on the move,

1007
01:04:03,624 --> 01:04:06,082
they have to be communicating with each other.

1008
01:04:06,082 --> 01:04:07,540
I know they're down there.

1009
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:10,123
This is the last grid square we haven't covered.

1010
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,665
One o'clock. Fly lower to take a look.

1011
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:43,248
Wing 2, you take the east side of the valley.

1012
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:57,082
Open the door.

1013
01:04:57,457 --> 01:04:58,290
Sir,

1014
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,666
the wind is too strong out there.

1015
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,166
Open the door!

1016
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:16,457
Lieutenant, take us lower!

1017
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:18,207
Negative, sir!

1018
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,748
It's too dangerous!

1019
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:24,498
Lower!

1020
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,332
Give me the camera.

1021
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:53,165
Lieutenant, take us to the next zone!

1022
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:17,790
Stop!

1023
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:27,332
Company Commander,

1024
01:06:27,332 --> 01:06:28,665
there's gunfire on the other side of the mountain.

1025
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:30,082
Notify the Political Instructor.

1026
01:06:30,082 --> 01:06:30,832
Roger.

1027
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,707
Looks like it's our comrades.

1028
01:06:57,707 --> 01:06:58,873
It's our comrades indeed.

1029
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:09,666
They are pinned down by the Americans.

1030
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,040
The enemies are so powerful.

1031
01:07:17,457 --> 01:07:19,082
If we don't help,

1032
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,998
they won't survive for more than 20 minutes.

1033
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:22,915
You two keep going with the radio transmitters

1034
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,249
to Taeyu-dong.

1035
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,540
Make sure you arrive on time.

1036
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:28,082
Yu Congrong, Ping He,
and the 1st Squad stay with me here.

1037
01:07:28,457 --> 01:07:29,915
Give me one of your Artillery Squads.

1038
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:31,749
I will have 3rd Artillery Squad follow you.

1039
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,957
Let me join the fight.

1040
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:38,290
This is the first time we fight
head-to-head with the U.S. Army.

1041
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,916
I should be here.

1042
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,624
Plus, I've studied English for
two years by myself.

1043
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:47,832
Request approved.

1044
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:14,915
Fire!

1045
01:10:23,707 --> 01:10:25,290
Move back! Move back!

1046
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:45,332
Attack!

1047
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:48,873
Cover them!

1048
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,291
Where's my M20, goddammit!

1049
01:11:04,332 --> 01:11:05,040
Fire!

1050
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:10,791
Move! Move back!

1051
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:11,874
Move back!

1052
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:14,457
Go get the higher point
and take out the mortars!

1053
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:23,249
Attack!

1054
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,540
Ji Chungeng from the 6th Company
of the 172nd Regiment!

1055
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:35,249
This is Wu Qianli from the 7th Company,
the 1st Storming Regiment.

1056
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,874
Our mission is to blow up the U.S. signal tower,

1057
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:42,374
cut off the connection between U.S. frontline
and headquarters in Lake Changjin!

1058
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:45,248
The enemy firepower is too fierce

1059
01:11:45,249 --> 01:11:47,040
and we are suffering heavy casualties!

1060
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,832
Our dynamiter was Killed right
by the cowshed in front of the tower.

1061
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,124
Platoon Leader,

1062
01:11:58,332 --> 01:11:59,248
Wu Wanli disappeared!

1063
01:12:01,374 --> 01:12:02,082
Tell them to stop ahead.

1064
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:02,665
Yes.

1065
01:12:02,874 --> 01:12:04,124
Everyone stop!

1066
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:05,957
Is he falling behind?

1067
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:07,832
Like hell he's falling behind!

1068
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,166
That little bastard!

1069
01:12:14,582 --> 01:12:15,332
Lei,

1070
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:16,415
listen.

1071
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,999
These are reinforcement troops.

1072
01:12:38,624 --> 01:12:39,499
What should we do?

1073
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,374
We can't let them pass.

1074
01:12:41,749 --> 01:12:43,040
Stop them right here.

1075
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,999
Arrange for one team to escort the
radio transmitters and cipher soldiers ahead.

1076
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:49,665
Tanks have limited sight.

1077
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:51,332
We'll occupy the commanding heights.

1078
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:52,957
The tanks can't touch us there.

1079
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,498
The mortars need to concentrate firepower

1080
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:57,165
and take out their troop carriers first.

1081
01:13:10,374 --> 01:13:11,457
Why are you here?

1082
01:13:11,457 --> 01:13:12,373
Don't come up here!

1083
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:34,499
- There's another one, get him!
- Where?

1084
01:14:34,499 --> 01:14:36,915
Two o'clock, keep shooting!

1085
01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:15,790
Who told you to come up here?

1086
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:17,249
Get inside, now!

1087
01:15:23,082 --> 01:15:23,998
Yu Congrong!

1088
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:24,540
Yes, sir!

1089
01:15:24,624 --> 01:15:25,540
Let's go get the dynamite pack!

1090
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,332
Roger!

1091
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,374
Ask the rest to set the defense
and save the wounded!

1092
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:34,041
Hurry! Go there!

1093
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:05,957
Ye, the knife!

1094
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,499
Platoon Leader.

1095
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:18,291
Take cover!

1096
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:36,248
Fire!

1097
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:40,666
Ambush from the hill!

1098
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:41,791
Strike!

1099
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:45,082
Fire!

1100
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:08,207
Find some cover,
get me the positions of those gook mortars!

1101
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,082
Move! Move!

1102
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:14,041
Retreat! Retreat!

1103
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,124
Lure them up the hill!

1104
01:17:25,124 --> 01:17:26,415
Grenade! Hurry!

1105
01:17:31,374 --> 01:17:31,874
Go!

1106
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:35,666
Yu Congrong!

1107
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:37,373
I'm okay!

1108
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:40,541
Ah!

1109
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,166
Don't come over!

1110
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:05,957
Go!

1111
01:18:17,374 --> 01:18:18,332
I'll go divert them!

1112
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:19,332
Listen for my gunfire!

1113
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:19,832
Roger!

1114
01:18:28,124 --> 01:18:29,499
Watch your back!

1115
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,207
Instructor, problem solved.

1116
01:19:57,624 --> 01:19:58,374
Stab him!

1117
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:04,832
Stab!

1118
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,041
Stab him!

1119
01:20:36,124 --> 01:20:37,040
Yu Congrong!

1120
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,541
Cover me, I am going after him.

1121
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:34,415
Grenade!

1122
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:46,207
Come here!

1123
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:00,915
Crouch down and don't move!

1124
01:22:05,207 --> 01:22:06,082
Hurry up!

1125
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:07,874
Over here!

1126
01:22:09,499 --> 01:22:10,207
Stay low.

1127
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:16,082
Stevens!

1128
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:17,457
Nine o'clock, take them out!

1129
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:18,248
Got it!

1130
01:22:56,332 --> 01:22:56,998
Company Commander!

1131
01:23:02,207 --> 01:23:03,540
You stay right here and don't go out there.

1132
01:23:04,707 --> 01:23:05,207
Remember!

1133
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:06,749
Here's the grenade.

1134
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,707
Count to five and release it.

1135
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:11,249
Okay.

1136
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:16,957
Keep up the rate of fire!

1137
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:42,082
Get ready.

1138
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:45,457
One, two, three!

1139
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:27,332
In the air?

1140
01:24:28,624 --> 01:24:29,290
One more time!

1141
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:05,373
Yu, take your man and go blow up the signal tower!

1142
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:31,873
Yu Congrong!

1143
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:38,082
Hey Third, push up the embankment!

1144
01:25:38,082 --> 01:25:40,165
Push up, push up the embankment!

1145
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:41,332
Move! Move!

1146
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,707
Chaos Company,

1147
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:46,374
assault through the ambush!

1148
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:48,290
Tank 1-1 and 1-2

1149
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,749
push to the tower!

1150
01:26:36,707 --> 01:26:37,832
Go to hell!

1151
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:45,416
Go to hell!

1152
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,374
Goddamnit!

1153
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:52,707
My bow gun is jammed!

1154
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:08,415
Company Commander!

1155
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:46,457
Company Commander Wu, two U.S. tanks

1156
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:48,832
and a dozen infantry soldiers
are heading this way!

1157
01:28:50,582 --> 01:28:53,290
Yu Congrong, the U.S. tank we seized from
the Battle of Southern Shandong,

1158
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:54,499
do you still remember how to use it?

1159
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:55,207
Yes!

1160
01:29:08,374 --> 01:29:10,374
Shit, I can't see anything!

1161
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:12,332
Me neither, what was that?

1162
01:29:46,707 --> 01:29:47,457
Stop!

1163
01:30:10,499 --> 01:30:11,707
Hang on tight!

1164
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,165
I can't stop it.

1165
01:31:12,624 --> 01:31:14,582
Ah!

1166
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,166
You okay?

1167
01:31:36,332 --> 01:31:37,332
I am fine.

1168
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:38,582
Let's get out.

1169
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,457
36,

1170
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:09,749
37,

1171
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,374
38,

1172
01:32:11,957 --> 01:32:12,707
39,

1173
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:14,374
40,

1174
01:32:14,832 --> 01:32:15,540
41,

1175
01:32:16,416 --> 01:32:17,082
42,

1176
01:32:17,749 --> 01:32:18,665
43...

1177
01:32:53,124 --> 01:32:53,915
26,

1178
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:55,832
27...

1179
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:02,623
36,

1180
01:33:03,082 --> 01:33:03,665
37,

1181
01:33:04,124 --> 01:33:04,999
38,

1182
01:33:04,999 --> 01:33:06,040
39...

1183
01:33:18,374 --> 01:33:19,207
Attack!

1184
01:33:22,082 --> 01:33:23,207
Watch out!

1185
01:33:29,124 --> 01:33:30,249
Run!

1186
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,332
Shit, we gotta get out of here!

1187
01:33:46,332 --> 01:33:48,123
Go! Go! Go!

1188
01:35:36,832 --> 01:35:38,332
It's Daddy's fault.

1189
01:36:16,082 --> 01:36:17,457
I hope our next generation

1190
01:36:20,082 --> 01:36:22,332
no longer has to live through war.

1191
01:36:29,874 --> 01:36:31,582
Why didn't you abide by orders?

1192
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:34,082
How can you come here on your own?

1193
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:39,373
I want to be with you.

1194
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:42,499
That's your reason?

1195
01:36:45,457 --> 01:36:46,998
Because you're my brother.

1196
01:36:58,499 --> 01:36:59,540
Are you hungry?

1197
01:37:12,541 --> 01:37:13,624
In the army,

1198
01:37:13,916 --> 01:37:15,166
you must abide by orders.

1199
01:37:15,832 --> 01:37:17,207
Your comrades-in-arms might die

1200
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:20,249
for your mistake if you act on your own.

1201
01:37:21,707 --> 01:37:22,957
Do you understand?

1202
01:37:32,916 --> 01:37:34,332
Go write a self-criticism.

1203
01:37:37,207 --> 01:37:38,748
What's self-criticism?

1204
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:52,666
"U.S. Airport Hagaru-ri, Eastern Front”

1205
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,291
Hagaru-ri HQ,

1206
01:37:57,332 --> 01:37:58,748
Whirlybird 1, over.

1207
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,582
Go ahead, Whirlybird 1.

1208
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:03,166
Where do you want us to set down? Over.

1209
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:05,374
Go to Pan 1, over.

1210
01:38:05,499 --> 01:38:06,707
Received, out.

1211
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:15,999
Attention!

1212
01:38:16,124 --> 01:38:16,957
At ease.

1213
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:18,832
Sir, here is the report.

1214
01:38:18,874 --> 01:38:19,457
Sir,

1215
01:38:19,624 --> 01:38:21,082
General Almond is here.

1216
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:35,749
Attention!

1217
01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:38,207
General Oliver Smith,

1218
01:38:39,207 --> 01:38:41,582
what the hell is that airstrip out there?

1219
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,416
I'm building an airport.

1220
01:38:43,457 --> 01:38:45,540
Because it's essential if I'm gonna be responsible

1221
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:47,041
for all the lives here.

1222
01:38:47,082 --> 01:38:47,707
One coffee.

1223
01:38:47,749 --> 01:38:50,040
It's a fatal mistake to fight a war

1224
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:52,165
without the will to win it, period!

1225
01:38:53,332 --> 01:38:55,207
Take a look outside, General.

1226
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:58,666
Our soldiers are trapped between
hellish mountain ranges

1227
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:00,124
and freezing temperatures.

1228
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:02,082
And now, we have reports

1229
01:39:02,124 --> 01:39:04,165
of hostile Chinese in the Yunshan.

1230
01:39:04,207 --> 01:39:06,790
Your orders were to move forward!

1231
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:08,707
This is not gonna be the fast war

1232
01:39:08,749 --> 01:39:10,165
that MacArthur expected.

1233
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:12,165
This war is on a schedule!

1234
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:14,165
And your task is to keep it,

1235
01:39:14,207 --> 01:39:15,248
Smith!

1236
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:17,124
On the subject of tasks,

1237
01:39:17,624 --> 01:39:19,832
I'm the chief of this task force,

1238
01:39:19,832 --> 01:39:21,040
Edward.

1239
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,124
Where's the coffee?

1240
01:39:25,332 --> 01:39:26,623
When this all ends,

1241
01:39:27,124 --> 01:39:30,249
you are going to face the consequences.

1242
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:33,791
Yes,

1243
01:39:33,832 --> 01:39:35,540
we all will, Edward.

1244
01:39:36,499 --> 01:39:37,832
We all will.

1245
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:41,457
November 25,

1246
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:44,124
my men will be up on the western line.

1247
01:39:44,666 --> 01:39:46,249
And if you don't show up,

1248
01:39:46,624 --> 01:39:48,207
I will have you scalped!

1249
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:50,999
I will scalp you with my own hands!

1250
01:40:00,499 --> 01:40:02,457
One lump of sugar, sir?

1251
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:17,624
Ping He, Changgui.

1252
01:40:18,374 --> 01:40:19,457
Standby.

1253
01:40:19,999 --> 01:40:21,165
Standby.

1254
01:40:21,207 --> 01:40:22,165
Are you guys hungry?

1255
01:40:23,582 --> 01:40:24,707
Of course.

1256
01:40:25,207 --> 01:40:26,290
Bear with it.

1257
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:39,374
Our own people.

1258
01:40:39,874 --> 01:40:40,749
I see that.

1259
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,166
Senior Officer,

1260
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,499
the 7th Interpenetrating Company is here

1261
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:48,790
to deliver 12 radio transmitters

1262
01:40:49,124 --> 01:40:50,999
and 4 cipher clerks by order,
please check them.

1263
01:40:52,499 --> 01:40:54,457
Li, show the cipher clerks in first.

1264
01:40:54,499 --> 01:40:54,999
Yes.

1265
01:40:54,999 --> 01:40:56,499
Comrades, bring the radios in.

1266
01:40:56,499 --> 01:40:57,040
Yes!

1267
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,541
Guys, come with me.

1268
01:41:07,499 --> 01:41:09,332
Liu, take them to get some rest.

1269
01:41:09,332 --> 01:41:09,998
Yes.

1270
01:41:10,624 --> 01:41:11,540
Thank you, Senior Officer.

1271
01:41:13,999 --> 01:41:14,874
Wu, please come with me.

1272
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:15,790
Thank you.

1273
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:16,624
Let's go.

1274
01:41:20,082 --> 01:41:20,832
Ouch!

1275
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:22,999
You won't die.

1276
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:32,332
What are you writing?

1277
01:41:33,249 --> 01:41:34,165
Yu, Yu!

1278
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:50,416
Comrades,

1279
01:41:51,499 --> 01:41:52,915
let me read it for you all.

1280
01:41:52,916 --> 01:41:54,582
It's Comrade Wu Wanli's self-criticism report.

1281
01:41:55,457 --> 01:41:56,457
No, no,

1282
01:41:57,082 --> 01:41:58,998
it's a self-O report.

1283
01:42:00,582 --> 01:42:04,498
I didn't listen to Leader Lei's O.

1284
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:07,124
I went to O my brother.

1285
01:42:08,457 --> 01:42:10,165
I O. I won't do it again.

1286
01:42:13,499 --> 01:42:14,082
Political Instructor,

1287
01:42:14,624 --> 01:42:15,707
our little comrade is growing up.

1288
01:42:16,082 --> 01:42:16,998
Nice attitude,

1289
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:18,707
but there's no sign and it doesn't count.

1290
01:42:19,999 --> 01:42:21,040
Sign it then.

1291
01:42:23,082 --> 01:42:25,832
If you peck and crack the egg from the inside,

1292
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:27,790
you may have a chance to lay more eggs.

1293
01:42:29,207 --> 01:42:30,415
Get out of here!

1294
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:32,874
And you.

1295
01:42:34,999 --> 01:42:36,332
You little bastard,

1296
01:42:36,332 --> 01:42:37,582
who are you to make fun of someone else?

1297
01:42:38,374 --> 01:42:39,332
Comrades,

1298
01:42:40,082 --> 01:42:41,207
Comrade Yu Congrong

1299
01:42:41,249 --> 01:42:42,874
was so afraid that he peed his pants

1300
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:44,457
the first time he went into battle.

1301
01:42:44,499 --> 01:42:46,124
It was me who washed his pants for him.

1302
01:42:46,499 --> 01:42:48,124
I can testify to that.

1303
01:42:50,874 --> 01:42:52,957
Everyone, leave your ripped

1304
01:42:52,957 --> 01:42:54,915
or dirty clothes here.

1305
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:56,082
Change into these clean clothes.

1306
01:42:56,999 --> 01:42:58,040
Thank you for your concern, comrades.

1307
01:42:58,499 --> 01:42:59,207
You've worked hard.

1308
01:42:59,457 --> 01:42:59,957
Dachuan,

1309
01:42:59,999 --> 01:43:00,707
pick out three clean uniforms

1310
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:02,290
and take the cotton out
to make first-aid pads.

1311
01:43:02,332 --> 01:43:03,790
Share the rest with our comrades.

1312
01:43:03,832 --> 01:43:05,415
Wounded soldiers have priority.

1313
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:07,749
Yes, wounded soldiers have priority.

1314
01:43:10,957 --> 01:43:12,707
Working on that little house of yours again?

1315
01:43:15,582 --> 01:43:17,165
If I can't come back,

1316
01:43:17,249 --> 01:43:19,665
hand this to my parents.

1317
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:21,916
They can't read.

1318
01:43:21,957 --> 01:43:25,540
Ask the teachers in the village
to read it for them.

1319
01:43:26,749 --> 01:43:27,874
This is taboo.

1320
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:29,707
Change it. Cross it out.

1321
01:43:31,874 --> 01:43:33,249
You didn't have that little triangle

1322
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:34,290
on the diagram before.

1323
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,249
What is it?

1324
01:43:39,666 --> 01:43:40,999
I buried Baili there.

1325
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:51,624
Let me see it.

1326
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:56,207
This is nice. This is nice.

1327
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:01,040
Comrade, do you have enough to eat?

1328
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:01,791
Yes.

1329
01:44:03,332 --> 01:44:04,665
We have more here if you want.

1330
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:23,624
Yu,

1331
01:44:24,416 --> 01:44:26,874
how many Americans does one
have to kill to be a hero?

1332
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,041
Just two?

1333
01:44:30,416 --> 01:44:31,624
Add a 0 behind it.

1334
01:44:32,582 --> 01:44:34,665
I have to kill 20 to be a hero?

1335
01:44:35,957 --> 01:44:37,165
You are already a hero

1336
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:38,541
if you've been on the battlefield.

1337
01:44:39,707 --> 01:44:41,123
Who is he?

1338
01:44:48,874 --> 01:44:50,249
Are you staying at my house or not?

1339
01:44:50,457 --> 01:44:51,415
No.

1340
01:44:51,749 --> 01:44:53,874
You have no one at your hometown
in Yimeng Mountain anyway.

1341
01:44:54,832 --> 01:44:55,957
If you live with me,

1342
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,290
you can take Baili's room.

1343
01:44:57,999 --> 01:44:59,332
You can get married

1344
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:00,624
and have two kids there

1345
01:45:00,999 --> 01:45:02,457
with your future wife.

1346
01:45:04,832 --> 01:45:06,290
It looks like a pigsty.

1347
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:07,207
I'm not going.

1348
01:45:07,207 --> 01:45:08,207
It's good if it's a pigsty.

1349
01:45:08,207 --> 01:45:09,165
Lei,

1350
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:10,749
if you raise pigs,

1351
01:45:10,749 --> 01:45:11,999
you can live a good life.

1352
01:45:11,999 --> 01:45:12,999
Plus,

1353
01:45:12,999 --> 01:45:14,582
there's food and accommodation.

1354
01:45:14,582 --> 01:45:16,207
You'll live a happy life.

1355
01:45:16,999 --> 01:45:19,374
Fine, I can go.

1356
01:45:22,957 --> 01:45:24,040
Political Instructor,

1357
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:25,666
which one is Company Commander Wu?

1358
01:45:27,791 --> 01:45:28,666
Come on.

1359
01:45:29,999 --> 01:45:30,874
Commander Wu,

1360
01:45:30,874 --> 01:45:32,040
he is looking for you.

1361
01:45:33,874 --> 01:45:35,499
Hi, Commander Wu.

1362
01:45:35,499 --> 01:45:35,999
Hi.

1363
01:45:35,999 --> 01:45:37,249
I'm Secretary Liu from HQ.

1364
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:37,707
Hello.

1365
01:45:37,707 --> 01:45:38,248
It's been tough for you.

1366
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,124
It's my duty.

1367
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:40,999
But your company is departing again.

1368
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:45,457
We received a telegram from our superiors.

1369
01:45:45,457 --> 01:45:47,623
The eastern and western fronts will start
a general assault together.

1370
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:48,999
The superiors ask the 7th Company

1371
01:45:48,999 --> 01:45:52,290
to arrive at the 1100 highland in
Sinhung-ni of the Lake Changjin.

1372
01:46:00,999 --> 01:46:02,124
When should we leave?

1373
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:11,666
Attention, all.

1374
01:46:12,124 --> 01:46:12,957
In 5 minutes, we will be leaving.

1375
01:46:12,957 --> 01:46:13,998
Get ready for departure.

1376
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:15,124
Yes!

1377
01:46:25,749 --> 01:46:27,249
Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children

1378
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:28,707
are going off to war on one command.

1379
01:46:28,999 --> 01:46:30,540
Why shouldn't I go?

1380
01:46:32,124 --> 01:46:33,040
Peng,

1381
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:35,499
let him

1382
01:46:37,332 --> 01:46:38,832
go with you.

1383
01:46:48,332 --> 01:46:52,832
"The 9th Corps heads to Lake Changjin"

1384
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:28,041
"The 9th Corps Frontline HQ Chengfang-dong, Korea"

1385
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:37,082
"-31◦c"

1386
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:46,166
Order from HQ,

1387
01:47:46,624 --> 01:47:48,374
before we arrived at the designated location,

1388
01:47:48,457 --> 01:47:50,165
Execute standard radio silence procedures.

1389
01:47:55,207 --> 01:47:57,832
Did we send the padded uniforms
to the combat units yet?

1390
01:47:58,999 --> 01:47:59,999
No.

1391
01:48:00,499 --> 01:48:01,707
Without air supremacy,

1392
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:03,624
it's very difficult to guarantee logistic support.

1393
01:48:04,207 --> 01:48:06,040
Plus, our fleet suffered a bomb attack again.

1394
01:48:06,374 --> 01:48:07,374
Tao Yong,

1395
01:48:08,249 --> 01:48:10,332
we must find any means possible

1396
01:48:10,332 --> 01:48:12,957
to send the padded uniforms
to our frontline units ASAP!

1397
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:19,541
We can't let our soldiers freeze to death
on the battlefield.

1398
01:48:21,416 --> 01:48:23,999
How many days will our food ration last?

1399
01:48:23,999 --> 01:48:25,582
If we eat one potato a day,

1400
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:27,332
it would last us to Sinhung-ni at the most.

1401
01:48:27,332 --> 01:48:29,957
We should find a way to save some

1402
01:48:29,957 --> 01:48:31,498
for the wounded soldiers.

1403
01:48:32,749 --> 01:48:34,124
Take these potatoes.

1404
01:48:34,249 --> 01:48:34,915
Okay.

1405
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:35,916
Take them.

1406
01:48:37,999 --> 01:48:41,624
"November 23, 1950"

1407
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:51,207
No cutting, wait your turn.

1408
01:49:02,832 --> 01:49:04,082
Get out of here.

1409
01:49:04,124 --> 01:49:05,874
Come on... I just want bacon.

1410
01:49:17,332 --> 01:49:18,415
Pass them.

1411
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:43,207
Here's a soft one.

1412
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:54,582
So much for Donald Duck home by Thanksgiving.

1413
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:56,832
He sent his Christmas wish list instead.

1414
01:49:57,207 --> 01:50:01,082
I don't have a goddamn thing
to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

1415
01:50:02,874 --> 01:50:04,124
That's some list,

1416
01:50:04,582 --> 01:50:06,665
but all I want to do is go home.

1417
01:50:26,999 --> 01:50:28,082
Qianli,

1418
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:31,499
can I ask why you always bullied me
when I was little?

1419
01:50:33,416 --> 01:50:34,499
Did 1?

1420
01:50:35,249 --> 01:50:36,499
Yeah.

1421
01:50:38,749 --> 01:50:39,999
Mom used to give me

1422
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:42,291
all the good things to eat.

1423
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:44,666
Once you were born,

1424
01:50:45,707 --> 01:50:46,957
that wasn't for me.

1425
01:51:05,374 --> 01:51:06,499
Ping He,

1426
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:08,874
<i>do you still want to tell the truth about Bail?</i>

1427
01:51:13,957 --> 01:51:15,957
Keep it in your heart.

1428
01:51:31,082 --> 01:51:32,790
Watch it, old man.

1429
01:51:48,666 --> 01:51:50,791
Sir, we have news from the Air Force.

1430
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,291
My family makes cheese broccoli for Thanksgiving,

1431
01:51:57,332 --> 01:51:59,290
you want to come and join us next year at home?

1432
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:00,999
I will, man.

1433
01:52:01,332 --> 01:52:02,915
If we make it home.

1434
01:52:03,832 --> 01:52:04,540
Attention!

1435
01:52:04,916 --> 01:52:05,624
At ease.

1436
01:52:06,749 --> 01:52:07,624
Sir.

1437
01:52:12,999 --> 01:52:14,332
With no signs of our enemy,

1438
01:52:14,374 --> 01:52:16,957
our pilots reported there
was signal interference

1439
01:52:16,957 --> 01:52:19,040
every time they flew over this area.

1440
01:52:21,082 --> 01:52:21,665
Here?

1441
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:22,749
Yes, sir.

1442
01:52:38,249 --> 01:52:40,332
"November 25, 1950"

1443
01:52:41,041 --> 01:52:41,999
I don't believe it!

1444
01:52:41,999 --> 01:52:42,749
You have to leave!

1445
01:52:42,874 --> 01:52:43,707
Deng Hua!

1446
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:46,416
Shut off the radios!

1447
01:52:46,457 --> 01:52:46,915
Yes!

1448
01:52:46,916 --> 01:52:47,999
Shut off all the radios!

1449
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:49,791
Gao Ruixin!

1450
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:50,291
Here!

1451
01:52:50,291 --> 01:52:51,124
Did you bring the map?

1452
01:52:51,124 --> 01:52:51,749
Yes.

1453
01:52:51,832 --> 01:52:52,332
Let's go.

1454
01:52:52,457 --> 01:52:53,498
The enemy planes are here!

1455
01:52:53,499 --> 01:52:54,832
- Retreat immediately!
- Hurry!

1456
01:52:58,291 --> 01:52:59,624
Get into the air-raid shelter!

1457
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:01,124
Hurry!

1458
01:53:01,332 --> 01:53:01,790
Hurry!

1459
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:03,624
- Boy.
- Hurry!

1460
01:53:03,624 --> 01:53:04,457
Those in the back, keep up!

1461
01:53:04,457 --> 01:53:05,082
Coming!

1462
01:53:07,082 --> 01:53:09,582
Hurry, keep up!

1463
01:53:10,749 --> 01:53:11,457
What's wrong?

1464
01:53:11,457 --> 01:53:12,498
Hurry, hurry!

1465
01:53:12,499 --> 01:53:13,915
There's still a map on the wall.

1466
01:53:13,916 --> 01:53:15,499
We don't have a lot of large-scale maps.

1467
01:53:15,499 --> 01:53:16,457
Take this!

1468
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:24,416
Second Squad,

1469
01:53:24,957 --> 01:53:26,540
proceed with the mission.

1470
01:54:39,707 --> 01:54:40,665
Commander,

1471
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,957
we lost communication with Taeyu-dong.

1472
01:54:57,916 --> 01:54:59,041
Chief Commander Peng,

1473
01:54:59,582 --> 01:55:01,332
these were left behind by the martyr,

1474
01:55:01,749 --> 01:55:02,957
Secretary Liu.

1475
01:55:45,624 --> 01:55:46,832
Deputy Commander Deng,

1476
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:49,374
we don't have any info about Secretary Liu.

1477
01:55:49,832 --> 01:55:51,082
Who was he?

1478
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:52,416
What was his full name?

1479
01:55:57,416 --> 01:55:58,499
Deng Hua.

1480
01:55:59,499 --> 01:56:00,790
The day after tomorrow,

1481
01:56:00,957 --> 01:56:04,165
which is November 27, 1950,

1482
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:07,166
the 9th Corps will begin their general assault
at the Lake Changjin.

1483
01:56:07,166 --> 01:56:08,416
Do they...

1484
01:56:09,041 --> 01:56:10,957
Do they know what to do?

1485
01:56:12,374 --> 01:56:13,457
Yes.

1486
01:56:14,749 --> 01:56:16,832
Give me a new command post!

1487
01:56:17,207 --> 01:56:18,415
Yes!

1488
01:56:40,582 --> 01:56:44,707
Currently... the 38th, 39th, and 40th Corps

1489
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:47,165
have already assembled at the Chongchon River.

1490
01:56:47,916 --> 01:56:51,499
You must complete deployment at the
Lake Changjin war zone quickly.

1491
01:56:51,499 --> 01:56:53,582
In two days,
the eastern and western fronts will begin

1492
01:56:53,582 --> 01:56:55,457
their general assault at the same time.

1493
01:56:55,457 --> 01:56:58,332
Song Shilun, remember.

1494
01:56:58,332 --> 01:56:59,415
Remember!

1495
01:56:59,416 --> 01:57:01,332
Strike them as hard as you can!

1496
01:57:05,332 --> 01:57:07,248
The 20th Corps shall separate
and surround the enemies

1497
01:57:07,249 --> 01:57:09,707
in Koto-ri, Yudam-ni, and Hagaru-ri.

1498
01:57:09,707 --> 01:57:11,665
Make sure the 27th Corps focuses their firepower

1499
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:13,457
to annihilate the U.S. army in Sinhung-ni.

1500
01:57:13,499 --> 01:57:13,957
Yes!

1501
01:57:14,374 --> 01:57:16,457
After the 27th Corps destroys
two large clusters of enemies,

1502
01:57:16,541 --> 01:57:18,249
immediately destroy the airport in Hagaru-ri

1503
01:57:18,249 --> 01:57:19,332
and cut off the enemy's aerial communication.

1504
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:19,998
Yes.

1505
01:57:19,999 --> 01:57:22,790
Meanwhile, stop the enemies
from reinforcing the north.

1506
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:23,332
Yes.

1507
01:57:23,332 --> 01:57:25,457
Where is the 27th Corps right now?

1508
01:57:25,457 --> 01:57:26,873
They've already reached the designated location.

1509
01:57:27,332 --> 01:57:30,457
Command the 27th Corps to take cover and stand by

1510
01:57:30,707 --> 01:57:32,748
so that we can prevent the enemy
from escaping south

1511
01:57:32,749 --> 01:57:34,207
Where is the 26th Corps now?

1512
01:57:34,207 --> 01:57:35,540
According to the original plan,

1513
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:37,332
they are 100 kilometers outside of Koto-ri.

1514
01:57:37,332 --> 01:57:38,415
Command the 26th Corps to

1515
01:57:38,416 --> 01:57:40,541
immediately march 50 kilometers
towards Lake Changjin.

1516
01:57:40,541 --> 01:57:41,374
Yes.

1517
01:57:42,416 --> 01:57:45,207
The 20th and 27th Corps
immediately get ready for the battle

1518
01:57:45,207 --> 01:57:47,040
and act simultaneously with the western front.

1519
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:49,666
Begin the general assault

1520
01:57:49,666 --> 01:57:50,707
at 4:30 pm on the 27th!

1521
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:52,249
Yes!

1522
01:58:06,291 --> 01:58:08,457
What is the lowest temperature tonight?

1523
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,624
40°c below zero.

1524
01:58:16,332 --> 01:58:19,207
We are not only fighting against the Americans.

1525
01:58:20,707 --> 01:58:23,123
We are also fighting against God.

1526
01:58:26,916 --> 01:58:30,166
General, we have reports of
Chinese attacking in division strength

1527
01:58:30,166 --> 01:58:31,999
in both Tokchon and Nyongwon.

1528
01:58:33,207 --> 01:58:35,915
That's far more than G2 has estimated.

1529
01:58:36,166 --> 01:58:38,874
Four other outfits are
also being decisively engaged.

1530
01:58:38,999 --> 01:58:41,499
The entire front is under heavy attack, sir.

1531
01:58:43,124 --> 01:58:44,624
Where do they come from?

1532
01:58:44,624 --> 01:58:47,415
Do they fall out of the goddamn sky?

1533
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:50,582
We don't know sir, but the reports are pouring in.

1534
01:58:54,874 --> 01:58:59,124
"Lake Changjin, Eastern Front"

1535
01:59:23,124 --> 01:59:24,707
Move, move, move!

1536
01:59:26,707 --> 01:59:28,790
Hey, get more light in there!

1537
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:37,791
"The 9th Company of the Volunteer Army"

1538
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:42,666
Did we receive a command?

1539
01:59:51,457 --> 01:59:52,082
You there

1540
01:59:52,166 --> 01:59:52,749
Pick up your feet

1541
01:59:52,749 --> 01:59:53,582
Hustle up!

1542
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:56,832
Get those crates over here!

1543
01:59:56,832 --> 01:59:57,457
Move faster!

1544
01:59:57,457 --> 01:59:58,415
Get some more!

1545
01:59:58,874 --> 01:59:59,540
Right there!

1546
01:59:59,541 --> 02:00:00,874
Stack them up boys!

1547
02:00:01,582 --> 02:00:02,998
Come on, pick it up!

1548
02:00:02,999 --> 02:00:03,999
Hurry up!

1549
02:00:04,207 --> 02:00:06,457
No, I don't see any sign of enemy.

1550
02:00:07,207 --> 02:00:09,582
Damn soldier, this ain't North Korea.

1551
02:00:09,582 --> 02:00:11,082
This is the North Pole.

1552
02:00:19,624 --> 02:00:23,790
"The 7th Company of the Volunteer Army"

1553
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:37,249
Let me hold that for a while.

1554
02:00:42,374 --> 02:00:43,832
What are they singing?

1555
02:00:48,499 --> 02:00:49,457
Don't fall asleep.

1556
02:00:49,457 --> 02:00:50,415
Wake up.

1557
02:00:59,957 --> 02:01:03,915
Merry Christmas.

1558
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:05,124
What does that mean?

1559
02:01:05,457 --> 02:01:07,665
It's an American holiday
that happens before the New Year.

1560
02:01:07,666 --> 02:01:08,541
It's called Christmas.

1561
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:11,207
What is it?

1562
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:13,166
To be so happy.

1563
02:01:13,457 --> 02:01:15,540
Their lives aren't so merry after all.

1564
02:01:16,124 --> 02:01:18,332
That MacArthur even said they were going to

1565
02:01:18,666 --> 02:01:20,374
cross the Yalu River before the New Year

1566
02:01:20,832 --> 02:01:22,582
so their soldiers could go home for the holiday.

1567
02:01:22,582 --> 02:01:23,915
Bullshit,

1568
02:01:24,124 --> 02:01:25,832
they want to go home for the holiday?

1569
02:01:26,207 --> 02:01:27,790
I'll give them a reason to go home.

1570
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,165
Do you miss mom?

1571
02:01:44,332 --> 02:01:45,207
Qianli,

1572
02:01:46,874 --> 02:01:48,707
when Baili died,

1573
02:01:49,499 --> 02:01:51,332
were you by his side?

1574
02:02:00,207 --> 02:02:02,332
He lost the bottom half of his body

1575
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,749
from the explosion.

1576
02:02:06,957 --> 02:02:08,457
I couldn't even

1577
02:02:08,457 --> 02:02:09,790
stuff his intestines back inside,

1578
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:13,207
no matter how I tried.

1579
02:02:16,999 --> 02:02:18,332
He said

1580
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:20,207
he was cold.

1581
02:02:21,457 --> 02:02:22,998
I held him in my arms.

1582
02:02:26,457 --> 02:02:28,207
His lips

1583
02:02:31,832 --> 02:02:34,040
were purple.

1584
02:02:35,916 --> 02:02:37,499
I couldn't stop

1585
02:02:38,374 --> 02:02:40,290
his bleeding.

1586
02:02:41,666 --> 02:02:43,082
He asked me

1587
02:02:44,207 --> 02:02:46,082
to help him take his life.

1588
02:03:02,707 --> 02:03:04,248
Qianli,

1589
02:03:05,624 --> 02:03:07,707
let me stay by your side.

1590
02:03:10,166 --> 02:03:11,624
If...

1591
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:14,874
I end up like Baili,

1592
02:03:17,416 --> 02:03:19,041
you can help me too.

1593
02:03:30,957 --> 02:03:32,290
Okay.

1594
02:03:48,791 --> 02:03:53,291
"November 26, 1950"

1595
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:54,749
How's it going?

1596
02:04:55,666 --> 02:04:56,749
Tanks,

1597
02:04:58,291 --> 02:04:59,749
Half-tracks,

1598
02:05:03,166 --> 02:05:04,374
and HQ.

1599
02:05:08,082 --> 02:05:10,873
From the marching direction and speed

1600
02:05:10,916 --> 02:05:13,332
of the 31st Corps led by the U.S. army

1601
02:05:13,499 --> 02:05:14,665
we can predict that

1602
02:05:14,666 --> 02:05:16,041
the enemy's HQ

1603
02:05:16,041 --> 02:05:17,707
will be established around

1604
02:05:18,999 --> 02:05:21,207
the 1100 Highland.

1605
02:05:21,874 --> 02:05:24,790
They are known as the Polar Bears.

1606
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:26,999
They fought in Siberia in WWI

1607
02:05:27,124 --> 02:05:29,582
and in the Pacific in WWII.

1608
02:05:30,249 --> 02:05:31,832
This is their trump card.

1609
02:05:32,082 --> 02:05:33,832
We'll show them

1610
02:05:33,832 --> 02:05:36,040
how tough our fists are then.

1611
02:06:01,416 --> 02:06:03,374
Why hasn't anything happened?

1612
02:06:05,707 --> 02:06:07,498
Do you think something went wrong?

1613
02:06:17,874 --> 02:06:20,915
The 59th, 79th,
and 89th Divisions arrived in Yudam-ni on time.

1614
02:06:20,916 --> 02:06:23,624
The 80th and 81st Divisions
are in position in Sinhung-ni.

1615
02:06:23,624 --> 02:06:25,999
What's the speed of Smith's corps?

1616
02:06:26,416 --> 02:06:27,707
3 kilometers per day.

1617
02:06:27,707 --> 02:06:29,290
They are moving at a snail's pace.

1618
02:06:32,666 --> 02:06:34,957
According to their line of march and geography,

1619
02:06:35,207 --> 02:06:37,373
Smith's corps will surely be stretched out.

1620
02:06:37,916 --> 02:06:40,291
Then we can break their lineup
into a few sections.

1621
02:06:40,291 --> 02:06:41,749
We must annihilate Smith

1622
02:06:42,124 --> 02:06:44,332
at the Lake Changjin.

1623
02:06:47,707 --> 02:06:48,957
Let's wait.

1624
02:07:03,624 --> 02:07:05,457
The 1100 Highland is right ahead of us.

1625
02:07:05,457 --> 02:07:06,915
If we make it there before sunrise,

1626
02:07:07,332 --> 02:07:09,457
we can block the U.S. army's route.

1627
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:13,499
Let's not waste our time here.

1628
02:07:14,499 --> 02:07:15,707
Notify all units. Get ready to head out.

1629
02:07:15,916 --> 02:07:16,416
Yes.

1630
02:07:16,416 --> 02:07:18,041
Gather your gear and get ready for departure.

1631
02:07:18,041 --> 02:07:19,666
Attention all! Get ready to depart.

1632
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:23,666
Lei.

1633
02:07:24,707 --> 02:07:27,207
I saved this just for you.

1634
02:07:29,916 --> 02:07:30,999
What do you want for it?

1635
02:07:31,707 --> 02:07:34,082
Why do you have such a nasty mind?

1636
02:07:35,916 --> 02:07:36,999
The situation with the Polar Bears is...

1637
02:07:36,999 --> 02:07:38,707
a tough battle.

1638
02:07:39,374 --> 02:07:40,915
Can you let me have Wanli?

1639
02:07:41,541 --> 02:07:43,749
You're the one who handed him over to me.

1640
02:07:44,207 --> 02:07:45,165
Now you want him back.

1641
02:07:45,166 --> 02:07:46,166
What are you up to?

1642
02:07:50,957 --> 02:07:51,832
He throws with unerring aim.

1643
02:07:51,832 --> 02:07:52,748
That's useful to me.

1644
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:55,707
Take good care of him.

1645
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,374
When this war is over,

1646
02:07:58,082 --> 02:07:59,665
he will become my godson.

1647
02:07:59,791 --> 02:08:01,332
I'm expecting him to take care of me
when I get old.

1648
02:08:01,957 --> 02:08:03,290
You old bastard,

1649
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:05,291
if he's your godson,

1650
02:08:05,499 --> 02:08:06,707
what should I call you?

1651
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:10,832
Call me Dad.

1652
02:08:13,082 --> 02:08:14,665
I'll break those aged teeth of yours.

1653
02:08:21,916 --> 02:08:22,874
Remember,

1654
02:08:23,332 --> 02:08:24,873
as soon as the battle begins,

1655
02:08:25,082 --> 02:08:27,540
you stick by your brother's side.

1656
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:30,124
He's more witty and canny than a rabbit.

1657
02:08:30,332 --> 02:08:32,540
Bullets don't tend to get him.

1658
02:08:33,832 --> 02:08:35,207
Don't be a show-off.

1659
02:08:35,832 --> 02:08:36,457
Okay.

1660
02:08:36,541 --> 02:08:39,124
Let's all try to fight this war nicely.

1661
02:08:39,374 --> 02:08:39,915
Okay.

1662
02:08:50,249 --> 02:08:51,582
Those in the back, speed up!

1663
02:09:07,291 --> 02:09:11,791
"November 27, 1950"

1664
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:20,332
Commander,

1665
02:09:20,416 --> 02:09:22,082
Smith's corps haven't arrived yet.

1666
02:09:26,332 --> 02:09:27,165
No more waiting.

1667
02:09:30,124 --> 02:09:31,249
Begin the general assault

1668
02:09:31,332 --> 02:09:32,332
in 5 minutes.

1669
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:37,499
"Sinhung-ni, Lake Changjin"

1670
02:09:49,666 --> 02:09:50,249
What?

1671
02:09:54,332 --> 02:09:55,540
Have we been discovered?

1672
02:09:55,832 --> 02:09:56,582
No.

1673
02:09:56,791 --> 02:09:57,957
We're about to initiate the attack.

1674
02:10:02,999 --> 02:10:06,082
Attack!

1675
02:10:13,624 --> 02:10:16,874
Attack!

1676
02:10:19,666 --> 02:10:20,999
Get on the truck!

1677
02:10:52,916 --> 02:10:54,874
Enemy attack, code Red!

1678
02:10:55,624 --> 02:10:57,457
Lock enemy assault position.

1679
02:10:59,624 --> 02:11:02,124
Sir, they are coming from everywhere!

1680
02:11:04,874 --> 02:11:07,874
Dinner is served!

1681
02:11:07,999 --> 02:11:09,124
Load the cannons!

1682
02:11:09,207 --> 02:11:09,915
Load the cannons!

1683
02:11:09,999 --> 02:11:11,249
Ready,

1684
02:11:11,541 --> 02:11:12,291
fire!

1685
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:25,332
Attack!

1686
02:12:12,957 --> 02:12:17,457
Attack!

1687
02:12:48,582 --> 02:12:49,832
Ammo supply!

1688
02:12:50,207 --> 02:12:51,165
Move, move, move!

1689
02:12:52,291 --> 02:12:53,416
Need more ammo!

1690
02:12:53,499 --> 02:12:55,957
Never see ammo go this fast like before!

1691
02:12:59,041 --> 02:13:00,291
Ammo supply!

1692
02:13:07,124 --> 02:13:08,874
You gonna pick that up, Glover?

1693
02:13:08,999 --> 02:13:10,582
Yeah, I got it, I got it!

1694
02:13:12,082 --> 02:13:13,332
All right, we gotta move!

1695
02:13:13,582 --> 02:13:15,040
Prepare the second load!

1696
02:13:15,249 --> 02:13:16,374
They are coming!

1697
02:13:22,416 --> 02:13:24,874
You guys think we're gonna make it for chow time?

1698
02:13:24,874 --> 02:13:26,082
Shut up, Costello!

1699
02:13:26,082 --> 02:13:28,873
We're gonna be lucky if they
don't roast our turkeys for dinner.

1700
02:13:37,832 --> 02:13:38,665
Hurry!

1701
02:13:40,499 --> 02:13:41,957
Hurry! Right here!

1702
02:13:41,957 --> 02:13:43,540
Two in the front and three in the back. Hurry!

1703
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:00,791
Take cover! Take cover now!

1704
02:14:01,666 --> 02:14:03,624
Target the center watchtower!

1705
02:14:03,791 --> 02:14:04,499
Copy!

1706
02:14:04,916 --> 02:14:06,874
Ready, fire!

1707
02:14:19,499 --> 02:14:21,707
Lei, where are your mortars?

1708
02:14:34,416 --> 02:14:36,791
Hang on. Hang on.

1709
02:14:39,624 --> 02:14:40,707
Hang on.

1710
02:14:51,666 --> 02:14:54,374
Lei, great job!

1711
02:14:56,999 --> 02:14:57,915
Who called me?

1712
02:14:58,207 --> 02:14:59,082
I didn't.

1713
02:15:00,499 --> 02:15:01,665
Hurry!

1714
02:15:11,624 --> 02:15:14,290
All tanks defend the headquarters!

1715
02:15:28,207 --> 02:15:29,540
Jesus, Sunny.

1716
02:15:36,791 --> 02:15:38,541
Go! find the American flag!

1717
02:15:38,541 --> 02:15:39,499
Destroy their HQ.

1718
02:15:39,499 --> 02:15:40,332
Yes.

1719
02:15:41,291 --> 02:15:43,124
Sir, the Air Force is on its way!

1720
02:15:43,124 --> 02:15:44,499
The enemy is closing in!

1721
02:15:44,499 --> 02:15:46,707
Emergency orders are required, sir!

1722
02:15:47,666 --> 02:15:49,249
Aim right at them!

1723
02:15:59,832 --> 02:16:00,665
Hurry!

1724
02:16:01,124 --> 02:16:02,415
Send the ammunition to them!

1725
02:16:02,416 --> 02:16:03,124
Hurry up!

1726
02:16:03,124 --> 02:16:03,999
Yes.

1727
02:16:24,582 --> 02:16:25,290
The tank is coming!

1728
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:25,999
Go that way!

1729
02:16:27,166 --> 02:16:28,166
Find cover!

1730
02:16:28,916 --> 02:16:30,624
Hurry, take cover!

1731
02:16:36,332 --> 02:16:37,123
Go!

1732
02:16:44,666 --> 02:16:45,749
Bazooka!

1733
02:16:45,749 --> 02:16:46,540
Here!

1734
02:17:20,124 --> 02:17:21,082
Run!

1735
02:17:32,666 --> 02:17:33,541
Leave me!

1736
02:17:33,582 --> 02:17:34,790
Hang on!

1737
02:17:35,332 --> 02:17:36,123
Go!

1738
02:17:41,999 --> 02:17:43,374
Go!

1739
02:18:01,541 --> 02:18:04,499
Don't fall asleep, bro. Wait for me.

1740
02:18:28,082 --> 02:18:32,582
Dachuan! Dachuan!

1741
02:18:34,166 --> 02:18:35,249
Attack!

1742
02:18:35,457 --> 02:18:36,915
Charge!

1743
02:18:42,249 --> 02:18:43,290
Watch out!

1744
02:18:43,291 --> 02:18:44,666
Up there!

1745
02:18:48,291 --> 02:18:49,457
Spread out!

1746
02:18:53,416 --> 02:18:55,166
Spread out!

1747
02:21:14,166 --> 02:21:15,082
Grenade!

1748
02:21:19,249 --> 02:21:22,082
1, 2, 3! Go!

1749
02:21:31,707 --> 02:21:32,873
Rush forward!

1750
02:21:32,874 --> 02:21:33,957
Fight!

1751
02:22:24,457 --> 02:22:25,290
Bro!

1752
02:22:37,624 --> 02:22:39,707
Spread out!

1753
02:22:39,749 --> 02:22:42,040
Get down!

1754
02:22:42,041 --> 02:22:43,166
Hurry!

1755
02:22:50,082 --> 02:22:50,957
Grenade!

1756
02:23:02,582 --> 02:23:03,332
Get back!

1757
02:23:03,332 --> 02:23:04,207
Take cover!

1758
02:23:04,207 --> 02:23:05,248
Get on! Hurry!

1759
02:23:05,249 --> 02:23:06,124
Get in the truck!

1760
02:23:06,124 --> 02:23:07,332
Stop them!

1761
02:23:08,791 --> 02:23:10,457
A fool who risks his neck

1762
02:23:10,457 --> 02:23:12,040
will never be a hero!

1763
02:23:12,041 --> 02:23:13,749
Stay calm!

1764
02:23:13,749 --> 02:23:15,624
You must stay calm on the battlefield!

1765
02:23:49,832 --> 02:23:51,248
I order a full retreat!

1766
02:23:51,707 --> 02:23:52,790
Give the order!

1767
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:54,249
All units fall back!

1768
02:23:54,249 --> 02:23:55,457
Burn everything!

1769
02:24:00,332 --> 02:24:01,707
Let's get out of here!

1770
02:24:01,832 --> 02:24:02,957
Go!

1771
02:24:02,999 --> 02:24:03,707
They are going to retreat!

1772
02:24:03,749 --> 02:24:04,624
Stop them!

1773
02:24:04,707 --> 02:24:06,832
Fall back!

1774
02:24:45,874 --> 02:24:47,082
Sir, the vehicle is ready!

1775
02:24:51,749 --> 02:24:52,582
Go!

1776
02:24:58,874 --> 02:24:59,957
Back up!

1777
02:25:00,582 --> 02:25:01,665
Back up!

1778
02:25:39,707 --> 02:25:40,623
What are you doing?

1779
02:25:41,666 --> 02:25:43,749
Only 8 more! I'm about to reach 20!

1780
02:25:50,249 --> 02:25:51,999
Some shots must be fired.

1781
02:25:52,041 --> 02:25:53,582
Some shots can be saved.

1782
02:26:35,999 --> 02:26:37,874
All units, move it to the position.

1783
02:26:37,916 --> 02:26:39,249
Wait for the order.

1784
02:26:39,291 --> 02:26:40,207
I repeat.

1785
02:26:40,249 --> 02:26:41,915
Wait for the order.

1786
02:26:41,957 --> 02:26:43,415
Move! Move! Move!

1787
02:26:45,249 --> 02:26:47,040
All units, move it to position.

1788
02:26:47,082 --> 02:26:48,415
Wait for the order.

1789
02:26:48,457 --> 02:26:49,373
I repeat.

1790
02:26:49,416 --> 02:26:51,124
Wait for the order.

1791
02:26:54,332 --> 02:26:56,248
Sir, calling from Sinhung-ni

1792
02:26:56,291 --> 02:26:57,957
demanding immediate reinforcements.

1793
02:26:57,999 --> 02:27:00,124
They are in urgent retreat.

1794
02:27:00,207 --> 02:27:00,790
Landman,

1795
02:27:01,041 --> 02:27:03,291
get reinforcements to Sinhung-ni. Move!

1796
02:27:11,707 --> 02:27:14,707
"Hagaru-ri"

1797
02:27:15,124 --> 02:27:17,457
All units consolidate immediately
and count inventory.

1798
02:27:17,666 --> 02:27:19,249
The 2nd Company of the 3rd Battalion,
stay on guard.

1799
02:27:19,291 --> 02:27:20,582
Stay alert in all directions!

1800
02:27:20,874 --> 02:27:21,665
The 3rd Platoon and the 6th Platoon,

1801
02:27:21,707 --> 02:27:23,248
defend the southwest direction.

1802
02:27:33,499 --> 02:27:34,457
Call him Old Company Commander.

1803
02:27:36,749 --> 02:27:37,915
Old Company Commander.

1804
02:27:38,791 --> 02:27:39,749
Not you.

1805
02:27:43,832 --> 02:27:45,373
Didn't I tell you?

1806
02:27:45,957 --> 02:27:46,832
I got it,

1807
02:27:48,499 --> 02:27:49,749
the undefeatable hero.

1808
02:27:55,874 --> 02:27:57,082
Wanli.

1809
02:28:01,666 --> 02:28:02,499
How old are you?

1810
02:28:05,416 --> 02:28:06,624
Nineteen.

1811
02:28:27,916 --> 02:28:29,124
Little brat,

1812
02:28:29,499 --> 02:28:30,832
have you seen any enemy aircraft?

1813
02:28:32,332 --> 02:28:34,165
The plane opens its butt end

1814
02:28:34,166 --> 02:28:36,041
and pours down bullets and bombs.

1815
02:28:36,332 --> 02:28:38,998
After that, our men in yellow uniforms

1816
02:28:38,999 --> 02:28:40,874
will drop one after another.

1817
02:28:40,874 --> 02:28:42,499
What should we call those brothers

1818
02:28:43,082 --> 02:28:44,665
who were Killed in action?

1819
02:28:46,249 --> 02:28:48,165
What should we call those
who froze to death

1820
02:28:48,207 --> 02:28:49,998
after marching for 6 days and nights

1821
02:28:50,374 --> 02:28:51,999
without any food or sleep?

1822
02:28:55,166 --> 02:28:57,082
What about those who ran to 10 meters
in front of the enemy

1823
02:28:57,124 --> 02:28:58,540
just to toss their hand grenades?

1824
02:28:58,957 --> 02:29:00,457
They were killed.

1825
02:29:00,624 --> 02:29:01,874
What should we call them?

1826
02:29:07,749 --> 02:29:09,499
There aren't any heroes
who will never freeze to death,

1827
02:29:09,541 --> 02:29:11,124
let alone ones who will never be killed.

1828
02:29:11,166 --> 02:29:13,166
A soldier only lives for honor and glory.

1829
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:17,999
What should I call you?

1830
02:29:23,041 --> 02:29:24,749
The 677th Soldier,

1831
02:29:25,457 --> 02:29:26,582
Wu Wanli.

1832
02:29:29,791 --> 02:29:31,416
"Wan" means ten-thousand.

1833
02:29:42,374 --> 02:29:43,582
Watch out.

1834
02:29:53,749 --> 02:29:54,790
Sophisticated.

1835
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:06,166
U.S. Aircraft are here!

1836
02:30:06,249 --> 02:30:07,332
Bazooka!

1837
02:30:09,332 --> 02:30:10,457
U.S. Aircrafts!

1838
02:30:10,749 --> 02:30:11,874
U.S. Aircrafts!

1839
02:30:12,332 --> 02:30:13,665
Find cover!

1840
02:30:47,499 --> 02:30:48,499
God save us!

1841
02:31:05,291 --> 02:31:06,041
Spread out!

1842
02:31:06,832 --> 02:31:08,540
U.S. bomb!

1843
02:31:13,291 --> 02:31:14,041
Are you alright?

1844
02:31:27,416 --> 02:31:28,124
What's your name?

1845
02:31:29,124 --> 02:31:29,957
Officer,

1846
02:31:30,207 --> 02:31:32,582
I'm the 280th soldier of the 7th Company, Ping He.

1847
02:31:36,582 --> 02:31:37,707
FX Bomb!

1848
02:31:37,707 --> 02:31:38,832
Spread out!

1849
02:31:38,999 --> 02:31:39,957
Spread out!

1850
02:31:39,957 --> 02:31:40,790
FX Bomb!

1851
02:31:40,791 --> 02:31:41,999
They're going to bombard us!

1852
02:31:45,166 --> 02:31:46,249
FX Bomb!

1853
02:31:46,249 --> 02:31:47,124
Spread out!

1854
02:31:47,249 --> 02:31:48,374
Spread out!

1855
02:31:49,082 --> 02:31:50,873
IS sighted, vision clear.

1856
02:31:50,916 --> 02:31:52,499
Ready to drop. Over.

1857
02:32:12,291 --> 02:32:15,374
Enemy planes! Spread out!

1858
02:32:47,207 --> 02:32:49,832
I'll send their FX bomb back to them!

1859
02:33:24,374 --> 02:33:26,082
Bastards.

1860
02:34:18,582 --> 02:34:23,082
Everybody says that...

1861
02:34:30,666 --> 02:34:35,166
Everybody says that

1862
02:34:37,916 --> 02:34:42,416
Yimeng Mountain is the best.

1863
02:34:45,249 --> 02:34:49,749
The scenery is beautiful

1864
02:34:51,457 --> 02:34:55,957
on Yimeng Mountain.

1865
02:34:58,666 --> 02:34:59,916
Lei!

1866
02:34:59,916 --> 02:35:02,041
Lift the car.

1867
02:35:39,791 --> 02:35:40,791
It hurts.

1868
02:35:42,166 --> 02:35:44,041
It so hurts.

1869
02:36:03,999 --> 02:36:08,499
Don't...

1870
02:36:14,832 --> 02:36:17,498
Don't...

1871
02:36:19,374 --> 02:36:22,207
Don't leave me alone here.

1872
02:37:01,332 --> 02:37:02,665
Why do you want to be a soldier?

1873
02:37:03,332 --> 02:37:05,207
So Qianli will take me seriously.

1874
02:37:06,707 --> 02:37:07,998
What are you talking about?

1875
02:37:09,249 --> 02:37:10,915
You're only tough enough

1876
02:37:10,957 --> 02:37:12,165
when your enemies take you seriously.

1877
02:38:05,457 --> 02:38:08,082
"Lei Suisheng.”

1878
02:38:58,999 --> 02:38:59,665
Lei,

1879
02:39:00,291 --> 02:39:02,207
It won't hurt anymore.

1880
02:39:06,874 --> 02:39:09,165
It won't hurt anymore.

1881
02:39:18,749 --> 02:39:20,582
You've done well, Lei.

1882
02:39:30,791 --> 02:39:31,582
Let me.

1883
02:39:38,707 --> 02:39:40,290
When I was back home last time,

1884
02:39:40,457 --> 02:39:42,290
every time I went out on the street,

1885
02:39:43,082 --> 02:39:45,915
people would nod and smile at me.

1886
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:51,999
I didn't know them,

1887
02:39:56,124 --> 02:39:58,832
but they recognized my army uniform.

1888
02:40:02,124 --> 02:40:03,749
Before I left home,

1889
02:40:03,791 --> 02:40:05,166
my daughter asked me,

1890
02:40:06,749 --> 02:40:09,457
"Daddy, why must you fight this war?"

1891
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:12,291
If we don't fight this war,

1892
02:40:12,832 --> 02:40:15,498
our next generation will have to fight it.

1893
02:40:18,124 --> 02:40:19,832
We are risking our lives

1894
02:40:23,332 --> 02:40:25,790
to win them a peaceful life.

1895
02:40:27,957 --> 02:40:29,790
My mom kept gazing at me

1896
02:40:30,874 --> 02:40:32,832
without saying a word

1897
02:40:34,041 --> 02:40:36,041
when I left home.

1898
02:40:37,957 --> 02:40:39,290
I know

1899
02:40:41,082 --> 02:40:42,832
she didn't want me to leave.

1900
02:40:44,374 --> 02:40:45,999
My wife said

1901
02:40:46,166 --> 02:40:47,874
when I came home again,

1902
02:40:49,041 --> 02:40:52,499
I had to teach our daughter how to do the math.

1903
02:41:07,082 --> 02:41:08,165
We have to win the war

1904
02:41:08,957 --> 02:41:10,748
and bring them home.

1905
02:41:28,207 --> 02:41:31,332
"Hagaru-ri Airport U.S. Army's Grand Retreat"

1906
02:41:31,332 --> 02:41:31,915
Sir!

1907
02:41:32,249 --> 02:41:33,207
Your chopper is here, sir.

1908
02:41:33,582 --> 02:41:34,957
You can leave anytime.

1909
02:41:36,582 --> 02:41:38,373
The 5th and 7th Regiments aren't here yet

1910
02:41:38,416 --> 02:41:40,499
and this will be an important evac route.

1911
02:41:44,082 --> 02:41:45,290
The supplies are on board now.

1912
02:41:45,291 --> 02:41:46,666
Okay, get ready.

1913
02:41:54,916 --> 02:41:57,291
You send that chopper to evacuate the wounded.

1914
02:41:57,291 --> 02:41:59,166
Those men aren't out of danger yet!

1915
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:04,082
Hey, clear out! Clear out!

1916
02:42:11,124 --> 02:42:12,332

Get down!

hang on!

1928

Battalion Commander,

1929
02:43:31,374 --> 02:43:33,707
we've already warded off an attack
from the enemy again.

1930
02:43:35,832 --> 02:43:36,998
Our Company Commander said,

1931
02:43:36,999 --> 02:43:37,915
We must fight!

1932
02:43:44,499 --> 02:43:45,665
Hand grenades!

1933
02:43:45,666 --> 02:43:46,832
Who has more?

1934
02:44:10,499 --> 02:44:11,665
Comrades,

we've already stood our ground for 24 hours

and warded off 7 attacks from the enemy.

1937

02:44:18,541 --> 02:44:19,707
we will never let the enemies

1939
02:44:19,707 --> 02:44:21,540
pass under our feet!

1940
02:44:21,791 --> 02:44:26,291

Show me.

1949
02:46:05,499 --> 02:46:09,290
Fighting against men with
such strong will like this

1950
02:46:09,957 --> 02:46:12,082
we were not ordained to win.
