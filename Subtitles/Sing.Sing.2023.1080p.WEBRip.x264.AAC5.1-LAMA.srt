00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,559
For aught that
I could ever read,

4
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,529
could ever hear
by tale or history,

5
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,798
the course of true love
never did run smooth.

6
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,836
But either it was different
in blood or else misgraffed

7
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,004
in respect of years,

8
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,173
or else it stood upon
the choice of friends,

9
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:16,444
or if there were a
sympathy in choice,

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,214
war, death, or sickness
did lay siege to it,

11
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,383
making it momentany
as a sound,

12
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,486
swift as a shadow,
short as any dream,

13
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,122
brief as the lightning
in the collied night,

14
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,291
that, in a spleen, unfolds
both heaven and Earth.

15
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,627
And, ere a man has
power to say, "Behold!"

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,135
The jaws of darkness
do devour it up.

17
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:50,378
So quick bright things
come to confusion.

18
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,572
Yo,
we got you, we got you.

19
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,407
Mike Mike, you killed
it tonight, man.

20
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,942
Don't I
do it every time though?

21
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,243
Yeah,
that's true.

22
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,145
But you could have definitely
used that same energy

23
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,346
for opening night
that you had tonight.

24
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,581
I'm gonna
let that one go.

25
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,983
Yeah,
I know, I know.

26
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,987
You good?

27
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,255
Yeah.

28
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,191
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,492
All right.

30
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,300
You gonna bust
outta here? All right.

31
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,980
B block, step forward.

32
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,918
Hey, fuck you, CO.

33
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,853
Who the fuck said that?

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,159
Who the fuck said that?

35
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,894
What the fuck you doin', man?

36
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,595
No fucking cigarettes.

37
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,774
Um, excuse me.

38
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:09,810
You know, I've been,

39
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,645
trying to catch you
in the yard, man.

40
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,714
It's been kind of hard,
you know?

41
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,584
And basically I
wanted to know,

42
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,419
would you mind signing,
you know this book, man?

43
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,523
Oh, man.

44
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,660
You from, wait,
you from Rikers?

45
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,395
Yeah. Yeah, man. I did two
years on the Island, man.

46
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,730
Very popular there.

47
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,031
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,566
It did really
good there, man.

49
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,536
- Got a pen?
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

50
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,970
Yeah, well, you got it
right there?

51
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,705
Ever ready, yeah, man.

52
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,709
I really appreciate this, man.

53
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,811
That's me. G.

54
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:45,713
Yeah.

55
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,715
Put a little star
right there for you.

56
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,116
D-DAN: Yeah, man.
Ooh wee!

57
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm still flying high,
you feel me?

58
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,388
Still flying high.

59
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,291
That monologue had
everybody paying attention.

60
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,426
- What monologue, mine?
- Divine G, Divine G.

61
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,561
Coldest shit he's done, right?

62
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,396
No, I was all right,
I was all right.

63
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,531
But we still got more work
to do I think, all right?

64
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,434
What do you mean "No,
no, no, no, no, no, no"?

66
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,636
Let's bask in it for a minute.

67
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,871
Those transitions were
rough though, hold on.

68
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,773
<i>Parate con</i> easy.

69
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,409
Let's just enjoy it
for a minute.

70
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,444
- I still just remember...
- Remember the moment.

71
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,544
...the feeling being
on the stage.

72
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,713
D-DAN: It does feel good.

73
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,148
You always gotta be
onto the next.

74
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,517
All right. Okay, I hear you.

75
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:23,751
All right, so why don't we
just go over the wait list?

76
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,319
- All right. See who could-
- We can do that,

77
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,387
- we could do that.
- Right?

78
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,521
See who can move up.
All right?

79
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:28,723
- Easy, man.
- All right, cool. Here we go.

80
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,357
- Just gotta make things better.
- Who we got?

81
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,460
We got, uh, Curtis Cross.

82
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,262
- Curtis Cross.
- Who's that?

83
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,030
D-DAN: I don't think so. What?

84
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,932
I'm with you.

85
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,567
Short answer, hell no.

86
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,702
What's the long answer?

87
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,405
The long answer is
he one of them dudes,

88
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,507
he always primping
and propping, you know,

89
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,910
he's gonna step in here,
sit right there,

90
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,111
try and take over every time
we put him in anything.

91
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,245
Put him in a hot seat
from the beginning.

92
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,413
D-DAN: He only wants to-

93
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,681
Yeah, but he don't
think it's a hot seat.

94
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,616
D-DAN: He only wants to sit
next to the females.

95
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,318
He makes women
feel uncomfortable.

96
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,420
Got you. All right. Okay.

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,588
How about, all right,
how about this?

98
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,056
We have, uh, now this
is his second time.

99
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,191
Who?

100
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,559
Is, uh, Divine Eye.

101
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,528
- D-DAN: Divine Eye.
- Mm-mm.

102
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,863
Eye...? From Mount Vernon?

103
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,097
D-DAN: I don't think
he's ready.

104
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:12,266
The brother's smart.
You gotta admit it though.

105
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,268
He teaches history class
at the NAACP.

106
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:15,402
I'm sure there's a lot of

107
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,503
smart drug dealers
in the yard.

108
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,006
Maybe he, what he
may need from us

109
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:19,840
is to be able to put that

110
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,941
- energy into this program.
- Divine G.

111
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,509
Divine G, you gonna
vouch for him?

112
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,278
I'll vouch for the interview.

113
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,512
Just for the interview?

114
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,848
Yeah, for the interview.

115
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,049
- And the rest is on him.
- Him getting in, it's up to us.

116
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,417
You know what?
Yeah, we'll give it to you.

117
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,417
Always trying to
save somebody.

118
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,988
Mike Mike, you go check him out
with me. See what's up.

119
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,024
- You and me?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,692
Let's check him out.

121
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,368
What's up? Make sure done get
that paper to me, right?

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,570
Oh, shit yo.

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,872
I gotta go do
something real quick.

124
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,939
Damn.

125
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,544
The fuck's he gotta do?

126
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,348
What's up, birdie?

127
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,683
Hey, man.

128
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,118
That little jump shot you did...

129
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,019
-Yeah? You saw that?
- It was nice, yeah.

130
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,655
You got my shit?

131
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,823
- Oh yeah. Um, yeah.
- Yeah, the shit I gave you.

132
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:09,790
The shit
I gave you, you got it?

133
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,858
- I got it.
- Yeah. Get it.

134
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,292
Just a young dude.

135
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,394
Here we go.

136
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,929
Always a
young white boy.

137
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,896
You really
wanna watch this?

138
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,169
Word, well what
is this though?

139
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,774
What?

140
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,310
What? What you mean what?
What the fuck is this?

141
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,545
This ain't fucking what
I gave you. Do you know...

142
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,813
- This is...
- That, that has not come...

143
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,081
- This is fucking aspirin.
- ...out of my pocket.

144
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,582
This is not what the...
You know what I gave you?

145
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,285
- No.
- Not fucking aspirin.

146
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,886
Worth $500.

147
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,689
This is $500,

148
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,957
- did you know that, brother?
- No, no, no.

149
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,191
I'm gonna be needing it.
I don't give a fuck

150
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,393
what was in your pocket.

151
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,394
I don't care where you had
it or who you know, or none...

152
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,096
I don't know
who's fucking you,

153
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,531
but you not gonna fuck me

154
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,765
- out of 500.
- I'm not trying to fuck you...

155
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm gonna be needing
all of that.

156
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,869
- You heard what I said?
-Look, I, I, I...

157
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,805
I don't care what the fuck
you's talking about right now.

158
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,440
This what's going on, $500.

159
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,675
Don't care how you get it.

160
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,678
Don't give a fuck what you
got to do to get it.

161
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:04,812
Get my fucking bread to me,
you heard what I said?

162
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,247
I can't get you $500.

163
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,815
- You're going to get me $500.
-I can't get you $500.

164
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,683
You're gonna do whatever
the fuck you got to do.

165
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,719
I don't give a fuck
what you got to do.

166
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,655
You're gonna do that shit
to get my fucking bread.

167
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,956
You heard what I said?

168
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,926
Or I'm gonna tear your
fucking face off in here.

169
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:23,096
Now here, take this bullshit
and get the fuck out my face.

170
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,164
Go get my money.

171
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,738
Peace, King. Peace.
What's happening?

172
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,006
Peace, brother. Hey.

173
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,609
That was really fucked up.

174
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,477
Yeah well, shit happens,
man, you know.

175
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,712
Dude gonna get schooled by

176
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,481
somebody somewhere,
so, you know,

177
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,349
I'm just charging
for the lessons, homie.

178
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,551
Expensive lesson.

179
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,486
Listen, you signed
up for the RTA program.

180
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,554
Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,223
And we have a few spots open.

182
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,391
Yeah, just like one
or two and that's it.

183
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:52,593
And we wanted to know

184
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,228
if you wanted to put
those acting skills

185
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,530
that we just saw down there
to some good use?

186
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,598
- What, that?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,466
Y'all thought that was acting?

188
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,335
Yeah, man.

189
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,002
You ain't seen nothing yet.

190
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,605
All right.

191
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,174
So why'd you sign up
for the program?

192
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,309
Yeah, you know, you got
some pretty volunteers

193
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,345
I saw up on that stage.

194
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,746
Chicks, y'all got up in here.

195
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,781
Yeah, man.
It's not really like that.

196
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,349
They're our colleagues.

197
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,121
Do I need a reason?
Do I really need a reason?

198
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,657
-Yeah.
- Well, we just...

199
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,260
I'm just asking you
to be honest.

200
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,230
- Honest, huh?
- Yeah.

201
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,232
All right.

202
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,336
Well, one day I came
across a book, man,

203
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,739
on keeplock in my cell,

204
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,007
so I ain't got
shit else to do.

205
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,175
So I got this book,
cracked it open

206
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,510
and some of the things

207
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,745
the brother was
saying in the book,

208
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,113
really resonated with me, man.

209
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,482
I mean, the brother said...
what'd the brother say?

210
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:52,253
He said, "When we are born,

211
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:57,358
"we cry because we're
born to a stage of fools."

212
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,028
And I said, yo,

213
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,732
whoever wrote this, man, had to
did a bid before, you know?

214
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,340
- Yeah.
- So...

215
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,110
<i>King Lear</i> just
fell off of a library cart

216
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,812
and you just happened to pick
it up and read a few pages.

217
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,848
Yeah. Shit funny, right?

218
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,118
- Yeah.
- Huh.

219
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,688
We'll be in touch.

220
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,390
All right.

221
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,491
Stay up.

222
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,262
Okay, he knows verse.

223
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,197
Yeah.

224
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:40,066
Two and a half hours?

225
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,108
He called me an old
man just a second ago.

226
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:51,979
- How much you want?
- What you got?

227
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,247
Yeah
man, I'm just holding uh...

228
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,949
Hello, everybody!

229
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,358
Good to see
some familiar faces.

230
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,995
For those of you
who don't know me,

231
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,699
my name is Brent and
I'll be at your service

232
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,967
as your director for
whatever you decide to do

233
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,003
for your upcoming production.

234
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,305
But there'll be plenty of
time for all that later.

235
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,574
Right now, let's just
warm ourselves up.

236
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,277
We're gonna warm up the space.
Warm up your instruments.

237
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,545
I want everybody
to start walking around

238
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,280
like you just won the lottery.

239
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,815
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

240
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,351
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

241
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,823
How about a zombie,
what does a zombie walk like?

242
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,225
There! I like... Oh, that's...

243
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,426
Basehead,
that's all that is.

244
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,530
Some of your
best work, my friends!

245
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,964
<i>♪ Doh doh, doh doh doh doh ♪</i>

246
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,566
How about
if you're walking

247
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,467
- on some hot coals?
- Hot coals.

248
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,203
- Hot coals.
-Hot coals.

249
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:53,440
Gentlemen, congratulations
on <i>Midsummer.</i>

250
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,981
I mean, I gotta say
Shakespeare,

251
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,849
you guys did beautiful work.

252
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,985
You should all be proud.
Really.

253
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,187
-Not easy.
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,957
So have you decided
what's next?

255
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,460
We know what it won't be.

256
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,994
No more Shakespeare.

257
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,564
What? I like Shakespeare.

258
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,598
We can do <i>West Side Story.</i>

259
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,800
Not back to back.

260
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,701
<i>Sacrifice?</i>
<i>Wizard of Oz?</i>

261
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,103
August Wilson's good...

262
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,038
Why don't we do
one of Divine G's plays?

263
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,506
- Yes.
- Time we take it back

264
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,474
to one of our own.

265
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,909
-Please.
- Why don't we talk about it?

266
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,277
Nah.
I love that idea.

267
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,345
No, no, no.
I don't know about that.

268
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,114
I don't know about that.

269
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,517
Well, wait.
I... Oh, pressure's on.

270
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,319
Okay, well, how about, I
don't know if it's ready, but,

271
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,221
all right, I just,
I just finished one.

272
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,322
-Okay.
- Now that he just

273
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,057
put my business
in the streets.

274
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,893
It's called <i>Fine Print.</i>

275
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,830
It's a saga of Zabar Turner,
he's a record producer.

276
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,698
It's all about him
getting tricked

277
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,835
into giving up
his record studio

278
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,304
by a conniving Fast Freddy.

279
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:02,208
It's a story of the dangers
of overzealous ambition.

280
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,277
Mmm.

281
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:08,382
And how all relationships
under heaven contain...

282
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:10,817
<i>Fine Print.</i>

283
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,319
-There we go!
- I like it.

284
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,988
<i>Fine Print!</i>

285
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,157
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

286
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,095
So, have you guys decided?

287
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,130
Are we gonna take a vote here

288
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,298
or anybody else
have any ideas?

289
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,234
Oh, hold on, new man.

290
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,369
Yes, sir.

291
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,104
Yeah.

292
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,973
I don't mean to
step on anybody's toes

293
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,407
in here or nothing.

294
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,443
Or disrespect the group,

295
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,147
but do all the plays
have to be so serious?

296
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,150
Yo, what do you mean
by serious though?

297
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,819
I mean like every day we
dealing with trauma, drama.

298
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,021
Every day we got tragedy.

299
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,890
I mean, I think population

300
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,624
just might appreciate
a comedy.

301
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:55,795
How do you guys
feel about that?

302
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,163
Makes sense.

303
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,199
You got a comedy?

304
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,634
I ain't got a comedy,
I don't write comedies.

305
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,669
I got satires.

306
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,137
We never did it before.

307
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,173
What kind of
comedy would you propose?

308
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,641
I mean, would it
be a broad comedy

309
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,143
or something more
low key or...

310
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,144
I don't know, I'm just talking
about making people laugh.

311
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,779
Yeah, I understand,
but I'm just trying to

312
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,914
be more specific
in terms of like

313
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,015
what kind of comedy you want.

314
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,050
I mean,
that's just my opinion.

315
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,485
How about
a cowboy comedy?

316
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,386
There we go.

317
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,021
I always wanted
to do a western,

318
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,555
like <i>Blazing Saddles</i>
or something.

319
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,757
Egyptians!

320
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,526
Egyptian comedies?

321
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,594
We could sneak some
Shakespeare in there.

322
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,728
<i>Hamlet.</i>

323
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,831
<i>Hamlet</i> in the comedy?

324
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,067
<i>Hamlet</i> in the comedy.
All right.

325
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,101
We could do something
in the forest,
<i>Robin Hood</i>

326
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,169
or something like that?

327
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,772
<i>- Peter Pan.</i> Yeah.
- Yeah.

328
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,607
How about <i>Jason?</i>

329
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,108
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

330
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,043
Could I ask a question?

331
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,480
Can someone name a comedy

332
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,282
that contains all that
bullshit that you just named?

333
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,651
We could do time travel.

334
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,653
Well now that is true.

335
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,789
I mean, with time travel,

336
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,157
we could put all
the things in there

337
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,294
that you guys are mentioning
and have a ton of roles.

338
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,096
Get more people up on stage
and maybe even

339
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,731
have a message in there
or not, I don't know.

340
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,336
What do you think
about that, G?

341
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,138
If you're not into it, I could
take a stab at writing it.

342
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,507
I think that's cool.

343
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,409
You take a...
You do it, you got it.

344
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,444
It's what everybody
else wants, right?

345
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,746
That's not really in my
wheelhouse, so you got it.

346
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,148
I'll tell you what,

347
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,985
I'll run it by Katherine
and if the script sucks,

348
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,653
we can always pivot to
something else, right?

349
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,922
All right.

350
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,757
Mike Mike, go ahead.

351
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,392
So Maestro,
we take it to a vote?

352
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,061
Yep.

353
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,129
Let's do it.

354
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,731
Let's go for it.

355
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,966
- Everybody?
- Raise your hand, Mike Mike.
Let's go.

356
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,534
Hey, man.

357
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,002
All right, done.

358
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:55,882
G, I've read
five drafts, at least,

359
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,851
of <i>Fine Print</i> front to back.

360
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,785
It is really solid, man.

361
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,456
And it could be funny.

362
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:07,560
I mean, you know, if you
do the right take on it.

363
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,096
It's a straight drama.

364
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,631
No point in trying to
change that, I mean, come on.

365
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,599
All right.

366
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,103
But maybe you got another
play that's funnier

367
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,971
and then we could run
it up for another vote?

368
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,540
Mike Mike, you know,
look, it's really okay.

369
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,475
I'm really good with it,
all right?

370
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,510
Okay.

371
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,312
Not gonna be pushy with you, man.

372
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,083
Maybe that knucklehead
is right.

373
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,487
Ah, man.

374
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,655
I mean, it'll take
the edge off around here.

375
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,624
It will be a lot easier

376
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,760
than all that dying
we normally do.

377
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,963
"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard."

378
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,700
A character actor said that.

379
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,202
I heard that from...
Brent told me that.

380
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,837
This shit gonna kill me.

381
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,907
All right, men.

382
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,875
Took everything you wanted,

383
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,178
and put it right in here.

384
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:03,283
It's got ancient Egypt,
pirates, Old West gunfights.

385
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,221
I even sprinkled a little
bit of the Black Plague

386
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,523
and Roman Gladiators in there
because at the time

387
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:11,024
it just seemed like
it was a good idea.

388
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,225
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

389
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,893
All right.

390
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,161
Whoa.

391
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,830
147 pages?

392
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,366
In one weekend?

393
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,535
Well, I had a lot
to fit in there,

394
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,669
but it's got
a couple of dance numbers,

395
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,639
a couple of songs,

396
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,375
a <i>Hamlet</i> soliloquy.

397
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,444
But at the heart of the story,

398
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,447
it's all about an
Egyptian prince

399
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:37,817
who follows clues through
time to find his mummy.

400
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,419
Freddy in this?

401
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,187
Oh, Freddy is
definitely in this.

402
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,422
It'll make sense when you guys

403
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,757
start to read it, okay?

404
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:44,858
But while you're reading it,

405
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,261
I want you to pick out a
role that you identify with.

406
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,830
Now, the cast list
is on the board.

407
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,365
Pick a time slot.

408
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,367
There's enough in here
for everybody

409
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,202
to have at least one role.

410
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,682
Good afternoon.

411
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,885
My name is Dario Pena,

412
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,356
and I will be auditioning
for the role of Whiskerandos.

413
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,058
My name is Carmine.

414
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,727
I'm auditioning
for the part of Coal.

415
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,698
My name is Patrick Griffin,
they call me Preme.

416
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,803
I'm gonna read the role
of the ring announcer.

417
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:33,773
I'm D-Dan, reading
for the part...

418
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,976
Alotincommon.

419
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,578
"Now indeed, I am a prisoner.

420
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,782
"Yes.

421
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:46,886
"Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains,

422
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,423
"which cruel Tilburina,

423
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:54,795
"thy doting captive
gloried in before."

424
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,665
"I'm tired of bashing guys'
brains out with mallets

425
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:03,136
"and ripping their hearts
out with my bare hands.

426
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,505
"I gotta get outta here."

427
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,642
My name is David James
Giraudy, also known as Dap.

428
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,911
And I'll be reading
for Leslie.

429
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,317
"Mummy, mummy, is that you?"

430
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,253
D-DAN: "Yes, son,
that is your mummy."

431
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,922
"Oh, mummy, mummy,
I miss you so."

432
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,591
"Draw your gun, Marshall.

433
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,193
"Point it at me
and pull the trigger.

travel from there to here,

436

437
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,768

440
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,273
"Coal, prepare to meet
your maker."

441
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:45,978
There's no other lines.

442
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,784
You pull a carrot
and I pull a broccoli.

443
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:53,119
D-DAN: No, that's fine,
that's pretty good there.

444
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,888
- There's no lines.
- D-DAN: No, no, no.

445
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,657
You're absolutely right.
Everything's good.

446
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,095
"We like maiming,
flagellation,

447

450
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:14,074
"I'll duck, roll, and
fill you so full of holes,

451
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:18,310
"that you'll whistle
like a steam kettle
when the wind blows."

452
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,980
Hello, my name is
James Williams,

453
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,682
also known as Big E.

454
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:27,520
And I'm reading for the part
of the ring announcer.

455
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,123
And I'm six foot five.

456
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,358
I want you to
imagine yourself

457
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,861
in a coliseum, and I want
you to be a gladiator

458
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,329
fighting to the death,

459
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,764
not only for survival,
but for performance.

460
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,834
Survival?

461
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:44,103
And the performance,
as gladiators do.

462
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:11,564
I got this signature move,
you gotta wait for it.

463
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:19,872
What other roles
have you played

464
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,708
in other productions?

465
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,478
To be honest with y'all,
I lost count.

466
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:28,214
I could sit here and tell you
Chief Bromden, Stratford.

467
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,384
I was in <i>Macbeth</i>
as King Duncan.

468
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,752
I was in
<i>The Silence of the Heart,</i>

469
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:36,155
I was a police officer.
And I was the boss

470
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,191
in <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

471
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,293
Once I played an angel.

472
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,162
Except that wasn't
here in RTA,

473
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,764
that was when I was
three years old.

474
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,466
I've been playing
a role my whole life, bro.

475

"To be or not to be.

Thank you.

497
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,361
D-DAN: Divine,
can you step out please?

498
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,929
- Sure.
- D-DAN: Divine G.

499
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,930
Thank you.

500
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,098
D-DAN: We got someone
else reading for Hamlet.

501
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,470
I'm sorry, somebody else
is going out for Hamlet?

502
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,038
Divine Eye.

503
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,809
Okay. All right, thanks.

504
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:10,850
You're up.

505
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,552
You sounded
great in there. Intense.

506
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:13,686
Thank you, I appreciate it.

507
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,021
Hey, yo.
Can I ask you something?

508
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,456
-Anything.
- You wanted to do a comedy,

509
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,623
- right?
-Sure did.

510
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:18,691
Now we're doing a comedy.

511
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,026
And I'm excited.

512
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,327
And yet you're auditioning
for the only dramatic role

513
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,795
in the whole play.

514
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,597
Comedy's very difficult, man.

515
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,165
I don't wanna get up
on that stage

516
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,133
and get ya'd off
the stage, bro.

517
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:30,636
Hey, there my boys,
right here.

518
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,717
How about some <i>Hamlet?</i>

519
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,019
Whoa, Laurence Olivier.
Here we go.

520
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,299
I'd also like to note,
commissioners,

521
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,501
that I was a candidate

522
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,902
to become a New York City
police officer.

523
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,338
Yes, yes,
we see that in your packet.

524
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:07,340
We also see some other things.

525
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,709
Was this before you
decided to become

526
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,911
a rampaging drug dealer?

527
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,547
Well, sir, I only hustled that

528
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,449
one year after my accident.

529
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,051
And, my God...

530
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,353
Mike Mike, can you please
stop messing around

531
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,421
with that paddle, I can't...

532
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:22,689
- I'm listening.
- But I can't focus

533
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:23,790
when you're not giving
the whole vibe.

534
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,592
You know what, my bad.
I got you.

535
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,460
I'll do the commissioner
voice this time, everything.

536
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,494
- Man.
- All right?

537
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,129
All right. Come on, come on.

538
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:32,765
Listen up, Whitfield.

539
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,400
The commission is not here

540
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:36,903
to talk about what
you could have been.

541
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:39,706
We're here to talk about
who you really are.

542
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:43,076
It says here that you were
in some sort of enterprise

543
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:47,013
called Mix Machine, some sort
of criminal organization?

544
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,348
No, sir, it is not a
criminal organization.

545
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,083
I was a DJ.

546
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,452
- A DJ?
- Yeah, yeah.

547
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,621
Well, I bet you was
funky as hell!

548
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,757
Weren't you? Admit it.

549
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,492
Admit it! You was funky.

550
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,394
You was funky.

551
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:02,895
Did you, did you pop lock?

552
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,263
- Did you pop lock?
- Ga ga!

553
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,599
- Zz-zz-zz.
- Kah, kah.

554
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,336
All right gentlemen,
I need your attention

555
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,537
and your bodies.

556
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,838
- Form a circle.
- RTA!

557
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,906
Let's go.

558
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:18,478
Thank you, men. Thank you.

559
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,612
C'mon D-Dan.
D-Dan!

560
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,481
This one's asleep.
What's up?

561
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,549
Let's get to work,
let's get busy.

562
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,418
We're gonna do
a character exercise.

563
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,619
I'm gonna pick somebody out.

564
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,554
They're gonna come to
the center of the circle,

565
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:31,390
introduce yourself
as your character,

566
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:32,692
in that character's voice

567
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,560
and then hand it off
to the next actor.

568
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,730
You sir, are number one, first.

569
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:41,567
Alotincommon,
the Egyptian high priest.

570
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,001
Get it. Get it.

571
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,139
I guess
I'm fucking Gravedigger.

572
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,913
What's the matter,
Gravedigger?

573
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,549
Freddy's claws got
you tongue tied?

574
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,752
Freddy! Oh, I am... no.

575
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,289
I am Leslie,
the Egyptian prince.

576
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,792
Okay, can I start a cuss?
Because I am Startacuss!

577
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,462
No, I am Start... man.

578
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,163
I'm the gunslinger Coal.

579
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:12,632
The rootin' tootin',

580
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,601
carrot totin', shootin',
you know.

581
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,270
I am Gladiator Goliathan.

582
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,106
And I'm Zakariedies.

583
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,507
If you want to play
in the coliseum,

584
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,575
you gotta see me.

585
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:25,611
And I am Captain Hook.

586
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:29,315
Arr, arr.

587
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,983
Hit it.

588
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,586
I'm Prince Hamlet of Denmark.

589
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,455
Oh!

590
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:37,290
Hold on, back off now,
come on now.

591
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,724
We just saw Divine Eye.

592
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,360
We wanna see Prince Hamlet.

593
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,461
Bring it, come on.

594
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,798
I am Prince Hamlet of Denmark.

595
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,533
- D-DAN: There we go.
-All right.

596
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,605
It's gonna get better,
it's gonna get better.

597
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:56,876
Yes, sir.

598
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,945
I got a question
about my character.

599
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,147
I mean,
wouldn't he be freaked out

600
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,182
by some dude
from ancient Egypt

601
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:05,384
time traveling
all the way into like

602
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,953
the middle of the ocean?

603
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,956
And do we even have
a common language?

604
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:13,292
- Language?
- Well, good questions.

605
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,029
Remember, it's a comedy.

606
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,498
So we can take some liberties
and have some fun with it.

607
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,666
You can make it up.

608
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,135
Yeah, we're gonna
have some fun with it.

609
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,971
I'll tell you what, we can
workshop it when we get to it,

610
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,239
- when we get to it...
- I have a question.

611
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,673
-Yes, sir.
- Can't let this go. I'm sorry.

612
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:30,009
We gotta talk about
this time travel.

613
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,844
Is it gonna be a wormhole?

614
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:35,315
I mean, we're gonna
breach the fabric of time?

615
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:38,017
Like what kind of effect is it
gonna have on a human body?

616
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,685
- Gentlemen, again...
- Brent, hold up.

617
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:42,788
All good questions,
but you know...

618
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,257
Go ahead.

619
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:46,592
Hey, all right you guys.
All right, just listen.

620
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:48,694
Okay, listen, you guys,

621
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,697
you wanna do a
cowboy play, all right.

622
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:52,965
Somebody right here
wanna do ancient Egypt

623
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,035
and somebody, for
God knows reason,

624
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,038
threw in Freddy Krueger,
all right. He did.

625
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,239
- So how...
-I just got the role,

626
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,407
- I didn't ask for it...
- Okay, well anyway,

627
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,775
it doesn't matter. But how was

628
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,710
Brent supposed to get
all of that in here?

629
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,412
He did it, right? He delivered.

630
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,881
I think we should just
focus on the scenes.

631
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,617
Look at the emotion of it,
the arcs,

632
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:13,285
and the work
will take care of itself.

633
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:14,854
- Fair.
- Well said.

634
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,322
Trust the process.

635
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,556
You are correct, sir.

636
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:18,824
- Thank you, G.
- Sure.

637
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,128
Okay, that's just great.

638
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:26,465
So, why don't we
start with your scene.

639
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,767
- Gotcha.
- MIKE MIKE Ooh.

640
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,437
I'm really tired of
this miserable profession.

641
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,640
I don't want to be all
mean and tough no more.

642
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,377
I'd like to be
gentle and kind.

643
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,578
Really?

644
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,646
Me too.

645
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:44,217
Look, I'm trying to escape,

646
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:48,821
but my boss has threatened to
kill me, my wife, and kids.

647
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,089
My boss too.

648
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,858
Why, I've been trying
to organize the guys

649
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,393
for like forever!

650
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,765
Let's break out.

651
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,066
Let's.

652
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,736
Amazing.

653
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,304
Amazing!

654
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:07,006
You see that shit?
You see that shit?

655
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,574
I made some choices,
I made some choices.

656
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:09,842
Come on.

657
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,077
There you go.

658
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,845
I made some choices.
Ooh!

659
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,980
All right.
So, who's next?

660
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,981
- Yeah, I got that.
- You got it. Come on.

661
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,386
We're doing Shakespeare.

662
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,887
-Get it.
- Yeah, come on. We got you.

663
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,638
Fuck this shit, man.

664
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,908
- Did I miss something? What?
- That's it?

665
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,010
That's all right, men.

666
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,178
We're just gonna
trust the process here.

667
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,213
That's all right. We're here

668
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,781
to support each other.
Who's next?

669
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,516
Who's next? Come on.

670
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:51,517
Come on, Dap. Let's go.

671
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:52,952
It's hard to follow him,
but all right.

672
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,252
That's all right.

673
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,669
What's up, what's up? Peace.

674
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,970
Son, get that money, son,
you heard?

675
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,247
All right, men. Let's take five!

676
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,850
Yo, yo, yo, Eye.

677
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,351
Let me holler at you
for a minute.

678
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,754
All right.

679
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,456
Yo, want you to
check some shit out.

680
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,792
Five means five.

681
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,560
It does not mean 15,
like Mike Mike.

682
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,232
Man, this is my spot.

683
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:41,666
Look at that, you can see
everything out there.

684
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:46,072
Yo, Eye, I just wanted to say

685
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:48,307
I recognize that you're
a little frustrated

686
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,708
with the way
things are going...

687
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,143
I'm not frustrated with shit.

688
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,446
Them exercises
is goofy as fuck.

689
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,214
Yeah, they are goofy as fuck.

690
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:57,883
But there's an intention to
them, you know what I mean?

691
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,785
I feel like it helps you get

692
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,087
some depth. Helps you find a...

693
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,622
Is this the speech you
give all the new guys?

694
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:03,956
I'm not trying
to give you a speech.

695
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,057
Listen, I already
know what you're doing,

696
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,659
know who you are,
what you about, bro.

697
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,927
- What?
- You wanna run around here

698
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,829
herding everybody up
with the little lessons,

699
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,031
and you call all the shots
and all that.

700
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,399
That's all good and all that.

701
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,234
But I'm not here for that.
I ain't come here for that.

702
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,668
I know you got a
knife in your waistband.

703
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,969
Of course.

704
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,673
Brother.

705
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,675
This fucking program is all
these motherfuckers got.

706
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,944
Makes them feel like they can
get the fuck up outta here.

707
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,980
If not literally out there,
out there in here.

708
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,049
Don't take that away
from them, all right?

709
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,851
And a knife in your waistband
will be the first thing

710
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,219
to make sure this
shit fucking crumbles.

711
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,755
You don't get to fucking
tell me what I need in prison.

712
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,924
You don't get to do that,
nobody do.

713
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,760
Nobody take care of me.

714
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,862
Nobody do nothing
for me or mines.

715
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,731
So don't tell me what to do

716
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:47,600
and don't bring me in no
fucking dark corners no more.

717
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,068
This shit make
a nigga nervous, you heard?

718
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,139
We don't use nigga in here.

719
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,541
We use beloved.

720
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,111
You feel me on that?

721
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,505
Where's Blaze?
Anybody seen Blaze?

722
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,340
Blaze?
Blaze in five building.

723
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,543
They been keeplocked all day.

724
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:32,077
What about Divine Eye,
is he in five building?

725
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,346
Nah,
Divine Eye is in A block

726
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,381
but I don't know
where he's at.

727
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,249
You could send Dap
to get him though.

728
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:59,137
Only place to catch
a breeze, man.

729
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,211
How's your girl doing?
The little one?

730
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,248
Growing up, I guess.

731
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,784
Yeah.

732
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,722
When's the last time
you talked to her?

733
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,190
Oh...

734
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,595
I don't count those days, G.

735
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:22,687
Gentlemen,

736
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:28,560
I'd like you to go to
your most perfect spot.

737
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,730
Perfect moment.

738
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:40,505
Do you hear anything?
Are there any sounds?

739
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,410
Are you with somebody?

740
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,323
What is the temperature?

741
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,294
Are you inside?

742
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,567
Are you outside?

743
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:14,906
Now, just hold
that feeling tone.

744
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,241
Hold it.

745
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,909
Remember it.

746
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,244
Savor it.

747
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,252
All right men, you can
open your eyes.

748
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:40,965
Does anyone wanna describe
where they just were?

749
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:45,570
Blaze?

750
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:51,677
So, I'm sitting in seven
building yard on a bench

751
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,611
that overlooks
the Hudson River.

752
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:57,416
And on the other side
of that yard

753
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:02,521
or the other side of that
water, actually, is my mother.

754
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:07,560
And I know that sometimes
she goes down that mountain

755
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,463
and looks over the water
to where I am at Sing Sing.

756
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:16,901
And for me, just looking
out at the water,

757
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,439
I gain my peace

758
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,807
because I see the waves
and they're peaceful

759
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,644
and it gives me something
to focus on.

760
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,549
June of 1972,

761
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,454
my wife and I had a picnic
by the lake in Prospect Park.

762
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:39,324
That's the first time I ever
told my wife I love her.

763
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,527
If anybody here knows,

764
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,761
we bought Manhattan Specials.

765
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:44,630
You know what
a Manhattan Special is?

766
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,167
It's coffee soda, comes in
glass bottles about this big.

767
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,336
We bought four of them,
I love that stuff.

768
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,304
And we went to Prospect Park.

769
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:55,607
And, uh, we went by the lake.

770
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:01,079
And six months ago
I lost that.

771
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:05,350
She passed away from
pancreatic cancer.

772
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,787
Boy am I gonna miss her.

773
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,991
Summer, 1977.

774
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,294
It's hot.

775
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,863
Water ice truck coming
down the street.

776
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,000
Mom gives me 25 cents

777
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,601
and I go running down
the street to get it.

778
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,838
It taste all cool in your mouth.

779
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,475
What flavor?

780
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:32,544
Cherry, I love cherry.
Mouth all red.

781
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:35,914
Spending time with
my son and my daughter.

782
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:40,652
Just watching 'em grow,
living their life, you know?

783
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:43,722
90 degree weather,

784
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,425
cutting grass in the backyard

785
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,360
to a point where
I'm just so exhausted

786
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,730
and I just lay back
and I smell the fresh grass

787
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,832
I just cut and I'm dozing off

788
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:56,301
and my dog come
licking sweat off my face.

789
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,605
Every summer, my mother
sent me to Baltimore

790
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,708
with my uncles and they only
a few years older than me.

791
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,777
And it was a sense of freedom

792
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:07,379
'cause my mother wasn't
looking over my shoulder.

793
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:11,750
I tried to do one about
the islands, you know?

794
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,652
My grandma would always tell
us about the islands.

795
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,154
The islands, that's where
our people are from.

796
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,491
Couldn't do it, Maestro.

797
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,827
I ain't never been there.

798
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,996
Ain't never been there,
and I'm not gonna get there.

799
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,636
This is real.
I'm stuck in this space.

800
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,875
But if I'm gonna be
stuck in a space

801
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,477
I guess I'll do it
with you suckers.

802
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,914
Payasos.

803
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,983
In here it's all right,
get a little release.

804
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,152
So I guess this is my space.

805
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,457
I think you guys
are becoming actors.

806
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:57,862
Just being real with
each other and vulnerable.

807
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:03,101
It's something men don't
really get to do too often.

808
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,221
To be, or not to be

809
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,091
that is the question.

810
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,394
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

811
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:31,296
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune

812
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,432
or to take arms...

813
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,434
- Bro, what's up?
-What's up?

814
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,602
Why you walking
behind me, bro?

815
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:38,070
I'm supposed to be
walking behind you.

816
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,672
- Bro, all this room right here?
- Why don't you just do what

817
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:40,739
- the hell you're supposed to?
- All this room right here

818
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,074
- and you gotta...
- That's his blocking.

819
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:43,509
Bro, I'm saying this the shit
niggas wanna do in the yard

820
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,710
Focus on what
you're supposed to.

821
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,278
That's what I'm supposed to do, man.

822
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:48,013
Bro listen, don't be doing shit

823
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,482
- you wouldn't be doing
in the yard.
- Or what?

824
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:50,749
- Put your fucking
hands down man.
- The fuck you talking about,

825
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:51,783
-"put my hands down"?
- You heard

826
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:52,850
- what the fuck I said man.
- Enough!

827
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,888
Yo, Eye.

828
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:01,259
I used to be a keeplock
monster, man,

829
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:04,829
consumed in my own anger.

830
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,770
'Til one morning in breakfast,

831
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,707
the guy sitting
across from me,

832
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,575
someone stepped behind him
and he cut him ear to ear.

833
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,381
And we all sat there

834
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,549
as the blood flew
across our clothes

835
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,318
and our faces,

836
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,586
and we pretended
that was normal.

837
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:38,797
Brother, we're here to
become human again.

838
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:42,167
To put on nice clothes
and dance around.

839
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:45,937
And enjoy the things that
is not in our reality.

840
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,680
All right,
you remember your mark?

841
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:57,716
Yeah,
I'm supposed to be standing

842
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:58,884
next to the Gravedigger

843
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,753
then Marion and Leslie
come outta nowhere.

844
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,122
Materialize from nowhere.

845
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:04,990
All right, somebody's gonna
walk behind you eventually,

846
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,959
act like it don't bother you,
that's all.

847
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:09,427
Now let's go, you know
your first line, let's go.

848
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,895
Let's run it again.

849
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:11,897
Come on man.

850
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,567
Fuck it.

851
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:06,985
Use the whole thing.
There you go.

852
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,120
Sweep through.

853
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:12,223
Yeah, same thing.

854
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,529
I'm focused.

855
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:31,776
You were doing great...

856
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,083
Why aren't you up there?

857
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:45,123
They're not rehearsing
any scenes I'm in today.

858
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,526
So you just drifted on in, yeah?

859
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,094
Yeah, I sure did.

860
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,162
Okay.

861
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,031
What's those notes?

862
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,067
What notes?

863
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,203
Those notes.

864
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,972
These... just some things
I'm working on

865
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,374
to help some brothers out.

866
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,009
Get healthier food
around here.

867
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,144
And then some
litigation business.

868
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,211
Hmm.

869
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,180
That's dope.

870
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,119
You got any kids?

871
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,787
Wait, so you just gonna be
all in my business today?

872
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:17,955
Is that what today is?
All right.

873
00:44:19,258 --> 00:44:22,293
Yeah, I got kids.
Two girls and a boy.

874
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:26,798
What's their names?

875
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,003
Divequa, Dinasia and Karron.

876
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,642
Karron is the boy, he was born
right when I got in here.

877
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:38,910
So, uh, you know.

878
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:42,614
He actually wants
to be an actor,

879
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:45,449
like this bunch of nuts.

880
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,886
He's doing YouTube videos
and stuff.

881
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,256
What about your girls?

882
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,998
They, uh, they have
their own lives.

883
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,467
Yeah?

884
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,073
When I started this bid,

885
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,275
my son was real young, man.

886
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:13,745
You know, the homies in the
hood, they took care of him.

887
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,079
'Cause that's my son.

888
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:17,682
Rolled out the
red carpet for him.

889
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,384
Anything he wanted,
treated him well.

890
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,422
Then it wasn't long

891
00:45:23,522 --> 00:45:26,391
before he started doing the
same things I was doing.

892
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:29,293
Putting in the same kind
of pain I was putting in.

893
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:33,398
And now he's in prison,
just like me.

894
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,933
Wearing greens, just like me.

895
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:44,877
Line?
You're looking through

896
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:46,445
the wrong end of the eyeglass.

897
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:49,113
Seems like
I'm not the only one, huh?

898
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,051
Nah.

899
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,591
He doesn't know that there's
tricks to learning lines.

900
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:00,725
Tricks?

901
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,026
Yeah.

902
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,794
What?

903
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,930
Yeah.

904
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:07,798
What's the tricks?

905
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,235
Everybody has
a different process.

906
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:11,570
Some people like me,
I write out

907
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,638
every single one of my lines.
You know what I mean?

908
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,007
That's the way I know
how to digest it.

909
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:16,741
Some people, and it might be
helpful for you

910
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:18,743
to just underline
every action,

911
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,045
every active word, right?

912
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,480
Take it little by little
and break it down.

913
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:23,648
Eventually, you know,
you start

914
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,816
paraphrasing a little bit,

915
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,017
but then it'll all start
to make some sense.

916
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,219
You know what I'm saying?

917
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:28,787
And then you sort of like
break it down, you know,

918
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,055
like how you would
eat an elephant.

919
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,690
You wouldn't swallow
that thing whole, right?

920
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:32,824
You would just...

921
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:34,759
take every little bite,
bite, bite, bite.

922
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,994
And then it all makes
more sense.

923
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:37,162
I think I learned some of that

924
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,997
in the law library.
You know what I mean?

925
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,433
Some of these cases
are so in depth,

926
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:42,500
you know, especially like

927
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:43,368
preparing for my
clemency hearing.

928
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,337
I mean, I gotta like
break it all down.

929
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,138
Yeah, I heard you
found a tape or something

930
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,773
that proves your innocence?

931
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:51,843
Yeah, man,
it took me 10 years but...

932
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,045
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...I got it.

933
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,913
So you don't need no good luck
or nothing, man.

934
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,847
You already got
the golden goose.

935
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,051
I hope so, I think I do.

936
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,286
- I hope so, man. I hope so.
- Yeah.

937
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,055
Um, what about you?

938
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,991
I don't mean to be
in your business,

939
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:08,360
but I did look at the docket

940
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,462
and I saw that you have
a parole hearing coming up.

941
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,731
Yeah.

942
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,132
Hey listen,
I gotta hit the yard.

943
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:16,134
Take care of a little bit
of business, all right?

944
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,936
Peace.

945
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:21,305
Yeah, if I can be of any,
um, help...

946
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,374
Yep.

947
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:27,378
All right.

948
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,923
To die,

949
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:41,258
to sleep,

950
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,130
to sleep,

951
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:49,834
perchance to dream.

952
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,269
Ay, there's the rub.

953
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,608
Okay, you wanna
take that again?

954
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,978
Why, did I do something wrong?

955
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,412
No, no, no,
we're just working at it.

956
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:02,647
But, I'll tell you what,

957
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,516
let's try something here.

958
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:05,684
As long as we're not eating

959
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:07,886
no fucking elephants
or nothing.

960
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,988
Okay, I don't know what
that means, but I won't.

961
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,623
Let's start from the
very beginning,

962
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:12,958
- okay?
- To be...

963
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,359
I don't mean the beginning
here on your mark,

964
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:17,896
I mean in the wings.
That's where it begins.

965
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,698
So I want you
to go back there.

966
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:22,100
I want to see you come on
the stage with Hamlet's...

967
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,435
You're in Hamlet's world

968
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:24,903
and you're bringing that
all the way to your mark.

969
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,037
And then you say your line.

970
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,304
Let's try it.

971
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,410
It's the moment before, guys.

972
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,522
- To be...
- Hold up, did you do it?

973
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,390
Because we all fell asleep.

974
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:48,292
Ooh!

975
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:51,229
You ain't see me just
walk from over there?

976
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,764
I saw you walk out here

977
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:54,532
like a man who's
asking this audience

978
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,034
for permission to be here.

979
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,469
I wanna see
Hamlet come out here,

980
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,471
take the stage and say,

981
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:03,108
"Hey! It's time to start
paying attention to me."

982
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,376
- You have to show...
- Ah, Brent, Brent.

983
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:06,310
-Yes, G?
- Do you mind if I...?

984
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:07,912
Please.

985
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:11,349
Cool. Watch. All right.
Yo, Eye.

986
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,518
The world expects
brothers like you and I,

987
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,454
all these brothers, to walk in
with our heads held down,

988
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:18,590
you know, apologizing
for being there.

989
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,392
Now, what you gotta walk in

990
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:22,660
- is like a motherfucking king!
-Ooh!

991
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:24,595
Like you own all this shit.

992
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,330
Everything is yours.

993
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,700
So you want me
to do it right now?

994
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,000
Right now.
Yeah.

995
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,070
Fucking...

996
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,574
I'm the fucking king, nigga.

997
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,278
Like the yard, but bigger.

998
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,051
I'm Divine fucking Eye!

999
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,053
Yeah.
Yeah.

1000
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,655
I own this fucking theater.

1001
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:52,157
This is my fucking theater.

1002
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:54,559
-I own this bitch!
- I own all this shit.

1003
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,594
That's it, yeah.

1004
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:56,894
Now give him some love,
give him some love.

1005
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,097
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1006
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,932
All right, now, what's your
emotional state?

1007
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,200
What's underneath that?

1008
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,735
Mad as a motherfucker.

1009
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,437
Okay.
No, no, no. Okay.

1010
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:08,072
Anger is the easiest thing
to play.

1011
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,340
Am I right, Brent?

1012
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,442
Too easy.

1013
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:13,912
What's more
complicated is to play hurt.

1014
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,914
That helps you name the thing,
all right?

1015
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,416
Now try that. All right.

1016
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:20,952
From the top.

1017
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,486
There you go, Brent. Ha!

1018
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:30,295
Guys, the superintendent's
got some big money

1019
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,664
sitting out in these
seats tonight.

1020
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,765
Money that can get us
new stage curtains.

1021
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,067
Ooh.

1022
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,003
I need you guys to melt
their faces off with this.

1023
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,572
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1024
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:42,206
We gonna
beat 'em down? Oh, no.

1025
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:43,941
I want you to be savage.

1026
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,144
So let's go.

1027
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,413
Let's go!

1028
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:02,593
Sure. All right. Okay.

1029
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,765
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, man.

1030
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:22,180
Take this sacred amulet
with you for your protection.

1031
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,982
You will need it one day

1032
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,251
before the end
of your journey, young man.

1033
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,188
Scooch to the right a little.

1034
00:51:31,857 --> 00:51:34,959
I'm on my mark, bro.
Scooch your fucking light.

1035
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:36,060
We can move the mark a little,

1036
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:37,195
we can move
the mark a little bit.

1037
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,030
We're gonna move the mark.

1038
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,565
Just a skosh.

1039
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:42,233
Dick.

1040
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,084
This headband is not Egyptian.

1041
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:01,185
It's clearly Phoenician.

1042
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,320
- Really?
- Yes.

1043
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,088
I'll talk to props. Thank you.

1044
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,024
Cucumbers? Eggplant?

1045
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,291
Come on, Brent,
I need six shooters.

1046
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:08,560
E, that's why it's funny.

1047
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,261
They're expecting
to see six shooters.

1048
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,830
You pull out vegetables,
it's a comedy!

1049
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,213
You'll need it before
the journey's end.

1050
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,781
Let's be gone, young one.

1051
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,324
Oh, take this amulet man.

1052
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,825
Wear this shit,
it's gonna protect you.

1053
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,263
You gonna need it before
the end of the journey.

1054
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,331
Let's get the fuck outta here,
let's go.

1055
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,367
Ah.

1056
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:51,936
Ah.

1057
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:56,974
- Oh!
- Motherfucker...

1058
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,258
Thank you.

1059
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,364
Well, uh,

1060
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,234
thanks for coming.

1061
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:26,370
You see the look on the one
with the hair like this?

1062
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,774
She was not having us.

1063
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,108
I think they cursed us.

1064
00:53:33,812 --> 00:53:36,614
We don't really need
those curtains anyway.

1065
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,085
We sure worked hard
for it though.

1066
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:50,828
Shut the fuck up.

1067
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:54,798
Can't believe that
you picked that scene.

1068
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,703
But they loved it.

1069
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,739
Oh!

1070
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,906
Shit.

1071
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,548
This is good. This might work.

1072
00:54:15,153 --> 00:54:16,287
Yo, how about this for you, man?

1073
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:17,554
Here you go.

1074
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,090
Bam.

1075
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,928
What's up? You all right?

1076
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,295
Yeah.

1077
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,398
It's just,

1078
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,837
my slings and arrows
on the inside

1079
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:37,943
and all this make believe
acting and college degrees...

1080
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:43,314
It don't really change
the fact I'm a gangster

1081
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:46,417
and that's my destiny.

1082
00:54:46,518 --> 00:54:49,019
That's what's waiting for me
on the outside, bro.

1083
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,356
It's like Hamlet.

1084
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,193
All he wants is Maid Marion,

1085
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:58,362
and he'll go against
the whole Greek army.

1086
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,764
But to what end?

1087
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,433
What?

1088
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,035
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1089
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:05,770
I keep forgetting
how different

1090
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,839
this version of <i>Hamlet</i> is
from the original.

1091
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:12,543
Yo. What I...

1092
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:15,846
what I do know,
if I don't know anything,

1093
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,382
is you're an artist.

1094
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:20,518
This is just bringing
out parts of yourself

1095
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,421
that has been hidden,
you know, remained dormant.

1096
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,291
Just go for it, trust it.

1097
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:28,826
All right? Leave all the
other shit behind.

1098
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:29,994
Go full out.

1099
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,998
Try something new,
get into some shit like this.

1100
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:35,767
No, I'm not gonna never
get into no shit like this.

1101
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:37,235
Why the fuck you ain't
gonna get in this?

1102
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:38,570
This is fucking regal,
it's a prince.

1103
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,040
How about this? Look.
How about that with the towel?

1104
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,109
- Nah, it's not my thing.
- All right, well,
that's all right.

1105
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,410
A towel?
Come on, bro.

1106
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:47,545
All right, well, how about...

1107
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:48,546
- Find something for me, man.
- I don't know.

1108
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:49,948
Something I could rock, man.

1109
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:51,582
Yo. How about this?
How about this? Look.

1110
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,683
That's kind of funky.

1111
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:54,585
I might could do
something with that.

1112
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:55,653
All right.

1113
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,055
- I might could rock that.
- There you go.

1114
00:55:57,155 --> 00:55:58,589
All right.
Either this or the towel,
I think.

1115
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,991
I think this towel might-

1116
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:01,325
Come on, bro, why you keep
trying to put me in the towel?

1117
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:02,393
I told you this right here, man.

1118
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,107
Who next? Who next?

1119
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,209
Wait, I thought
you were gonna
do some shit next.

1120
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:20,878
You gotta do that.

1121
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,314
- Whoa.
- Oh!

1122
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:24,615
That one, that one!

1123
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,356
<i>♪ Ba da cha da da ♪</i>

1124
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:32,423
<i>- ♪ Cha ♪</i>
- Hey, lock it up, lock it up.

1125
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:33,758
Lock it up.

1126
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,426
Lock it! Lock it!
Lock it! Lock it!

1127
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:36,894
Lock it! Ah!

1128
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,397
Yeah!

1129
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,465
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1130
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:51,208
Go, go, go, go.

1131
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,145
Blaze, what about you?

1132
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,349
There you go.

1133
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,650
Whoa!

1134
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:02,920
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!

1135
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,491
Go Brent. Go Brent.

1136
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,759
No man, I'm too white!

1137
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,495
Go Brent, go Brent!

1138
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,399
<i>To be</i>

1139
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:17,000
<i>or not to be.</i>

1140
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:19,236
That is the question.

1141
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,508
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

1142
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:26,711
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

1143
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:31,449
or to take arms against
the sea of troubles

1144
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,717
and by opposing, end them.

1145
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,019
To die.

1146
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:37,921
To sleep.

1147
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,459
And by asleep to say we end

1148
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,527
the thousand natural heartaches

1149
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,162
that flesh is heir to.

1150
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:49,900
'Tis a consummation
devoutly wished.

1151
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,968
To die.

1152
00:57:52,403 --> 00:57:53,570
To sleep.

1153
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,641
To sleep,

1154
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:00,677
perchance,

1155
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,116
perchance...

1156
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,421
Line?

1157
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:11,989
Yo!

1158
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,431
The champ is here!

1159
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:21,632
Where Brent at?

1160
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,167
Where Brent at? Hey Brent,
how'd I do, Brent?

1161
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,236
You did it!
Ooh, wee!

1162
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:32,510
Listen, I don't mean to
step on your toes or nothing,

1163
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,144
but I know
you haven't had time

1164
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:35,146
to prepare for your

1165
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:36,681
- parole board hearing.
-Mmm-hmm.

1166
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:38,415
- So I took the liberty to, uh...
-Liberty?

1167
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:39,918
...do some prep work.

1168
00:58:40,018 --> 00:58:42,486
Man, what I told you
the last time
we talked about this shit?

1169
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:43,688
Oh, come on, man.

1170
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,957
All you gotta do is, like,
fill out the essay

1171
00:58:46,057 --> 00:58:47,625
and I just need some
addresses that I don't have.

1172
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:48,793
Listen man,
how you sitting up here

1173
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:50,628
with all this faith
in the system?

1174
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:51,996
The system don't
give a fuck about us.

1175
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,532
The system that's trying
to keep you in here.

1176
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:57,334
Even with all the evidence
that you got

1177
00:58:57,435 --> 00:58:59,069
to prove your innocence.

1178
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,038
What do I got bro?
I got nothing.

1179
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,273
They gonna slam me.

1180
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:03,908
What you trying
to tell me? They got you?

1181
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:05,242
- Who got me?
- Letting you think

1182
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,343
that you belong in here.

1183
00:59:06,444 --> 00:59:07,945
- No, man.
- They got you.

1184
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:11,248
Well, what I got out there?
All my people in here.

1185
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,318
My son is in here, shit.

1186
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:15,520
Sometimes I think

1187
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,754
this might be the best place
for me right now.

1188
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,756
No, no. Don't say that shit.
Don't say that.

1189
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:20,391
That's what they
want you to think.

1190
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:21,425
They want you
to think you some

1191
00:59:21,526 --> 00:59:22,860
motherfucking lapdog
or some shit.

1192
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:24,796
When you're not that
and you know you're not that.

1193
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,964
You know who you are?
You know who you are?

1194
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:30,167
Let me remind you,
you're a motherfucking wolf.

1195
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,235
All right?

1196
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,603
A wolf.

1197
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,372
Yo, listen man,
I heard sometimes

1198
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:35,707
you might not even
get a decision.

1199
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,775
You sitting on your bunk
waiting and waiting and shit.

1200
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:38,843
Not the truth, not the truth.

1201
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:40,777
What they give you
is a letter.

1202
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,680
Thick as a brick,

1203
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,348
you keeping your ass here.

1204
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,218
Light as a feather,
you're free.

1205
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,756
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

1206
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:54,858
I do all that shit right
there, man, and it don't work?

1207
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,528
You try again.

1208
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,096
And again.

1209
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,098
And again. And again.

1210
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,200
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

1211
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:09,272
Well, how long
this essay gotta be?

1212
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,543
That's my boy. That's my boy.

1213
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,312
Come on.

1214
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:16,747
They better let me out
off this bullshit too.

1215
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,782
Come on. Come on.

1216
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:24,555
I can't sleep.

1217
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,022
It's too hot.

1218
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:27,858
You're too hyped.

1219
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,793
It's the play, man.

1220
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:31,628
Shit is wild, right?

1221
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:32,997
Yeah.

1222
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:36,700
Space and time and histories.

1223
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:40,337
And, I still haven't
cracked that whole

1224
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:42,439
time portal thing, but...

1225
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:47,311
you know
what's really fun though?

1226
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:48,145
What?

1227
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:50,514
Playing all those
characters and names

1228
01:00:50,615 --> 01:00:53,584
in one piece,
'cause that's me, man.

1229
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,753
That's my whole life.

1230
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:58,322
It's like the name game thing.

1231
01:00:58,422 --> 01:00:59,857
You remember Role Call?

1232
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,359
My name is...

1233
01:01:01,459 --> 01:01:02,660
Yeah, but that's
what all the girls did.

1234
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,964
No, man, everybody
did that. Except for me.

1235
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:09,100
- I couldn't do it.
-  Why?

1236
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,168
Name was
too damn long.

1237
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,336
Wait, wait, wait.

1238
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:13,804
What's your whole name, man?

1239
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:15,906
Come on, man,
my government name?

1240
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,674
- Do I know your... Wait.
-Yeah.

1241
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:19,010
How many... What?

1242
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:24,114
My Christian name, Miguel
Francisco Benjamin Garcon.

1243
01:01:25,283 --> 01:01:28,385
Benjamin? Is that
like Arabic or something?

1244
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:29,687
Benjamin.

1245
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:33,657
Come on, man, you don't
know Spanish for shit.

1246
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:36,127
I mean, we're islanders.

1247
01:01:36,227 --> 01:01:37,761
So I guess it
could be anything.

1248
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,930
But, you know, the only thing

1249
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:42,466
I answered to
growing up, though,

1250
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:43,867
Miguelito.

1251
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,603
That's what my
grandmother called me.

1252
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,171
Miguelito.

1253
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,341
She was my word and my God, man.

1254
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:55,112
Miguelito. Mm-hmm.

1255
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:57,247
You remember the clique
I came with, right?

1256
01:01:57,348 --> 01:01:58,549
There was two Mikes.

1257
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,586
So they thought it was, like,
Mike and then I was Mike Mike.

1258
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:03,888
But nah.

1259
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:08,458
You know, G, that came
from outside, from before.

1260
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,863
When I used to be high, high.

1261
01:02:12,964 --> 01:02:17,702
They say, "Mike do his dope
for Mike."

1262
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:19,970
And then he always
come right back again

1263
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:24,575
and do more dope for Mike,
so Mike Mike.

1264
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:27,544
Yeah, man.
That shit was so nice,

1265
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:29,212
I had to do it twice.

1266
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,049
Yeah.

1267
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:33,116
And more.

1268
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:34,985
And more.

1269
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,387
Hoo.

1270
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,257
I was fucked up.

1271
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,501
I really did fuck up, man.

1272
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,574
That was the one thing
that broke my grandma.

1273
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,112
Drugs and me.

1274
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,118
But that's me, man.

1275
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,355
That's what I work on in here.

1276
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:15,125
That's why I'm good in here.

1277
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,428
I mean,

1278
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:19,496
I'm here...

1279
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:21,932
and I'm good.

1280
01:03:25,136 --> 01:03:27,872
You know
they called me...

1281
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:30,708
a couple names
in the neighborhood.

1282
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,042
They called me Mix Machine.

1283
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,577
- Yeah.
-My DJ name.

1284
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:34,779
Yep.

1285
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37,815
And then
they called me, uh...

1286
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,116
you know, they call me
Divine G in here,

1287
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:41,318
but they called me
Davey at home.

1288
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:42,453
Davey.

1289
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:46,290
Yeah, Davey,
when I was at the Fame school.

1290
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,092
The High School of Performing
Arts in Manhattan.

1291
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:49,993
- Ooh.
-For dancing.

1292
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:52,963
You mean the Irene Cara thing?

1293
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,065
So you was Leroy?

1294
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,801
No, I wasn't Leroy,

1295
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,336
but there were a whole
lot of Leroys there.

1296
01:03:58,436 --> 01:04:00,904
But let me tell you, those
Leroys could dance and fight.

1297
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,339
- Okay?
-You danced?

1298
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,307
Me and my boys. What?

1299
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:04,608
-You danced too?
- Yeah, I danced.

1300
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,677
I danced modern and ballet.

1301
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:07,845
-Hmm, tutus...
- And ballet

1302
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:09,013
was not what you think
it is, all right?

1303
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:10,114
- Ballet is like...
-The tutus

1304
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,182
- and everything, right?
- ...disciplined.

1305
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:14,919
It is, um... It's physical.

1306
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,988
It's strong. It's like
football, to be honest.

1307
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:21,191
It takes a lot of focus
and dedication.

1308
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,995
Man, I used to love to do that.

1309
01:04:25,096 --> 01:04:27,865
But I couldn't because I
had to fight every day.

1310
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,400
Once the fellas found out
in the neighborhood,

1311
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,302
I'd be fighting every
time I went home, man.

1312
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,370
"Yo,

1313
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:35,906
"you wear them tights.
Yo, faggot, whatever."

1314
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,975
Like, everybody
thinks something about you

1315
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:39,476
just because you dance.

1316
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,014
I gave it up, man.

1317
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,952
Man, the things you give up.

1318
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,292
Yeah, I miss it.

1319
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,665
Man... if I only
stayed with it, man.

1320
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,736
I ain't thinking
about that, you know,

1321
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:07,170
you can't look back.

1322
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:11,241
What if I kept, what if I did?

1323
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:16,012
Mike Mike?

1324
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:19,617
Oh, man.

1325
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:22,820
All right, I listen to
your bullshit stories

1326
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,388
about being called
Benjamin and whatnot.

1327
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:30,460
Good night.

1328
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,088
Yeah, I'm still here.

1329
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,357
Where's the body?

1330
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,926
I don't know, they
bagged it before my shift.

1331
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:04,761
Didn't have
much property so...

1332
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,798
Well,
don't be late for lunch.

1333
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,199
I ain't gonna
wait on you all day.

1334
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,068
Yeah, I know.

1335
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,698
I could understand
a person hanging up.

1336
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:45,702
I could even understand
a person getting stabbed.

1337
01:06:47,905 --> 01:06:49,506
But a brain aneurysm?

1338
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,375
I don't get it.

1339
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:01,452
You know, when they called me
down to the chapel

1340
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:03,686
and let me know
my mom had passed,

1341
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:08,492
I sat in the audience

1342
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:10,294
while RTA
was putting on a show.

1343
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:13,497
Mike Mike was on stage,
you know,

1344
01:07:13,598 --> 01:07:16,833
every performance after that,
I came down and watched him.

1345
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,269
Mike Mike brought me in.

1346
01:07:26,844 --> 01:07:29,746
I guess Mike Mike's gonna
finally visit the Island.

1347
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,160
Is there
anything you need

1348
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,495
to talk about, bro?

1349
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:46,463
Everything that needed to be
said got said, right?

1350
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:48,766
I'm only asking,
bro, because you ain't

1351
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:50,334
having much to say when
we was in the circle.

1352
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:51,734
What's that supposed to mean?

1353
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,473
G, I don't mean no disrespect
or nothing.

1354
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:59,210
I'm always here
for you, if you ever need me.

1355
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,912
I got a dozen letters to
write to his family tonight.

1356
01:08:02,013 --> 01:08:05,215
What I need to do right now
is finish with these chairs.

1357
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:11,421
All right, man, listen,
my bad. Peace.

1358
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:47,958
Ahoy, mateys!

1359
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:52,028
I think I spy a ship
on the horizon.

1360
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,798
Nah, that's not a ship.

1361
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:56,399
It's a sailboat.

1362
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:03,940
<i>No, no, no, Mom.
That's not what I'm saying.</i>

1363
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,142
But you just have to tell them

1364
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:06,243
that they can't
talk to you like that.

1365
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:07,577
That's all I'm trying to say.

1366
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,581
Well, if you're not gonna
do anything about it

1367
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:11,949
then I don't even know
why we're...

1368
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:14,885
I don't know why we're talking
about it then, all right?

1369
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,653
Just let them
run over you then.

1370
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,124
Oh, man. Ma, I'm sorry.

1371
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,965
No, no, I'm not nervous.

1372
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:29,366
I'm just ready for it
to be done.

1373
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:32,369
I'm just, you know,
just waiting.

1374
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,844
I'm just ready to see you, Mom.

1375
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,416
I'm ready to see you.

1376
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,156
Mr. Whitfield.

1377
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,192
This is a clemency hearing

1378
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:58,295
for your conviction of
murder in the second

1379
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,097
as well as weapons possession.

1380
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,566
Two counts on each,
25 to life.

1381
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:05,735
Two to seven, and
five to 15 respectively.

1382
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:06,836
That is correct.

1383
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:09,105
Okay.

1384
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:16,647
I will note at the outset

1385
01:10:16,747 --> 01:10:20,384
that we were able to acquire
the sentencing minutes

1386
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:23,720
and they will be considered
as well as your parole packet.

1387
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,721
Yes.

1388
01:10:24,822 --> 01:10:25,956
But we are talking about

1389
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:30,427
the March 25th, 1988 homicide
of Randall Birch.

1390
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:33,396
He had been shot many times
in the head and body, correct?

1391
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,032
As far as I understand.

1392
01:10:36,133 --> 01:10:38,201
And in terms of this offense,

1393
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:41,071
you have exhausted
your appeals.

1394
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,172
- Yes.
-You had

1395
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,507
the Innocence Project
look at it.

1396
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:45,642
Legal Aid.
You hired an investigator.

1397
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:48,912
Apparently you've raised
other issues of, um,

1398
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:51,682
prosecutorial and police
department misconduct.

1399
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:55,352
And there were some other
exculpatory statements

1400
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:56,553
made by another person

1401
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,822
that were never given
to you for your trial.

1402
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,291
Another man confessed
to the crime on that tape,

1403
01:11:01,392 --> 01:11:03,260
but it was buried along
with other key evidence.

1404
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,429
Yes, and that's
part of the issue.

1405
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,764
It's been next to impossible

1406
01:11:07,865 --> 01:11:10,633
for us
to authenticate the validity.

1407
01:11:11,802 --> 01:11:14,972
The person who
made it is deceased

1408
01:11:15,072 --> 01:11:18,308
and we can't get the DA's
office to return our calls.

1409
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:19,610
I don't know how...
what I can...

1410
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:20,844
You
understand that this creates

1411
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,046
a complicated legal issue,
don't you?

1412
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,418
- Yes. But I...
- Since you've been in custody,

1413
01:11:28,519 --> 01:11:31,188
you've been involved
in numerous programs.

1414
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:33,991
It's too long a list
for me to go through.

1415
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:37,761
But I do have a question
about the theater program.

1416
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,797
You've been involved in that
many years, have you not?

1417
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:41,798
Yes. Uh, yes ma'am.

1418
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:45,535
I am a founding member
of this program.

1419
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:46,870
It's something
I'm very proud of.

1420
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,671
And what part do you play

1421
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:49,706
in this program?

1422
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,241
Actor? Director?

1423
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,476
Well, we all do a few things.

1424
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:54,511
I'm on what is called
the Steering Committee.

1425
01:11:54,612 --> 01:11:58,615
We make a lot of decisions
for how it operates, and...

1426
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:01,785
from time to time
I do act, like we all do,

1427
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:06,323
and um... it's been a program
that was established

1428
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:09,526
to help the population
with management skills.

1429
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:13,663
And it's turned into something
a bit more, I don't know,

1430
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:17,467
wonderful,
because it helps people

1431
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:18,669
get more in touch
with their feelings

1432
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:21,471
and able to process
and actually move through

1433
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,875
and truly get
some rehabilitation.

1434
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:28,411
So are you acting at all
during this interview?

1435
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,052
Absolutely not. Uh...

1436
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,557
I truly hope that
you can understand

1437
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:42,292
that I've been very sincere.

1438
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,894
I know how meaningful this is.

1439
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:45,929
I would never...

1440
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:48,832
Actually, that's not
the intention of acting.

1441
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,935
Acting is just to, you know, process.

1442
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,135
I read about the program.

1443
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,037
It's a good program.

1444
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:57,340
Okay.

1445
01:12:58,008 --> 01:13:00,409
Any other questions
from the board?

1446
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:05,282
Well, thank you,
Mr. Whitfield.

1447
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,350
We'll take all of this
into account

1448
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:10,152
and deliver our decision
in two weeks.

1449
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:19,655
You're going home.

1450
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:22,558
Yeah.

1451
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,194
I can hardly believe it.

1452
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:27,129
It don't even seem real.

1453
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:35,805
What about you?

1454
01:14:57,894 --> 01:15:00,296
I wouldn't even be here
without you, beloved.

1455
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,833
Thank you for everything.

1456
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:14,076
C'mon,
they're waiting for you.

1457
01:15:32,596 --> 01:15:34,564
The tree costume
is great.

1458
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:37,233
This looks perfect,
don't lose any of those.

1459
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:42,605
Reach for the sky, Marshall.

1460
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:46,175
You look just like Gary
Cooper, you know that?

1461
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:47,276
- My lady!
- Hey!

1462
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:48,445
You've arrived!

1463
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,080
- So good to have you here.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

1464
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,414
- We'll talk? We'll talk later.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1465
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:52,582
We got it.

1466
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,684
Ah!

1467
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,923
I told you I was no ghoul.

1468
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:01,924
I'm happy as the
Gravedigger now.

1469
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:02,826
Thank you.

1470
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:04,895
15 years since
I put on a suit.

1471
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:07,730
And you look good champ
but can I get this mirror?

1472
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:18,208
Take this sacred amulet
and wear it.

1473
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,810
You will need it before
your journey's end.

1474
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:31,120
<i>Well, we made it.</i>

1475
01:16:31,821 --> 01:16:33,389
Still a lot more work to do.

1476
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:40,364
Dress rehearsal, this is when
you guys get to grow.

1477
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:43,566
It's when the director
kind of lets go

1478
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,935
and lets you guys take over.

1479
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,305
So don't be afraid
to try things.

1480
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:51,608
No acting allowed.

1481
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,544
A lot of listening,
let's listen to each other.

1482
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,212
Let's support each other.

1483
01:16:57,748 --> 01:17:01,218
I want to thank you guys
for trusting the process.

1484
01:17:01,318 --> 01:17:03,820
I know we're thinking
about Mike Mike right now.

1485
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,890
And I want you to know,
I got a feeling Mike Mike

1486
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:09,058
has not left the building.

1487
01:17:10,227 --> 01:17:12,261
So we're gonna do this
for Mike Mike.

1488
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,998
Let's go, man.
Bring it on in here.

1489
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,633
- Bring it in.
-Everybody.

1490
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:18,568
-All right. Yep. Yep.
- We got it?

1491
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:20,203
One, two, three.

1492
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:21,504
RTA!

1493
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:23,272
- Yeah. Yeah.
-Whoo!

1494
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:42,825
I am Alotincommon.

1495
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:48,464
I am the high priest of Egypt
from the year...

1496
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,833
Hell, it was a long time ago.

1497
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:55,839
Sweet Egyptian
Princess Neotali

1498
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:58,240
has been the victim
of a murder,

1499
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:02,245
a crime most foul.

1500
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:08,084
She was a good mummy,
to her little one she named,

1501
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:09,218
Leslie.

1502
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:14,724
Mummy?

1503
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:17,092
Mummy? Is that you?

1504
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,630
Oh, Mummy, I miss you so.

1505
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:22,965
Now I am a prisoner.

1506
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,168
Yes.

1507
01:18:25,269 --> 01:18:30,274
Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains.

1508
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,710
And so
the young lovers set out

1509
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:38,381
on their journey seeking
something black and white,

1510
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,349
above water and sky.

1511
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:55,865
Oy!

1512
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:58,134
I think I found
her here, guv'nor.

1513
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,003
What a pretty mess
she turned out to be.

1514
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:02,972
Wait.

1515
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,951
Keep this with you always.

1516
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:16,152
Keep it near to your heart,

1517
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,187
so that you'll always
remember me.

1518
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:42,011
Yo, these are mine.

1519
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:45,581
My bad.

1520
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:00,029
Zakariedies' got me locked

1521
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,898
into a 25 year
no pay contract.

1522
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:03,199
If I don't do what he says

1523
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,367
and be his
number one gladiator,

1524
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,102
he's gonna kill my wife
and daughters,

1525
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:07,836
and feed me to the lions.

1526
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,741
Line?

1527
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,476
We sure could
have used you

1528
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:16,112
for some serious backup.

1529
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,649
Why, we sure could use
you for some serious backup.

1530
01:20:19,749 --> 01:20:22,218
Yeah, we sure coulda used
you for some serious backup.

1531
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,253
And then I say...

1532
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:27,157
Never fear!
Gladiator Goliathan is here.

1533
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:31,827
I'll smash 'em and bash 'em,
whether short or tall.

1534
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,229
Got it?

1535
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,966
And then I come out and
say the most profound line.

1536
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:40,570
If you help me escape,
consider it done.

1537
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,739
And remember everybody
say it like it's really funny,

1538
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,874
'cause it's a comedy.

1539
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:47,843
Ha, ha, ha.
It's a fucking comedy, yeah.

1540
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,453
Uh.

1541
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:58,520
Okay, men.

1542
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,490
- Let's take five.
- Why?

1543
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:02,925
Why Brent?

1544
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,127
Like it's gonna
fucking matter?

1545
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,562
Like we're gonna
get any fucking better?

1546
01:21:05,662 --> 01:21:08,565
Like he's gonna remember
any fucking line he has?

1547
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:11,000
You tell us to trust
the fucking process, right?

1548
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,102
Well, the process is fucked!

1549
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,973
I think we need
more than five, Brent,

1550
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:18,041
for him to learn
his fucking lines.

1551
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:19,075
Hey, c'mon, brother.
Let's take a walk.

1552
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:20,776
Yo, get the fuck off of me.

1553
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:21,844
The fuck you gonna do?

1554
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:24,580
You gonna step? You wanna step?

1555
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,647
Yeah?

1556
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:29,585
What the fuck
are you wearing, man?

1557
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:31,053
What the fuck are we doing?

1558
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,558
This silly bullshit we do
every fucking six months,

1559
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:39,062
as if it fucking matters, man.
And we're still fucked.

1560
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:41,530
We're still right back
where we fucking start.

1561
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,474
Are you done?

1562
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:53,542
No.

1563
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,348
I'm not done.

1564
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:04,586
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

1565
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:38,621
Yo, this is gonna set
us back for how long now?

1566
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:39,755
He walked away.

1567
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,090
He just walked away.

1568
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,291
You can't do that.

1569
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:44,127
We're all going through stuff.

1570
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:46,062
This is about
acting professionally.

1571
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:48,297
We're in the middle
of a production.

1572
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:52,001
We all have breaking points.

1573
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:54,304
Listen, we all understand
breaking points.

1574
01:22:54,404 --> 01:22:56,906
We've all been through
our own breaking points,

1575
01:22:57,006 --> 01:23:00,776
yet we show up and we do
what we have to do.

1576
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,045
You have to.

1577
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:41,310
<i>So I want you to
picture in your mind's eye</i>

1578
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,580
a very dear and old friend

1579
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:47,182
that you haven't seen
for a very long time,

1580
01:24:48,151 --> 01:24:50,185
but you'd love
to see him again.

1581
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:55,458
So what does that look like?

1582
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:57,360
And what does he look like?

1583
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,495
Is he taller now or shorter?

1584
01:25:01,631 --> 01:25:03,632
Does he still got
the same haircut?

1585
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,802
Maybe he needs a shave.

1586
01:25:09,673 --> 01:25:12,775
Maybe he looks a little bit
different, a little bit older.

1587
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,176
We're all getting older.

1588
01:25:15,512 --> 01:25:19,648
Have that brotherly feeling
of love and safeness.

1589
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:22,217
What would that be like?

1590
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,653
Should be joyful.

1591
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:27,456
Should be wonderful.

1592
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,661
You know?

1593
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,865
Just to be with that person
one more time.

1594
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:45,808
You can open your eyes now.

1595
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:47,076
Was it me?

1596
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:54,216
Oh, what's good, boys?

1597
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:56,218
Oh, man, it's good to see y'all.

1598
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,287
Yo, good to see you, man.

1599
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,356
Dapper Dapper,
you still here, bro?

1600
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:02,458
Tell us
what's going on outside, man.

1601
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:03,826
Oh, man.

1602
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:05,728
The world, man.

1603
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:09,499
I get up, 4:30
I'm in that bakery, man.

1604
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:14,603
Pumping out donuts,
cheesecake. Grinding.

1605
01:26:14,838 --> 01:26:18,574
But, man, I take so much joy
in just being out at night,

1606
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:21,110
you know what I'm saying?
Like, it's summertime,

1607
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,313
10 o'clock at night,
you know what I mean?

1608
01:26:23,413 --> 01:26:25,848
You go to the basket and still
seeing kids out there.

1609
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,450
Remember how we used
to play ball at night?

1610
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,051
Like, you go to
the schoolyard
or wherever at night

1611
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:30,252
and play ball and whatnot.

1612
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:32,288
Bam, I just walk past.
See the...

1613
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:33,890
Oh, man, you know.

1614
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:38,761
But then my greatest joy,
my greatest joy, right?

1615
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:42,064
It's washing my car,
going to the car wash,

1616
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:44,366
getting that baby
spit fine clean,

1617
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:47,703
finding me a destination.

1618
01:26:49,005 --> 01:26:52,541
Go grab my dog,
put my road dog on the side,

1619
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:57,780
throw my jazz on,
hit the road at 60,

1620
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,283
throw that cruise on
and let everything else go.

1621
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:02,618
I got up the other day, man,

1622
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,487
at two o'clock in the morning
and made some pancakes

1623
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:07,189
and grits and shit
just because I could.

1624
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:10,559
That feel good as hell.

1625
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:13,395
On another note though, right?

1626
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:15,997
I just had to put my dog down.

1627
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,501
Hey.

1628
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:22,771
I had a 85 pound red nose
pit bull named Girly.

1629
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:25,441
That bitch,
all she wanted to do,

1630
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:27,343
she thought she was a lap dog.

1631
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,545
She just wanna lay in your lap
and eat Scooby snacks.

1632
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:33,615
You know what I'm saying?
She just wanna play.

1633
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:39,288
But, um, she was sick
and I didn't know.

1634
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:40,789
And so,

1635
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:43,526
her nose started bleeding.

1636
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:46,328
She was...
She was the only one

1637
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:47,530
that was really
happy to see me

1638
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,432
when I walked
through the door.

1639
01:27:49,532 --> 01:27:51,567
You know what I mean?
She, uh...

1640
01:27:51,668 --> 01:27:53,736
She looked... the day that
we had to put her down,

1641
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:56,305
I couldn't really...
I couldn't go.

1642
01:27:56,406 --> 01:28:00,375
'Cause I'm not gonna watch
nobody walk my dog off.

1643
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:08,417
She was suffering,
she was suffering.

1644
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:13,855
This emotional
rollercoaster, man, is really...

1645
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,693
it's really something else.
And it don't hit you at first

1646
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:20,630
'cause everything is...
Everything is lovely.

1647
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:23,632
You know what I mean?
It's cotton candy, baby.

1648
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:25,568
You know, peaches and cream.

1649
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:26,669
First years out, you get...

1650
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:28,737
It's exciting
getting to know them.

1651
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:32,808
But then, you know,
you settle down.

1652
01:28:32,909 --> 01:28:36,012
You find out you
got these feelings, man.

1653
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:40,349
And everybody want a piece
of your feelings, you know?

1654
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:45,454
And because you care,
you open up.

1655
01:28:45,588 --> 01:28:48,089
And that's when the hurting
come on in, you know.

1656
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,159
But, uh, yeah,

1657
01:28:50,259 --> 01:28:51,494
Brent asked me to come in

1658
01:28:51,594 --> 01:28:53,429
'cause y'all got this
production coming up

1659
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:55,765
and here I am
with all this heavy shit

1660
01:28:55,865 --> 01:28:57,934
sucking the air
out of the room, right?

1661
01:28:58,034 --> 01:29:00,369
- Oh, man. But listen...
-It's all right.

1662
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:01,770
It's real.

1663
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:02,905
Yeah.

1664
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,274
I appreciate that, man.

1665
01:29:05,374 --> 01:29:07,510
So on that vein, yo...

1666
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:11,214
But you think maybe like
we could do a exercise

1667
01:29:11,314 --> 01:29:14,583
or something so I could be
reinvigorated, re-energized?

1668
01:29:14,684 --> 01:29:16,052
Definitely, man,
let's get up on our feet.

1669
01:29:16,152 --> 01:29:18,654
This ain't no goddamn
sewing circle, come on.

1670
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:20,223
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

1671
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:22,825
So let's shake up this
space for brother Charlie.

1672
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:25,861
Let's walk around,
let's walk around here.

1673
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:27,163
Let's walk it out...

1674
01:29:27,263 --> 01:29:29,965
What it's like when the air
is really heavy and hot?

1675
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,102
You know, I was artistic
as a kid, you know.

1676
01:30:06,202 --> 01:30:09,438
Used to draw, paint... like
those little geese right there

1677
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:10,739
and everything.

1678
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,774
Man.

1679
01:30:14,309 --> 01:30:15,510
That was dope.

1680
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,616
Yeah, man.

1681
01:30:23,653 --> 01:30:26,588
Mom used to try
to tell me to paint a lot

1682
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:28,523
and I skipped over that.

1683
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,027
You know where
that landed me, so...

1684
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:36,032
I got a label.

1685
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:41,137
Everybody perceived me to be
a thug, a gangster, whatever.

1686
01:30:41,404 --> 01:30:43,772
And that kind of like
put me in a box

1687
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,608
and you don't have a box.

1688
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:50,145
Everywhere I saw you
at in the jail,

1689
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:51,480
you always was Divine G

1690
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,682
and you was free to be that

1691
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,250
because you
didn't have a label.

1692
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:59,888
And I see that
you need help, bro.

1693
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:02,557
But you won't ask for it.

1694
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:07,630
You got all of us here,
man. We love you, bro.

1695
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,165
We gonna do anything
we can for you.

1696
01:31:09,265 --> 01:31:14,270
But you refuse to extend your
hand to ask for help, bro.

1697
01:31:14,537 --> 01:31:17,272
As many brothers as you
helped in here.

1698
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,785
I fucked up.

1699
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:32,020
Yeah, you did,
you fucked up.

1700
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:34,723
But, you know, we all know you.

1701
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:36,992
We all love you
and we took a vote.

1702
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:41,463
Yeah, everybody's willing
to take you back right now

1703
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:43,932
under one condition.

1704
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:46,301
What is that?

1705
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:49,105
Well...

1706
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:53,175
you gotta, you gotta admit
wholeheartedly,

1707
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:54,843
possibly even in writing

1708
01:31:56,145 --> 01:31:58,847
that I murdered that
Hamlet scene, bro.

1709
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:01,083
I mean listen, man,

1710
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:04,486
the dude Shakespeare is
in his grave right now.

1711
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:07,189
He rolled over
just to hear that magic

1712
01:32:07,289 --> 01:32:08,690
I put on that thing, man.

1713
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:13,161
You did your thing, beloved.

1714
01:32:13,262 --> 01:32:15,163
Yes, I did, beloved.

1715
01:32:25,574 --> 01:32:27,909
Everybody, let's just
take a cleansing,

1716
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:29,044
deep breath.

1717
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:33,982
Just let it all go.

1718
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:40,589
Who would have thunk,

1719
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:43,359
that the beginning of
the healing for this planet

1720
01:32:43,459 --> 01:32:46,861
would start right here
behind the walls of Sing Sing.

1721
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:57,772
Anybody else have anything
they want to add right now?

1722
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:01,610
Yes, sir.

1723
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,786
Sometimes
it's just all a little

1724
01:33:10,886 --> 01:33:13,188
too much on the heart.

1725
01:33:15,324 --> 01:33:16,624
But that's no excuse.

1726
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,028
And I hope that
you could forgive me.

1727
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,736
Bring it in, RTA.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:33:27,837 --> 01:33:28,737
Gimme those hands.
Gimme those hands.

1729
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,138
- All right, all right.
- All right?

1730
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,840
One, two, three.

1731
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,374
RTA!

1732
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:08,677
Yo, B block,
they was loving it.

1733
01:34:08,777 --> 01:34:10,312
Yeah, see, the comedy...

1734
01:34:10,412 --> 01:34:11,680
Comedies are different, man.

1735
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,082
D-DAN: Yeah.
That was a little hard

1736
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:14,483
but it was... it's different,
it had a different hit.

1737
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,184
D-DAN: And Carmine, yo,

1738
01:34:16,285 --> 01:34:17,219
he came around in that

1739
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,487
- Gravedigger, didn't he?
-Gravedigger, yeah.

1740
01:34:18,587 --> 01:34:19,454
He definitely did.
D-DAN: Yeah!

1741
01:34:19,555 --> 01:34:20,556
You're right about that.

1742
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:23,358
Carmine did,
Blackseed, Winter, Tye.

1743
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:24,726
All of them did their thing.

1744
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:25,894
The cast stepped up.

1745
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:27,563
Yeah, the cast definitely
stepped up.

1746
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:29,031
And I still don't
understand time travel.

1747
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:30,099
We did all that,
I still don't understand.

1748
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:31,467
I don't think
we'll ever understand.

1749
01:34:31,567 --> 01:34:32,634
D-DAN: From pirates and... yeah.
I don't know how

1750
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:34,836
it got from Robin Hood
to pirates

1751
01:34:34,937 --> 01:34:36,205
and then all over the place.

1752
01:34:36,305 --> 01:34:37,639
D-DAN: All over the place.
That's the craziest thing.

1753
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,742
We were all over the place

1754
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:41,910
and the population was
still able to follow it.

1755
01:34:42,011 --> 01:34:43,112
D-DAN: They enjoyed it.
They enjoyed it.

1756
01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:45,213
-They got all that in there.
- D-DAN: Right.

1757
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:46,215
Shakespeare.

1758
01:34:46,315 --> 01:34:49,751
D-DAN: But fellas,
what are we gonna do next?

1759
01:34:51,453 --> 01:34:52,555
It's too hard to top.

1760
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:53,789
What do you think Dap?
Yeah, it's hard to top,

1761
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:54,923
I don't know, man.

1762
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,592
Divine, what you got for us?

1763
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:58,393
You always keep
something in the stash.

1764
01:34:58,494 --> 01:35:00,028
What you got
for us Divine G?

1765
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:01,096
Shit, what I got for you...

1766
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,298
I don't know,
I ain't got nothing.

1767
01:35:02,398 --> 01:35:04,999
I know you keep
something in the stash.

1768
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:08,169
D-DAN: You always
working on something, man.

1769
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,875
How about my play, <i>Fine Print?</i>

1770
01:35:12,975 --> 01:35:15,477
Wait, but it's a little
lost in the second act.

1771
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:16,545
But maybe I could...

1772
01:35:16,645 --> 01:35:18,380
Come on,
you got something else.

1773
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,949
Wait, all right, how about...

1774
01:35:20,049 --> 01:35:21,817
Man, I've been working on
this play for a couple years.

1775
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:23,117
Maybe it might work.

1776
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:25,120
It's called <i>Pro Se.</i>

1777
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:28,790
Now that's gonna
appeal to the population.

1778
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:30,592
It's a satire, man.

1779
01:35:30,692 --> 01:35:32,094
It's about this
dude who's been

1780
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:34,629
like working out, you know?
Just hitting the gym...

1781
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:41,309
Come on.

1782
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:47,748
Come on, man.

1783
01:40:05,234 --> 01:40:07,936
All right,
all right, we here man.

1784
01:40:08,036 --> 01:40:09,004
We out here now.

1785
01:40:09,104 --> 01:40:10,505
- Yeah.
- We out here now.

1786
01:40:10,606 --> 01:40:12,674
- Yeah. We out here now.
- We out here now.

1787
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:13,908
And we got work to do.

1788
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:17,612
What's up?
How you like my joint?

1789
01:40:17,712 --> 01:40:18,480
Ah, man.

1790
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:20,648
- Yeah, man, yeah.
- Yeah, it's good.

1791
01:40:20,749 --> 01:40:22,150
We out here.

1792
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,985
Yeah, oh, man.

1793
01:40:24,085 --> 01:40:25,187
We're cruising now.

1794
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:27,021
Oh, man, the air feels
different out here.

1795
01:40:27,122 --> 01:40:28,356
It is different.

1796
01:40:28,457 --> 01:40:30,926
We ain't gotta
smell no toilets

1797
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,727
or nothing out here.
Man, we good.

1798
01:40:32,828 --> 01:40:33,995
What you wearing?
Look at those.

1799
01:40:34,096 --> 01:40:35,563
Hey, where you gonna
get you some?

1800
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,467
Man. Man.

1801
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:40,535
Yeah.

1802
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,804
<i>(LIKE A BIRD</i> BY
ABRAHAM ALEXANDER

1803
01:40:42,904 --> 01:40:44,272
AND ADRIAN QUESADA PLAYING)

1804
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:52,907
I introduce to you

1805
01:41:53,008 --> 01:41:54,275
<i>Breakin' the Mummy's Code,</i>

1806
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,643
by Brent Buell.

1807
01:42:00,882 --> 01:42:02,717
Mummy. Mummy.

1808
01:42:02,817 --> 01:42:03,784
Is that you?

1809
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,402
Now indeed I am a prisoner.

1810
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:23,739
Yes.

1811
01:42:23,839 --> 01:42:28,643
Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains!

1812
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,136
You know,
I'm really tired of this

1813
01:42:55,236 --> 01:42:57,606
really miserable profession.

1814
01:42:57,706 --> 01:43:01,543
I don't wanna be all mean
and tough no more.

1815
01:43:01,643 --> 01:43:04,745
I want to be gentle and kind.

1816
01:43:06,314 --> 01:43:07,749
Really?

1817
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,617
Me too.

1818
01:43:15,057 --> 01:43:20,027
Keep this near to your heart
so that you will remember me.

1819
01:43:20,128 --> 01:43:21,295
Always.

1820
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:36,243
Let's go, Horatio!
