1
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,417
We'll split up

2
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,708
yu with chuliang

3
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
Ian, with me

4
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,498
why are we splitting up?

5
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,248
Why didn't you tell us before?

6
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,875
Follow orders

7
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,568
this way, if one
of us gets caught

8
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,365
we won't rat out the others

9
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,873
say a quick goodbye

10
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,907
we're still far from harbin

11
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,208
Sorry

12
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,206
I didn't think we'd be separated

13
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:26,781
whoever makes it

14
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,833
searches for our children

15
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,453
Can you still smell the blood?

16
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,958
Ready to talk now?

17
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes

18
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,250
I'll talk

19
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,289
You're scared, mr xie

20
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:02,917
how many came?

21
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,125
You know them all?

22
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Four

23
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I don't know them

24
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,625
from?

25
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,958
Ussr

26
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,663
why harbin?

27
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,125
They say

28
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,749
there's a secret
operation on the 18th

29
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,702
what secret operation?

30
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
I don't know

31
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,534
it's called

32
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,583
utrennya

33
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,788
what 'nya'?

34
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,949
Ut...

35
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,497
Utrennya

36
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:30,576
they put us

37
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,077
in charge of coordination

38
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,782
that's all I know

39
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,539
and I didn't dare ask

40
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,706
Are you hunting at tiger head?

41
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,366
Collecting hides
at sujia village

42
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,083
zhang?

43
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:03,917
I'm feng

44
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,123
we were sent to meet you

45
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,164
we'll take the train to harbin

46
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,198
there will be many
traps on the way

47
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,495
they're strict with searches

48
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,782
put guns, compasses,

49
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,623
anything suspicious

50
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,077
into this sack

51
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,785
someone will collect it

52
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,292
Thank you

53
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,250
feng

54
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,198
got a smoke?

55
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,910
When you get to harbin

56
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,698
can you get me a Colt?

57
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,542
A revolver?

58
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,782
American-made?

59
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:13,701
Hard to find

60
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,455
ask xia

61
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
xia has connections

62
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:16,792
we don't need him

63
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have my ways

64
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,498
You still have a gun on you?

65
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:27,792
Chuliang told me

66
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,202
to always be prepared

67
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,708
where is it?

68
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,750
On my body

69
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:32,830
what's wrong?

70
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,125
They are spies

71
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,167
don't look

72
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,618
Put it in my mitten

73
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,125
give it to me

74
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
don't move!

75
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,167
Hands up

76
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,875
What's wrong?

77
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,042
Tie him up

78
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,458
Feng

79
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,830
you've got it wrong

80
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,708
what?

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Zheng

82
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,167
you're really tying me up

83
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,667
what are you doing?

84
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Gently

85
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,456
Toss me the mitten

86
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:56,958
Try again

87
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,875
hurry

88
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,077
Come out with your hands up

89
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,743
It's good you screamed

90
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,868
it gave me the chance

91
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,740
I did it on purpose

92
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,206
how did you know
they were spies?

93
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,831
Xia, the guy I mentioned

94
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:14,917
doesn't exist

95
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,994
how did they know our codes?

96
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,452
We have a traitor

97
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,157
high up in the ranks

98
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,707
we must tell chuliang and yu now

99
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,243
Tell me about their leader

100
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
zhang xianchen

101
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,456
was a news reporter

102
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,035
of the four

103
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,333
he is the most educated

104
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,875
Two people coming

105
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,240
seems to be a man and a woman

106
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,743
is it zhang?

107
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,989
How would I know?

108
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,539
I've never seen their pictures

109
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,208
send the signal

110
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,535
Keep quiet

111
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,708
don't ask questions

112
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,393
they were trained in the ussr

113
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,417
they're top-level

114
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,369
I'm sure unit one
has made contact

115
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
don't worry

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's put

117
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,495
everything that
can blow our covers

118
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,958
and our weapons here

119
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,532
the organization
will handle them

120
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,994
From now on, stay close

121
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,864
work hard

122
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:08,917
you will be rewarded

123
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,125
thank you

124
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,417
section chief

125
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,414
we found feng and zheng's bodies

126
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,156
where?

127
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,288
Zone 5203

128
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,768
Team one's location is unknown

129
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,373
we are searching the area now

130
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,203
isn't feng experienced?

131
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,448
How did he get made?

132
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,038
The codes

133
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,083
are correct

134
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,702
the codes should be correct

135
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,083
team two has made contact

136
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,167
all is well

137
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,615
from what I know

138
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,206
neither team has radios

139
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,202
you mean

140
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,570
team one cannot
contact team two?

141
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,708
Yes

142
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:54,917
correct

143
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,458
section chief

144
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,934
shall we tighten security
at the train stations?

145
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:00,958
No

146
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Relax them

147
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
even looser than before

148
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
let them all get on the train

149
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,323
use team two to
draw out team one

150
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,413
"Traitors! Contacts are spies”

151
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,617
Stop

152
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,489
stop

153
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,372
can't you stand in line?

154
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,951
Get in line

155
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,292
do you speak Chinese?

156
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,535
Drunkard

157
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,747
Get your tickets ready

158
00:17:58,792 --> 00:17:59,792
ticket

159
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
ticket

160
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,292
Yours?

161
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,577
I'm just checking tickets

162
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,667
out of the way

163
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,833
your papers

164
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,577
Come with me

165
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,333
why?

166
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,833
Who are you?

167
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,875
Special task force

168
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,958
why me?

169
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,490
Cut the crap

170
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,833
standard check

171
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:50,917
you look suspicious

172
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Go

173
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,706
That girl just now

174
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,202
is our comrade

175
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,240
The girl the secret
agent just took away

176
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,115
we need to rescue her

177
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,118
is she with team one?

178
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:16,993
What did she tell you?

179
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,042
Nothing

180
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,782
we pretended to be strangers

181
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,792
and her partner?

182
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,542
I didn't see him

183
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,323
not on the train?

184
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,375
No

185
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,990
Mudanjiang station is next

186
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,330
prepare to alight

187
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,206
mudanjiang station is next

188
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,743
prepare to alight

189
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,410
we must determine

190
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,206
why she was taken

191
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,125
get off

192
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:04,792
What's wrong?

193
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,039
We'll take the next train

194
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,577
this train is unsafe

195
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,039
and the comrade?

196
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,282
She was taken by an agent

197
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,208
Tell you what

198
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,667
you go ahead

199
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,042
I'll find a way

200
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,167
no

201
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,657
Then we'll all be exposed

202
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
let's go

203
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,583
we'll take the next train

204
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,032
Hand over everything
in your belt

205
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,243
do you understand?

206
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,333
Hurry

207
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,748
Help!

208
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,873
What will chuliang and yu do?

209
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,285
They're surrounded by spies

210
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,907
she should have seen the message

211
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,365
they will find a way

212
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,493
we can't stay together

213
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,369
Where was the coded
message written?

214
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,958
Here

215
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,580
what did it say?

216
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,625
It said

217
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,083
traitors!

218
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,748
Contacts are spies

219
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,739
how did you change it?

220
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:25,907
I changed it

221
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:26,993
to say

222
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,157
all normal

223
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,869
see you 18th harbin

224
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,914
no one gets off here

225
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,327
we're going to hengdaohezi

226
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,660
have your tickets checked

227
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,327
we're going to hengdaohezi

228
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,455
have your tickets checked

229
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,118
give me your ticket

230
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,167
wait here

231
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,205
Looks quicker over there

232
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,792
stay in line here

233
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,583
Come with me

234
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
who are you?

235
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,749
Come when I tell you and shut up

236
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,458
let's go

237
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,750
come

238
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,452
Hurry

239
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,042
your papers

240
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,458
yours

241
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,583
Tickets

242
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,184
you're going to hengdaohezi?

243
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,208
Yes

244
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,664
hengdaohezi is fine

245
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,392
we're checking for
those going to harbin

246
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,365
You may go

247
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:22,917
thank you

248
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
this way

249
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,240
tell them up front

250
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,907
that I've checked you already

251
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,782
thank you

252
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,455
You're going to harbin?

253
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,580
Hengdaoheazi

254
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,125
take them away

255
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,167
what?

256
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,292
Why?

257
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,120
My father is head of security

258
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,866
it's a misunderstanding

259
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,417
Go

260
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,619
Stop crowding! Back up

261
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,743
Open up! Anyone there?

262
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,167
Open up!

263
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,453
Ian should be safe, right?

264
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:52,874
We haven't heard otherwise

265
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,956
so she should be fine

266
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,740
perhaps they are
in harbin already

267
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,667
Jin

268
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,949
this isn't the way to the modern

269
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,365
the investigation
team is staying there

270
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,497
it's full of agents

271
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:10,542
way too unsafe

272
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,323
where are you putting us up?

273
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:14,123
An old mansion

274
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,790
belonging to mr Kasper's cousin

275
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,243
he lives overseas

276
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,618
the house is falling apart

277
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,125
I've been there

278
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,285
wouldn't all of us

279
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,498
going at once attract attention?

280
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:28,998
That house is so spooky

281
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,368
people avoid it

282
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,457
even ghosts won't haunt it

283
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,125
Come on in

284
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:47,913
meng

285
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,448
is here to coordinate our work

286
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,364
zhang jie

287
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,623
food and accommodations

288
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,914
spartan, but definitely safe

289
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,605
women comrades stay
in the back house

290
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,240
The stove back here

291
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,458
doesn't work as well

292
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,115
but with three of us in one bed

293
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,247
we should be fine

294
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,667
How is your leg?

295
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:46,748
It's fine, just a sprain

296
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,248
what is operation utrennya?

297
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,740
You know about beiyinhe?

298
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:57,157
The Japanese secret
killing grounds?

299
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,324
They say no one comes out alive

300
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,039
last Autumn

301
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:04,499
there was a prison break there

302
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,198
one month later

303
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,206
the Japanese bombed it

304
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,893
what do you think
they're hiding there

305
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,908
to pay such a price
to keep it secret?

306
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,248
Only one escapee survived

307
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,993
wang ziyang

308
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,078
our mission is to get
him over the border

309
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,409
to expose the Japanese
crime internationally

310
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,664
what happens now that
we have a traitor?

311
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,167
Emergency protocol

312
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,292
can you use it?

313
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,034
Yes

314
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,289
I've had training

315
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,333
write

316
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,289
What do we do next?

317
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:00,657
Nothing

318
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,167
we wait

319
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,667
understood

320
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,414
operation utrennya

321
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,865
for this operation

322
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,581
we trained seven months

323
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,414
you're classmates?

324
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,660
We met in training

325
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,868
does that make us classmates?

326
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,244
He's a star pupil at
oriental university

327
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,956
but I'm not well-educated

328
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,042
not as cultured as he

329
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,247
who trained you?

330
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,455
Soviet military instructors

331
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,702
what were you trained in?

332
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,823
Airborne, marksmanship,
hand-to-hand

333
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,913
and Russian

334
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,407
you speak Russian?

335
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,830
What does that mean?

336
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,207
Proletarians of the world, unite

337
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:43,872
what?

338
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,869
That's too difficult

339
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,831
when I first arrived

340
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,865
I didn't even know the alphabet

341
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,864
until I finished reading

342
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,123
the communist manifesto

343
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,618
that quote was taken

344
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,073
from the manifesto

345
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:00,458
come

346
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,949
proletarians of the world, unite

347
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
hear, hear

348
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:08,072
proletarians of the world, unite

349
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:09,867
come

350
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:10,917
cheers

351
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,289
We're on them 24 hours a day

352
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,449
they have no chance
to communicate

353
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,115
nor contact team one

354
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:22,998
won't they get suspicious

355
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,240
with you coming and going?

356
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,493
They're worried about team one

357
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,328
and asked us to take turns

358
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,160
looking for any sign of them

359
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,118
I think we're fine

360
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,828
stay in as much as possible

361
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:33,417
yes, sir

362
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,583
enter

363
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,164
Chief, I'll be off then

364
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:44,542
hurry back to the house

365
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,333
I've bought the book

366
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,057
it's identical to the
telegram operator's

367
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,417
the same edition

368
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,490
This is carried by team two

369
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,578
it's definitely the
code book for utrennya

370
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,914
this is how they communicate

371
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,782
can you decipher it?

372
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,202
Definitely not

373
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,328
it was encoded by the Russians

374
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,331
and used only by
the highest leaders

375
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,748
These are our
instructions from above

376
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,042
remember it

377
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:49,864
Have you read it all?

378
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes

379
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,976
can you write it
out from memory?

380
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,955
That is my special skill

381
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,285
that's why they sent me here

382
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:01,248
what an archaic
way to communicate

383
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,664
when the organization
is badly damaged

384
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,114
the most archaic methods

385
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,250
are the safest

386
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,623
The code book is with chuliang

387
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,833
how can we decipher it?

388
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,081
We should be able
to find it in harbin

389
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,184
I'll go to the book
shop in the morning

390
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,243
you stay indoors

391
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,908
I'll have dinner ready for you

392
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,281
braised pork ribs

393
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,375
be more alert

394
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:34,952
Come and go often

395
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:36,452
beware of enemy traps

396
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:37,792
if something is wrong

397
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:39,042
get out immediately

398
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,542
and

399
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,953
don't actively seek out anyone

400
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,020
just wait for the
communication signal

401
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,203
memorize the code
from the organization

402
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,332
that is our only clue
to find wang ziyang

403
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,365
You're still up

404
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
I can't sleep

405
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,831
I wonder how chuliang is doing

406
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,157
think of him as
though he were dead

407
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,164
How can you say that?

408
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,078
How about yu?

409
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,536
Do you see those low houses?

410
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,324
Yu and I used to live there

411
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,206
with our two children

412
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,206
5 years ago, soon after
we went to the ussr

413
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,453
their foster parents were
killed by the Japanese

414
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,704
they were last seen
begging at modern hotel

415
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:06,702
by now

416
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,823
our daughter should be 8

417
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,160
and our son should be 6

418
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,323
Do you know what
"utrennya" means?

419
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:29,873
It is the Russian
word for "dawn"

420
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,042
yes

421
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:34,917
dawn

422
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,513
everything will be
fine when the sun rises

423
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:03,743
What do you want?

424
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,331
What is your name?

425
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,748
I don't have a name

426
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,645
do you have a birthmark
on your belly?

427
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,205
Let me go

428
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,331
These little bastards

429
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,994
swarm around here all day

430
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:37,618
up to no good

431
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,125
Looking for someone?

432
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,330
That boy

433
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,032
how long has he been here?

434
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,198
Years

435
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,373
does he have a sister named fen?

436
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,243
She looks about two years older?

437
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:53,623
That I don't know

438
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:53,785
We need him alive

439
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,077
no one may kill him

440
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,157
Be smart, zhang

441
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,868
Who are you meeting on the 18th?

442
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,205
Time and place?

443
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,078
What do you think
about this book?

444
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,328
I'm sure that's how
they communicate

445
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,240
Where did he want to go?

446
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:49,747
All right, give me the key

447
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,958
He hasn't talked yet?

448
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:26,624
He's incontinent
shall we continue?

449
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:27,497
Forget it

450
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:29,119
he seems tough to break

451
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,664
try the latest
imported psychedelics

452
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,958
see if they work

453
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,159
yes, sir

454
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,208
I'll arrange that

455
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:44,406
Do you have cigarettes?

456
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:45,072
Yes

457
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,208
let's go for a smoke

458
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:00,625
Zhou

459
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:06,831
who turned on us?

460
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,375
Xie zirong

461
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,873
How are yu and chuliang?

462
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,452
All right

463
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:17,625
they're preparing

464
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:49,998
There's no escape, is there?

465
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:02,577
Change clothes

466
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,365
wear the ID tag

467
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,789
take the gun

468
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,375
hold me hostage

469
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,323
after we charge out

470
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,573
shoot af me

471
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,114
anywhere, just

472
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,125
don't kill me

473
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:29,625
We can do it

474
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,615
I won't

475
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,495
I'm worthless trash now

476
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,241
I can't complete
operation utrennya

477
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,456
might as well reuse the trash

478
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,039
to keep one of us alive

479
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:50,532
Zhou

480
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,623
right now

481
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:55,707
you're worth more
alive than anyone else

482
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,581
don't argue

483
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,323
you know I'm right

484
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:10,458
Tell me

485
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,828
what is operation utrennya?

486
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:15,661
Wang has escaped from hell

487
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:16,914
escort him across the border

488
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,199
but we don't know where he is

489
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:20,782
find Ian

490
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:23,707
she can decipher your orders

491
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,285
What now?

492
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,032
Get in the white car

493
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,042
Anything else?

494
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:45,497
Can you help

495
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,868
yu and the others escape?

496
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,083
I'll try my best

497
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,032
anything else?

498
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,203
A small favor

499
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:12,870
among the beggars
at modern hotel

500
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:15,453
are yu's and my children

501
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,407
That looks like my car

502
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:28,407
close the doors

503
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:40,827
Take him alive

504
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:34,417
Zhang

505
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:35,708
wake up

506
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:39,493
zhang

507
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:40,542
wake up

508
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,077
zhang

509
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,907
Zhang

510
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,368
you made it out!

511
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,949
The comrades have
been waiting for you

512
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,407
who helped you escape?

513
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,366
We must thank him properly

514
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:22,497
Where is Ian?

515
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,540
You must execute
the plan together

516
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,074
complete operation utrennya

517
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,286
Ian

518
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,448
Ian

519
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,579
how will she contact you?

520
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,453
Find Ian

521
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,161
Asia

522
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,119
Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays

523
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:53,532
first and last

524
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:09,037
How do you think he
opened the handcuffs?

525
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,286
It must be an inside job

526
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,164
that's what you think?

527
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:14,532
There's no other explanation

528
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:19,703
he used Jin's car

529
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,494
shall we arrest Jin now?

530
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,493
I believe

531
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,577
he got into that car

532
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,161
by chance

533
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,286
Jin has nothing to do with this

534
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,410
if he did

535
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,914
it would be too stupid of him

536
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,535
let's not do anything

537
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,830
about that now

538
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,290
keep a tight surveillance
on Asia cinema

539
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:51,958
yes, sir

540
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,535
Welcome, section head zhou

541
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,448
where is the medicine I wanted?

542
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,615
I haven't had time to find it

543
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,165
you still have a headache?

544
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:16,656
Well

545
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,074
try this anacin

546
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,750
section head zhou

547
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,831
I found some aspirin

548
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,292
thank you

549
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,163
Yu is ill

550
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:37,618
What did she eat last night?

551
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:39,042
I don't know

552
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:42,615
food poisoning?

553
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,240
She'll need a few days

554
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,125
Here

555
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,535
here

556
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:38,667
You took it?

557
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:43,702
You suspect them?

558
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,698
They are spies

559
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:48,827
are you sure?

560
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,414
The code zhang
wrote on the train

561
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:53,874
must have been changed

562
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:55,956
I know him too well

563
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,581
he wouldn't take
an unnecessary risk

564
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,990
there is a traitor

565
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:01,873
what shall we do now?

566
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,911
When I leave the hospital

567
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,448
we must escape

568
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,703
Have you read aesop's fables?

569
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:31,123
Have you read aesop's fables?

570
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:33,908
I've only read the
fox and the hyena

571
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,374
do you know why
the fox refused it?

572
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,743
No

573
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,953
Why won't you say
the contact code?

574
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,116
Because the fox
didn't know its gender

575
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:51,490
I'm zhou yi

576
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,073
a secret agent operating

577
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:55,324
from inside the
special task force

578
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,036
xie zirong has turned

579
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:58,831
but he doesn't know about me

580
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,285
I decided on my own

581
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,494
to risk approaching my liaison

582
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:05,283
to attain your contact code

583
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,789
why did you expose yourself?

584
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,577
Zhang has been captured

585
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:14,660
and Ian?

586
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,115
She is safe for now

587
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,830
but zhang

588
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:19,869
has been injected
with psychedelics

589
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,205
while unconscious

590
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,535
he may have revealed

591
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:24,289
ways to find Ian

592
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:26,958
traitor

593
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,205
he was not

594
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,823
I was there

595
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:35,667
listen

596
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,375
operation utrennya

597
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,108
will be completed
by other comrades

598
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,032
keep delaying the enemy

599
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,208
don't make any rash moves

600
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:43,623
listen to my arrangements

601
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,323
I will try to free you

602
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:59,161
Why should we trust you?

603
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,323
Because you have two children

604
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,536
begging outside modern hotel

605
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:10,157
How do I find Ian?

606
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,809
It's Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays, right?

607
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,243
So why are we here now?

608
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,740
I'll go take a look

609
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:20,792
I'll go now

610
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:22,202
if I don't match you

611
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,285
I'll catch hell from

612
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,333
section chief gao

613
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:30,202
You've taken a look?

614
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,292
Yes

615
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,123
did you find anything?

616
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,333
No

617
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:52,990
Really?

618
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,125
Really

619
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,080
Did you see that?

620
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:20,667
Yes

621
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,789
did you see who did it?

622
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,032
I am a communist

623
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,539
If I were a communist

624
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:51,788
you would never have seen

625
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,164
what I had just done

626
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:01,532
We can only catch communists

627
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:04,073
by thinking like them

628
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:05,993
and unlike you

629
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:08,038
only watching during

630
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:10,039
Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays

631
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:15,772
section chief gao
cares about details

632
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,536
shall I tell him about this?

633
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:28,079
See why you've
never been promoted?

634
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,456
Coffee is on you

635
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,625
fine

636
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,364
What's wrong?

637
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,161
It won't start?

638
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:52,458
I'll give you a ride

639
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
no, thanks

640
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:54,697
it's too cold

641
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,990
it will start after a few tries

642
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:01,917
come on

643
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,875
come

644
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:15,830
All right

645
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,537
even after all that, your
car is still in good shape

646
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:29,615
Today's 1:30 show

647
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:30,782
three seats together

648
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,333
near the front

649
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:45,875
Thank you

650
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:04,657
Jin and zhang jie are not here

651
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:06,657
remember these two cups

652
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,333
don't get them mixed up

653
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:11,167
all right

654
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:18,123
Today is the 18th

655
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,365
finally the wait is over

656
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,664
can you reveal a
little more now?

657
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:25,205
No comment

658
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,619
then we can only talk about food

659
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,950
red sausage from
omsk with red wine,

660
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,789
beet soup and black bread

661
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:39,283
not easy to get these days

662
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:42,499
do you often eat western food?

663
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:43,697
Yes

664
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,115
but I prefer Chinese food

665
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:48,917
do you drink coffee?

666
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,490
We drink coffee

667
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:12,702
I feel very dizzy

668
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,706
I'm going to take a nap

669
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,740
I feel dizzy, too

670
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:24,993
I'll walk you back

671
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,831
Why is he down, too?

672
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,199
I think he mixed up the cups

673
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,660
he's always like that

674
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,661
alcohol distracts
him from everything

675
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:03,917
Chuliang

676
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:06,625
chuliang

677
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:26,623
Tell them the operation
starts tonight

678
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:27,875
get a car

679
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:29,032
drive along Balkan street

680
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,163
to number 25

681
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,914
the Romanian embassy

682
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,539
when you get to the door

683
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,583
stop the car

684
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:35,497
have the others

685
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:36,542
wait outside

686
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,625
two of you enter

687
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:38,326
the guard

688
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,490
will ask for an invitation

689
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,447
tell him

690
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:42,365
I am a friend of the
ambassador's wife'

691
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:43,156
then

692
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,368
remove your left glove

693
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,497
they will let you in

694
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,572
Tonight is

695
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:54,619
the ambassador's
wife's birthday party

696
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:55,792
there will be many guests

697
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:56,993
as long as you are in

698
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,532
no one will ask who you are

699
01:17:58,708 --> 01:17:59,538
after you enter

700
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:00,577
walk through the banquet hall

701
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:01,893
and exit directly
via the back door

702
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:03,578
a black sedan will
be parked there

703
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,035
the key will be in the ignition

704
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:06,865
everything you need
will be in the car

705
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,165
I will try to tell yu this plan

706
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,535
Who found this?

707
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:25,456
I found it on him myself

708
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,157
it's a good thing you
suggested we check

709
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:35,454
you all slept together night
after night and didn't notice?

710
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,205
Meng is not to blame

711
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,786
it was me who shared
a bed with him

712
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,706
so, what do you think?

713
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:44,868
We've been made

714
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,324
we should abort
tonight's operation

715
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:48,664
and detain them

716
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:50,328
is there any other explanation?

717
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:53,288
Of course

718
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,623
there is one other possibility

719
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,366
that he was just
being extra cautious

720
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,240
and that we haven't been made

721
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,786
how much longer
till they wake up?

722
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:09,498
One hour, at most

723
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,167
put back the gun

724
01:19:13,292 --> 01:19:14,327
the plan remains

725
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,869
we move tonight

726
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,500
yes, sir

727
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:34,077
Disable the firing pin

728
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,125
before putting it back

729
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,448
don't tell anyone

730
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,500
yes, sir

731
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,240
keep watching them

732
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,823
let's see what he
needs a gun for

733
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:49,660
Meng

734
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:50,702
do you have a light?

735
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:56,995
Zhou told you I
mixed up the cups?

736
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:57,701
Yes

737
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,286
you did mix them up

738
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:12,202
We leave in half an hour

739
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:16,789
there are so many of us

740
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,865
will we stand out too much?

741
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,365
With so many spies in harbin

742
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:23,623
we'll be safer together

743
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,581
keep an empty seat in the car

744
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:27,532
we may need it on our way back

745
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,250
then you

746
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:30,202
and I

747
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,535
stay and wait for orders

748
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:33,042
yes

749
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,448
Didn't I say wait for orders

750
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:46,827
orders from above

751
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,581
Shall we keep the empty seat?

752
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,698
No need

753
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,250
Where to?

754
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,410
Balkan Avenue

755
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,698
where on Balkan Avenue?

756
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,456
You'll know when we get there

757
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,167
Stop

758
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,409
Here?

759
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:16,326
Yes

760
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:17,785
wait here

761
01:22:18,042 --> 01:22:19,202
chuliang and I will get out

762
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:20,708
keep the engine running

763
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,250
Wait

764
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,740
The ambassador is anti-communist

765
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,494
it could be a trap

766
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:51,748
the contact is inside

767
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,623
we have our plan

768
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:55,914
I'll go with you

769
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,994
if the contact sees it
is not who he expects

770
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,706
he will abort the operation

771
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:01,623
that's better than
falling into his trap

772
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,333
you are right

773
01:23:07,042 --> 01:23:08,202
why don't we abort?

774
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,663
Let's call it off

775
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:11,292
wait

776
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:13,873
I'm just worried for your safety

777
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:15,750
why don't we do this

778
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:17,583
sister yu

779
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,789
you go in alone

780
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:22,373
and we'll wait for you outside

781
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,083
all right then

782
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:28,581
here I go

783
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:38,197
Good evening, madam

784
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,250
your invitation, please?

785
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,289
The ambassador's
wife is my friend

786
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:42,948
I left the house in a rush

787
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,160
and forgot the invitation

788
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:45,417
your name, please?

789
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:46,583
I am wang yu

790
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,365
from the idota association

791
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:28,367
Hello, sir

792
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:29,657
your invitation, please

793
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:32,199
I'm with the lady
who just entered

794
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:33,625
pardon me

795
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:34,948
what is your name, please?

796
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,410
Chuliang

797
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,080
I'll park the car

798
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:12,948
I'll have a look?

799
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,458
Go

800
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,292
Yes, sir

801
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,660
Do you know how to drive?

802
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,250
Get out

803
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,914
I want them alive

804
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:40,208
Let's split up

805
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:00,625
Go

806
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:38,452
Split up

807
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,455
you go that way

808
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,500
remember

809
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,497
I need him alive

810
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:42,542
yes

811
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:07,042
Come out

812
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:11,167
come out

813
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,785
Put down your gun

814
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:29,708
put it down

815
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:38,417
Damn

816
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:40,667
I was too late

817
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:15,958
He's dead?

818
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,250
He took poison

819
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:19,823
didn't get to him in time

820
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,208
and the woman?

821
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:31,059
Subsection chief
zhou's sure shot

822
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:31,822
saved Jin

823
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:32,489
because he...

824
01:39:32,542 --> 01:39:33,542
I saw

825
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:36,197
and the gun?

826
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:37,458
Was it shot?

827
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:38,281
Yes

828
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,073
the enemy fired
without hesitation

829
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:41,393
if you hadn't disabled
the firing pin

830
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:42,417
zhou would be dead

831
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:43,823
the men saw it, too

832
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:45,831
I think zhou is clean

833
01:39:46,417 --> 01:39:47,452
is that so?

834
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:52,955
He's dead

835
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:54,042
we couldn't save him

836
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:37,208
Jin

837
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,240
gao said to stay here a few days

838
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,740
This operation failed

839
01:40:50,125 --> 01:40:51,706
because they had help

840
01:40:57,542 --> 01:40:58,748
So then

841
01:40:58,958 --> 01:41:00,198
are you arresting me?

842
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:01,618
Why are you so nervous?

843
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,581
You take my gun

844
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:06,115
and ask me why I'm nervous?

845
01:41:06,417 --> 01:41:07,623
I will ask again

846
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:09,619
have I been arrested?

847
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:11,573
Answer me first

848
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:14,994
who do you think helped them?

849
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:17,369
From the embassy?

850
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,788
I had the guard investigated

851
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:24,573
he's Latvian

852
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:25,865
with a diplomatic passport

853
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:27,914
I don't mean him

854
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:29,458
then who?

855
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:33,364
Besides operation utrennya

856
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:35,783
xie provided other
important intelligence

857
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:38,244
a communist special agent has

858
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:40,790
infiltrated our task force

859
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:43,042
who?

860
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:47,244
All we know is, it's a man

861
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:52,158
stopping operation
utrennya was only a part

862
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:53,622
the more important part is

863
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:55,073
to use this operation

864
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,538
to find the mole

865
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:02,907
you don't think
Jin is a suspect?

866
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:08,493
What's so suspicious

867
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:09,831
about a dead man?

868
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,828
Zhang used his car to break out

869
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,282
is it really a coincidence?

870
01:42:17,167 --> 01:42:18,167
Yes

871
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:19,993
these things often happen

872
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,162
You've seen this movie poster?

873
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,035
Who made this Mark?

874
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:49,667
I did

875
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:50,875
why?

876
01:42:51,417 --> 01:42:52,748
To remind Jin

877
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:55,073
to pay attention to details

878
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:57,748
like you always taught us

879
01:42:58,042 --> 01:42:59,782
that's not what Jin said

880
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:01,573
what did he say?

881
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:04,414
He wouldn't lie

882
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,573
we've worked together
so many years

883
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:09,417
what did he say?

884
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,865
Why did you choose the 20th?

885
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,351
I just made that Mark at random

886
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:15,375
is it by coincidence?

887
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:17,998
Or is there a
special significance?

888
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:23,456
I don't understand what you mean

889
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,535
don't you?

890
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:27,869
Then you will sit
here until the 20th

891
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:09,492
All up

892
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:10,542
get up

893
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,288
all up

894
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:17,202
how do we find Ian?

895
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:19,226
Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays. First and last

896
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,330
choose a time

897
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:21,542
make a tick Mark

898
01:44:21,917 --> 01:44:23,202
what is the safety measure?

899
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,161
Four days later from that time

900
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,039
is when she will show up

901
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:28,538
remember

902
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:30,292
four days later

903
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:10,998
I found this in Jin's car

904
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:16,292
Jin?

905
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,615
I'll give you a ride

906
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,078
We're letting you go

907
01:45:53,792 --> 01:45:54,934
It is my job to suspect people

908
01:45:54,958 --> 01:45:56,164
and my responsibility as well

909
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:57,542
forgive me

910
01:45:57,917 --> 01:45:58,827
this weekend I'll treat you to

911
01:45:58,875 --> 01:45:59,910
a meal at modern hotel

912
01:46:01,625 --> 01:46:02,785
I don't like western food

913
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:06,539
don't be so petty

914
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,368
Go home, get some rest

915
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,500
Wait

916
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:40,665
This gun will not jam

917
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,956
I must say

918
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:48,208
section chief

919
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:50,994
you saved my life

920
01:47:34,083 --> 01:47:35,083
Jin

921
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:36,958
Jin

922
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:41,458
Jin

923
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,200
the higher ups want to see you

924
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:44,664
there was an urgent mission

925
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,323
they couldn't find you

926
01:47:47,292 --> 01:47:48,407
at this critical time

927
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:49,993
where are you meeting?

928
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,250
Jin

929
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:00,833
What do you think?

930
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,037
Jin definitely out-ranks zhang

931
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:10,874
can his own people
hurt him so badly?

932
01:48:12,167 --> 01:48:13,532
Gotta make it look real

933
01:48:13,583 --> 01:48:14,618
comes with the territory

934
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:20,291
you've caught a
high-level communist spy

935
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:22,152
who'd been in your
ranks for years

936
01:48:24,333 --> 01:48:26,665
the result of stopping
operation utrennya

937
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:29,198
can you report it this way?

938
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,080
Brilliant, section chief

939
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:55,698
Ready

940
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,743
load

941
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:04,458
Aim

942
01:50:28,042 --> 01:50:29,157
Comrade wang

943
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:30,748
we part ways here

944
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:32,498
everything has been arranged

945
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:33,952
you'll be safe up to the border

946
01:50:34,708 --> 01:50:35,708
take care

947
01:50:36,958 --> 01:50:37,958
thank you

948
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:46,115
Take care, han

949
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,413
Brother zhou

950
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,161
our mission is done

951
01:51:14,917 --> 01:51:16,077
please tell me

952
01:51:17,167 --> 01:51:19,579
how zhang and chuliang died

953
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:22,206
I've told you often

954
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,786
they fought bravely

955
01:51:26,667 --> 01:51:28,623
and saved the final
bullet for themselves

956
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,535
they weren't arrested

957
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:36,042
no

958
01:51:37,292 --> 01:51:38,498
I was there

959
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:39,792
you were?

960
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:41,208
Yes

961
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,286
But I couldn't help

962
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:04,828
When we landed

963
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:07,573
chuliang apologized to me

964
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,240
but I'm the one who
should apologize

965
01:52:19,542 --> 01:52:21,533
I didn't even say goodbye

966
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:29,744
Our final meeting was

967
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:32,782
a distant glance on the train

968
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:38,994
do you know what
"utrennya" means?

969
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,536
The Russian word for 'dawn'

970
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:49,623
zhang's last words to me were

971
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:52,472
everything will be
fine when the sun rises

972
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:56,305
everything will be
fine when the sun rises

973
01:52:57,708 --> 01:52:58,708
will we

974
