1
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,024
Good morning, Ivano.

2
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,941
<i>The first red rose has already blossomed</i>

3
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:30,399
<i>Awaking timidly</i>

4
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:33,066
<i>The sweet violets</i>

5
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,316
<i>By now the first swallow has returned</i>

6
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,607
<i>In the limpid sky, it circles once again</i>

7
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>The fair season it has come to proclaim</i>

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,149
<i>Open the windows to the new sun</i>

9
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:58,274
<i>It is spring</i>

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,357
<i>Welcome in a breath of fresh air</i>

11
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:07,316
<i>With the perfumed scent of gardens
and meadows in flower</i>

12
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:13,316
<i>Open the windows to new dreams</i>

13
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,316
<i>Pretty young girls</i>

14
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,649
<i>In love</i>

15
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:23,732
<i>It is perhaps
the most beautiful dream you are dreaming</i>

16
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:28,316
<i>In tomorrow, your happiness lies</i>

17
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:34,275
<i>Among the silvery clouds, and in wait</i>

18
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:38,983
<i>The moon has already set a date</i>

19
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:43,733
<i>Open the windows to the new sun</i>

20
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,900
<i>It is spring</i>

21
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:49,442
<i>Festival of love</i>

22
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:58,733
<i>Open the windows to the new sun</i>

23
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:03,025
- Knock it off!
- I'll smash your face.

24
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,442
Stop it!

25
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,275
Son of a bitch!

26
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:21,817
Sit down.

27
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,067
What's in that empty head?

28
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,817
- What did I do?
- Shut up!

29
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,233
The crapper chain's broke again.
Go easy.

30
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,567
Damn you!

31
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,358
Try to be more delicate.

32
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:38,817
Eat now.

33
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,275
- Hands off!
- No, that's mine!

34
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:46,317
- Marcella, doll, sit to eat.
- And you?

35
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,067
- I gotta do things.
- Me too.

36
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,067
Hurry, I'll be late for work.

37
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:52,733
Oh, wait a sec!

38
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,817
Finished your homework?

39
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,733
Too bad, you'll get the stick!
You dunces.

40
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:02,108
- What did I do?
- If I went to middle school, I'd be good.

41
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,900
Sergio's going, he's a boy.
Besides it costs 2,000 lire.

42
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,150
You got 2,000 lire?

43
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,108
Then you can't go.

44
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,192
Lucky I allowed you some training
and now you've got a trade.

45
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:20,150
Just bring in money
and help your useless ma.

46
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,067
I bring in money and I always help Mama.

47
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:27,192
Good. Doing your duty.

48
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,275
Let's go.

49
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,150
Hey, wait up...

50
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,192
when's that moron Giulio
popping the question?

51
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:41,067
- I don't know.
- I gotta know...

52
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:43,275
Are you two serious or just fooling?

53
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,192
Go now, it's late.

54
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,692
Yes.

55
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,733
- Take this, you didn't touch a thing.
- I don't need it!

56
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,025
I don't need anything.

57
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,692
Do something good today.

58
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,108
Bye, Ivano.

59
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,026
Delia! Where you at?

60
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:21,401
Coming, Papa.

61
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:24,151
Delia!

62
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,401
What the fuck's it take?

63
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,276
- Starving me, that's what!
- Good morning, Dom Ottorino.

64
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,776
Watch it!

65
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,359
My boy, where's he at?

66
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,401
Hands off, c'mon!
It's not a good day.

67
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,776
Eh... What a fuss!

68
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:53,568
When cousins married,
there weren't all these problems.

69
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:57,359
My son took a stranger
and here are the results.

70
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:01,318
- Where's Ivano?
- Working.

71
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,109
And no goodbye?

72
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:06,568
Never says goodbye, that ingrate.

73
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,984
After all I done for him.

74
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,276
I learned him everything,

75
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,609
tie his shoes, shave...

76
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,609
Who took him whoring the first time?

77
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,484
- You, Dom Ottorino, you.
- Me!

78
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:24,026
Maybe not a thank you
but at least a goodbye.

79
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,443
Even gave him the house.

80
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,594
It was seized.
You lost that on the horses too.

81
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,276
So what! It's the thought.

82
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:35,984
- But his trade, I learned him that.
- What trade?

83
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,193
- Grave robber.
- Oh, that!

84
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:41,901
When he was a kid,
we'd dig the hole and throw him in.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,068
Ivano'd come back up with vases, statues.

86
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,318
He was good, like a cat.

87
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,443
Yeah, a great trade!

88
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,401
Don't go judging!

89
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,276
The Fascists bought it all.

90
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,690
Respectable folks, elegant.

91
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:59,109
They liked old stuff in the living room.

92
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:03,318
Cash went around great guns!

93
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,984
I loaned to loads of people.

94
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:09,693
You got caught five times.
World's only flat-broke loan shark.

95
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:13,068
Not so! My wife lived like a queen.

96
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:16,568
Your wife, in despair,
jumped from the fifth floor. Rightly so.

97
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:19,484
Know your problem?

98
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:22,068
You talk too much.

99
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,484
Learn to shut up, you're a good girl

100
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,734
but you gotta learn to shut up,
mouth closed.

101
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,901
Hey, kids, cut it out!

102
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,818
Those dummies!

103
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:45,234
You're lucky I didn't tell my husband,
he'll smash your face!

104
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:04,443
- Good morning, Alvaro.
- Good morning, Delia.

105
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:07,651
Keep an eye on Ottorino
in case he needs something.

106
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,069
Count on it, I'll see to him.

107
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,319
That poor old guy.

108
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,569
Means the world to me!

109
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,527
I'm sorry he's not my papa.

110
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:23,861
Thank the Lord!

<i>There's Still Tomorrow</i>

112
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,487
Delia dear! We've been expecting you.

113
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,487
I'll take you to Papa.

114
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:15,987
- Adelina, hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

115
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,028
Let's go, young ladies.

116
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,987
This way, Delia.

117
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,403
Come along, it's late!

118
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:35,820
Delia, I must tell you

119
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,070
the restorative is working,
I feel much better.

120
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,987
True, sir, your color's back,
you were yellow.

121
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,153
And your father?
Is he improving too?

122
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,403
No, my father-in-law!

123
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,945
To improve him
would take a brain operation.

124
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:54,820
The elderly take patience.

125
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,612
Done.

126
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,028
- You have a velvet touch.
- Thank you, sir.

127
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,945
- You think it's easy.
- Papa, it is easy.

128
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:08,612
- If you have the right, you decide.
- If you're capable, you decide!

129
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:12,403
You mirror an ancient, dead culture.
We need new ideas, new faces!

130
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:16,278
- Values count, not faces!
- Common objectives are what count.

131
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,153
In the interest of the collectivity.

132
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,570
Darling... be quiet.

133
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,445
Don't join discussions
that don't pertain to you.

134
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:34,138
Instead, give the woman her 20 lire.

135
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,028
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

136
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,695
Actually, it's 30.

137
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,519

Here you are.

141
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:11,820
So, four bras, 200 lire,

142
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,237
and two garter belts, 60 lire.

143
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:16,070
That's 260 lire in all.

144
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,028
Mrs Franca, if other things need mending,
I'm at your disposal.

145
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,945
Socks, wool sweaters, your own things too,
a stocking run...

146
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,653
Oh, who do you take me for?
I toss the ones with runs.

147
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,695
Lucky you! I did the whole war
with a whopping run.

148
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:34,445
Goodbye.

- I apologize, sir.
- Go to the laboratory.

Goodbye, I'll expect you Thursday.

Delia, show him.

This umbrella had a broken rib
so we changed it.

00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:03,654
put it inside.

159
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,071
Insert the tips, one by one.

160

See? Easy as pie.

See?

- You understand when I talk?
- What's the rib and the tips?

Oh, great!

00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:23,613
But you too, Delia!
Help him out!

165
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,321
Now it's my fault.

166
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,055
Kiddo, snap to!

167
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:33,904
I gotta learn. If I knew the trade
I wouldn't be getting 40 lire.

168
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,696
What? 40 lire?

169
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:42,821
Sir, may I have a word?

170
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:49,613
I've worked here three years,
even during bombings.

171
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,446
Why's he get more than me?

172
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,363
The kid's a man, eh!

173
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,363
God, what a scare!

174
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,696
- Delia, devil take you!
- Like a bomb.

175
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,931
Why can't we use the elevator
same as everyone?

176
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,905
God forbid we see some gentleman
and embarrass him.

177
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,030
Don't complain,
it's a lot they call us for the sheets.

178
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:40,280
I thought we'd see more money
with the Americans.

179
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,780
- We lost the war, eh.
- Uncle Joe'll fix it!

180
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,530
Yeah, he's all we need.

181
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,530
Now we got the vote, the tune'll change.

182
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,946
Yeah, but just the tune.

183
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:20,196
Thirty for shots, 260 from Mrs Franca,

184
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,613
and 30 from Fiacchini...

185
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,656
I think this is yours.

186
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,114
Let go! Put me down!

187
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,947
Are you nuts?

188
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:38,072
I knew it was yours.

189
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,489
I thought so, they're all black.

190
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,822
Your mama?

191
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,531
All so sweet.

192
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:09,739
Fella, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

193
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:11,406
I just talk Roman.

194
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:25,906
Chocolate!

195
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:27,864
For me?

196
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,072
Thank you! I'll take for the moppets.

197
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:32,697
Moppets?

198
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,489
The moppets, my kids.

199
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,072
Thank you.

200
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,614
I have to leave, I gotta go.

201
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,031
I... gotta go!

202
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,781
- Bye.
- Thank you, Gottago.

203
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,906
I... William.

204
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,281
Bye, Gottago.

205
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:23,906
Fresh string beans!

206
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,864
Melt in your mouth, ma'am!

207
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:29,864
Not the string beans, sell the chard!

208
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:34,407
Beans last a week, chard goes limp.

209
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:35,740
Come here.

210
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:38,823
Gimme a kiss, so nothing goes limp.

211
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,448
Cut it out! C'mon!

212
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,657
Work, slave, I'll be back.

213
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,532
Chard! It's good, it's fresh...

214
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,157
it won't go limp!

215
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,823
There, I married an idiot.

216
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:55,532
Tell me, did the American say his name?

217
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,823
Yes, his name's "Willian."

218
00:19:58,616 --> 00:19:59,740
Willian...

219
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,823
Aren't Americans something beautiful?

220
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,407
They got all their teeth!
Lots of them!

221
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:09,157
- More than us, I'd say.
- Could be.

222
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,323
- He was tall, right?
- A real he-man!

223
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,990
How tall? Like this?

224
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,823
No, figure to the canopy.

225
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:22,115
See! And his hands, what were they like?

226
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,907
I wouldn't know, I looked at his face.

227
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,198
He was so kind.

228
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:31,948
Right, you could use
a kind, handsome American.

229
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:35,115
Forget that lowlife, scoundrel husband.

230
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:38,365
You know what he's like, he's edgy.
He did two wars!

231
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,615
The war thing again?

232
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,407
Once a stinker, always a stinker,
trust me.

233
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,865
I better go,
still gotta wash and put away.

234
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:48,698
- Wait! Take this.
- No!

235
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,282
Yes.

236
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,532
Thank you, Marisa.

237
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,198
Bye.

238
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,365
Delia?

239
00:20:56,574 --> 00:21:00,766
I got two crates of apricots,
they're off, I'm making jam tonight.

240
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,907
Come help, you can have a jar.

241
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,740
- I'd like that!
- So, I'll expect you.

242
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,115
I have to see what Ivano says.

243
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:12,157
And what's that?
He's edgy 'cause he did two wars.

244
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:15,032
- Maybe he'll send me.
- Yeah, when hell freezes!

245
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,532
- Okay... Bye.
- Bye.

246
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:30,907
You never stop, eh?

247
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,948
Excuse me.

248
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:42,490
Even as a girl, always running off.

249
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:47,490
- Actually, you ran off.
- So, let's run off together.

250
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:50,282
Sure, change the subject.

251
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,990
I've regretted it
every morning for 30 years.

252
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,865
I got distracted and he stole you.

253
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:04,490
What's with you today?

254
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,782
Things aren't going too well.

255
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:14,824
Clients either fly the coop
or pay only when they remember.

256
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,574
Like this, I'll die in here.

257
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,074
Nino!

258
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,033
Coming.

259
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,825
What would you like to do?

260
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,450
I've got an idea
but maybe not the courage.

261
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,408
I can't bear even telling you.

262
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:36,616
- So, write it.
- Oh, sure!

263
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,908
Better go.

264
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,991
Hey, you deaf?

265
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,658
I'm getting moldy here!

266
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,116
Right here!

267
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,283
Bye, Delia.

268
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:32,741
Bye, Nino.

269
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:42,825
Sergio, your sister?

270
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:44,783
Right there.

271
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,408
Mrs Delia?

272
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,116
They're a real nice couple.

273
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:58,658
Never! It's just a crush.

274
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,533
No jinxing them, eh?

275
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:04,283
They've been pecking for a year,
but still no ring, eh?

276
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:07,158
Don't listen, she's green with envy

277
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:11,867
because Marcella's got a proper boy,
even well-off.

278
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,451
Right.

279
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,492
His father's got the best café around,
brand new.

280
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:17,992
It's a sight!

281
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:22,659
Sure, opened it with black market money.
The jackals!

282
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:27,826
They all did black market.
Didn't you sell your brother-in-law's oil?

283
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:29,367
She's right.

284
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:32,076
Better jackals
than down-and-outs like them, eh?

285
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,201
C'mon, if Marcella marries him,
at least she won't end up like you.

286
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,242
Thank you, Mrs Giovanna.

287
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:45,492
Marcella, get the kids and go home,
your father's coming.

288
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:48,534
Let me help, Mrs Delia.

289
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,576
Pardon me if I take advantage, but,
Marcella and I

290
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,367
have been close for a while.

291
00:25:57,493 --> 00:26:00,826
I was wondering if you and Dom Ivano
would like...

292
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:03,909
- I mean...
- Yes?

293
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:05,826
To meet my parents.

294
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,326
Of course!

295
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,451
- Come to lunch on Sunday.
- No!

296
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,701
No?

297
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:17,867
- Not here, please.
- We'd be happy to have you at home.

298
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,742
Absolutely not,
my husband would never accept.

299
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:24,742
It's tradition,
the fiancé goes to the fiancée.

300
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:27,451
- Let's go to a cafeteria.
- Hear that! But how...

301
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:31,826
Don't worry, your mama will see to it.

302
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:36,159
- We'll expect you on Sunday.
- Sunday.

303
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:46,118
Thank you.

304
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:48,409
Go call the boys.

305
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,951
See? Let's go call the boys.

306
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:57,242
Delia? There's mail.

307
00:26:57,452 --> 00:27:00,451
- Give it to Ivano, I get muddled.
- Best not to.

308
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,034
It's not for Ivano, it's for you.

309
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:10,117
- For me?
- Yes... it's a letter.

310
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:14,076
- It can't be.
- Your name's on it.

311
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:24,909
Thank you.

312
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:27,742
Mrs Ada!

313
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,159
Don't say anything to Ivano.

314
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:33,159
You know what he's like.

315
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:35,492
I mind my business.

316
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:50,202
Delia, run, the piss pot!

317
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:51,827
Coming.

318
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,785
Wash your hands.
Hurry, we're eating soon.

319
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,744
Mama's doll!

320
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:12,994
Why did you invite them here?

321
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,494
- I'm ashamed.
- Why on earth?

322
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:21,702
- Ma...
- What did I do now?

323
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:25,244
You're always in an apron,
holding a rag.

324
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:27,452
Of course, I'm always busy.

325
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,785
Obviously, I'll fix up for the occasion.

326
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:33,994
Franchino and Sergio swear all the time.

327
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:36,410
What they put me through!

328
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,369
They hear your father and grandfather
and imitate.

329
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,077
Anyway, by now they're big boys,

330
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:47,202
we'll explain we have high-level guests,
you'll see they won't...

331
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:51,869
I'll pay them.

332
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,619
Give them 5 lire each.

333
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:56,702
What about Papa?

334
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,869
You know him when he drinks.

335
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:01,702
We'll keep the wine away.

336
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,410
Grandpa Ottorino!

337
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:07,619
- He swears against the Lord!
- No, just the Virgin.

338
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:11,410
I'll see to Grandpa.

339
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,369
He'll eat first and doze off,

340
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,410
then we'll lock him in,
you won't see or hear him.

341
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,327
C'mon, your father's here.

342
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:20,369
Don't let him see you like this.

343
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,994
Delia, clean this place, it's a pigsty.

344
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,160
Come here, let me wipe your mouth.

345
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,744
You're filthy!

346
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:38,785
Seen the crapper chain?
I fixed it.

347
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:42,035
- Good.
- Now go break it again.

348
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,994
There's some very nice news.

349
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:52,828
Damn you, I'm dying of thirst!

350
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:53,962
Take him the wine.

351
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:57,036
I took him food, now this smart-ass goes.

352
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,578
- Son of a bitch, always me.
- Liar!

353
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:01,911
- Chunk of dead dog.
- I'll rattle your brain.

354
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,036
I'll go!

355
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:08,620
- What did they learn you today?
- Phoenicians. Pain in the ass!

356
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:11,828
I send you to school
to study everything, even birds.

357
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:17,203
That's a pheasant.
Phoenicians are... a kind of Turk.

358
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,578
- Me and Marcella want to say...
- The ironing shop paid you?

359
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:27,203
You too, out with the pittance.

360
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:37,911
Two hundred eighty lire?
They giving alms?

361
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:40,620
Won't even pay the lights.

362
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:44,745
But we're not so bad off.

363
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:47,536
Marcella brings home
almost 600 lire a week.

364
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:50,995
With your 13 thousand, makes 15,400,
take off 4 thousand for rent,

365
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:53,995
200 for lights, 80 for gas,
makes 11,120.

366
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,870
Good girl, you can penny pinch.

367
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,203
Marcella has an important thing to say.

368
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:00,245
Go on, Marcella.

369
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:05,036
Giulio wants to bring
his parents for lunch, to meet you.

370
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,745
This is satisfaction!

371
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,911
Right, Delia?
Our Marcella's getting married.

372
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:16,203
- Mama's doll!
- I'm taking her bed!

373
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:19,078
Come here, Papa's joy.

374
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,911
Once you go, there'll be no women here!

375
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:33,203
- Marcella, gonna make love now?
- And sleep without undies?

376
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:35,661
Cut it out!

377
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,620
Eat your hearts out!

378
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,620
My daughter's marrying a gentleman,

379
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,620
not a bum like you all, wretches!

380
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,911
- All of you!
- Hey, screwball!

381
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:51,703
I'll be off to Marisa's to make jam...

382
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:54,828
You're going nowhere.
Get me a shirt, I'm going out.

383
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:58,078
- Where to?
- None of your business.

384
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,786
With all this joy, I almost forgot!

385
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,078
Look what I have.

386
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,995
American chocolate!

387
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,661
We can celebrate with dessert.

388
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,161
Calm down, one at a time.

389
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,245
Where's it from, this chocolate?

390
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,911
Some soldiers were giving it..

391
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:25,745
Giving it to who?

392
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,870
To people going by.

393
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,161
They were giving it to the sluts.

394
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:32,745
To the wheedling ones,

395
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:35,036
that's who.

396
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,828
- No, it was a distribution...
- Shut up.

397
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,579
And you've got the nerve
to give it to the kids.

398
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,662
Got no shame?

399
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:21,829
Ivano...

400
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,496
<i>No one. I swear no one
not even destiny, can part us</i>

401
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:39,371
<i>Because this love that heaven gives us
will always live</i>

402
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:45,829
<i>No one. I swear, no one
can give me, in a whole lifetime</i>

403
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:48,537
<i>The infinite joy I feel with you,
only with you</i>

404
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:52,412
<i>It's you. sweet love</i>

405
00:34:52,622 --> 00:34:55,079
<i>Only you, past and future</i>

406
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:58,496
<i>My whole world
begins with you, ends with you</i>

407
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,079
<i>No one. I swear, no one
not even destiny can part us</i>

408
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:08,329
<i>Because this love
will illuminate eternity</i>

409
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:30,579
<i>It's you, sweet love</i>

410
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,079
<i>Only you, past and future</i>

411
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:36,954
<i>My whole world
begins with you, ends with you</i>

412
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:41,996
<i>No one, I swear, no one
not even destiny can part us</i>

413
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:46,246
<i>Because this love
will illuminate eternity</i>

414
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:51,163
<i>Eternity</i>

415
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:54,204
<i>Eternity</i>

416
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,038
<i>Eternity</i>

417
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,621
Get my handkerchief.

418
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:37,039
Cologne.

419
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,122
Spray.

420
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:08,789
You even put perfume on him
for his whores.

421
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,747
What are you saying?

422
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,705
He's playing cards with friends tonight.

423
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,080
Sure!

424
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:23,289
He's wearing Brylcreem for his friends.

425
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,455
Rather than end up like you,
I'd kill myself.

426
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,497
What? Say that again!

427
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:42,247
Why let him treat you like that?

428
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:44,497
Why don't you leave?

429
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,414
And where do I go?

430
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,122
Where do I go...

431
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,206
See, I still love you.

432
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:53,998
I'm sorry for yesterday.

433
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,040
Guess I'm a little edgy.

434
00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:58,956
After all...

435
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:01,498
You did two wars.

436
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:04,165
Yeah!

437
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,665
<i>Bakery - Groceries</i>

438
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:29,540
- What's the pasta today?
- Dunno!

439
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:32,873
Who knows! Last time, just ditalini.

440
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,540
We had soup for a week.

441
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,373
Ditalini, hope not.

442
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:40,956
I can't give them soup.

443
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,498
It's open!

444
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,956
Sorry, I can't talk to you.

445
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,498
- I, friend.
- Friend, but go away or I got trouble.

446
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:08,915
Well?

447
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:12,790
You gotta leave me alone, okay?

448
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:17,456
Touching! Why the touching?

449
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:21,540
No, it's late for artichokes.

450
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:24,831
- They're all choke.
- Then 300 grams of chicory.

451
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:26,748
Okay.

452
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:31,290
I knew Ivano wouldn't let you come!
Doesn't want you to see anyone.

453
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:34,956
Her husband's a jailer, she's in prison.

454
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:39,498
- Want herbs, ma'am?
- Yes, and a kilo of potatoes.

455
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,040
Yesterday he was edgy over Marcella's news.

456
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:46,677
What news?
I put two jars of jam aside for you.

457
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:47,674
Thank you.

458
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:50,581
Now I can make a tart for Sunday...

459
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,206
Marcella's in-laws are coming for lunch.

460
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:58,123
- Marcella's engaged to Giulio?
- Seems so.

461
00:41:58,332 --> 00:41:59,998
- Peppe!
- No need.

462
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:03,206
Hear that? Marcella's engaged.

463
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,623
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

464
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:07,873
- Ma'am, did you hear?
- Her, too?

465
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:10,873
- Her daughter's engaged
- Congratulations.

466
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:13,296
Thank you, but it's not official.

467
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,207
Don't say that, brings bad luck.

468
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,166
Let's celebrate at the café.

469
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,400
- My potatoes?
- They're yours when you pay for them.

470
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,749
Peppe, see to it, we got stuff to do.

471
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,707
- I gotta do a thousand things!
- Forget it!

472
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,291
What can happen?
Lunch is lunch.

473
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:36,957
See, what's important is locking away

474
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:40,582
that killer, SOB father-in-law of yours.

475
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:51,041
It means a lot to Marcella.
Me too, I didn't sleep all night.

476
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,083
Making a big deal of it!

477
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:57,734
Just feed them, he pulls out the ring,
a toast and it's done.

478
00:42:57,834 --> 00:42:59,333
You gotta stay calm.

479
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,833
Salvatore, on my tab,
you know where to find me.

480
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,166
Can't get far!

481
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:11,874
Take one of these.

482
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,499
Take one!

483
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,291
- Where did you get them?
- From an American.

484
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,458
For half a kilo of chicory sprouts.

485
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,499
You screwed him good!

486
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:40,208
When did these guys
ever see chicory sprouts?

487
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,499
In Wisconsin!

488
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,874
Poor guy!

489
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,958
Wonder if he knows you eat them.

490
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,291
Wow!

491
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,833
I gotta tell you something
nobody knows.

492
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:11,999
What did you do?

493
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:17,249
For months, I've been stealing
a little money from my jobs.

494
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,083
Stealing? It's your money.

495
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:23,083
Well, I don't give it to Ivano,
I put it away.

496
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,666
Almost 8,000 lire.

497
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,083
That's a barrel!

498
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:39,999
It's for Marcella's wedding dress.

499
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,124
Ivano wants her to wear my old one.

500
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,458
It was a rag even back then.

501
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,749
She's gotta be the most beautiful of all.

502
00:45:08,418 --> 00:45:10,834
Here, put it away.

503
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:16,834
Smoke it Sunday after the engagement.

504
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:30,959
Careful, you get...

505
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:35,084
- Little bits.
- Don't eat them.

506
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,250
Why are you crying?

507
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,917
Don't be a sissy, go play.

508
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,125
Rascal!

509
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:49,542
- It's all ready?
- Yes, thank you.

510
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,084
If you need a hand...
anything for Marcella.

511
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:55,875
- My good tablecloth's ready.
- Thank you, Mrs Giovanna.

512
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:58,584
I'll take this stuff home and come for it.

513
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:01,834
- Oh, then I'll wash and iron it.
- Don't worry, no rush.

514
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:04,875
Even lending her your good tablecloth?

515
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:07,042
So she'll look good with those snakes.

516
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,959
Yeah, sure am!

517
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:11,709
I lend it to who I want,
without your permission.

518
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:16,000
Delia, pay no mind,
she's just sour grapes.

519
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:20,709
It really chokes you to see
my Marcella settle with decent people.

520
00:46:20,918 --> 00:46:23,459
Decent? They're country yokels.

521
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:26,792
We all know they got rich using people.

522
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,792
- Rat-fink traitors!
- Watch your mouth.

523
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,417
- Or else? Gonna scratch me?
- Calm down!

524
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:37,417
- I'll smack you so hard, you'll spin.
- Yeah? Let's see.

525
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:41,459
Don't touch me!

526
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,959
- What's going on here?
- It smarts, eh?

527
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,417
That Marcella's pretty,
and no one's taking your daughter.

528
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:49,875
Wash your mouth
before naming my daughter.

529
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:51,667
The Mouth of Truth!

530
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,167
Clean your own mouth, it's all poison.

531
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:57,000
Calm down or your husbands will fix you.

532
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,584
No need.

533
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:01,292
Tell our husbands, then we're talking.

534
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:07,084
Okay, but I'll say your wretched brats
blow trash inside with peashooters.

535
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:09,917
- Not true!
- No, eh?

536
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:11,875
We all see them.

537
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,167
Ball!

538
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:48,460
Give it back!

539
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:51,376
Stop, you asshole!

540
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:54,043
I got it first!

541
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:58,376
Calm down. If you get dirty,
I swear I'll kill you.

542
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:02,835
- I'll catch you and whip your ass.
- Never catch me!

543
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:05,835
- Stay still!
- His fault, that son of a bitch.

544
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:07,626
Shut up, ugly wimp.

545
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:10,710
Another curse word
and I swear I'll kill you.

546
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:17,085
- Yummy!
- Careful!

547
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:19,251
Come here.

548
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:22,418
Go lock Grandpa in, then bring it back.

549
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,168
Hush, if he wakes up,
I swear I'll kill you.

550
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,960
Go.

551
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:37,001
Still like this?

552
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,668
Take off the apron and comb your hair.

553
00:49:39,878 --> 00:49:43,002
- I'm ready.
- The mending shows!

554
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:46,960
- It's all I've got.
- Put the apron back up.

555
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:51,460
Stay put, I'll go.

556
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:00,710
- Welcome!
- Hello, Dom Ivano.

557
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:02,002
- How are things?
- Fine.

558
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,502
- Santucci, a pleasure.
- Very pleased, Moretti.

559
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,043
Orietta, my wife.

560
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:10,002
- A pleasure.
- A pleasure.

561
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,127
Please sit down.

562
00:50:12,336 --> 00:50:14,252
And Luisa, the youngest.

563
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:15,960
- How are you?
- A pleasure.

564
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:17,710
Please come in.

565
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:21,293
Knock it off, you bastard!

566
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:35,961
Good.

567
00:50:36,961 --> 00:50:38,377
Never seen it with ditalinis.

568
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:43,043
I make it with rigatoni
and veal meatballs.

569
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,544
Oh well, yours is not as rich.

570
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,086
If you like,
I'll give you my butcher's address.

571
00:50:52,295 --> 00:50:55,336
He's a bit expensive, but sells quality.

572
00:50:58,754 --> 00:51:00,294
Thank you.

573
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:02,544
Franco doesn't like meat in pasta.

574
00:51:02,754 --> 00:51:04,169
Oh, Ma, that's fucking bullshit.

575
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,336
Eat.

576
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:13,503
Ma'am, you're not going to sit?

577
00:51:17,045 --> 00:51:18,586
Yes.

578
00:51:19,045 --> 00:51:21,503
Delia, get another half liter.

579
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,711
This wine slides down easy,
eh, Dom Mario?

580
00:51:26,462 --> 00:51:28,711
Yes, but at lunch, I have just one glass.

581
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:41,461
This pretty daughter, what's her trade?

582
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:44,128
Our Luisa studies.

583
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,503
- What's she do?
- She studies.

584
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:50,419
Now she's tackling ninth grade exams,
but gets all As.

585
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:00,253
I'll get the meatballs.

586
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:17,753
- More bread here, please.
- Yes.

587
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:22,961
In any case, I'm undecided where to stand.

588
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,044
Papa, it's not long now.

589
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:27,044
Ma, water!

590
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:30,503
With all we've been through,

591
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:32,586
something new's better.

592
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:35,794
And now I'm getting my say.

593
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,044
What can you say? Eat.

594
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,669
May I have the salt, please?

595
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:42,128
Sure.

596
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:46,711
Salt's not passed.

597
00:52:47,337 --> 00:52:48,669
It's bad luck.

598
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:53,086
Go get my cigarettes.

599
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:08,169
If you allow, Dom Ivano.

600
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,211
I'll offer a real one.

601
00:53:21,337 --> 00:53:23,128
Thank you, Dom Mario.

602
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,545
My dear guests,

603
00:53:38,755 --> 00:53:41,462
having you at our table
is a great pleasure.

604
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:46,045
But let's get to the reason
for this nice family reunion.

605
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,545
He's awake!

606
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:56,712
Someone's at the door?

607
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:58,212
No.

608
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,545
Good, these cigarettes.

609
00:54:00,755 --> 00:54:01,795
Damn you all!

610
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:02,930
Holy shit!

611
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,087
I forgot to lock Grandpa in.

612
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:08,212
- You idiot!
- You do fuck-all every day.

613
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:18,129
- He walks?
- Hasn't been up since before the war.

614
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:20,962
- Come, Papa.
- Papa the fuck!

615
00:54:22,255 --> 00:54:24,962
We eat decent for once and you don't call?

616
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:29,337
- A little baked pasta?
- Better believe it!

617
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:39,379
- Santucci Ottorino, a pleasure.
- Moretti, very pleased.

618
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:42,087
Papa, they're Giulio's parents.

619
00:54:42,296 --> 00:54:43,629
A pleasure.

620
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:46,004
Ah, I know!

621
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:50,087
You've got that café
in partners with Cecio the Rat.

622
00:54:50,963 --> 00:54:55,170
He sold more folks to the Germans
than you sell coffees at your café.

623
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,462
We were saying...

624
00:55:09,713 --> 00:55:12,629
This nice family reunion has a reason.

625
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:16,337
To get these two lovebirds pledged.

626
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:19,795
A promise is a promise, right, Giulio?

627
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,545
Give me your hand.

628
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:51,712
A toast to these two young people.

629
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,504
Congratulations!

630
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:55,837
- Pa, I get her bed.
- You said it was mine!

631
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:58,337
Get them off me, Delia!

632
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,795
There are right times and wrong!

633
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:03,712
Sit down.

634
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:06,004
Sweetheart!

635
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:07,712
Felicitations.

636
00:56:08,505 --> 00:56:10,629
Best wishes, congratulations.

637
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:13,587
- Sweetheart...
- Let me see.

638
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:18,754
That's a rhinestone!

639
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:21,420
I like it best of all.

640
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,295
When you pop out his first kid,

641
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,880
demand a real sparkler,
not a piece of glass.

642
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:29,380
- This piece of glass...
- I'll get the pastries!

643
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,838
Let's have a toast!

644
00:56:33,047 --> 00:56:35,171
Some wine, Papa.

645
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:38,922
- Have some wine with water like us.
- Wine's great!

646
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,088
- Me too, pa?
- Cheers!

647
00:56:42,214 --> 00:56:44,254
- Congratulations to these lovely kids!
- Thank you.

648
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:46,255
- Congratulations!
- Thank you all.

649
00:56:46,464 --> 00:56:47,755
Good for you, Marcella!

650
00:56:47,964 --> 00:56:49,922
I'm glad you like it.

651
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:52,463
She made baked pasta with ditalinis?!

652
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:54,713
Some wine for our mother-in-law.

653
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:57,713
This lovely girl, not even a drop?

654
00:56:57,923 --> 00:56:59,005
No, thank you.

655
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,338
My mama's plate!

656
00:57:08,548 --> 00:57:11,297
A tad of damage, eh?

657
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:13,628
Things happen.

658
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,172
Have to pay attention.

659
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:19,755
Don't mind me, celebrate.

660
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,672
Celebrate!

661
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:25,505
- I'll help you.
- No!

662
00:57:25,714 --> 00:57:27,130
It's all fragments.

663
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,505
Just continue celebrating!

664
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:33,255
Papa, let's go to our café for ice cream?

665
00:57:34,006 --> 00:57:35,963
- Yeah, ice cream!
- Let's go, Papa?

666
00:57:36,173 --> 00:57:37,297
Please!

667
00:57:38,173 --> 00:57:40,088
Go on, me and mama will come later.

668
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,797
Delia, take Papa to his room,
he's tired.

669
00:57:53,964 --> 00:57:56,255
- Goodbye.
- Lots of luck.

670
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:58,838
Come on, Papa.

671
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:01,524
- Mrs Delia...
- Please excuse us.

672
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:23,672
Ivano...

673
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:26,005
You can't even be a servant.

674
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,130
Hello!

675
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,505
Hello.

676
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:37,130
Giulio deserved better.

677
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:38,922
He wouldn't listen.

678
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:41,255
- She's cute.
- Not really...

679
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:44,547
Clever maybe! An ironer...

680
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:46,880
She hit the jackpot.

681
00:58:47,214 --> 00:58:50,672
Once married, she'll quit work,
Giulio will civilize her.

682
00:58:50,881 --> 00:58:53,880
What kills me
is being related to that riff-raff.

683
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:56,588
- Yokels.
- And ignorant!

684
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,838
Hello Dom Mario.

685
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:37,673
Right here? You bother my customers.

686
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:41,506
- This is my café.
- But the street's everyone's.

687
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,714
Let's hope Luisa chooses better.

688
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:55,339
Choose? I'm choosing for her.

689
00:59:57,215 --> 00:59:58,881
He's done.

690
00:59:59,965 --> 01:00:01,673
Good.

691
01:00:01,882 --> 01:00:06,589
- Please, leave.
- Calm it, be sure you do the right thing.

692
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,798
You too? It's a year
they been filling our heads.

693
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:17,089
Want to see me, Papa?

694
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:19,923
You're doing wrong with Delia.

695
01:00:21,757 --> 01:00:23,923
She asks for it.

696
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:26,214
Patience has a limit.

697
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,006
- But not this way.
- I know.

698
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:31,589
I'm sorry.

699
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,589
Come here.

700
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:37,798
Right here, son, sit down.

701
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:48,256
Listen to your old man.

702
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:53,631
You can't hit her all the time.

703
01:00:56,632 --> 01:00:58,673
She'll get used to it!

704
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:00,173
Once.

705
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:04,423
Once in awhile, a real good licking,
wicked, so she understands.

706
01:01:06,174 --> 01:01:10,339
I did that with your poor ma.
Ever see us fighting?

707
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:13,756
Why?

708
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:17,089
Because she was my cousin
and family's important.

709
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,798
Not the cousin thing again.

710
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:23,298
Since time began,
all men mate with cousins.

711
01:01:23,507 --> 01:01:25,339
It's the only sensible thing.

712
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,839
If you'd listened
and married your cousin Adelaide...

713
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:30,256
She was ugly as sin!

714
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:32,548
But she knew her place.

715
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:35,673
And I wouldn't have to hear the ruckus.

716
01:01:35,882 --> 01:01:38,048
I know, I'm sorry.

717
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,006
Anyway...

718
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:50,464
Delia's a good housewife,
her flaw is answering back.

719
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:54,923
She's gotta learn to shut her mouth.

720
01:01:57,757 --> 01:02:00,214
Don't let me hear her crying.

721
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:02,964
I feel sorry for her.

722
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:12,674
Besides, don't I got the right
to nap in peace?

723
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,965
<i>I feel so guilty with you</i>

724
01:02:32,508 --> 01:02:35,215
<i>And you with me</i>

725
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:40,007
<i>We don't dare exchange gazes</i>

726
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,174
<i>Because remorse</i>

727
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:46,507
<i>Weighs on our hearts</i>

728
01:02:47,841 --> 01:02:50,799
<i>Let's forgive one another</i>

729
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,090
<i>All the past</i>

730
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,674
<i>Every error</i>

731
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,132
<i>Let's forgive one another</i>

732
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:05,299
<i>Once again</i>

733
01:03:05,508 --> 01:03:08,340
<i>Let's return to loving as before</i>

734
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,632
<i>Like a single soul</i>

735
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:18,632
<i>Let's remember</i>

736
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,549
<i>The first day we met</i>

737
01:03:27,425 --> 01:03:28,924
<i>Let's remember</i>

738
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,965
<i>The radiant day</i>

739
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:36,257
<i>That changed our whole lives</i>

740
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,924
<i>From a single word</i>

741
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,591
<i>But then our love</i>

742
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:52,382
<i>For play or cruelty</i>

743
01:03:54,758 --> 01:03:59,466
<i>Lost it's sincerity</i>

744
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:06,049
<i>Let's forgive one another</i>

745
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,549
<i>Let's forgive one another</i>

746
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:15,882
<i>My love</i>

747
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:05,925
Sorry if I scared you.

748
01:06:08,176 --> 01:06:10,008
Don't worry about it.

749
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,175
I banged my arm. Let me go.

750
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:34,967
I don't understand a word.

751
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:42,050
Why's he have to shout?

752
01:06:45,926 --> 01:06:48,133
This guy's all I needed.

753
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:18,217
I thought you were joking.

754
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:22,258
I wish! This time I gotta go.

755
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:27,050
My cousin says there's work up North
and pay's good.

756
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:31,842
It's right.

757
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,633
You gotta go.

758
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,300
Take wool socks, winters bite.

759
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:46,342
Seems you don't care if I go.

760
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:49,093
That's not true and you know it.

761
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,759
Then think about it.

762
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:55,676
Think about it.

763
01:07:56,137 --> 01:07:57,170
Delia...

764
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:00,051
Now you know.

765
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:08,218
When do you go?

766
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,968
I'll wrap things up

767
01:08:13,177 --> 01:08:15,093
and leave on Sunday.

768
01:08:23,094 --> 01:08:24,968
I better go.

769
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:43,426
Think about it?

770
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:12,383
Marcella showed us the ring.

771
01:09:12,594 --> 01:09:14,258
We're happy for her.

772
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:17,008
- And for you.
- Congratulations!

773
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,758
Thank you!

774
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:24,926
How sweet, like from a film.

775
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:28,008
Yeah!

776
01:09:30,134 --> 01:09:31,801
I did one good thing, eh?

777
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:34,426
Seems yesterday she was sucking my boob!

778
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:36,468
Now she's got a ring.

779
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:41,343
Careful Dom Ottorino doesn't steal it,
he even hocked his gold teeth!

780
01:10:10,552 --> 01:10:12,384
Oh, no, the potatoes!

781
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,593
Marcella, come home, run!

782
01:10:26,635 --> 01:10:28,551
Oh no, what did I do?

783
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,551
- I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Help me.

784
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,510
Hurry, if your father comes,
it's hell to pay.

785
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:39,802
- Papa, sorry...
- Damn me and my empty head!

786
01:10:41,428 --> 01:10:44,177
- I forgot them, sorry.
- No, Mama...

787
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,552
Go watch the kids.

788
01:10:46,762 --> 01:10:48,636
- Ma...
- Go!

789
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,136
What's to look at?

790
01:11:45,678 --> 01:11:49,427
It's bread and milk tonight.
Thank your retard mama.

791
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,386
See? All sorted out.

792
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:07,594
What's sorted out?

793
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:11,427
Is this how you sort things out?

794
01:12:11,637 --> 01:12:14,136
He let off steam and we get some peace.

795
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:16,427
Go get the bread.

796
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:18,052
Aren't you ashamed?

797
01:12:18,928 --> 01:12:21,094
Don't you see you're a doormat?

798
01:12:21,387 --> 01:12:23,927
You're worth nothing, count nothing.

799
01:13:21,595 --> 01:13:24,552
- For a signature, call your husband.
- I'll sign.

800
01:13:25,345 --> 01:13:28,553
- Your husband?
- Listen, there's no man here.

801
01:13:28,763 --> 01:13:32,387
Settle for this
or you're taking the zippers back.

802
01:13:34,346 --> 01:13:37,178
What's got into your heads, all of you?

803
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:42,595
- So, we were saying?
- Two hundred.

804
01:13:43,304 --> 01:13:45,053
Two hundred lire.

805
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:48,303
Thank you.

806
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:50,845
Goodbye.

807
01:14:57,429 --> 01:14:59,678
- Hi, Marisa.
- Hi, Delia.

808
01:15:04,054 --> 01:15:05,970
Listen, I need a favor.

809
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,387
Sunday, after Mass,

810
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:15,637
I gotta give shots in your building.

811
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,470
Okay! What's the favor?

812
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:21,887
That's the favor.

813
01:15:23,429 --> 01:15:26,512
- You gotta back me.
- So? Where are you going?

814
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:29,345
I can't say.

815
01:15:32,096 --> 01:15:35,303
- You got someone! Praise to heaven!
- No!

816
01:15:35,638 --> 01:15:37,512
- Will you do me this favor?
- Yes!

817
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:39,928
So, if Ivano asks,

818
01:15:40,138 --> 01:15:42,678
Sunday you're coming to give shots.

819
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:46,345
Well, well!

820
01:15:48,638 --> 01:15:50,428
- If you leave...
- No!

821
01:15:50,638 --> 01:15:52,387
If you leave,

822
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:55,803
don't get caught,
he'll kill you this time.

823
01:15:56,013 --> 01:15:59,095
- Come on, really?
- Really, yeah.

824
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,678
Listen to this moron.

825
01:16:08,304 --> 01:16:09,553
Bye, Marisa.

826
01:16:10,513 --> 01:16:11,928
Bye, Delia.

827
01:16:17,763 --> 01:16:19,346
Delia?

828
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,804
C'mon, stop!

829
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:47,763
- She can't see us.
- She can!

830
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:53,471
You're so beautiful.

831
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:56,929
Why the make-up?

832
01:16:57,139 --> 01:16:58,888
What's this new thing?

833
01:16:59,222 --> 01:17:02,346
- Don't you like me like this?
- Yeah, a lot.

834
01:17:02,805 --> 01:17:04,763
Why did you go so decked out?

835
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,846
To work.

836
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:10,221
It's not okay.

837
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:13,971
- No?
- You wear makeup just for me.

838
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:17,513
But I got made up to be pretty for you.

839
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,638
- Sure?
- Yes.

840
01:17:21,764 --> 01:17:23,471
You're hurting me!

841
01:17:26,472 --> 01:17:28,888
- Just for me.
- Just for you.

842
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:36,096
If it's just for me, from now on
you go to work natural.

843
01:17:39,097 --> 01:17:41,388
Anyway, when we're married
you'll quit working.

844
01:17:42,556 --> 01:17:45,096
- Who says so?
- Me.

845
01:17:48,056 --> 01:17:49,763
You're mine.

846
01:17:51,222 --> 01:17:53,513
Okay? Just mine.

847
01:17:55,472 --> 01:17:57,138
Just yours.

848
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:43,555
C'mon, she can see us!

849
01:19:02,244 --> 01:19:03,263
Marcella.

850
01:19:04,931 --> 01:19:06,971
Come a minute.

851
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,722
- What is it?
- Sit down.

852
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:24,514
- Well?
- I was thinking.

853
01:19:28,098 --> 01:19:31,097
Marriage is something nice.

854
01:19:34,473 --> 01:19:36,222
But, it's for life.

855
01:19:38,015 --> 01:19:40,014
No turning back.

856
01:19:41,432 --> 01:19:44,014
So? What are you saying?

857
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:49,181
Giulio really loves you?

858
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:53,681
You gotta choose your man good.

859
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,139
He's gotta be the right one.
Giulio's the right one?

860
01:19:57,348 --> 01:19:58,639
You tell me,

861
01:19:59,307 --> 01:20:01,306
since you chose so well.

862
01:20:02,223 --> 01:20:04,181
What did I ever understand?

863
01:20:05,432 --> 01:20:07,514
But you still have time.

864
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:12,847
You too.

865
01:20:30,307 --> 01:20:31,972
They gift the house, the rings

866
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,306
and even got a good photographer.

867
01:20:35,973 --> 01:20:39,097
We gotta do the flowers,
but I think we could do without.

868
01:20:39,307 --> 01:20:41,222
For those, ask Father Felice.

869
01:20:41,432 --> 01:20:45,306
God willing, if someone croaks the day
before, we get them from the funeral.

870
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:47,139
Good.

871
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,639
For the dress, there's Delia's.

872
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:52,847
You fixed it up, right?
It's gotta look new.

873
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,015
Yes.

874
01:20:55,265 --> 01:20:58,389
For the music, I say we ask Alvaro.
He was a singer.

875
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,472
Who's he?

876
01:21:00,682 --> 01:21:03,681
Nuvoloni, Pa.
The guy who comes every morning.

877
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,556
That deadbeat?

878
01:21:05,765 --> 01:21:08,056
He's bad luck, God forbid!

879
01:21:08,265 --> 01:21:10,264
I don't want him at the wedding.

880
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:12,472
Think they love each other, really?

881
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:19,847
- What kind of question's that?
- Opens her mouth, words fall out.

882
01:21:20,598 --> 01:21:23,014
Maybe you don't get the picture.

883
01:21:23,223 --> 01:21:26,097
We gotta get Marcella set up and us too.

884
01:21:26,307 --> 01:21:30,136
Think it sucks your daughter's
becoming a lady? Eh, Delia?

885
01:21:32,932 --> 01:21:35,597
But with those scrubbed-up yokels...

886
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:38,056
If it was up to me,

887
01:21:38,265 --> 01:21:41,472
I'd kick them straight to hell,
those skinflint hicks.

888
01:21:41,682 --> 01:21:43,806
But so long as they got the café,

889
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:46,306
this marriage does us all good.

890
01:22:40,183 --> 01:22:43,098
She just can't accept it, poor Marcella!

891
01:22:44,183 --> 01:22:47,390
She wanted him anyway,
but Dom Ivano won't have it.

892
01:22:47,599 --> 01:22:49,182
I can understand.

893
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:53,007
He's not all wrong,
can't give his girl to a broke bum.

894
01:22:53,224 --> 01:22:55,015
- It's nowhere.
- They're dirt-poor now.

895
01:22:55,224 --> 01:22:57,223
Back to the village, at least they'll eat.

896
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:01,140
Nothing's left of the café, not one chair.

897
01:23:01,349 --> 01:23:03,765
It was done with TNT.

898
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:05,515
But I wonder,

899
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:08,390
who could have been so spiteful?

900
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,098
Zillions!

901
01:23:10,683 --> 01:23:12,932
There's a long line.

902
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:15,723
- Reap what you sow.
- Aren't you ashamed?

903
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:16,933
No.

904
01:23:28,808 --> 01:23:31,348
Enough moaning! Stop.

905
01:23:31,933 --> 01:23:35,432
I'm a good guy and all,
but my patience has its limit.

906
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:37,640
Giulio loved me.

907
01:23:37,849 --> 01:23:40,348
Love can't make lunch or dinner.

908
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:44,973
Giulio hasn't got a pot to piss in.
They even took the ring back.

909
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:48,682
Tight-wad louts! Like to know
what good's a chunk of glass.

910
01:23:50,183 --> 01:23:53,807
Once hicks, always hicks.

911
01:23:56,641 --> 01:24:01,515
Tell me, you want to wander that village
barefoot, roped to an ass, eh?

912
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:05,973
I'm leaving.

913
01:24:17,308 --> 01:24:19,640
Mama, say something!

914
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:23,349
You never do anything!

915
01:24:24,683 --> 01:24:26,640
That's what you think.

916
01:24:59,642 --> 01:25:03,100
<i>It's the night of miracles, be careful</i>

917
01:25:03,726 --> 01:25:06,016
<i>Someone in the back alleys of Rome</i>

918
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,850
<i>With his mouth, is wrecking a song</i>

919
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:15,808
<i>It's the night of dogs
talking among themselves</i>

920
01:25:16,017 --> 01:25:18,891
<i>Of the moon that's about to wane</i>

921
01:25:19,976 --> 01:25:24,433
<i>And people run into the squares to see</i>

922
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:31,433
<i>This night so sweet you could drink it</i>

923
01:25:31,767 --> 01:25:34,641
<i>Of sharing a stadium
with a hundred thousand</i>

924
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:38,141
<i>A night so strange and deep</i>

925
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:41,433
<i>That even the radio says it</i>

926
01:25:41,726 --> 01:25:44,016
<i>Actually, it airs it</i>

927
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:47,100
<i>So black it dirties the sheets</i>

928
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,766
<i>It's the hour of miracles that bewilder</i>

929
01:25:50,601 --> 01:25:54,016
<i>I seem to hear the sound of a ship</i>

930
01:25:55,101 --> 01:25:57,141
<i>On the waves</i>

931
01:26:00,184 --> 01:26:02,850
<i>The city is moving</i>

932
01:26:07,559 --> 01:26:11,766
<i>With its squares, gardens
and people in cafes</i>

933
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:19,350
<i>It floats and sails away</i>

934
01:26:22,517 --> 01:26:27,141
<i>Even without power it will go</i>

935
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:35,058
<i>But tonight it flies</i>

936
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:42,100
<i>Its sails on the houses
are a thousand sheets</i>

937
01:26:45,017 --> 01:26:49,058
<i>There are thugs too</i>

938
01:26:49,642 --> 01:26:53,308
<i>No need to be afraid
but just a little careful</i>

939
01:26:53,517 --> 01:26:56,683
<i>Two by two the lovers</i>

940
01:26:57,101 --> 01:27:00,100
<i>Unfurl their sails like pirates</i>

941
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:03,600
<i>And in the midst of this sea</i>

942
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:10,433
<i>I'll try to find out which star you are</i>

943
01:27:13,642 --> 01:27:17,266
<i>Because I'd be lost</i>

944
01:27:20,267 --> 01:27:24,641
<i>If I realized you're not here tonight</i>

945
01:28:09,893 --> 01:28:13,184
Are you ready?
Marcella, let's go.

946
01:28:13,393 --> 01:28:15,642
Don't shout, I'm right here.

947
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:17,976
- Your father?
- In the toilet.

948
01:28:18,185 --> 01:28:20,184
Come here. Stay still!

949
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,476
- Ma, we're going!
- Father Felice won't wait Mass.

950
01:28:23,685 --> 01:28:25,517
Come on. Behave!

951
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:32,267
- Move!
- See if Papa needs something.

952
01:28:32,643 --> 01:28:33,976
Yes.

953
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,892
Papa?

954
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,392
Need something?

955
01:28:41,143 --> 01:28:43,601
Please, don't waste my...

956
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,476
Get a move on.

957
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,309
Coming!

958
01:29:28,185 --> 01:29:29,934
Not today.

959
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,434
We're going now.

960
01:29:43,643 --> 01:29:45,851
And we're going to Mass.

961
01:29:48,518 --> 01:29:51,101
Here I am. C'mon, boys!

962
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:55,267
Hey, slow down! What's the rush?

963
01:29:55,477 --> 01:29:57,351
We'll be late.

964
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,601
Papa? Things okay, need anything?

965
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:06,476
Thing's are okay,
he doesn't need anything.

966
01:30:06,893 --> 01:30:08,559
Let's go!

967
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,851
May the almighty and merciful Lord

968
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,517
grant us the forgiveness, the absolution
and the remission of our sins...

969
01:30:42,936 --> 01:30:44,852
Going to see Dom Ottorino.

970
01:31:01,894 --> 01:31:03,518
Dom Ottorino?

971
01:31:07,436 --> 01:31:10,727
Dom Ottorino, it's Alvaro,
need anything?

972
01:31:17,894 --> 01:31:19,560
Dom Ottorino?

973
01:31:37,436 --> 01:31:38,769
You may go.

974
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:41,810
And today, please,

975
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:44,769
act according your conscience.

976
01:31:44,978 --> 01:31:48,435
The conscience of God our Almighty Lord

977
01:31:48,645 --> 01:31:51,810
who always watches and judges you.

978
01:32:10,478 --> 01:32:12,852
Enough of this long face.

979
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,727
Nobody's died!

980
01:32:16,853 --> 01:32:19,019
DOWN WITH THE SAVIOIAS
HURRAH FOR THE REPUBLIC

981
01:32:19,228 --> 01:32:21,519
- Did we find the fourth?
- No which way!

982
01:32:21,978 --> 01:32:26,602
They're all busy, no one came.
Never seen such ruckus on the streets!

983
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:29,852
I went this morning,
such a line you can't get by.

984
01:32:30,061 --> 01:32:31,227
So, see you later.

985
01:32:32,728 --> 01:32:34,060
What's in there?

986
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,477
The syringe
and what's needed to disinfect.

987
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:39,477
I'm going to Marisa's.

988
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:45,102
Go on.

989
01:32:47,811 --> 01:32:50,269
Dom Ottorino is dead!

990
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,310
That's how I found him.

991
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,519
Just now.

992
01:33:00,728 --> 01:33:03,269
I ran like a cheetah.

993
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:07,185
Papa, so we can get his room?

994
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,727
Why did you take him from me?

995
01:33:14,936 --> 01:33:17,894
- Why?
- Don't act like this! Get up.

996
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,978
Don't act this way.

997
01:33:20,562 --> 01:33:21,895
Papa!

998
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:23,645
Why?

999
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:27,603
Why, Papa?

1000
01:33:27,854 --> 01:33:30,228
Why did you take him away?

1001
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:34,353
- So, I'll be going.
- Where the fuck to?

1002
01:33:34,562 --> 01:33:36,936
Papa! Let me be alone.

1003
01:33:40,146 --> 01:33:42,811
- Let me be alone.
- Go home now.

1004
01:33:43,646 --> 01:33:45,311
We'll all come over later.

1005
01:33:54,187 --> 01:33:56,520
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

1006
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,561
- Doughnuts!
- Hands off! They're not for you.

1007
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:29,186
He was still warm,
gone just a few minutes.

1008
01:34:30,312 --> 01:34:32,061
He seemed to smile at me.

1009
01:34:33,562 --> 01:34:36,978
He loved me, like a son!

1010
01:34:43,146 --> 01:34:46,020
No more decent men like him.

1011
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,145
A saint.

1012
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:54,978
- Papa, now the room's ours!
- C'mon, Papa!

1013
01:34:55,187 --> 01:34:57,145
Not here!

1014
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,186
Ivano, have some water.

1015
01:35:08,146 --> 01:35:10,853
Papa, how can I go on without you?

1016
01:35:11,771 --> 01:35:13,020
Be strong.

1017
01:35:20,562 --> 01:35:23,061
Who's that old bag?

1018
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:29,978
How do I know...

1019
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,686
Sweetheart, why suffer like this?

1020
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:39,145
Grandpa was an old man.

1021
01:35:39,771 --> 01:35:43,020
I don't give a damn about grandpa!
I'm crying for Giulio!

1022
01:35:50,396 --> 01:35:53,853
What immense, infinite grief.

1023
01:35:54,437 --> 01:35:56,603
- Coffee?
- Two sugars.

1024
01:35:57,729 --> 01:35:59,228
If only I had some!

1025
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,395
What immense grief.
Immense and infinite!

1026
01:36:04,604 --> 01:36:06,770
Oh, God!

1027
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:09,395
- Everyone loved him.
- Everyone!

1028
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:12,104
He smiled at me.

1029
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,104
Thank you.

1030
01:36:25,188 --> 01:36:27,729
I knocked and knocked, but no answer.

1031
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:30,521
Dom Ottorino? Dom Ottorino?

1032
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:32,312
Silence. I knocked once,

1033
01:36:32,522 --> 01:36:34,146
knocked twice,

1034
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:36,062
let me go see.

1035
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,854
I went in, he was still alive.

1036
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:42,146
He looked at me, like asking for help.

1037
01:36:43,313 --> 01:36:45,687
He didn't speak
but his eyes were shouting.

1038
01:36:48,188 --> 01:36:49,396
Stop it!

1039
01:36:49,605 --> 01:36:51,146
Outside to play.

1040
01:36:51,355 --> 01:36:52,937
Outside.

1041
01:36:54,855 --> 01:36:57,896
We left soon as we heard,
but there's a ruckus!

1042
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,896
You can't get through.

1043
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:02,979
Everybody today? Go tomorrow.

1044
01:37:03,188 --> 01:37:04,937
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:08,687
- It is what it is... Coffee?
- Gladly!

1046
01:37:27,897 --> 01:37:30,021
- Our condolences.
- Thank you.

1047
01:37:30,688 --> 01:37:31,812
Ivano...

1048
01:37:32,022 --> 01:37:33,229
- Condolences.
- Thank you.

1049
01:37:33,438 --> 01:37:34,896
Can I talk to you?

1050
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:36,812
What immense, infinite grief.

1051
01:37:37,022 --> 01:37:39,062
I gotta go to Marisa's.

1052
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:42,312
- She's waiting for me.
- Go to the door.

1053
01:37:53,855 --> 01:37:55,604
Thank heaven you came!

1054
01:37:55,813 --> 01:37:58,812
We heard... we just couldn't not come.

1055
01:37:59,772 --> 01:38:02,854
- Peppe, Marisa!
- Condolences.

1056
01:38:03,063 --> 01:38:05,229
All our condolences.

1057
01:38:06,272 --> 01:38:08,979
- What happened?
- Alvaro found him.

1058
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:14,229
I looked at me and said just four words.

1059
01:38:15,022 --> 01:38:16,813
I love you...

1060
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:18,896
Alvaro.

1061
01:38:41,814 --> 01:38:43,854
I waited quite a long time,

1062
01:38:44,064 --> 01:38:45,729
but once we heard..

1063
01:38:47,022 --> 01:38:49,063
Peppe wanted to come.

1064
01:38:51,564 --> 01:38:53,063
Who's that old bag?

1065
01:38:53,272 --> 01:38:54,896
Who knows!

1066
01:38:58,647 --> 01:39:01,064
Ma'am, get up, you're getting' moldy.

1067
01:39:01,273 --> 01:39:03,564
Get up, go rest.

1068
01:39:03,773 --> 01:39:07,522
Have some water,
or our next prayers will be for you.

1069
01:39:07,773 --> 01:39:09,230
Thank you.

1070
01:39:14,273 --> 01:39:16,897
Thank heaven I found you!

1071
01:39:17,606 --> 01:39:20,314
Imagine if you'd already left,
what would I tell Ivano?

1072
01:39:20,565 --> 01:39:22,022
Good God!

1073
01:39:26,773 --> 01:39:29,564
Of all the days, he decided to die today.

1074
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:34,105
He did it out of spite, the wretch.

1075
01:39:34,315 --> 01:39:37,230
- Malicious scumbag.
- Degenerate stinker.

1076
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,855
- Murderous skunk.
- Cursed sleaze-bag.

1077
01:39:42,773 --> 01:39:44,772
Say a prayer for us, too.

1078
01:39:45,523 --> 01:39:47,355
We've given him a good many.

1079
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:49,564
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1080
01:39:53,315 --> 01:39:55,314
Come on, Delia!

1081
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:58,814
It's best this way.
What were you thinking?

1082
01:39:59,898 --> 01:40:02,272
Ivano's a skunk, but...

1083
01:40:03,606 --> 01:40:05,022
Think of the kids.

1084
01:40:08,315 --> 01:40:10,272
Think of Marcella.

1085
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,480
That's exactly who I'm thinking of.

1086
01:40:25,023 --> 01:40:26,480
There's still tomorrow!

1087
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:29,814
Holy Mary...

1088
01:40:30,023 --> 01:40:31,647
No, that's enough, ma'am.

1089
01:40:33,106 --> 01:40:34,897
That's enough, really.

1090
01:43:03,482 --> 01:43:06,648
<i>for Marcella</i>

1091
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:21,481
What a scare!

1092
01:43:22,357 --> 01:43:25,356
- Where are you going?
- To give shots.

1093
01:43:26,774 --> 01:43:30,231
- Shots for Marisa's neighbors.
- So early?

1094
01:43:31,566 --> 01:43:32,731
Ridiculous!

1095
01:43:33,232 --> 01:43:35,315
Make breakfast, move.

1096
01:43:37,482 --> 01:43:39,773
Papa? All okay last night?

1097
01:43:41,899 --> 01:43:44,023
Yes, didn't move a muscle.

1098
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:47,856
Let me go do these shots.

1099
01:43:49,732 --> 01:43:52,606
We need money for the funeral.

1100
01:43:53,732 --> 01:43:56,023
We'll get him some proper flowers.

1101
01:43:57,107 --> 01:43:59,148
He deserves them, doesn't he?

1102
01:44:11,816 --> 01:44:13,648
See you're back soon.

1103
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,483
That sneak!

1104
01:46:39,234 --> 01:46:43,483
<i>With this you kan go to skool.
Mama.</i>

1105
01:48:27,151 --> 01:48:28,859
Everyone, please.

1106
01:48:29,068 --> 01:48:31,317
One at a time, don't push.

1107
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,775
Get your documents ready.

1108
01:49:15,526 --> 01:49:18,317
<i>Make way because... come by tomorrow</i>

1109
01:49:19,401 --> 01:49:21,609
<i>Because now we can't</i>

1110
01:49:22,693 --> 01:49:26,275
<i>I won't open today because I'm on strike</i>

1111
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:31,734
<i>And we'll walk In the streets
with all the banners</i>

1112
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:37,650
<i>Looking, as always, like idiots</i>

1113
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:43,817
<i>I could care less about that, you know</i>

1114
01:49:44,776 --> 01:49:48,192
<i>Today I sing with all the others</i>

1115
01:49:50,401 --> 01:49:54,275
<i>Because I believe in it
or maybe for decency</i>

1116
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:58,984
<i>Participation, of course, is freedom</i>

1117
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:02,150
<i>But so is opposition</i>

1118
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,525
WOMEN on June 2 and 3
VOTE for the REPUBLIC

1119
01:50:04,735 --> 01:50:07,025
<i>I have no shield to protect myself</i>

1120
01:50:07,235 --> 01:50:10,484
<i>Or weapons to defend myself</i>

1121
01:50:11,193 --> 01:50:13,484
<i>Or helmets to hide myself</i>

1122
01:50:13,693 --> 01:50:16,234
<i>Or saints to whom address myself</i>

1123
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:21,525
<i>All I have is this tongue in my mouth
and maybe half a dream in my pocket</i>

1124
01:50:21,735 --> 01:50:24,610
<i>And many, many bad mistakes</i>

1125
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:29,068
<i>But I pay for them all...</i>

1126
01:50:39,319 --> 01:50:41,651
Ladies are requested
to remove their lipstick

1127
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:44,360
before licking the ballots to seal them.

1128
01:50:44,569 --> 01:50:47,776
Lipstick stains
might invalidate the ballots.

1129
01:50:55,444 --> 01:50:58,818
<i>And the words. I know,
are always the same</i>

1130
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:03,943
<i>But the sun's come out
and they seem nicer</i>

1131
01:51:04,819 --> 01:51:09,235
<i>School and work, what original topics</i>

1132
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:15,443
<i>Except for that old idea
of us all being equal</i>

1133
01:51:18,194 --> 01:51:22,276
<i>And with no shield to protect myself</i>
