00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,469
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

3
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,799
<i>it walked with its arms swinging.</i>

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,609
<i>It wanted the stream to be a river...</i>

5
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,200
<i>the river a torrent...</i>

6
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,219
<i>and this puddle to be the sea.</i>

7
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,189
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

8
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,689
<i>it didn't know it was a child.</i>

9
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,659
<i>Everything was full of life...</i>

10
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,219
<i>and all life was one.</i>

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,990
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,399
<i>it had no opinion about anything.</i>

13
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,230
<i>It had no habits.</i>

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,209
<i>It often sat cross-legged, took off running...</i>

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>had a cowlick in its hair...</i>

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,739
<i>and didn't pull a face when photographed.</i>

17
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,430
Look!

18
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,509
<i>The consolation of lifting one's head
out here in the open...</i>

19
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,979
<i>the consolation of seeing the color...</i>

20
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,719
<i>enlightened through the sun
in all men's eyes.</i>

21
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>At last mad, at last no longer alone!</i>

22
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,960
<i>At last mad, at last redeemed!</i>

23
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,370
<i>At last mad, at last at peace!</i>

24
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,699
<i>There's a little house...</i>

25
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,329
<i>with two floors and a terrace.</i>

26
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,629
<i>And every day we go bathing.</i>

27
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,930
<i>And the man who lives there....</i>

28
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>I don't even understand this character.</i>

29
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,069
<i>It's amazing how little
I know about this part.</i>

30
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,939
<i>maybe we'll discover it during the shoot.</i>

31
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,279
<i>I'll get a good costume,
That's half the battle.</i>

32
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,949
<i>Berlin.</i>

33
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,949
<i>Emil Jannings.</i>

34
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,949
<i>Kennedy.</i>

35
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,689
<i>Von Stauffenberg.</i>

36
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,259
<i>Hell of a guy.</i>

37
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,920
What a pretty picture!

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,860
<i>That wasn't in Berlin.</i>

39
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,339
<i>What difference does it make? It happened.</i>

40
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,240
<i>If grandma was here, she'd say "spazier."</i>

41
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,829
"Go spazieren."

42
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,899
<i>Tokyo, Kyoto...</i>

43
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,000
<i>Paris, London, Trieste...</i>

44
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,970
<i>Berlin.</i>

45
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,699
<i>Nothing to see on TV.</i>

46
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,529
<i>You stumble over your colors
and are never punctual.</i>

47
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,699
<i>I'll think of something.</i>

48
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,980
<i>It's still the same smell. But dustier.</i>

49
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,519
<i>She collected everything.</i>

50
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,519
<i>...even U-Bahn tickets.</i>

51
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120
<i>She never threw anything away.</i>

52
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,689
<i>Mother, my mother...</i>

53
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,829
<i>she never was.</i>

54
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,389
<i>My father....</i>

55
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,500
<i>My father was my father.</i>

56
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,170
<i>She is dead.</i>

57
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,639
<i>No tears, no grief.</i>

58
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,470
<i>Maybe later.</i>

59
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,269
<i>She doesn't love you,
she has never loved you.</i>

60
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,740
<i>And you too are only pretending.</i>

61
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,779
<i>You should be glad they've forgotten you.</i>

62
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,839
<i>At last you're free.</i>

63
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,519
<i>My God, what will become of the boy?</i>

64
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,860
<i>He's only got music in his head.</i>

65
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,430
<i>What does he want now?</i>

66
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>I already bought him a guitar.</i>

67
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,079
<i>Now he wants drums.</i>

68
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,170
<i>In the end, I'm getting fed up with it.</i>

69
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,220
<i>Won't he ever grow up?</i>

70
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,389
<i>I'm getting fed up.</i>

71
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,460
<i>I can't help him anymore.</i>

72
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,029
<i>No wonder. He only learned rock n' roll.</i>

73
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,700
<i>Maybe he'll grow up one day.</i>

74
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,610
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

75
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,620
<i>it was the time of these questions.</i>

76
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,190
<i>Why am I me...</i>

77
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,429
<i>and why not you?</i>

78
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,799
<i>Why am I here, and why not there?</i>

79
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:28,059
<i>When did time begin,
and where does space end?</i>

80
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,750
<i>Isn't life under the sun just a dream?</i>

81
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,649
<i>Isn't what I see, hear, and smell...</i>

82
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,980
<i>just the mirage of a world before the world?</i>

83
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,620
<i>Does evil actually exist...</i>

84
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,559
<i>and are there people who are really evil?</i>

85
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,399
<i>How can it be that I, who am I...</i>

86
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,110
<i>wasn't before I was...</i>

87
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,970
<i>and that sometime I, the one I am...</i>

88
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,470
<i>no longer will be the one I am?</i>

89
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,220
<i>The child needs oxygen.</i>

90
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,509
<i>Breathe deep down.</i>

91
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,610
<i>If I could only suffer in her place.</i>

92
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,950
<i>It hurts! But it'll be over soon.</i>

93
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,889
<i>It's almost over.</i>

94
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,539
<i>Poor little mite, I'm anxious to see you.
I just wonder what you'll look like.</i>

95
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,259
Bastard!

96
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,570
<i>Women will fuck up your life.</i>

97
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,200
<i>Blackie, I've lost my way.
We wanted to go to the cemetery.</i>

98
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,309
Well?

99
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,460
Sunrise at 7:22, sunset at 4:28.

100
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,049
Moonrise at 7:04, moonset....

101
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,889
Water level of the Havel and the Spree.

102
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,870
Twenty years ago today...

103
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,299
a Soviet jet fighter crashed
in Spandau Lake.

104
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,830
Fifty years ago there were--

105
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,570
The Olympic Games.

106
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,740
Two hundred years ago,
Blanchard flew over the city in a balloon.

107
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,409
Like the fugitives the other day.

108
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,879
And today...

109
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,419
on the Lilienthaler Chaussee,
a man walks slowly...

110
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,320
and looks over his shoulder into space.

111
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,029
At Post Office 44, someone who wants
to put an end to it today...

112
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,120
has stuck collectors' stamps
on his farewell letters.

113
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,600
A different one on each.

114
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:14,230
Then he spoke English
with an American soldier...

115
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,789
for the first time since his schooldays,
very fluently.

116
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,340
A prisoner at PlÃ¶tzensee...

117
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,009
just before dashing his head
against the wall...

118
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,450
said, "Now!"

119
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,289
At the Zoo U-Bahn station, the guard,
instead of the station's name...

120
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,539
suddenly shouted, "Tierra del Fuego!"

121
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,490
<i>In the hills, an old man was reading
The Odyssey to a child...</i>

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,429
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes.

123
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,129
And what do you have to tell?

124
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,309
A passer-by, in the rain,
folded her umbrella...

125
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,940
and was drenched.

126
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,980
A schoolboy...

127
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,610
who described to his teacher...

128
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,519
how a fern grows out of the earth,
and astounded the teacher.

129
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,789
A blind woman who groped for her watch...

130
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,659
feeling my presence.

131
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,629
It's great to live by the spirit,
to testify day by day...

132
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,330
for eternity, only what's spiritual
in people's minds.

133
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,509
But sometimes I'm fed up
with my spiritual existence.

134
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,450
Instead of forever hovering above...

135
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,009
I'd like to feel a weight grow in me...

136
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,820
to end the infinity and to tie me to earth.

137
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,519
I'd like, at each step, each gust of wind,
to be able to say "now."

138
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,320
"Now and now"...

139
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,889
and no longer "forever" and "for eternity."

140
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,399
To sit at the empty place at a card table...

141
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,429
and be greeted, even by a nod.

142
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,009
Every time we participated,
it was a pretense.

143
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,440
Wrestling with one...

144
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,009
allowing a hip to be put out in pretense...

145
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,049
catching a fish in pretense...

146
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,690
in pretense sitting at tables...

147
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,750
drinking and eating in pretense.

148
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,620
Having lambs roasted and wine...

149
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,529
served in the tents out there
in the desert, only in pretense.

150
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,889
No, I don't have to beget a child
or plant a tree...

151
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,090
but it would be rather nice...

152
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,870
coming home after a long day...

153
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,850
to feed the cat, like Philip Marlowe...

154
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,509
to have a fever...

155
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,570
and blackened fingers from the newspaper...

156
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:44,049
to be excited not only by the mind...

157
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,149
but, at last, by a meal...

158
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,820
by the line of a neck...

159
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,190
by an ear.

160
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,259
To lie!

161
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,899
Through one's teeth.

162
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,700
As you're walking,
to feel your bones moving along.

163
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,769
At last to guess, instead of always knowing.

164
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,179
To be able to say "ah" and "oh" and "hey"...

165
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,970
instead of "yea" and "amen."

166
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,419
To be able, once in a while,
to enthuse for evil.

167
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,549
To draw all the demons
of the earth from passers-by...

168
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,299
and to chase them out into the world!

169
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,690
To be a savage.

170
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,529
Or at last to feel how it is...

171
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,070
to take off shoes under a table...

172
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:38,029
to wriggle your toes barefoot, like that.

173
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,509
Stay alone!

174
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,080
Let things happen!

175
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,220
Keep serious!

176
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,240
We can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious.

177
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,889
Do no more than look!
Assemble, testify, preserve!

178
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,059
Remain spirit!

179
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,230
Keep your distance. Keep your word.

180
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,830
Look, a convertible!

181
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,840
You don't buy that!

182
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,470
You steal it, if not it's stolen from you.

183
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,039
Just imagine...

184
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,110
open the roof, leave the smog behind....

185
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,620
In a pimp's jalopy.

186
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,630
<i>Tell me, muse, of the storyteller...</i>

187
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,309
<i>who has been thrust
to the edge of the world...</i>

188
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,640
<i>both an infant and an ancient...</i>

189
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,710
<i>and through him reveal everyman.</i>

190
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,930
<i>With time...</i>

191
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,190
<i>those who listened to me
became my readers.</i>

192
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,400
<i>They no longer sit in a circle...</i>

193
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,380
<i>but rather sit apart...</i>

194
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,430
<i>and one doesn't know anything
about the other.</i>

195
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,049
<i>I'm an old man...</i>

196
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,579
<i>with a broken voice...</i>

197
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,589
<i>but the tale...</i>

198
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,279
<i>still rises from the depths...</i>

199
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,680
<i>and the mouth, slightly opened, repeats it...</i>

200
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,470
<i>as clearly, as powerfully.</i>

201
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,440
<i>A liturgy...</i>

202
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,869
<i>for which no one needs to be initiated...</i>

203
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,700
<i>to the meaning of words and sentences.</i>

204
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,809
<i>Maybe she doesn't have the money
to see another doctor.</i>

205
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,319
<i>It's four years since I saw her...</i>

206
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,329
<i>and two that she's been ill.</i>

207
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,859
<i>When will you finally pray
with your own words...</i>

208
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,930
<i>and not for life eternal?</i>

209
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,539
<i>And these young girls
who make eyes at men.</i>

210
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:51,269
<i>So why am I living?</i>

211
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,779
<i>How will I pay, with my small pension?</i>

212
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,029
<i>You are lost,
but it can go on for a long time.</i>

213
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:22,099
<i>Disowned by your parents,
betrayed by your wife...</i>

214
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,200
<i>your friend is in another town.</i>

215
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,740
<i>Your children only recall your stutter.</i>

216
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,009
<i>You could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror.</i>

217
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,369
<i>What's that?</i>

218
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,980
<i>What's going on?</i>

219
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:37,819
<i>I'm still there.</i>

220
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,349
<i>If I want it, if only I want it.</i>

221
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:46,029
<i>I must want it,
then I can get myself out of it again.</i>

222
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,960
<i>I let myself go.</i>

223
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,589
<i>I can drag myself out again.</i>

224
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,859
<i>You'd laugh if I couldn't!</i>

225
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,099
<i>Mother was right.</i>

226
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,140
Look, two marks!

227
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,769
No, it's a beer top!

228
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:09,289
Nonsense! Quick, let's pull it up!

229
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,549
Only 10 pfennigs.

230
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,589
<i>You Bet! was great last night.</i>

231
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,029
<i>You Bet! wasn't on last night.</i>

232
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,190
A few days ago, or a month.

233
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:31,299
<i>I'm all alone</i>

234
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,539
<i>just mad on my own</i>

235
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,950
<i>Three at play, that'll be the day</i>

236
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,730
<i>And they lived happily ever after.</i>

237
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,049
Marion, not like that!

238
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,720
With a swing, not with force.

239
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,660
Don't dangle there, fly!

240
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,289
You are an angel!

241
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,460
For heaven's sake!

242
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,579
I can't fly with these things.

243
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,549
Yes, you can.

244
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:43,410
It's easier with wings than without!

245
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,980
Not with these chicken feathers!

246
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,150
What did she say?

247
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,589
Those chicken wings seem to bother her.

248
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,460
Marion, just imagine you're a dove!

249
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,900
And you a bunch of sparrows!

250
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,809
What are you playing at?
Sounds like a firemen's ball!

251
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,470
That's enough!

252
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,680
Concentrate, Marion!

253
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,369
You must admit she works hard
with those chicken feathers!

254
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,089
Make an effort!

255
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,019
Make an effort.

256
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:23,490
Of course I'm making an effort!

257
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,990
What do you think I'm doing?

258
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,289
I'd have fallen on your heads long ago...

259
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,490
if I didn't make an effort.

260
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,500
Just a moment, please.

261
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,970
Hold everything.

262
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,740
We can't pay the rent or the electricity.

263
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,450
We're broke.

264
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,049
Tomorrow we pull out.

265
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,480
Caravans to winter quarters.

266
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,880
The bailiff's been.

267
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,059
This is it for the circus this year.

268
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,990
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,559
<i>That's it.</i>

270
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,990
<i>It's over. Not even a season.</i>

271
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:12,230
<i>Once again, no time to get anywhere.</i>

272
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,329
<i>Tonight is the last night
of my good old number.</i>

273
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,839
<i>And it's a full moon.</i>

274
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,849
<i>And the trapeze artist breaks her neck...</i>

275
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,839
<i>Shut up!</i>

276
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,089
I never imagined it like that...

277
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,819
the farewell to the circus.

278
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,789
The last evening, no one shows up,
you play like fools...

279
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,470
and I fly round the ring like a poor chicken!

280
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,109
And then I'm a waitress again.

281
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,900
<i>Moments like that, moments like now.</i>

282
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,750
<i>My circus dream,
souvenirs for 10 years from now.</i>

283
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:05,660
<i>Time will heal.</i>

284
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,279
<i>What if time was the illness?</i>

285
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,890
<i>As if sometimes
one had to lean over to go on living.</i>

286
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,690
<i>To live, a look is enough.</i>

287
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,269
<i>The circus, I'll miss it.</i>

288
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,109
<i>It's funny, I don't feel a thing.</i>

289
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,299
<i>It's the end, and I feel nothing.</i>

290
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,970
An angel passes by!

291
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,920
Another fallen angel!

292
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,349
<i>All those I've known who remain
and who will remain in my head.</i>

293
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,190
<i>It begins, it always ends...</i>

294
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,990
<i>too good to be true.</i>

295
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,430
<i>At last, outside in the city...</i>

296
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,609
<i>I'll find out who I am, who I've become.</i>

297
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,009
<i>Most of the time, I'm too aware to be sad.</i>

298
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:04,569
<i>I waited an eternity...</i>

299
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,609
<i>to hear a loving word.</i>

300
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,250
<i>Then I went abroad.</i>

301
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,150
<i>Someone who'd say,
"I love you so much today."</i>

302
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>That would be wonderful.</i>

303
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,289
<i>I just lift my head...</i>

304
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,529
<i>and the world appears before my eyes...</i>

305
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,329
<i>and fills my heart.</i>

306
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,940
<i>As a child...</i>

307
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:37,539
<i>I wanted to live on an island.</i>

308
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,750
<i>A woman alone, gloriously alone.</i>

309
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,390
<i>That's it.</i>

310
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,769
<i>Emptied, incompatible.</i>

311
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,329
<i>Fear.</i>

312
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:24,019
<i>The look of a small animal, lost in a wood.</i>

313
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,319
<i>Who are you? I don't know anymore.</i>

314
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,930
<i>Just that I won't be a trapeze artist anymore.</i>

315
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:42,900
<i>Don't cry.</i>

316
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:46,279
<i>That's how it is, shit happens.</i>

317
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,390
<i>It's not always as you'd like.</i>

318
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,720
<i>Emptiness.</i>

319
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,240
<i>Not think anymore.</i>

320
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,750
<i>Just simply be there.</i>

321
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,509
<i>Berlin!</i>

322
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,220
<i>Here I'm a foreigner, yet it's all so familiar.</i>

323
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,589
<i>Anyway I can't get lost,
You always end up at the Wall.</i>

324
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,789
<i>I'll wait for a photo by the photomat...</i>

325
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:11,029
<i>I'll come out with another face.</i>

326
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:14,170
<i>That will be the start of a story.</i>

327
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,700
<i>The faces.</i>

328
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,339
<i>I want to see faces.</i>

329
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,109
<i>Maybe I'll get a job as a waitress.</i>

330
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:39,190
<i>This evening scares me, it's silly.</i>

331
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,059
<i>Anxiety makes me sick.</i>

332
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,900
<i>Only part of me worries,
but the other doesn't believe in it.</i>

333
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,000
<i>How should I live?</i>

334
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,180
<i>Maybe that's not the question.</i>

335
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,140
<i>How should I think?</i>

336
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,490
<i>I know so little.</i>

337
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,119
<i>Maybe because I'm too curious.</i>

338
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,420
<i>I often think so wrongly...</i>

339
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,230
<i>because I think
as if I was talking to someone else.</i>

340
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,900
<i>Inside closed eyes...</i>

341
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,039
<i>close your eyes again.</i>

342
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,509
<i>Then even the stones come alive.</i>

343
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,250
<i>Be close to the colors!</i>

344
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,619
<i>The colors.</i>

345
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,590
<i>Neon lights in the evening sky.</i>

346
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,699
<i>the red and yellow S-Bahn.</i>

347
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,039
<i>Longing.</i>

348
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,809
_

349
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,590
<i>Longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me.</i>

350
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,219
<i>That's what makes me clumsy...</i>

351
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,960
<i>the absence of pleasure.</i>

352
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:06,530
<i>Desire for love.</i>

353
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,820
<i>Desire to love.</i>

354
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,400
<i>You never saw anyone die?</i>

355
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,739
<i>I stink of gasoline.</i>

356
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,269
<i>I saw it all clearly:
the Mercedes, the pool of oil.</i>

357
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,150
<I>Karin, I should have told you.

358
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:29,590
<i>It can't be that simple,
I've still so much to do.</i>

359
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,289
As I came up the mountain,
out of the misty valley into the sun.

360
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,829
The fire on the cattle range...

361
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,760
the potatoes in the ashes...

362
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,769
the boathouse floating in the lake.

363
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,780
The Southern Cross.

364
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,980
The Far East.

365
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,690
The Great North.

366
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,989
The Wild West.

367
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
The Great Bear Lake.

368
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,590
Tristan da Cunha.

369
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,289
The Mississippi Delta.

370
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:15,969
Stromboli.

371
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,110
The old houses of Charlottenburg.

372
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,039
Albert Camus.

373
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,039
The morning light.

374
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,449
The child's eyes.

375
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,750
The swim in the waterfall.

376
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,159
<i>The spots of the first drops of rain.</i>

377
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,590
<i>The sun.</i>

378
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,030
<i>The bread and wine.</i>

379
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,769
<i>Hopping.</i>

380
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,909
<i>Easter.</i>

381
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,849
<i>The veins of leaves.</i>

382
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,380
<i>The blowing grass.</i>

383
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:05,420
<i>The color of stones.</i>

384
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,119
<i>The pebbles on the stream's bed.</i>

385
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,190
<i>The white tablecloth outdoors.</i>

386
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,190
<i>The dream of the house in the house.</i>

387
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,329
<i>The dear one asleep in the next room.</i>

388
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,880
<i>The peaceful Sundays.</i>

389
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,840
<i>The horizon.</i>

390
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,969
<i>The light from the room in the garden.</i>

391
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,340
<i>The night flight.</i>

392
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,219
<i>Riding a bicycle with no hands.</i>

393
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,460
<i>The beautiful stranger.</i>

394
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,460
<i>My father.</i>

395
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,469
<i>My mother.</i>

396
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,000
<i>My wife.</i>

397
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,739
<i>My child.</i>

398
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,690
<i>The world seems to be sinking into dusk...</i>

399
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,230
<i>but I recount, as in the beginning...</i>

400
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:26,460
<i>in my sing-song voice which sustains me...</i>

401
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,599
<i>saved by the tale from present troubles...</i>

402
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,599
<i>and protected for the future.</i>

403
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:52,510
<i>finished with the sweeping
over the centuries...</i>

404
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,590
<i>with the going back and forth,
as in the past.</i>

405
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:59,500
<i>Now I think only day by day.</i>

406
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,300
<i>My heroes are no longer...</i>

407
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,969
<i>The warriors and kings...</i>

408
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,139
<i>but the things of peace...</i>

409
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,750
<i>equal one to the other.</i>

410
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,019
<i>The drying onions being equal...</i>

411
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:20,889
<i>to the tree trunk crossing the marsh.</i>

412
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:26,090
<i>But no one has so far succeeded...</i>

413
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,170
<i>in singing an epic of peace.</i>

414
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,039
<i>What is wrong with peace...</i>

415
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:36,340
<i>that its inspiration doesn't endure...</i>

416
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,570
<i>and that it is almost untellable?</i>

417
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,289
<i>Must I give up now?</i>

418
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,889
<i>If I do give up,
then mankind will lose its storyteller.</i>

419
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,300
<i>And if mankind once loses its storyteller...</i>

420
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,230
<i>then it will lose its childhood.</i>

421
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,429
<i>I cannot find the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

422
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,280
<i>Here?</i>

423
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,650
<i>It cannot be here.</i>

424
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,659
<i>Potsdamer Platz.</i>

425
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:35,489
<i>That's where there was the Cafe Josti.</i>

426
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,130
<i>In the afternoons I went there to chat,
then to drink a coffee...</i>

427
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,869
<i>and to watch the crowd,
having smoked my cigar...</i>

428
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,809
<i>at LÃ¶hse and Wolff, a renowned tobacconist.</i>

429
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,909
<i>Just about here.</i>

430
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,650
<i>This can't be the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

431
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,329
<i>And no one whom you can ask.</i>

432
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,630
<i>It was a lively place.</i>

433
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:17,409
<i>Tramways, horse-drawn omnibuses...</i>

434
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:23,079
<i>and two cars:
mine and that of the chocolate shop.</i>

435
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,440
<i>The Wertheim store was here, too.</i>

436
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,110
<i>And then...</i>

437
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,230
<i>suddenly, the flags appeared.</i>

438
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:39,550
<i>There...</i>

439
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,630
<i>The whole Platz was covered with them.</i>

440
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,599
<i>And the people...</i>

441
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,840
<i>weren't friendly anymore.</i>

442
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,940
<i>And the police wasn't either.</i>

443
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,070
<i>I will not give up...</i>

444
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,710
<i>as long as I have not found
the Potsdamer Platz.</i>

445
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,019
<i>Where are my heroes?
Where are you, my children?</i>

446
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:19,869
<i>Where are my own, the curious ones...</i>

447
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,940
<i>the first, the original ones?</i>

448
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,210
<i>Name me, muse, the immortal singer...</i>

449
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:42,190
<i>who, abandoned by those
who listened to him...</i>

450
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:43,820
<i>lost his voice.</i>

451
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:48,659
<i>He who, from the angel of poetry
that he was, became the poet...</i>

452
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,989
<i>ignored or mocked...</i>

453
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,030
<i>outside on the threshold of no-man's land.</i>

454
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,199
<i>20 marks, 40 marks, 80 marks.</i>

455
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>In a week, I could have 500. Off to the south!</i>

456
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:35,170
<i>What a crazy idea to be here.
Too much traffic.</i>

457
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:39,710
<i>Idiot! Three times he's been this way.</i>

458
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,440
<i>I want to get out of here.</i>

459
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,210
<i>If anyone recognizes me,
I'll be thrown out of high school.</i>

460
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,289
<i>I need Klaus, he'd take care of me.
He'd take good care of me.</i>

461
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,960
<i>He was too good. That's why he's dead.</i>

462
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:07,500
<i>Are there still borders? More than ever.</i>

463
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,349
<i>Each street has its borderline.</i>

464
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:17,550
<i>Between each lot
there's a no-man's land strip...</i>

465
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,110
<i>disguised by a hedge or by a ditch.</i>

466
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:25,429
<i>Whoever dares will fall on booby traps...</i>

467
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,389
<i>or be hit by laser rays.</i>

468
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,030
<i>The trout are really torpedoes.</i>

469
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,440
<i>Every proprietor, or even tenant...</i>

470
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,869
<i>sticks up his nameplate like a coat of arms...</i>

471
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:44,349
<i>and studies the morning paper
as if he were a world leader.</i>

472
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:49,119
<i>The German people have divided into
as many states as there are individuals.</i>

473
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,210
<i>And these small states are mobile.</i>

474
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,250
<i>Each one takes his own with him...</i>

475
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:58,989
<i>and demands a toll
when another wants to enter.</i>

476
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:04,230
<i>A fly caught in amber, or a leather bottle.</i>

477
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,139
<i>So much for the border.</i>

478
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,440
<i>But one can only enter each state
with the password.</i>

479
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:38,969
<i>The present-day German soul
can only be conquered and governed...</i>

480
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:43,170
<i>by he who arrives at each small state
with the password.</i>

481
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,710
<i>Fortunately, no one now has that power.</i>

482
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,699
<i>So everyone migrates...</i>

483
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,610
<i>and raises his own flag all over the world.</i>

484
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,780
<i>Their children already shake their rattles...</i>

485
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,320
<i>and trail their filth around them in circles.</i>

486
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:02,250
-This is the book you were telling me about?
-Yeah.

487
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,489
-So what is it? Hitler had a double?
-Yeah.

488
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,360
-There were two Hitlers?
-Yeah.

489
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,900
-Two Hitlers?
-Not two.

490
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:13,730
-Hitler came from the east point.
-Yes.

491
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:17,429
And he died before he could land
at his home in the Alps.

492
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,139
And Goebbels got an actor to be Hitler?

493
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,840
Yes, because he doesn't want
anybody to know--

494
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,940
Let me ask you something.

495
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:30,280
This story, to me it's not too plausible.

496
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:32,320
Oh, well, I don't know.

497
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:35,550
<i>Monsieur Falk, it will take another hour
before the next set.</i>

498
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,889
Wonderful.

499
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:39,989
So it's more realistic than the film
we're making.

500
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,730
Let me explain to you.
People like detective stories.

501
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:47,000
They use any excuse
to make a detective story.

502
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:48,699
-You understand?
-Yeah.

503
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,510
It's dopey, I grant you.
But this is dopey, too.

504
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,480
Erika, come on, honey,
give me a break, please.

505
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,739
Okay, see you later.

506
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,750
I'm sorry. Hey, please, I want to talk to you.
Come here, sweetheart.

507
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,690
We have enough pictures.

508
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,519
So please, no more pictures, all right?

509
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,250
Oh, Helen, I'm looking for you.

510
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:13,380
I can't wear this fucking hat.

511
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,000
This is an excellent hat. It looks great.

512
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,590
-You put it on.
-Believe me.

513
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,429
You wear it.

514
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,800
Come on, we have other hats over here
you can find.

515
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,170
Yes, sir.

516
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:32,039
-All right. Just hold this. Very good.
-Thank you.

517
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,170
Now we've got some hats!

518
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,750
All right, now we're gonna get a hat
that fits the face.

519
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,659
A hat that fits the face.

520
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:49,659
-And we go over here and put.... Oh, Jesus!
-What kind of hat do you want?

521
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:51,059
How about this one?

522
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:54,099
I wanna look like a German.
I wanna look anonymous.

523
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:58,369
And I wanna look melt-into-the-crowd.

524
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,300
Not when you look like Humphrey Bogart.
Here, try that one.

525
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,210
All right. What about.... Oh, Jesus Christ!

526
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,849
-This one?
-All right.

527
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:13,510
-This here's for the opera.
-No, you look like a Jewish rabbi.

528
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,760
-Try that one.
-All right.

529
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,619
-This here, I'm 42nd Street.
-Here we go, there.

530
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:20,860
He's a bookmaker.

531
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,699
You know, a bookmaker?

532
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,869
What the hell is this here?

533
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,559
Come on, for Christ's sake,
get me a good hat, will you?

534
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,300
I'm in disguise, you see? I really
don't want to call attention to myself.

535
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,840
How about this one?

536
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,280
You know, it's ridiculous, these hats.

537
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:45,179
It doesn't go with the coat.
They're all gangsters' hats.

538
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:48,230
There, that's not a gangster hat.

539
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:51,219
This, I'm getting married.

540
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:56,659
-This is for a horse show in London.
-Try that one.

541
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,030
That one's good.

542
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,800
-That looks good.
-Maybe.

543
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,500
-I think that's it.
-Could be.

544
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,300
-Yeah.
-Possible.

545
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,250
Great. You look like
somebody's grandfather.

546
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:22,690
Charlie Chan.

547
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:26,320
"Number one son, not too clever."

548
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,159
Okay, look...

549
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,159
-it ain't great...
-It's super.

550
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,829
...but it'll be wonderful.

551
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,570
And you've been wonderful.

552
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,639
Olivier, that coat looks terrible.

553
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:47,909
<i>Colombo had no hat,
That was a hell of a costume.</i>

554
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,579
<i>Well, it was your own coat.</i>

555
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:53,989
<i>Hey, Peter, where's your raincoat?
Been cleaned and burned.</i>

556
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,550
<i>What is it? What is it, Peter?</i>

557
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,559
<i>Why does your mind stray?</i>

558
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,760
<i>Think I'll have
filet of sole meuniÃ¨re tonight.</i>

559
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:08,460
<i>Do Germans make meuniÃ¨re?</i>

560
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:12,059
<i>Maybe pasta, tomato sauce, and basil.</i>

561
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,469
<i>Do Germans make pasta?</i>

562
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,599
<i>It will never change.</i>

563
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,719
<i>They were elegant, those guys.</i>

564
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,579
<i>They had style.</i>

565
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:35,489
<i>The one thing I shall miss...</i>

566
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,800
<i>from the outside, from the realm of light...</i>

567
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:41,429
<i>will be the sparrows.</i>

568
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:44,059
<i>Money makes for happiness. How to live?</i>

569
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,210
<i>The "Man in the Golden Helmet"
is a swindle.</i>

570
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,610
<i>You're not natives. You're all refugees.</i>

571
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,650
<i>I've been sitting here since this morning.</i>

572
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,320
<i>I'm cold and I'm bored.</i>

573
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,389
<i>Wind in the face, the first snow in the air.</i>

574
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,099
<i>Water in the gutter...</i>

575
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,460
<i>the balcony with the beautiful foreigner.</i>

576
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,570
<i>They could be real ones. They look like it.</i>

577
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,199
<i>Some stole food
from the dogs in the camps.</i>

578
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,570
<i>That would take the grin off your face.</i>

579
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,699
<i>Don't be too sure.</i>

580
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,449
<i>The Frenchman: I met him in the street.</i>

581
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:32,579
<i>"Berlin won't be there anymore," he said.</i>

582
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,449
<i>Constant.</i>

583
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,320
<i>The house had half gone.</i>

584
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:40,590
<i>Some of it still stood, for how long?</i>

585
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,699
<i>Yes, I can still see this woman
who was standing in the ruins...</i>

586
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,539
<i>and who was shaking the duvet.</i>

587
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,300
<i>When was that? In May, June '45.</i>

588
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:59,809
Excuse me, may I draw you?

589
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,119
Sketch you? It's all right?

590
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,560
Yes, please.

591
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,889
Two minutes, very fast. Don't move.

592
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,090
<i>I wonder if she's Jewish.</i>

593
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,760
<i>What a dear face!</i>

594
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,099
<i>Is it well done, what he's drawing?</i>

595
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,639
<i>Interesting.</i>

596
00:53:27,949 --> 00:53:29,710
<i>What a nostril!</i>

597
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,739
<i>A dramatic nostril!</i>

598
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,110
<i>These people are extras.</i>

599
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,520
<i>Extra people.</i>

600
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,190
<i>Extras are so patient.</i>

601
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,150
<i>They just sit.</i>

602
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,849
<i>I'd like to see it.</i>

603
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,380
<i>Perhaps he'll give it to me.</i>

604
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,230
<i>Extras.</i>

605
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,489
<i>These humans are extras.</i>

606
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,599
<i>Extra humans.</i>

607
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,540
Oh, very good.

608
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:01,869
Very nice picture.

609
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,679
<i>Yellow star means death.</i>

610
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,480
<i>Why did they pick yellow?</i>

611
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,510
<i>Sunflowers.</i>

612
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,150
<i>Van Gogh killed himself.</i>

613
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:17,190
<i>This drawing stinks.</i>

614
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:21,059
<i>So what? No one sees it.</i>

615
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:24,369
<i>Someday you'll make a good drawing.</i>

616
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,559
<i>I hope, I hope, I hope.</i>

617
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,970
Start the action for the stuntmen.

618
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,449
Come on, boys, I want to see action now!

619
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,610
Stop, cut!

620
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:51,349
They're not fighting.
It looks like it was choreographed.

621
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,500
I told you to hang that flag higher.
Get moving!

622
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,960
Make sure it hangs straight.

623
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:00,030
-Jerry?
-Yes, Peter?

624
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,130
Another interview. Berlin television.

625
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:04,730
You have some time, Peter.

626
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:08,610
I need you for a close-up afterwards,
for after the point-of-view shot.

627
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,980
All right, I'm coming fellas. We'll do it now.

628
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,239
Yeah, now is good.

629
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,190
<i>What is it? What is it, Peter?</i>

630
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:28,659
<i>"Why, if I didn't have it, I'd miss it"...</i>

631
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,699
<i>said the general to the whore.</i>

632
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,449
Come, I'll show you something else.

633
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,010
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

634
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,820
<i>it choked on spinach, peas, rice pudding...</i>

635
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,949
<i>and steamed cauliflower...</i>

636
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,059
<i>and now eats all of that,
and not just because it has to.</i>

637
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,300
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

638
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,030
<i>it woke up once in a strange bed...</i>

639
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,730
<i>and now time and time again.</i>

640
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:52,559
<i>Many people seemed beautiful then...</i>

641
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,440
<i>but not so many anymore, only if it's lucky.</i>

642
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,039
<i>It had a precise picture of Paradise...</i>

643
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:02,150
<i>and now can only guess at it.</i>

644
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:05,250
<i>It couldn't imagine nothingness...</i>

645
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,079
<i>and today shudders at the idea.</i>

646
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,130
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

647
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:13,389
<i>it played with enthusiasm...</i>

648
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,530
<i>and now with such involvement...</i>

649
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:19,760
<i>only when it concerns its work.</i>

650
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:22,110
<i>Do you recall our first visit here?</i>

651
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:24,840
<i>History had not yet begun.</i>

652
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:29,960
<i>We let both mornings and evenings go by,
and we waited.</i>

653
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:33,679
<i>It was a long time
before the river found its bed...</i>

654
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:36,670
<i>and the stagnant water began to flow.</i>

655
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,429
<i>Valley of the primeval river.</i>

656
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:42,460
<i>One day, I still remember...</i>

657
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:47,489
<i>the glacier melted,
and the icebergs drifted to the north.</i>

658
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:52,579
<i>A tree passed by, still green,
with an empty bird's nest.</i>

659
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,380
Over myriad years, only the fish had leapt.

660
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:01,579
Then came the moment
when the swarm of bees drowned.

661
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:06,010
Some time later,
the two stags fought on this bank.

662
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:08,989
Then the cloud of flies...

663
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,830
and the antlers, like branches,
flowing down the river.

664
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,769
All that ever grew again was the grass...

665
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,239
growing over the bodies of wild cats,
of wild boar, and buffalos.

666
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:22,639
Do you remember, one morning...

667
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,579
how, out of the savanna,
its forehead smeared with grass...

668
01:02:26,649 --> 01:02:30,709
appeared the biped, our image,
so long awaited.

669
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,388
And its first word was a shout.

670
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,388
Was it "ah" or "oh"...

671
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,360
or was it merely a groan?

672
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:44,928
We were at last able to laugh
for the first time...

673
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:49,768
and through this man's shout
and the call of his followers...

674
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,710
-we learned to speak.
-A long story.

675
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,900
The sun, the lightning,
the thunder above in the sky...

676
01:02:56,979 --> 01:02:59,880
and below, on earth,
the firesides, the leaps...

677
01:03:00,189 --> 01:03:02,980
the round dances, the signs, the writing.

678
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:10,018
Then one of them broke through the circle
and ran straight ahead.

679
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,828
As long as he ran straight ahead...

680
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,070
swerving perhaps from joy...

681
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,400
he seemed free,
and we could laugh with him.

682
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:23,408
But then, suddenly...

683
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:27,038
he ran in a zigzag and stones flew.

684
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:34,249
With his flight began another story:
the story of wars.

685
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:36,170
It is still going on.

686
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:39,848
But the first story, too,
that of the grass, the sun...

687
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:43,190
of the leaps, and the shouts,
that still goes on.

688
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,929
Do you remember how one day
the highway was built...

689
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,229
which the next day
saw the Napoleonic retreat...

690
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:03,268
and was then paved?

691
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,440
Today it is covered with grass
and sunk like a Roman way,

692
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,281
its tank tracks, too.

693
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:18,289
But we weren't even spectators.
We've always been too few.

694
01:04:25,038 --> 01:04:26,369
You really want--

695
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:30,439
To conquer a history for myself.

696
01:04:31,709 --> 01:04:35,730
What my timeless downward look
has taught me, I want to transmute...

697
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,179
to sustain a glance...

698
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:42,709
a short shout, a sour smell.

699
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,019
<i>I've been on the outside long enough.</i>

700
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,388
<i>Absent long enough.</i>

701
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,750
<i>Long enough out of the world.</i>

702
01:04:51,828 --> 01:04:54,058
<i>Let me enter the history of the world.</i>

703
01:04:54,129 --> 01:04:56,789
<i>If only to hold an apple in my hand.</i>

704
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:59,190
<i>Look, those feathers.</i>

705
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:01,829
<i>Look, there on the water, already vanished.</i>

706
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,340
<i>Look, the tire marks on the asphalt...</i>

707
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,638
<i>and the cigarette butt rolling.</i>

708
01:05:10,178 --> 01:05:12,800
<i>The primeval river has dried up...</i>

709
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,809
<i>and only today's puddles still quiver.</i>

710
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,879
<i>Do away with the world behind the world!</i>

711
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,940
Hey, Jerry!

712
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:50,480
<i>Interesting drawing problem.</i>

713
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:54,050
<i>This man has eyes like a raccoon...</i>

714
01:05:55,629 --> 01:05:57,788
<i>but he has a good hat.</i>

715
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:03,189
<i>What dark rings under his eyes!</i>

716
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,130
<i>Always worried.</i>

717
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:12,369
<i>I wonder if the director likes my work.</i>

718
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,300
<i>They always say "Wonderful!"...</i>

719
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:17,908
<i>no matter what you do.</i>

720
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:26,019
<i>Have to buy gifts for my children.</i>

721
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:28,348
<i>Maybe picture frames.</i>

722
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,359
<i>Am I a better actor now than I used to be?</i>

723
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,269
<i>Only the Roman roads still lead somewhere.</i>

724
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:50,840
<i>Only the most ancient traces lead anywhere.</i>

725
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:53,739
<i>Where is the top of the pass here?</i>

726
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,409
<i>Even the plains...</i>

727
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:59,619
<i>even Berlin has its hidden passes...</i>

728
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,149
<i>and it's only there that begins my country...</i>

729
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,849
<i>the country of the tale.</i>

730
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,260
<i>Why doesn't everyone see from childhood...</i>

731
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:15,389
<i>the passes, doors and crevices...</i>

732
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:19,071
<i>on the ground, and above in the sky?</i>

733
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,340
<i>If everyone saw them...</i>

734
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:27,308
<i>there would be a history
without murder or war.</i>

735
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:32,349
<i>Ten thousand times I thought about it,
but this time I'm doing it.</i>

736
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:37,089
<i>Funny I'm so calm.
Why red socks with black shoes?</i>

737
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:38,659
<i>Foggy, cold.</i>

738
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,250
<i>I put on a pullover, afraid to be cold.</i>

739
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,199
<i>Very good jacket. Was a bargain.</i>

740
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,559
<i>Pocket is un-sewn. She gave it to me.</i>

741
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:52,198
<i>Pebbles on the roof, I wonder why?
So it doesn't fly away or what?</i>

742
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:55,909
<i>I'd love to fly one day.</i>

743
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:00,439
<i>The plane circles over Berlin,
one day it'll crash.</i>

744
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:03,718
<i>It's really cold. My hands were always warm.</i>

745
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,018
<i>Really a good sign. It crackles underfoot.</i>

746
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:09,750
<i>How late is it? The sun's setting.</i>

747
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:13,729
<i>Logical, it's the West.
At least now I know where the West is.</i>

748
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:17,429
<i>I always took the U-Bahn to the East...</i>

749
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,989
<i>then bought 10 tickets, saved a mark.</i>

750
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:23,300
<i>The sun in my back, on the left, the star.</i>

751
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,930
<i>That's really good. Sun and a star.
Her little feet!</i>

752
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:31,239
<i>She hopped from one foot to the other.
She danced so sweetly.</i>

753
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:34,510
<i>We were all alone.
Has she already got my letter?</i>

754
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:38,449
<i>I don't want her to have read it.
Berlin means nothing to me.</i>

755
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,489
<i>Havel, is it a river or a lake?</i>

756
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,550
<i>The East? It's really everywhere.</i>

757
01:08:46,629 --> 01:08:49,529
<i>Strange people, they're shouting.</i>

758
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,889
<i>I really don't care.</i>

759
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:54,329
<i>All these thoughts.</i>

760
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,770
<i>I'd really rather not think anymore.</i>

761
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,858
<i>I'm going, but why?</i>

762
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,479
<i>Story? Want to hear the story?</i>

763
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,489
<i>Story of '45, Berlin, war.</i>

764
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,520
<i>I'm an American detective.</i>

765
01:09:18,099 --> 01:09:21,529
<i>German-American guy hires me.</i>

766
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:24,288
<i>His brother's son is in Germany.</i>

767
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,659
<i>Go to Germany, find him.</i>

768
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:30,069
<i>Brother's dead. The family is lost.
Find the kid.</i>

769
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,930
<i>In '45?</i>

770
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:10,569
<i>I'll never make it tonight.</i>

771
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,759
<i>No trapeze on full moon nights.</i>

772
01:11:14,381 --> 01:11:17,829
<i>Not the last time. The very last time.</i>

773
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,118
<i>I think I should stop this dream.</i>

774
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,789
<i>The end of the circus!</i>

775
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:25,448
<i>The end.</i>

776
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:30,850
<i>Once again, night falls in my head.</i>

777
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:33,090
<i>Fear.</i>

778
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,420
<i>Fear of death.</i>

779
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,220
<i>Why not death?</i>

780
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,539
<i>The only important thing sometimes...</i>

781
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:44,880
<i>is just being beautiful...</i>

782
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:48,710
<i>or else absolutely nothing.</i>

783
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:54,108
<i>To look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think.</i>

784
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:56,579
<i>So what do you think?</i>

785
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:00,989
<i>I think I've still the right to be afraid...</i>

786
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,079
<i>but not to talk about it.</i>

787
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:05,789
<i>You're not yet blind...</i>

788
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,170
<i>the heart still beats.</i>

789
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,270
<i>And now you're crying.</i>

790
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:16,670
<i>You'd like to cry like a very sad little girl.</i>

791
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:19,159
<i>Do you know why you're crying?</i>

792
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,600
<i>For whom?</i>

793
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,739
<i>Not for me. I don't know for whom.</i>

794
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:26,778
<i>I'd like to know.</i>

795
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,170
<i>I know nothing.</i>

796
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:32,220
<i>I'm a little bit afraid.</i>

797
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:34,380
<i>It's gone.</i>

798
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,818
<i>It's gone away.</i>

799
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,329
<i>It'll come back.</i>

800
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,789
It doesn't matter.

801
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,550
<i>Just to be able to say...</i>

802
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,019
<i>like now:</i>

803
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,960
<i>"I'm happy."</i>

804
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:23,659
<i>I've a story...</i>

805
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:27,001
<I>and I'll go on having one.

806
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:31,368
<i>There it is again, my feeling of well-being...</i>

807
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:36,199
<i>as if inside my body,
a hand was softly tightening.</i>

808
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,930
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

809
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:32,060
<i>it was the time of these questions:</i>

810
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:37,739
<i>Why am I me and why not you?</i>

811
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:42,629
<i>Why am I here and why not there?</i>

812
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:47,439
<i>When did time begin,
and where does space end?</i>

813
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:52,279
<i>Isn't life under the sun just a dream?</i>

814
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,050
<i>Walking.</i>

815
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,210
<i>Looking and seeing.</i>

816
01:26:54,689 --> 01:26:56,949
<i>I wish you were here, Grandma.</i>

817
01:26:57,461 --> 01:27:00,649
<i>This must be the station
they told me about...</i>

818
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:02,720
<i>with the funny name.</i>

819
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,630
<i>Not the station where the train stopped.</i>

820
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,690
<i>But the station...</i>

821
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,090
<i>where the station stopped.</i>

822
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:13,029
Isn't that Colombo?

823
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:15,039
No, don't think so.

824
01:27:15,209 --> 01:27:17,139
Not with that moth-eaten coat.

825
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:20,259
Why should he be walking
through this mud!

826
01:27:39,569 --> 01:27:43,059
SNACK BAR

827
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:54,699
I can't see you, but I know you're here.

828
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,380
I feel it.

829
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:03,420
You've been hanging around
since I got here.

830
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,339
I wish I could see your face.

831
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:11,359
Just look into your eyes,
and tell you how good it is to be here.

832
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,619
Just to touch something.

833
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:15,029
See, that's cold.

834
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,689
That feels good.

835
01:28:18,069 --> 01:28:19,189
Here.

836
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:21,029
To smoke...

837
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:23,159
to have coffee.

838
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,099
And if you do it together, it's fantastic.

839
01:28:26,949 --> 01:28:28,069
Or...

840
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:30,069
to draw.

841
01:28:30,549 --> 01:28:34,000
You know, you take a pencil,
and you make a dark line...

842
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,909
then you make a light line.

843
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:40,350
And together, it's a good line.

844
01:28:41,259 --> 01:28:43,590
But when your hands are cold...

845
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:46,329
you rub them together.

846
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,900
You see, that's good. That feels good.

847
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:54,559
There's so many good things.

848
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,801
But you're not here. I'm here.

849
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:03,238
I wish you were here.

850
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,479
I wish you could talk to me...

851
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,719
because I'm a friend.

852
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:02,828
Well?

853
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:05,069
I'm going to enter the river.

854
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:09,300
Old human expression, often heard,
that I just understood today.

855
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:11,909
Now or never, moment of the ford.

856
01:30:11,979 --> 01:30:15,970
But there is no other bank,
there is only the river.

857
01:30:16,489 --> 01:30:19,679
Forward in the ford of time,
in the ford of death.

858
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:22,409
We are not yet born, so let's descend.

859
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:26,489
To look is not to look from on high,
but at eye level.

860
01:30:26,599 --> 01:30:28,459
First, I'll have a bath.

861
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,199
Then I'll be shaved...

862
01:30:32,438 --> 01:30:34,300
by a Turkish barber...

863
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,199
who will massage me
down to the fingertips.

864
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:40,029
Then I'll buy a newspaper...

865
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:42,869
and read it from headlines to horoscope.

866
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,300
On the first day, I'll be waited upon.

867
01:30:48,389 --> 01:30:50,819
For requests, ask the neighbor.

868
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:54,880
If someone stumbles over my legs,
he'll have to apologize.

869
01:30:54,959 --> 01:30:57,390
I'll be pushed around, and I'll push back.

870
01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:00,688
In the crowded bar,
the bartender will find me a table.

871
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:05,129
A service car will stop,
and the mayor will take me aboard.

872
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:07,970
I'll be known to everyone,
and suspect to no one.

873
01:31:08,038 --> 01:31:11,270
I won't say a word,
and will understand every language.

874
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,028
This will be my first day.

875
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:16,710
None of it will come true.

876
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:50,000
I'll take her in my arms.

877
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,511
And she'll take me in her arms.

878
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:41,158
I think he's drunk.

879
01:33:06,729 --> 01:33:07,850
Let's go!

880
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,680
It's got a taste!

881
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:45,820
Now I begin to understand!

882
01:33:53,538 --> 01:33:55,229
-Is that red?
-Yes.

883
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,170
Have you hurt yourself?

884
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:00,499
Is today a good day?

885
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,110
The pipes?

886
01:34:04,649 --> 01:34:06,550
They're yellow.

887
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:09,079
-What about him?
-He's gray-blue.

888
01:34:11,989 --> 01:34:14,250
He's orange. Ochre.

889
01:34:14,328 --> 01:34:16,158
Ochre or orange?

890
01:34:17,328 --> 01:34:19,119
Yellow, red.

891
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:21,400
-And him?
-He's green.

892
01:34:22,028 --> 01:34:25,050
-And what's that, over the eyes?
-That's blue.

893
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:31,189
-Is it very cold today?
-Oh, it'll soon be over.

894
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,330
I'd like to have a coffee.

895
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:36,439
You have no money?

896
01:34:42,189 --> 01:34:45,350
I'm glad that today everything's fine.

897
01:34:55,698 --> 01:34:57,029
Beautiful!

898
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:26,320
Milk and sugar?

899
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,850
Black.

900
01:36:10,909 --> 01:36:13,769
<i>When the child was a child.</i>

901
01:36:14,849 --> 01:36:17,810
<i>it lived on apples and bread,
that was enough.</i>

902
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,270
<i>And it is still that way.</i>

903
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,189
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

904
01:36:27,431 --> 01:36:30,760
<i>berries fell only like berries into its hand...</i>

905
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,829
<i>and they still do now.</i>

906
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:39,659
<i>Fresh walnuts made its tongue raw...</i>

907
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:42,608
<i>and they still do now.</i>

908
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:46,329
<i>Atop each mountain, it was longing...</i>

909
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:48,310
<i>for a higher mountain.</i>

910
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:52,939
<i>And in each city, it was longing...</i>

911
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:54,910
<i>for a bigger city...</i>

912
01:36:56,618 --> 01:36:58,640
<i>and it still does.</i>

913
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:06,189
<i>Reached in the treetop for the cherries...</i>

914
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:08,630
<i>as elated...</i>

915
01:37:09,499 --> 01:37:11,050
<i>as it still is.</i>

916
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,500
<i>Was shy...</i>

917
01:37:15,568 --> 01:37:17,470
<i>in front of strangers.</i>

918
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,470
<i>And it still is.</i>

919
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:24,568
<i>Waited for the first snow...</i>

920
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:28,439
<i>and still waits that way.</i>

921
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,649
<i>When the child was a child...</i>

922
01:37:40,171 --> 01:37:43,100
<i>it threw a stick, like a lance, into a tree.</i>

923
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,420
<i>And it's still quivering there today.</i>

924
01:37:58,818 --> 01:38:01,049
ANTIQUES

925
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:31,970
How do I get to Akazienstrasse?

926
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:34,809
Go up Potsdamer to Kleistpark.

927
01:38:34,889 --> 01:38:37,479
Then right at Grunewald,
past Elssholz and Gleditsch.

928
01:38:37,561 --> 01:38:40,351
No right turn at Goltzstrasse,
it goes to Winterfeldplatz.

929
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,920
Turn left, and there you are.

930
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,929
Entrance reserved for the crew.

931
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,858
Extras, the other way.

932
01:39:20,069 --> 01:39:21,328
Oh, yes!

933
01:39:31,009 --> 01:39:31,989
Extra.

934
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,769
You look like one!
They all want autographs!

935
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:37,639
Idiot cop!

936
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,029
I'm so happy to see you.

937
01:40:05,779 --> 01:40:07,639
-How's it going?
-Fine.

938
01:40:08,049 --> 01:40:11,609
You see, I expected a much taller man.
I don't know why.

939
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,540
-Even taller?
-Even taller.

940
01:40:16,119 --> 01:40:17,409
How long?

941
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,751
Minutes...

942
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:22,648
hours...

943
01:40:22,728 --> 01:40:25,130
days, weeks, months.

944
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,220
Time!

945
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:31,489
Let me give you a few dollars,
just to tide you over.

946
01:40:31,839 --> 01:40:33,329
I have money.

947
01:40:33,739 --> 01:40:35,399
I sold something.

948
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:38,069
The armor?

949
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,399
Right? What did you get for it?

950
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:44,910
Two hundred marks.

951
01:40:44,978 --> 01:40:47,409
You got robbed. But that happens.

952
01:40:47,921 --> 01:40:51,649
I got to tell you something.
I'm going back now 30 years.

953
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,239
New York City.

954
01:40:53,329 --> 01:40:55,449
Pawn shop, 23rd and Lex.

955
01:40:55,529 --> 01:40:57,359
The guy gave me $500.

956
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:04,299
You were....

957
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:06,390
Yeah.

958
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:10,799
You are....

959
01:41:14,579 --> 01:41:16,670
-You, too?
-Oh, yeah.

960
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:19,510
There's lots of us.

961
01:41:20,489 --> 01:41:24,220
Mr. Falk, I've been looking for you all over.
We're ready for you now.

962
01:41:24,289 --> 01:41:26,479
Okay, David, I'll be right with you.

963
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,550
You're not the only one.

964
01:41:38,539 --> 01:41:40,829
So what're you going to do now?

965
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:42,828
There is a girl.

966
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,501
A girl! Good!

967
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,340
Hey, wait! You wanted to tell me more!

968
01:41:53,319 --> 01:41:54,979
I want to know...

969
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,938
everything!

970
01:41:57,390 --> 01:42:00,909
That you have to find out yourself.
That's the fun of it.

971
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:22,430
Come on, Marion, don't worry.

972
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:24,229
It'll be all right.

973
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:27,270
I'll send you postcards of the Eiffel Tower.

974
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:30,000
See you next season!

975
01:42:30,778 --> 01:42:33,109
Don't forget the Circus Alekan!

976
01:42:33,318 --> 01:42:36,108
Bye, Archie, see you next year!

977
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,609
A thousand kisses!

978
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:43,480
I'll send a little parcel. What do you want?

979
01:42:43,559 --> 01:42:45,460
Some Camembert cheese?

980
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:50,019
<i>I couldn't say who I am,
I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

981
01:43:51,159 --> 01:43:53,319
<i>I'm someone with no roots...</i>

982
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:56,449
<i>no story, no country.</i>

983
01:43:57,329 --> 01:43:59,260
<i>And I like it that way.</i>

984
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,289
<i>I'm here, I'm free.</i>

985
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,000
<i>I can imagine anything.</i>

986
01:44:05,069 --> 01:44:06,829
<i>It's all possible.</i>

987
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:09,301
<i>I only have to raise my eyes...</i>

988
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,069
<i>and once again, I become the world.</i>

989
01:44:13,149 --> 01:44:14,310
<i>Now...</i>

990
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:16,380
<i>in this very place...</i>

991
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,880
<i>a feeling of happiness...</i>

992
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:21,448
<i>that I could always have.</i>

993
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:26,640
-What are you doing there?
-I'm sitting here.

994
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:28,839
Are you sad?

995
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,680
-Are you sick?
-Yes.

996
01:46:33,319 --> 01:46:35,439
-What's the matter?
-A need.

997
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,319
Is that so?

998
01:46:39,029 --> 01:46:41,989
A double-knot is the only way
to make it hold.

999
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:51,000
A need of food perhaps, or need of drink.

1000
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,069
<i>She has not gone, Cassiel, I know that.</i>

1001
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,301
<i>I'll find her.</i>

1002
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,600
<i>Something will happen,
something important, tonight.</i>

1003
01:47:12,529 --> 01:47:16,429
<i>There are other suns
than the one up in the sky, Cassiel!</i>

1004
01:47:17,398 --> 01:47:20,630
<i>In deepest night, spring will begin today.</i>

1005
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:25,399
<i>Other wings will grow
in place of the old ones.</i>

1006
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:29,100
<i>Wings that will, at last, astound me.</i>

1007
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,761
Can I have a coffee please?

1008
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:47,080
Lieutenant...

1009
01:48:47,619 --> 01:48:50,880
I bet you must know how to find people.

1010
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:54,559
Well, I know how to look for them.
I don't always find them.

1011
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:56,789
You're looking for somebody?

1012
01:48:57,399 --> 01:49:00,850
-I don't know. I just want to find someone.
-Yeah, who?

1013
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:04,319
Boy, girl, man, woman?

1014
01:49:05,841 --> 01:49:06,890
Man.

1015
01:49:08,949 --> 01:49:11,070
Well, do you know his name?

1016
01:49:11,209 --> 01:49:12,260
No?

1017
01:49:12,478 --> 01:49:14,569
Do you know where he lives?

1018
01:49:16,989 --> 01:49:18,978
-I know nothing.
-Nothing?

1019
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,039
Well, this is a tough case.

1020
01:49:23,729 --> 01:49:25,819
I got to go. Good night.

1021
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:29,228
-Good luck.
-Lieutenant.

1022
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:39,769
I can't see you, but I know you're here.

1023
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:42,369
I feel it.

1024
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:48,880
I wish I could see your face, because
there are so many things I want to tell you.

1025
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,840
I'm your friend.

1026
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:36,340
<i>One more song, and it's over.</i>

1027
01:52:36,449 --> 01:52:39,568
<i>But I'm not going to tell you about a girl.</i>

1028
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:43,050
<i>I want to tell you about a girl.</i>

1029
01:56:39,399 --> 01:56:41,689
It must finally become serious.

1030
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,789
I've often been alone...

1031
01:56:49,069 --> 01:56:51,189
but I've never lived alone.

1032
01:56:55,978 --> 01:56:58,970
When I was with someone,
I was often happy.

1033
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:03,109
But at the same time,
it all seemed a coincidence.

1034
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,649
These people were my parents.

1035
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:08,050
But it could have been others.

1036
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:12,460
Why was this brown-eyed boy my brother...

1037
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:16,589
and not the green-eyed boy
on the opposite platform?

1038
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:22,169
The taxi driver's daughter was my friend.

1039
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:28,000
But I might as well have
put my arm round a horse's neck.

1040
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:32,369
I was with a man...

1041
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,039
in love...

1042
01:57:35,618 --> 01:57:38,380
and I might as well have left him there...

1043
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:43,778
and gone off with the stranger
I met in the street.

1044
01:57:48,698 --> 01:57:50,600
Look at me or don't.

1045
01:57:51,869 --> 01:57:54,028
Give me your hand or don't.

1046
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:57,619
No.

1047
01:57:58,439 --> 01:58:01,101
Don't give me the hand, and look away.

1048
01:58:07,648 --> 01:58:10,010
I think tonight is the new moon.

1049
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:14,049
No night more peaceful.

1050
01:58:17,829 --> 01:58:20,390
No bloodshed in all the city.

1051
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,729
I've never played with anyone...

1052
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,859
and yet I've never opened my eyes
and thought:

1053
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:29,130
Now it's serious.

1054
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:35,440
At last it's becoming serious.

1055
01:58:39,449 --> 01:58:41,238
So I've grown older.

1056
01:58:44,949 --> 01:58:47,609
Was I the only one who wasn't serious?

1057
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,310
Is it our times that are not serious?

1058
01:58:54,329 --> 01:58:56,159
I was never lonely...

1059
01:58:56,599 --> 01:58:59,460
neither when I was alone, nor with others.

1060
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:03,090
But I would have liked to be alone at last.

1061
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:06,728
Loneliness means I'm finally whole.

1062
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,339
Now I can say it...

1063
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:12,769
as tonight, I'm at last alone.

1064
01:59:14,619 --> 01:59:17,019
I must put an end to coincidence.

1065
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:25,010
The new moon of decision.

1066
01:59:26,529 --> 01:59:28,930
I don't know if there's destiny...

1067
01:59:28,999 --> 01:59:30,930
but there's a decision.

1068
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:32,720
Decide!

1069
01:59:34,569 --> 01:59:36,591
We are now the times.

1070
01:59:38,641 --> 01:59:40,398
Not only the whole town...

1071
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:43,840
the whole world is taking part
in our decision.

1072
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:48,109
We two are now more than us two.

1073
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,779
We incarnate something.

1074
01:59:51,349 --> 01:59:54,210
We're representing the people now...

1075
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:57,649
And the whole place is full of those...

1076
01:59:57,729 --> 02:00:00,091
who are dreaming the same dream.

1077
02:00:00,829 --> 02:00:03,189
We are deciding everyone's game.

1078
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:06,659
I am ready.

1079
02:00:08,368 --> 02:00:09,529
Now...

1080
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:11,619
it's your turn.

1081
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,370
You hold the game in your hand.

1082
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,329
Now...

1083
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:19,739
or never.

1084
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,879
You need me.

1085
02:00:27,819 --> 02:00:29,439
You will need me.

1086
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:35,280
There's no greater story than ours...

1087
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:38,170
that of man and woman.

1088
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,528
It will be a story of giants...

1089
02:00:43,409 --> 02:00:44,800
invisible...

1090
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,559
transposable...

1091
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,840
a story of new ancestors.

1092
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:56,069
Look.

1093
02:00:56,618 --> 02:00:57,979
My eyes...

1094
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:02,648
they are the picture of necessity...

1095
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:07,189
of the future of everyone in the place.

1096
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:13,591
Last night...

1097
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:16,759
I dreamt of a stranger...

1098
02:01:20,641 --> 02:01:22,000
of my man.

1099
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:25,510
Only with him could I be alone...

1100
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,340
open up to him...

1101
02:01:29,079 --> 02:01:31,810
wholly open, wholly for him.

1102
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,460
Welcome him wholly into me...

1103
02:01:38,228 --> 02:01:40,659
surround him with the labyrinth...

1104
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:43,920
of shared happiness.

1105
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:47,489
I know...

1106
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,960
it's you.

1107
02:02:19,529 --> 02:02:21,249
<i>Something happened.</i>

1108
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:25,140
<i>It is still going on.</i>

1109
02:02:26,739 --> 02:02:28,229
<i>It binds me.</i>

1110
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:33,779
<i>It was true at night, and it's true in the day.</i>

1111
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:36,039
<i>Even more so now.</i>

1112
02:02:37,449 --> 02:02:38,879
<i>Who was who?</i>

1113
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:43,108
<i>I was in her, and she was around me.</i>

1114
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:50,330
<i>Who in the world can claim that he was
ever together with another being?</i>

1115
02:02:51,269 --> 02:02:52,788
<i>I am together.</i>

1116
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:57,229
<i>No mortal child was begot...</i>

1117
02:02:57,310 --> 02:03:00,170
<I>but an immortal, common image.

1118
02:03:01,739 --> 02:03:04,670
<I>I learned astonishment that night.

1119
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:08,100
<I>She came to take me home...

1120
02:03:08,449 --> 02:03:10,500
<i>and I found home.</i>

1121
02:03:15,059 --> 02:03:16,720
<i>It happened once.</i>

1122
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,689
<I>Only once, and therefore forever.

1123
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:30,760
<I>The picture that we have created
will be with me when I die.

1124
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:35,630
<i>I will have lived within it.</i>

1125
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:40,939
<i>First the amazement about the two of us.</i>

1126
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:44,780
<i>Amazement about man and woman...</i>

1127
02:03:45,289 --> 02:03:47,520
<i>has made a human being of me.</i>

1128
02:03:53,158 --> 02:03:54,251
<i>I...</i>

1129
02:03:55,229 --> 02:03:56,449
<I>know...

1130
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,989
<i>now...</i>

1131
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:00,590
<i>what...</i>

1132
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:02,358
<i>no...</i>

1133
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:04,969
<i>angel...</i>

1134
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:06,999
<i>knows.</i>

1135
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:17,140
<i>Name me the men, women, and children...</i>

1136
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,149
<i>who will look for me...</i>

1137
02:04:19,549 --> 02:04:22,881
<i>me, their storyteller...</i>

1138
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:25,279
<i>their spokesman...</i>

1139
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:28,190
<i>for they need me...</i>

1140
02:04:28,601 --> 02:04:31,590
<i>more than anything in the world.</i>

1141
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:37,269
<i>We have embarked!</i>
