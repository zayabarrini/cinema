1
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,694
<i>They stand there, barking.
Twenty-six dogs.</i>

2
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:16,701
<i>I see their mean faces.
They've come to kill.</i>

3
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,695
And they tell my boss Bertold:

4
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:25,707
"Give us Boaz Rein or we'll eat
your customers. In one minute."

5
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,044
- Twenty-six dogs?
- Exactly.

6
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,590
How do you know
there are 26 and not 30?

7
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,801
I'm coming to that.

8
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,433
- Well?
- Well what?

9
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,648
- Do you check it out?
- What do you think happens?

10
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:51,362
- I wake up.
- At that point every time?

11
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,775
Exactly. It always stops there.

12
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:56,704
- Since when?
- Two and a half years.

13
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,833
- And you call me now? At this hour?
- Asshole.

14
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,701
Don't call me an asshole.

15
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,206
This dream is coming
from somewhere.

16
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:11,674
- I haven't told you everything.
- Like what?

17
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,667
You know, in Lebanon....

18
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,419
What about Lebanon?

19
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,510
At the start of the war,
we went into Lebanese villages...

20
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:23,428
...to search for wanted Palestinians.

21
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,349
Yeah, and...?

22
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:46,867
<i>When someone enters a village,
the dogs smell and bark to alert.</i>

23
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>Everyone wakes up
and the fugitives take off.</i>

24
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:58,342
Someone had to liquidate them.
Otherwise our men would have died.

25
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,758
But why you?

26
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:05,097
They knew I couldn't shoot a person.
They told me:

27
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:08,805
"Go ahead and shoot the dogs."

28
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,830
Twenty-six dogs,
I remember every single one.

29
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:35,838
Every face, every wound, the look
in their eyes. Twenty-six dogs.

30
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,844
How long before they started
appearing in your dreams?

31
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,377
Twenty years.

32
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:44,176
- Have you tried anything?
- Like what?

33
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:48,596
Therapy, a psychiatrist,
shiatsu, anything.

34
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,517
No, nothing. I called you.

35
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,436
I'm just a filmmaker.

36
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,515
Can't films be therapeutic?

37
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:59,277
You've dealt with all the issues
in your films, right?

38
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,534
But nothing like this.

39
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,367
No flashbacks from Lebanon?

40
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,160
No. Not really.

41
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,159
Are you sure?

42
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,957
No.

43
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,375
- Beirut, Sabra and Shatila?
- What about that?

44
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,714
You were only 100 yards away
from the massacre.

45
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,551
More like 200 or 300 yards.

46
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:27,678
The truth is
that's not stored in my system.

47
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:31,387
No flashbacks or dreams?
You never think about it?

48
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,849
No, no.

49
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,645
No.

50
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,819
You'll be okay, huh?

51
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,028
- You think so?
- Sure.

52
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,704
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'll think of something.

53
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,078
- Sure?
- Sure.

54
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,658
<i>The meeting with Boaz
took place in winter, 2006.</i>

55
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,040
<i>That night,
for the first time in 20 years...</i>

56
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,299
<i>...I had a flashback
of the war in Lebanon.</i>

57
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:46,133
<i>Not just Lebanon, West Beirut.
Not just Beirut...</i>

58
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:51,261
<i>...but the massacre at the
Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.</i>

59
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:21,269
What's wrong?
It's 6:30 in the morning.

60
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:27,071
We all have friends
who are lawyers, doctors, therapists.

61
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,985
Sometimes that friendship
costs them.

62
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,736
But you wouldn't
wake your lawyer friend at 6:30.

63
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,369
My lawyer is
10 times cheaper than you.

64
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:41,035
I just don't understand.

65
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:48,587
Why Boaz's dream with the dogs?

66
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:53,762
Why that to jog my memory?
It has nothing to do with me.

67
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,850
Memory is fascinating.

68
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,603
Take this psychological experiment.

69
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:08,992
<i>A group of people were shown
10 various childhood images.</i>

70
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:13,105
<i>Nine were really from their childhood
and one was fake:</i>

71
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:20,911
<i>Their portrait was pasted
into a fairground they never visited.</i>

72
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,052
Eighty percent
recognized themselves.

73
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,633
They recognized the fake photo
as real!

74
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,799
Twenty percent couldn't remember.

75
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,309
The researchers asked them again.

76
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:41,765
<i>The second time, the others said
that they remembered the image.</i>

77
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>"Such a wonderful day at the park
with my parents."</i>

78
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:50,488
<i>They remembered
a completely fabricated experience.</i>

79
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,606
<i>Memory is dynamic. It's alive.</i>

80
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,031
<i>If some details are missing...</i>

81
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:03,331
<i>...memory fills the holes
with things that never happened.</i>

82
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,090
So my vision of the massacre
is like the fake photo?

83
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:16,837
It never happened?
I invented it? It's not real?

84
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,181
I don't know.
Who was there with you?

85
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:24,438
Carmi was there.
You know him from school.

86
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:28,268
And someone else I don't recognize.

87
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:34,026
- So go ask Carmi what he remembers.
- He's in Holland.

88
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,525
He's lived there for 20 years.

89
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:40,948
Go to Holland and ask him,
if it bothers you.

90
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,409
Isn't that dangerous?

91
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,708
Maybe I'll discover things
I don't want to know about myself.

92
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,544
Not at all.

93
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,010
You'll discover important things
that you want to know.

94
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:57,392
We don't go places
where we really don't want to.

95
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:01,972
A human mechanism prevents us
from entering dark places.

96
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,230
Memory takes us
where we need to go.

97
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,770
See all that?

98
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:47,772
Yes.

99
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,232
It's all mine.

100
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,820
All of it?

101
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,949
From those trees to the river.

102
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,452
- It all belongs to you?
- Yes, and the house.

103
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,832
It's about 10 acres.

104
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:09,415
- All that just from selling falafel?
- Just from falafel.

105
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,842
- Wow.
- Come and see.

106
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,799
- How much falafel did you sell?
- Three years was enough.

107
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:25,104
In the early '90s,
I had a small stand in Utrecht.

108
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:29,894
Health food was in fashion,
the Middle East too.

109
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,731
Falafel is both healthy
and Middle Eastern.

110
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:38,108
Everyone thought you'd become
a nuclear physicist.

111
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,145
Who did?

112
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,333
I don't know. Your family,
my family, our school friends.

113
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:50,161
They thought that by the age of 40,
you'd be nominated for a Nobel Prize.

114
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,331
By 20, that future was over.

115
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,343
Cold?

116
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:59,593
- Cold? I'm freezing.
- Let's go inside.

117
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:04,181
We have to walk all that way?

118
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,305
It's funny you've showed up now.

119
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,683
- Why?
- When you called...

120
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:15,021
...I had just gone out with
my son Thomas. He's 7.

121
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:19,189
He was playing with a toy gun
and started asking questions:

122
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,410
"What did you do in the army?
Ever shoot anyone?"

123
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,320
- Did you?
- I don't know.

124
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,451
Let's go inside and warm up.

125
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:34,501
Would you mind if I sketch
you and your son playing in the snow?

126
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,667
No.

127
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,052
Not at all. Draw as much as you like.

128
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,924
I'll fetch him.

129
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:45,221
It's fine as long as you draw,
but don't film.

130
00:15:55,122 --> 00:16:00,292
<i>As strange as it sounds,
we were transported to war...</i>

131
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:06,011
<i>...on a little Love Boat leased
by the army or God knows what.</i>

132
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:11,346
They wanted to mislead the enemy
and launch a surprise attack.

133
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:17,521
What do you mean, a "Love Boat"?
With Jacuzzis and bars?

134
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:23,028
- All of that?
- That's how I imagined it.

135
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:29,991
I later found out it was
just an old commando boat.

136
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:35,037
For 18, you seemed pretty bright
to me. I never took you for a fighter.

137
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:39,286
Frankly, it was important to me
for a pretty practical reason.

138
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,668
I felt like everyone else
was screwing like rabbits...

139
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:46,718
...and that I was the only....
How can I put it?

140
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,682
The only nerd
good at chess and math...

141
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:56,175
...but with masculinity problems.
So I had to prove to everyone...

142
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,515
...that I was the best fighter
and some big hero.

143
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,607
Did you succeed?

144
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:04,815
Yes, surprisingly enough.

145
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,953
I felt that I was strong and capable.

146
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:16,158
Then the war started and they
put us on that damned Love Boat.

147
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,794
- Then I....
- You what?

148
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:25,627
<i>I puked like a pig. I wondered
what the enemy would think.</i>

149
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,222
<i>I finally collapsed on deck
and fell asleep.</i>

150
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:32,926
<i>I sleep when I'm scared.</i>

151
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:37,175
To this day,
I escape into sleep and hallucinate.

152
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,940
<i>Unconscious on the deck...</i>

153
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:30,435
<i>...dreaming a woman would come...</i>

154
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,451
<i>...and take me for the first time...</i>

155
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:45,213
<i>...I saw my best friends
go up in flames before my eyes.</i>

156
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,706
- Where?
- On the boat.

157
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:26,167
I woke up just before we docked.
It's dawn, and we're in a city.

158
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,843
- Which city?
- How should I know?

159
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:31,335
Sidon, I think.

160
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:37,264
<i>Out of pure fear and anxiety,
we start shooting like lunatics.</i>

161
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,808
<i>- At whom?
- How do I know?</i>

162
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,941
<i>Then an old Mercedes drives up.</i>

163
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,274
<i>Everyone fires at it like crazy.</i>

164
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,531
<i>Two years of training,
and the fear...</i>

165
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,697
<i>...the uncontrollable fear....</i>

166
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:07,875
<i>Then the silence.
The terrible silence of death.</i>

167
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,380
<i>At daybreak...</i>

168
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,719
<i>...we could see our destruction...</i>

169
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,215
<i>...without knowing where we were.</i>

170
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,599
<i>Lying in the car....</i>

171
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,150
<i>What was in the car?</i>

172
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,062
<i>The bodies of a whole family.</i>

173
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,399
Why did you come here?

174
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,899
Me? I....

175
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,571
I lost my memory.

176
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,830
- In an accident?
- What?

177
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,414
- Did you have an accident?
- What do you mean?

178
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,499
In a car or at work?

179
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,417
No, I didn't have an accident.

180
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:56,915
I just can't remember anything
about the Lebanon War.

181
00:20:57,091 --> 00:21:01,601
Just one image in my mind.

182
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,602
Somehow you're in it.

183
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:06,733
What image?

184
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:47,305
Were you there too?

185
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,314
It's hard to say.

186
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,477
What do you mean?
Were you there?

187
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,066
It's hard to say.

188
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,817
I don't remember anything
about the massacre.

189
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,655
But you were in Beirut
when the massacre took place.

190
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,413
Yes, I remember being there.

191
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,655
I'll never forget
us marching into Beirut.

192
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,828
But the massacre....
How did you say it?

193
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,748
That's not stored in my system.

194
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,881
- Right.
- Massacre....

195
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:57,747
<i>Then it happened in a taxi
to Amsterdam Airport.</i>

196
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,220
<i>Suddenly, all the memories
came back.</i>

197
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,218
<i>Not a hallucination,
nor my subconscious.</i>

198
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:09,215
<i>The first day of the war. Barely 19,
I haven't even started shaving.</i>

199
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,480
<i>We're driving down a road.
Orchards on one side...</i>

200
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:17,653
<i>...the sea on the other.
We're shooting everywhere...</i>

201
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:20,065
<i>...at everything, until nightfall.</i>

202
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:28,742
<i>That evening, when we stopped,
an officer tells me:</i>

203
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,499
<i>"Load up the dead and wounded.</i>

204
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:35,373
<i>Go and dump them."</i>

205
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,082
<i>"Dump?"</i>

206
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,791
<i>"Yes, dump."</i>

207
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,751
<i>"Where?"</i>

208
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:47,091
<i>"How should I know?
Out there, near that bright light.</i>

209
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,931
<i>That's where they're dumped."</i>

210
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:00,356
<i>So I drive all the way back.</i>

211
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:05,324
<i>I had never seen an open wound
or any kind of bleeding before.</i>

212
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,777
<i>Now I was in command of a tank...</i>

213
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:13,038
<i>...full of the dead and wounded,
looking for a bright light, salvation.</i>

214
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,757
What should we do?
Why don't you tell us what to do?

215
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,296
- Shoot.
- At who?

216
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,387
How do I know? Just shoot.

217
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:32,222
- Isn't it better to pray?
- Then pray and shoot.

218
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:48,204
<i>Finally we see the helicopter lights.
Like halos.</i>

219
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:53,333
<i>As we get closer to the light, we see
dead and wounded everywhere.</i>

220
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:33,622
<i>We unload mechanically,
as if we're not even present.</i>

221
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,584
<i>Then we turn around and drive off.</i>

222
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,150
On the first day of the war...

223
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,146
...I transported
the dead and wounded...

224
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,239
...from tanks on the coast road.

225
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,834
I'm looking for people
who were with me.

226
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,413
Could your men
have been among them?

227
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,590
It sounds logical.
We were in the coastal area.

228
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,261
In the western sector. It's possible.

229
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:32,302
Do you recognize me here?

230
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,432
No.

231
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,144
I don't recognize myself either.

232
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:59,702
Crossing the border at Rosh Hanikra
felt like an excursion.

233
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,460
We took photos...

234
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,922
...we told jokes.

235
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:09,132
<i>We had time to fool around
before going into action.</i>

236
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:16,432
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

237
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:23,475
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

238
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:30,654
<i>Too much pain to carry on</i>

239
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,870
<i>Good morning, Lebanon</i>

240
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:43,503
<i>The landscape was beautiful,
trees all around.</i>

241
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:49,344
<i>A few scattered houses.
A really idyllic pastoral scene.</i>

242
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,973
<i>The slow drive allowed us
to enjoy the scenery.</i>

243
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:59,971
<i>May your dreams come true</i>

244
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:07,812
<i>May your nightmares pass</i>

245
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>Your existence
Is a blessing, Lebanon</i>

246
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,198
<i>In a tank, you always feel really safe.</i>

247
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:22,334
<i>A tank is a very massive
enclosed vehicle.</i>

248
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,624
<i>Inside the tank...</i>

249
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,828
<i>...we were protected.</i>

250
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:36,431
<i>You are torn to pieces</i>

251
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:43,682
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

252
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,394
<i>You bleed to death in my arms</i>

253
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:51,226
<i>You are the love of my life</i>

254
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:58,238
<i>Oh, my short, short life</i>

255
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:03,905
<i>Tear me to pieces</i>

256
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,576
<i>I'm bleeding</i>

257
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:17,884
Suddenly our commander
stopped responding. We lost contact.

258
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,840
- Was he beside you?
- Yes.

259
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,850
<i>I saw his head slumped forward.</i>

260
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:30,651
<i>I went down inside and saw blood,
blood in the tank.</i>

261
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:36,532
<i>The blood was coming from his neck.</i>

262
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,606
<i>You were next in command?</i>

263
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,531
Yes, I was.

264
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,500
But I didn't react immediately.

265
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:52,285
<i>We just stayed in the tank
without even thinking of firing back.</i>

266
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,964
Two minutes later,
there was an explosion.

267
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,051
Everyone tried to escape
from the tank hysterically...

268
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,807
<i>...without weapons or anything.</i>

269
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,145
<i>Those who stayed inside
were killed in the tank.</i>

270
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,902
<i>I ran as fast as I could...</i>

271
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,991
<i>...in zigzags towards the sea.</i>

272
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,434
<i>My only thought:</i>

273
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:50,095
"It's over. I'm done for.

274
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:54,857
They'll be here any minute.
All I can do is wait for the end."

275
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:05,623
<i>I saw the building from which they
were shooting, and the commander.</i>

276
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:11,202
<i>I hoped he'd get closer.</i>

277
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:42,281
<i>I don't know why,
but he started to retreat.</i>

278
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:59,130
<i>I felt abandoned by our forces.</i>

279
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:08,093
<i>I imagined how my mother
would react.</i>

280
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:12,971
<i>We're very close.
I was always like her right hand.</i>

281
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:17,901
<i>I'm the only one
who helps out at home.</i>

282
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,937
<i>Like the first-born son.</i>

283
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:28,447
<i>I took a peek.
I saw them chatting, smoking.</i>

284
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,775
<i>I wondered why...</i>

285
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,497
<i>...they didn't notice me.</i>

286
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:39,131
<i>I peeked a few more times.
I realized that they probably thought...</i>

287
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:44,262
<i>...that everyone was killed
in the attack.</i>

288
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:47,802
<i>I decided to wait until dark.</i>

289
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,008
<i>I had a good place to hide.</i>

290
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,981
<i>I don't know why, but I decided...</i>

291
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,150
<i>...to crawl out to the sea.</i>

292
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:16,751
<i>I didn't want to stay close to shore,
so I swam quite far out.</i>

293
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:22,287
<i>When I felt I was far out enough,
I started swimming south.</i>

294
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,500
<i>How was the sea?</i>

295
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,760
Really calm, no waves.

296
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,845
I felt calm and at peace.
Just me and the sea.

297
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,279
<i>I felt safe because the sea
was calm and peaceful.</i>

298
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,528
<i>But I was still really afraid...</i>

299
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,907
<i>...that my strength would fail
and I'd drown.</i>

300
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,880
<i>Or maybe someone might spot me
and shoot at me, kill me.</i>

301
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:19,891
<i>While swimming through
this peaceful water...</i>

302
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,520
<i>...I suddenly heard a loud noise.</i>

303
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,898
<i>I felt the water pulsating.</i>

304
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:30,946
<i>I felt the turbulent water
enveloping me.</i>

305
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,112
<i>My body shook with fear.</i>

306
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:09,356
<i>I saw lights in the distance
and I headed in that direction.</i>

307
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,446
<i>They might be Israeli forces.</i>

308
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:16,872
<i>I kept swimming,
but felt my strength was dwindling.</i>

309
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,703
<i>I could barely move my limbs.</i>

310
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:35,797
<i>Sometimes I simply
let the water carry me along.</i>

311
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:47,109
<i>I eventually reached shore
and started walking.</i>

312
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:52,652
<i>I heard voices speaking Hebrew
on the two-way radio.</i>

313
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,989
<i>I knew...</i>

314
00:35:56,156 --> 00:36:00,326
<i>...that I had to get to them
despite my exhaustion.</i>

315
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,461
<i>To my amazement, it was
the regiment that had abandoned me.</i>

316
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:20,176
After I got back to my regiment...

317
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,556
...I felt like....

318
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:27,846
Like it was me who had
abandoned my comrades.

319
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:32,231
I always felt
that they regarded me like....

320
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:39,658
<i>Like someone who didn't help
rescue his friends.</i>

321
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:46,544
<i>As if I had fled the battlefield
just to save my own skin.</i>

322
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,206
<i>I sometimes felt very uneasy.</i>

323
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,625
<i>I broke off contact
with the families of the dead.</i>

324
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:58,965
At first I visited their graves,
but then I just stopped.

325
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,555
I wanted to forget.
I didn't want to relive those moments.

326
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:09,019
<i>- Visiting the graves, you felt....
- Guilty.</i>

327
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:12,897
<i>I felt guilty standing at their graves.</i>

328
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,606
As if I didn't do enough.

329
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,649
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

330
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:24,081
<i>I wasn't the hero type who carries
weapons and saves everyone's life.</i>

331
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,834
<i>That's not me. I'm not the type.</i>

332
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,541
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

333
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,040
<i>Amid the clouds of smoke at dawn</i>

334
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:20,088
<i>I almost went home in a coffin</i>

335
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,299
<i>I bombed Sidon today</i>

336
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,478
<i>One month after Ronny Dayag
swam back home safely...</i>

337
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,565
<i>...the army took the beach
from which he had fled.</i>

338
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:40,573
<i>They told us we'd soon attack Beirut
and that we'd all die.</i>

339
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,830
<i>But on the beach,
we didn't think much about death.</i>

340
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,492
<i>I had a hut of banana leaves.</i>

341
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:50,751
<i>Thinking back...</i>

342
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:57,004
<i>...the smell of patchouli oil
still makes me nauseous.</i>

343
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:02,505
<i>It was really popular in the '80s.
For my roommate Frenkel...</i>

344
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:08,555
<i>...patchouli was not just a fragrance,
it was a way of life.</i>

345
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,377
Patchouli. How do you use it?

346
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,215
Show me.

347
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:48,143
You sprinkle a drop on your hand,
like this.

348
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,766
This way...

349
00:39:57,939 --> 00:40:01,279
...your comrades
always know you're there.

350
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:05,362
I remember my men telling me:

351
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,580
"Frenkel, you walk too fast.
Like a rabbit."

352
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:16,866
<i>So what do you do? Patchouli.</i>

353
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,841
<i>In the dark, at night....
They couldn't miss me.</i>

354
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:25,174
<i>The scent is really strong,
even out in the field.</i>

355
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,427
I still use it.

356
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:33,104
<i>I bombed Beirut today</i>

357
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,902
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

358
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:44,863
<i>If I came close to death
I couldn't say</i>

359
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,611
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

360
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,290
<i>At the pull of a trigger</i>

361
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,325
<i>We can send strangers
Straight to hell</i>

362
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:05,757
<i>Sure, we kill some innocent
Along the way</i>

363
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:11,136
<i>If I came close to death
I couldn't say</i>

364
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,715
<i>I bombed Beirut every day</i>

365
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:19,652
<i>Our daily routine was this:</i>

366
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:21,482
<i>Get up in the morning...</i>

367
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:27,358
<i>...prepare breakfast
on those frying pans...</i>

368
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,818
<i>...potted beef and eggs.</i>

369
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,826
<i>- On the beach.
- On the beach.</i>

370
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,082
<i>Take a quick swim...</i>

371
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:38,332
<i>...back into uniform,
then go after some terrorists.</i>

372
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,917
<i>Someone yelled, "Frenkel!"</i>

373
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:12,262
I noticed a boy holding an RPG.

374
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,550
<i>A kid.</i>

375
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,943
Frenkel, was I there too?

376
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,319
Sure. From training camp,
you were with me wherever I went.

377
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:38,366
- Even there?
- Yes, there too.

378
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:42,331
Good to know.
Of course I was there.

379
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:47,626
Is it possible that I can't remember
such a dramatic event?

380
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:49,754
We call them dissociative events.

381
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:54,927
It's when a person is in a situation
but feels outside it.

382
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:59,222
I was once visited by a young man,
an amateur photographer.

383
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:03,518
I asked him in 1983, "How did you
survive through that grueling war?"

384
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:08,114
He replied, "It was quite easy.
I regarded it as a long day trip."

385
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:12,032
He told himself,
"Wow, what great scenes:

386
00:44:12,193 --> 00:44:15,453
Shooting, artillery,
wounded people, screaming...."

387
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:20,663
He looked at everything
as if through an imaginary camera.

388
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:37,335
<i>Then something happened:</i>

389
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,970
<i>His camera broke.</i>

390
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:55,443
<i>He said that the situation
turned traumatic for him...</i>

391
00:44:55,611 --> 00:45:00,491
<i>...when they arrived in the vicinity
of the stables in Beirut.</i>

392
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:01,988
<i>The Hippodrome.</i>

393
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,209
<i>He saw a huge number
of carcasses...</i>

394
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:10,462
<i>...of slaughtered Arabian horses.</i>

395
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:16,216
<i>"It broke my heart," he said.
"What had those horses done...</i>

396
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:18,722
<i>...to deserve such suffering?"</i>

397
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,684
<i>He couldn't handle seeing
those dead and wounded horses.</i>

398
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,727
<i>He had used a mechanism
to remain outside events...</i>

399
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:29,651
<i>...as if watching the war on film
instead of participating.</i>

400
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:32,152
<i>This protected him.</i>

401
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:37,395
<i>Once pulled into the events,
he could no longer deny reality.</i>

402
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,370
<i>Horror surrounded him
and he freaked out.</i>

403
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:52,921
You told me earlier that you can't
remember being in the orchard...

404
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,255
...where the boy with the RPG was.

405
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:59,842
Can you remember other things?
Like going home...

406
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:02,929
...chatting with friends,
events from that time...

407
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:07,385
...something that maybe
reminds you of that time?

408
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:10,768
- Yes, in detail.
- For example?

409
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:13,766
I can remember perfectly
every furlough.

410
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:08,408
<i>I remember when I was about 10,
there was a war going on.</i>

411
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,787
<i>And everything came to a halt.
All the fathers were at the front.</i>

412
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:16,376
<i>All children sat with their mothers,
closed up indoors...</i>

413
00:47:16,544 --> 00:47:19,464
<i>...behind closed blinds in the dark.</i>

414
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,339
<i>Just waiting for a plane
to drop a bomb and kill them all.</i>

415
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:28,514
<i>No one even dreamed
of going outside.</i>

416
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:34,353
<i>When I went home from Lebanon
for the first time in six weeks...</i>

417
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,980
<i>...I saw that life
was carrying on normally.</i>

418
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:55,245
<i>My goal on leave
was to get back my girlfriend, Yaeli.</i>

419
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:58,706
<i>She had dumped me the night before
all of this started.</i>

420
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,690
Remember how?
Add some Sprite.

421
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:25,611
Ready?

422
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,238
Bottoms up!

423
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,794
The memories are coming back.

424
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:43,008
I met people who served with me.
I almost have the full picture.

425
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:46,472
- At which point?
- The first day of the war...

426
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,264
...the siege on Beirut.

427
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:51,758
You remember that
Yaeli dumped you a week before?

428
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:55,101
How do you know?

429
00:48:57,686 --> 00:49:01,066
Didn't you know that
I was in love with her for years?

430
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:06,198
No, I didn't know that.

431
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:08,032
It's true.

432
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:12,449
What's wrong?
That was 20 years ago.

433
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:15,958
It's okay. I'm not angry.

434
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:21,127
At least you had your home,
your family.

435
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:25,133
What home? What family?

436
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:26,797
You have no idea.

437
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,006
My father....

438
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:34,561
To comfort me,
he told me that in his war...

439
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,813
...World War Il...

440
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:38,806
...Russian soldiers in Stalingrad...

441
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:42,228
...were given 48 hours' leave
only after one year on the front.

442
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:57,077
<i>They got on a train,
arrived home at the station...</i>

443
00:49:57,413 --> 00:49:59,793
<i>...kissed their girlfriends
on the platform...</i>

444
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:04,497
<i>...then had to get back on board
to head back to the front.</i>

445
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,630
<i>Understand?</i>

446
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:14,595
He thought it would comfort me.
In fact, he was right.

447
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:18,353
After only 24 hours,
I was called back to duty.

448
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:21,727
Back then, a new trend started:
car bombs.

449
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:24,016
Still popular today.

450
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,689
They're a blast.

451
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,237
A real blast.

452
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:36,035
So I arrive at this villa
on the outskirts of Beirut.

453
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,210
<i>Everything is made of gold.</i>

454
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:49,126
<i>Fancy sinks, marble,
gold fixtures and all that stuff.</i>

455
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:55,546
<i>An officer sits in front of the TV.
He doesn't look at me.</i>

456
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:56,931
<i>He keeps repeating:</i>

457
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,637
Fast forward.

458
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:01,637
Fast forward.

459
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:03,731
THE PLUMBER COMES 2

460
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:09,226
<i>- I'm here to check your plumbing.
- Down here.</i>

461
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:16,912
<i>- Have you seen my tool?
- Which tool?</i>

462
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:18,736
<i>The big, long one.</i>

463
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:24,329
<i>Your pipes are so deep.</i>

464
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,670
Fast forward.

465
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,972
Stop.

466
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,440
<i>Hello.
Is that your red Mercedes outside?</i>

467
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:47,442
<i>I'm busy servicing a customer.</i>

468
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:53,736
<i>He changes the tape and says:</i>

469
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:57,784
We received a tip-off
about a red Mercedes.

470
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,410
- It's coming to blow up your men.
- So?

471
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:02,577
Blow it up first.

472
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:06,326
- Every red Mercedes?
- Are you an idiot?

473
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:09,459
Did the Mercedes come?

474
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:15,298
We waited all night
for the exploding Mercedes...

475
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,297
...for this impending disaster.

476
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:00,804
<i>Then, in the middle of the night,
the phone rang.</i>

477
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:03,217
Bashir is dead.

478
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:05,933
- Which Bashir?
<i>- Bashir Gemayel...</i>

479
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:09,191
...the elected president of Lebanon.

480
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:13,784
A brother, an ally, a Christian.
Murdered.

481
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,528
<i>Wake everyone up.
You'll be in Beirut in two hours.</i>

482
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:22,661
<i>I don't remember much
about the flight to Beirut...</i>

483
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:27,076
<i>...except that I was having
obsessive thoughts about death...</i>

484
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,247
<i>...because my girlfriend Yaeli
had dumped me the week before.</i>

485
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:34,798
<i>Death would be my revenge.</i>

486
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:37,715
<i>She would be ridden with guilt...</i>

487
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,053
<i>...for the rest of her life.</i>

488
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:47,312
<i>While fantasizing about my death...</i>

489
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,226
<i>...we approach Beirut.</i>

490
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:52,436
<i>A city with hotels, beaches...</i>

491
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,646
<i>...and people scurrying about.</i>

492
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:57,897
<i>We land at the international airport.</i>

493
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:03,660
<i>Our Hercules army helicopter lands
next to jets from Air France, TWA...</i>

494
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:05,986
<i>...and British Airways.</i>

495
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:10,001
<i>I was excited
like I was going on a trip abroad...</i>

496
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:13,335
<i>...excited all over.</i>

497
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:22,761
<i>At some point I simply take off...</i>

498
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:25,928
<i>...and walk into the terminal.</i>

499
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:30,018
<i>It felt as if I was on a leisure trip...</i>

500
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:33,685
<i>...a sort of hallucination.</i>

501
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:36,106
<i>Like standing in a terminal...</i>

502
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:39,185
<i>...waiting to choose my destination.</i>

503
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:42,451
<i>Before that '80s departures board...</i>

504
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:46,624
<i>...the choice is all mine.</i>

505
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,905
<i>I see the 14:10 to London...</i>

506
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,290
<i>...the 15:20 to Paris...</i>

507
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:55,287
<i>...the 16:00 to New York.</i>

508
00:54:56,086 --> 00:55:00,466
<i>I wander through the terminal
and see the duty-free shops:</i>

509
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:03,842
<i>Jewelry, tobacco...</i>

510
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,221
<i>...alcohol.</i>

511
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:09,887
<i>While I'm still on this trip,
I suddenly realize what's going on.</i>

512
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:13,768
<i>Through the window I see...</i>

513
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:19,567
<i>...that all the TWA and Air France
planes are just bombed-out shells.</i>

514
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,065
<i>And the shops are empty.</i>

515
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,031
<i>They've long since been looted.</i>

516
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:29,327
<i>And the schedule board
hasn't changed for months.</i>

517
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:33,622
<i>Then I start to hear sounds, voices.</i>

518
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:38,630
<i>I hear shelling in the city
and the bombing by the air force.</i>

519
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:40,625
<i>Slowly I begin to realize
where I am...</i>

520
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:44,007
<i>...and I am afraid
of what will happen next.</i>

521
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:52,813
<i>We start walking
from the airport to the city.</i>

522
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:56,306
<i>Tall high-rise hotels
hover above us.</i>

523
00:55:57,272 --> 00:56:00,032
<i>The sea is at our side.</i>

524
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:12,874
<i>We walk along a promenade
towards a large junction.</i>

525
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:19,877
<i>Then we come under sniper fire
from the upper floors of a hotel.</i>

526
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:25,545
<i>We can't see where it's coming from
or who is shooting.</i>

527
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:30,887
<i>A wounded soldier was lying at the
junction, but we couldn't get to him.</i>

528
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,560
<i>We were scared to death.</i>

529
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:48,371
<i>Then, in the middle of this hell...</i>

530
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:53,122
<i>...that TV correspondent
Ron Ben-Yishai suddenly shows up.</i>

531
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:59,075
<i>He's walking upright,
dodging bullets like Superman.</i>

532
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:03,881
<i>Strolling along as if nothing's wrong,
while bullets whiz past him.</i>

533
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:08,337
<i>In front of him, a terrified cameraman
crawls forward.</i>

534
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:13,600
<i>Trembling with fear,
he can't see beyond his helmet.</i>

535
00:57:13,974 --> 00:57:16,274
It was a large junction.

536
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:23,322
One lane led directly
into Hamra Street...

537
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:27,113
...to the West Beirut district of Hamra.

538
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:31,449
I remember the sizzling sound,
a sort of hissing noise....

539
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:36,286
They were firing masses of RPGs,
and it sounded...

540
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,616
<i>...like a Native American
arrow-shooting range.</i>

541
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,630
<i>Before an RPG explodes,
it makes this hissing noise.</i>

542
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:47,836
<i>You don't hear an explosion...</i>

543
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:52,468
...but just this hissing,
then the walls shattering.

544
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:59,227
During all this,
civilians are seen on balconies:

545
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:01,564
Women, children...

546
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:07,150
<i>...and old people are watching
as if it were a film.</i>

547
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:25,209
<i>They are shooting at us
from all directions.</i>

548
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:33,429
<i>And we can't get across.</i>

549
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:37,675
Throughout my military service,
I was a MAG shooter.

550
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,599
During my officer's training, I thought:

551
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:44,769
"You've used a MAG for so long,
why not try something else?"

552
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,070
So they gave me a Galil.

553
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:53,408
<i>And while they're shooting at us
from all directions...</i>

554
00:58:53,573 --> 00:58:59,203
<i>...I realize that I can't shoot
with the Galil like I could before.</i>

555
00:58:59,371 --> 00:59:03,921
<i>I missed the good old MAG
that I was familiar with.</i>

556
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:09,005
So I say to Erez,
"Erez, do me a favor.

557
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:15,506
Give me your MAG.
I won't make it across with the Galil.

558
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,059
Give me your MAG
and we'll cross the street.

559
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:20,314
I'll shoot better."

560
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:24,976
<i>He says, "Frenkel, are you nuts?</i>

561
00:59:25,147 --> 00:59:30,687
<i>They're attacking us!
Stop babbling and shoot!"</i>

562
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,157
<i>I finally realize that I must...</i>

563
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:38,743
...take drastic steps.
I grab him and say:

564
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:46,250
"Listen, Erez, give me the MAG,
or I'll take it by force."

565
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,443
<i>Whether an eternity
or just a minute...</i>

566
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:15,324
<i>...there was Frenkel at the junction...</i>

567
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:18,828
<i>...with bullets flying past him
in every direction.</i>

568
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:21,997
<i>Instead of crossing the junction...</i>

569
01:00:22,162 --> 01:00:25,462
<i>...I saw him dancing, as if in a trance.</i>

570
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:30,625
<i>He cursed the shooters.
Like he wanted to stay there forever.</i>

571
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:35,375
<i>As if he wanted to show off
his waltz amid the gunfire...</i>

572
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,010
<i>...with the posters of Bashir
above his head.</i>

573
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:42,519
<i>And Bashir's followers...</i>

574
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,062
<i>...preparing their big revenge
just 200 yards away:</i>

575
01:00:45,227 --> 01:00:49,807
<i>The Sabra and Shatila massacre.</i>

576
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:02,907
I'm starting to remember.

577
01:01:03,078 --> 01:01:06,208
I've met people, I've heard stories.

578
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:08,753
Stories about myself.

579
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:11,087
I didn't want to believe them.

580
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:16,224
So what can't you remember?

581
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:21,513
The day of the massacre.
I can remember everything else.

582
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:27,020
I don't understand
why people were so surprised...

583
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:29,645
...that the Phalangists
carried out the massacre.

584
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:33,733
I knew all along
how ruthless they were.

585
01:01:38,196 --> 01:01:42,156
During the storming of Beirut,
we were in the slaughterhouse.

586
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:46,405
- Where?
- The slaughterhouse, that junkyard...

587
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:51,919
...where they took the Palestinians,
interrogated them, and executed them.

588
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:54,875
It was like being on an LSD trip.

589
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:05,972
<i>They carried body parts
of murdered Palestinians...</i>

590
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,731
<i>...preserved in jars of formaldehyde.</i>

591
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:16,032
<i>They had fingers, eyeballs,
anything you wanted.</i>

592
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:24,081
<i>And always pictures of Bashir.</i>

593
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:28,414
<i>Bashir pendants, Bashir watches,
Bashir this, Bashir that.</i>

594
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:34,710
<i>Bashir was to them
what David Bowie was to me.</i>

595
01:02:34,878 --> 01:02:40,088
<i>A star, an idol, a prince, admirable.</i>

596
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,933
<i>I think they even felt
an eroticism for him.</i>

597
01:02:44,095 --> 01:02:45,755
Totally erotic.

598
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:52,603
Their idol was about to become king.
We were the ones to crown him.

599
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:55,191
The next day he was murdered.

600
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:59,737
It was obvious they'd avenge his death
in some perverse way.

601
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:03,283
It was as if their wife
had been murdered.

602
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,908
This was about family honor,
which runs deep.

603
01:03:10,038 --> 01:03:11,328
Why did you come back?

604
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:18,125
I'm still having these hallucinations
about the massacre on the beach.

605
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,800
And you're there with me.

606
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:02,755
You're crazy.

607
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,054
You're obsessed.

608
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:09,598
Beach? What are you talking about?
Who was on the beach that night?

609
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:12,274
What beach?

610
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:26,451
I've reached a dead end.

611
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:31,204
I can't find anyone
who was with me at the massacre.

612
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:34,664
No one who was with me...

613
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:39,841
...has any solid memories
of the days of the massacre.

614
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:43,383
I only have this one vision.

615
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:49,388
And Carmi, the only person in my
vision, denies being there with me.

616
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:52,144
- It's still real.
- It's a vision.

617
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:55,557
- But it's yours. Shall I explain?
- Yes.

618
01:04:55,727 --> 01:05:01,267
What does the sea symbolize
in dreams? Fear. Feelings.

619
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:06,281
The massacre frightens you, makes
you uneasy. You were close to it.

620
01:05:06,446 --> 01:05:08,316
That doesn't help me much.

621
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:14,080
Your interest in the massacre
developed long before it happened.

622
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:17,415
Your interest in the massacre
stems from another massacre.

623
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:22,252
Your interest in those camps
is actually about the other camps.

624
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,300
- Were your parents in camps?
- Yes.

625
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:26,134
- Auschwitz?
- Yes.

626
01:05:26,716 --> 01:05:31,716
So the massacre has been with you
since you were 6.

627
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:34,768
You lived through the massacre
and those camps.

628
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:40,483
Your only solution
is to find out what really happened...

629
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:44,147
...in Sabra and Shatila.
Seek out people.

630
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:47,487
Find out what really happened,
ask who was there.

631
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:50,874
Get details and more details.
That way....

632
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:57,115
Then maybe you can find out
where you were exactly...

633
01:05:57,288 --> 01:05:59,578
...and what role you played.

634
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:13,809
<i>On that day, we were sent
to a certain post.</i>

635
01:06:13,972 --> 01:06:17,062
It was actually on a hill.
This hill...

636
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:21,984
...was opposite the western sector
of the refugee camp.

637
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:28,315
<i>From where I was,
I could see the settlement houses.</i>

638
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:31,196
<i>There was occasional shooting.
We tried to locate them...</i>

639
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:33,244
<i>...and retaliate.</i>

640
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:41,001
<i>The Christian Phalangist forces
began to arrive.</i>

641
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,665
<i>In full kit,
soldiers in Israeli uniforms...</i>

642
01:06:44,836 --> 01:06:47,336
<i>...took position behind tanks.</i>

643
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:53,601
<i>I was called for a briefing.
It was in English.</i>

644
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:55,601
<i>What was it about?</i>

645
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:58,273
They told us that the Christians...

646
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:01,943
...would enter the camp
and we would give them cover.

647
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:06,072
<i>Once they had purged the camps...</i>

648
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:08,692
...we would seize control.

649
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,740
- Purged of what?
- Palestinian terrorists.

650
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:06,879
<i>The next morning,
they began to bring out civilians.</i>

651
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:18,677
<i>The civilians were led
out of the camps...</i>

652
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:22,976
<i>...in a long line.</i>

653
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:26,902
<i>The Phalangists watched on,
constantly shouting at them...</i>

654
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:29,653
<i>...and occasionally firing into the air.</i>

655
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,783
<i>There were women, old people...</i>

656
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:38,284
<i>...and children walking in a line
towards the stadium.</i>

657
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:46,121
From inside the tank, did you
wonder where they were taking them?

658
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,460
Did you think about it?

659
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:52,054
Not really,
because wherever we went...

660
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:55,343
...an announcement was made
upon entering a camp.

661
01:08:55,508 --> 01:09:01,468
Civilians were ordered out. Those
remaining were considered rebels.

662
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:07,349
It seemed quite natural
to say to the residents:

663
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,770
"If you don't want to get hurt,
then come out."

664
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:39,216
On that day I drove to Docha,
a city on the coast.

665
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:43,845
It had an Israel Defense Forces
landing field.

666
01:09:44,891 --> 01:09:45,931
<i>On the way...</i>

667
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:49,849
<i>...many Phalangist
half-track vehicles appeared.</i>

668
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:56,071
<i>They shouted with joy
as they headed towards the airfield.</i>

669
01:09:56,235 --> 01:10:01,025
At the airfield, I met a colonel friend.

670
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,199
<i>He told me:</i>

671
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:07,708
<i>"Have you heard what's happening
in the refugee camps?"</i>

672
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:10,712
<i>He had pointed to Sabra and Shatila.</i>

673
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:14,045
<i>"What's happening?" I asked.</i>

674
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:19,882
<i>"I didn't witness it myself, but they
say there was a terrible massacre."</i>

675
01:10:20,051 --> 01:10:27,101
Palestinians were slaughtered.
I heard they put them on trucks.

676
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:32,226
<i>I was told that crucifixes
were carved on their chests.</i>

677
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:37,436
<i>There were wounded,
some in critical condition.</i>

678
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:41,029
They were put on trucks
and taken to an unknown destination.

679
01:10:50,456 --> 01:10:54,126
We saw a Phalangist soldier...

680
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:57,263
<i>...taking an old man away.</i>

681
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:03,797
<i>At some point, we heard shots.</i>

682
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:06,350
<i>We heard shots.</i>

683
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:10,268
<i>Then the soldier came out alone.</i>

684
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:14,564
<i>We asked him what happened.</i>

685
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:21,532
<i>We couldn't hear him,
but his gestures meant "boom!"</i>

686
01:11:21,696 --> 01:11:26,446
<i>We understood that he'd told the man
to kneel down before him.</i>

687
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:29,947
<i>When he refused, he shot his knees.
When he refused again...</i>

688
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:31,911
<i>...he shot him
in the stomach and head.</i>

689
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:39,708
Didn't you ever realize...

690
01:11:39,881 --> 01:11:44,391
...that trucks were going in empty
and coming out full?

691
01:11:44,552 --> 01:11:49,642
Women and children were brought out
and bulldozers went in?

692
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:51,557
That maybe
a massacre is taking place?

693
01:11:51,726 --> 01:11:56,266
Did you wonder
why you didn't realize earlier?

694
01:11:57,398 --> 01:12:00,148
Yes, of course.

695
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:06,701
I realized something was happening
only when my men told me.

696
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:09,158
<i>From the top of their tanks...</i>

697
01:12:09,327 --> 01:12:14,327
<i>...they started shouting,
"They are shooting people!"</i>

698
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,639
<i>They claim that people were lined up
against the wall and shot.</i>

699
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:36,399
So I called my commanding officer.

700
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:41,652
I told him what I heard
was going on in the camps.

701
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:46,953
He said, "We know about it.
It's under control. We reported it."

702
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:51,704
As far as I was concerned,
the army was handling it.

703
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:56,539
Where was the operations room,
the headquarters?

704
01:12:56,707 --> 01:13:00,877
About 100 yards away.
On top of a very tall building.

705
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:05,467
<i>- How tall?
- Tall enough to see everything.</i>

706
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:09,433
<i>They surely had a better view
than I did.</i>

707
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:39,580
<i>I didn't want to walk around at night,
so I drove...</i>

708
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:43,380
<i>...to my place in Baabda.
I had an apartment in Beirut.</i>

709
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:48,756
<i>Micha Friedman was with me.
We decided to make dinner.</i>

710
01:13:48,926 --> 01:13:56,096
<i>Micha invited the guys from
the regiment of the 21 1th Brigade.</i>

711
01:13:56,267 --> 01:14:00,977
<i>During the meal, the regiment
commander took me aside.</i>

712
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:04,439
<i>He said, "Ron...</i>

713
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:10,528
<i>...my men say there's a massacre
going on in the camps."</i>

714
01:14:10,698 --> 01:14:14,448
He mentioned one or two incidents...

715
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:17,158
...saying a family was seen shot.

716
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:21,039
I asked him again,
"Did you see it yourself?"

717
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:25,048
"I didn't," he said,
"but my soldiers told me about it.

718
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:31,222
The officers sitting here did too."
We talked about it over dinner later.

719
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:36,849
<i>As soon as they left at 11:30 p.m...</i>

720
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:42,148
<i>...I knocked back a whiskey and
phoned Defense Minister Arik Sharon.</i>

721
01:14:43,064 --> 01:14:45,194
<i>At his ranch.</i>

722
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:49,487
Arik was half asleep.

723
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:55,913
I said, "I've heard
there's a massacre going on, Arik.

724
01:14:56,077 --> 01:15:01,667
They are slaughtering Palestinians.
We have to put a stop to it."

725
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:06,002
He asked me,
"Did you see it yourself?"

726
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:13,472
"No", I said, "but there are
several witnesses who saw it."

727
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:15,676
"Okay," he said.

728
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:19,516
"Thanks for bringing it
to my attention." That was all.

729
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:23,853
<i>You'd normally say, "I'll check it out,
I'll look into it." But no!</i>

730
01:15:24,021 --> 01:15:29,941
<i>He said, "Thanks for bringing it
to my attention. Happy New Year."</i>

731
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:33,701
<i>Well, something along those lines.
Then back to sleep.</i>

732
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:36,954
It's amazing.
A massacre took place...

733
01:15:37,118 --> 01:15:41,908
...it was carried out by
Christian Phalangists.

734
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:48,045
All around were several circles
of our soldiers.

735
01:15:48,796 --> 01:15:51,716
Every circle had some information.

736
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:54,802
The first one had the most.
However...

737
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:57,972
...the penny didn't drop.

738
01:15:58,139 --> 01:16:00,889
They didn't realize
they were witnessing a genocide.

739
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,808
What circle were you in?

740
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:05,767
In the second or third.

741
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:09,068
What did you do?

742
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:14,614
<i>We stood on a roof
and saw the sky was lit up.</i>

743
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:18,987
<i>- With what?
- Flares.</i>

744
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,080
<i>Flares that must have helped them
do what they were doing.</i>

745
01:16:29,587 --> 01:16:31,757
<i>Did you fire the flares?</i>

746
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:33,472
<i>Is that important?</i>

747
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:37,262
Does it make any difference
if I fired them...

748
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:41,598
...or if I just saw the flares
that helped people shoot others?

749
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:47,611
In your state of mind at that time,
it didn't really make a difference.

750
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:51,861
You can't remember the massacre
because in your opinion...

751
01:16:52,026 --> 01:16:56,736
...the murderers and those
around them are the same circle.

752
01:16:56,906 --> 01:17:00,026
You felt guilty at the age of 19.

753
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:02,541
Unwillingly,
you took on the role of the Nazi.

754
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:07,415
You were there firing flares,
but you didn't carry out the massacre.

755
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:28,346
<i>I woke up at 5 or 5:30,
and I woke everyone up...</i>

756
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,980
<i>...the whole team.</i>

757
01:17:31,148 --> 01:17:34,988
<i>Then I drove to Sabra and Shatila.</i>

758
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:38,196
When I arrived there....

759
01:17:38,364 --> 01:17:40,744
What a mess.

760
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:47,325
You know that picture
from the Warsaw ghetto?

761
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:51,839
The one with the kid
holding his hands in the air?

762
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,507
<i>That's just how
the long line of women...</i>

763
01:17:56,674 --> 01:18:00,184
<i>...old people and children looked.</i>

764
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:04,314
<i>I thought about going to
Brigadier Amos' headquarters...</i>

765
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:08,853
<i>...but as I was leaving,
Amos suddenly turned up.</i>

766
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:11,109
<i>He drove to the head of the convoy.</i>

767
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:15,862
<i>His angry gestures
forced them to stop.</i>

768
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:19,276
And that was the end of it.

769
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,820
Stop the shooting.

770
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:24,241
Stop the shooting immediately.

771
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,119
It's an order. Stop the shooting...

772
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:32,285
...immediately. Everybody, go home.

773
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:34,459
Go home, now.

774
01:18:49,059 --> 01:18:52,189
<i>The Phalangists
withdrew back up the street.</i>

775
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:57,234
<i>The women and children
returned to the camp.</i>

776
01:18:57,401 --> 01:19:00,401
<i>- The Palestinians?
- Yes.</i>

777
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:12,289
I said to my men,
"We're going in with them.

778
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,248
With those women and children.

779
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:19,920
<i>We'll see what happened in there."</i>

780
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:23,550
<i>Inside the camp, we saw
a huge amount of rubble.</i>

781
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:25,509
<i>My eye caught...</i>

782
01:19:25,888 --> 01:19:28,218
<i>...a hand, a small hand.</i>

783
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:34,690
<i>A child's hand
stuck out from the rubble.</i>

784
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:40,148
<i>I looked a bit closer and saw curls.</i>

785
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:46,784
<i>A head of curls covered in dust.
It was hard to make out.</i>

786
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:54,120
But it was a head,
exposed up to the nose.

787
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:56,625
A hand and a head.

788
01:19:56,794 --> 01:20:01,054
<i>My own daughter was the same age
as that little girl...</i>

789
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:05,545
<i>...and she had curly hair too.</i>

790
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,140
<i>The Palestinians in refugee camps
have houses with courtyards.</i>

791
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,481
<i>These courtyards were full
of bodies of women and children.</i>

792
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:20,778
<i>The young men had been shot first.</i>

793
01:20:21,276 --> 01:20:25,236
<i>Then the rest of the family
was dealt with.</i>

794
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:29,869
<i>We entered one alley,
a very narrow alley...</i>

795
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:33,035
<i>...the width of a man and a half.</i>

796
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:36,884
That alley was full....

797
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:42,422
Piled up to the height
of a man's chest...

798
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:45,179
<i>...with the bodies of young men.</i>

799
01:20:45,342 --> 01:20:50,642
<i>That's when I became aware
of the results of the massacre.</i>
