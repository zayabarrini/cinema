1
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:19,209
That Was the wrong bus

2
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,167
What

3
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,126
Is this the bus to Wulagai

4
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:36,709
That was in 1967

5
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,209
the second year of the Cultural Revolution

6
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:43,042
City students were sent to the countryside

7
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,042
The Great Wall

8
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,209
The Great Wall, look

9
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,251
I volunteered

10
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,501
I was among the very first to go

11
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,042
I picked Inner Mongolia

12
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,417
Wherever that was

13
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,084
It was so exciting to escape

14
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:09,001
the hard life we had in Beijing

15
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,542
during that troubled period

16
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,667
Don't forget my books

17
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,709
Goodbye

18
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:23,876
See you

19
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,376
See you

20
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,417
Look, so beautiful

21
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,917
Which is the brigade leader's yurt

22
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,334
The one with the Wolf totem

23
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,834
Welcome

24
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,334
Hello

25
00:03:58,584 --> 00:03:59,792
We are students from Beijing

26
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,917
My name is Yang Ke

27
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:05,459

Hello

29
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,626
Welcome

30
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,917
How are you

31
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,542
How are you

32
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,709
Are you the leader

33
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,167
Yes

34
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,417
Alright

35
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,751
My name is Bilig

36
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,251
I am Bao Shungui

37
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,542
I am the new head of production for your area

38
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,167
I bring

39
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:34,459
Come, come

40
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,459
These two students

41
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,209
will stay here for two years

42
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,042
You will take care their living

43
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,251
and give them Work

44
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,584
They will teach the kids

45
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,542
to read and Write mandarin

46
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,709
I am going now

47
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,417
Goodbye

48
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,042
See you

49
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:55,667
Goodbye

50
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,167
What's inside

51
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:11,709
Books

52
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,126
Only books

53
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,417
That's my son's yurt

54
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,209
Yours is over there

55
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,834
This Will be your home

56
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,167
Here

57
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,626
This is for your protection

58
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:46,834
Protection against What

59
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:49,876
Mosquitoes

60
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,167
Wolves

61
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,209
You city boys

62
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:58,042
What did you learn at school

63
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,834
Serf)'

64
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,167
late again

65
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:19,542
Easy, Stop

66
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,084
Give me

67
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,876
Did you see the gazelles

68
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,042
Hard to miss them

69
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,501
I Wonder

70
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,417
What they were running away from

71
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,542
Do you have your club

72
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,417
I've forgotten it

73
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:42,876
Take this one

74
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,084
Okay

75
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,417
Take care

76
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,501
Sure

77
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:23,959
It's okay

78
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,667
E215)'

79
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,292
E215)'

80
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:23,084
Did the awe that the Mongolian Wolf inspired

81
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,084
come from a cult deeply entrenched

82
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,584
in man's brain since time immemorial

83
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,751
My heart filled with gratitude

84
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,751
for the secret forces that came to my rescue

85
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,126
I had the feeling

86
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,292
that I'd started t0 open the door

87
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:45,751
on the spiritual World of the grassland people

88
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,709
What happened

89
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,709
Gasma

90
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,126
You alright?

91
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,459
"Riding this vast, deserted land

92
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:24,584
he could not stand

93
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,751
Walls, barriers or borders

94
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,501
He'd never surrendered to anyone

95
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:30,626
he'd rather die than be taken prisoner"

96
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,667
What means "never surrendered t0 anyone"

97
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,751
If not free

98
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,001
better dead

99
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,292
And then?

100
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,542
"His dream was t0 be free as the wolves

101
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,667
He would only answer to Great Tengger

102
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,626
He would only answer to Great Tengger

103
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,167
His one and only Master"

104
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,542
Chen Zhen

105
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,709
who do you answer to

106
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,292
I'm loyal t0 my parents

107
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,126
my superiors and people I respect

108
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,334
I hope that includes me

109
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:21,209
To be honest

110
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,417
there Was one instruction I did disobey

111
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,834
I left the path

112
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,209
on the Way home

113
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,834
My horse and I were surrounded

114
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,542
by a pack of Wolves

115
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:35,084
But

116
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,042
I remembered that you told me

117
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,917
Wolves were scared of the sound of steel traps

118
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,251
So

119
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,167
I banged my stirrups

120
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,667
You saved me

121
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,959
You're not entirely stupid

122
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,209
A'ba

123
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,542
Wolves fascinate me

124
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,251
I am thinking

125
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,459
in the spring

126
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,834
I would like to capture a cub

127
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,001
t0 study it

128
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,251
What

129
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:38,584
You Want t0 study Wolves?

130
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,292
Look

131
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,626
What do you think they'll do

132
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,501
What are they Waiting for

133
00:13:56,376 --> 00:14:00,292
They have been waiting for this moment for months

134
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,959
The desire t0 kill tortures them

135
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:05,584
But they

136
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:09,792
are not going to Waste it because of haste

137
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,834
How do you think Genghis Khan defeated

138
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:15,542
the great armies of the World

139
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:19,334
with so few mounted Warriors

140
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,376
He learnt the art of War by studying the Wolves

141
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,042
that you have in front of you

142
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,084
Wolves are smart

143
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,876
and organized

144
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,334
They Work together

145
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,501
and obey their leader's decision

146
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,584
More than anything else

147
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,917
they have patience

148
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,001
Life is about choosing the moment

149
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,876
Wolves and Mongols understand that

150
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:58,667
A'ba

151
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,459
Yes

152
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,042
After I escaped from the Wolf pack

153
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,209
I saw something in the sky

154
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,417
A smiling face

155
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:11,417
Of course. That was Tengger

156
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,126
Do you imagine

157
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,792
you'd still be alive without Him

158
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,251
See that?

159
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:26,084
The gazelles are too full t0 run fast

160
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,626
That's What Wolves were Waiting for

161
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,584
They are on the move

162
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,792
Look, they are about to attack

163
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,626
Look, they are about to attack

164
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,542
Get your horse. Let's go

165
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:31,876
Aren't We following them

166
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:34,834
Too far, too dangerous

167
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,626
Anyway, it will all be over

168
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,292
when We get there

169
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,751
You will see the result tomorrow

170
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,126
You see

171
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,834
the problem for us Mongols

172
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,417
is that our history

173
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,792
Wasn't Written by us

174
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,292
but mostly by our enemies

175
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:02,459
You speak Mandarin

176
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,792
Maybe one day

177
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,417
you'll Write about who We really are

178
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:09,334
I'm a reader

179
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,084
Not a Writer

180
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,001
There's a difference

181
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,334
How do you know

182
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,792
Have you ever tried

183
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,709
Look at our son

184
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:31,584
now a real man

185
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,376
Chen Zhen, follow me

186
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,126
You understand What the wolves have done

187
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,626
A great Mongol general

188
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:53,459
did exactly the same thing

189
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,667
a few centuries ago

190
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,084
Mugali drove the cavalry of the great J in Dynasty

191
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,501
into this snowdrift

192
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:01,584
They're probably

193
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,376
still buried there

194
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,042
Welcome t0 Wolves' fridge

195
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,126
They store their meat here t0 next spring

196
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,917
for their newborn

197
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,042
Take your carpet

198
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:26,209
if you don't Want to be changed into Wolf food

199
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:32,084
Be careful

200
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,751
Are you alright

201
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,584
Here is one

202
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,126
Pull hard, son

203
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,042
Pull it. Bravo

204
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:53,709
Pull. Pull

205
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:54,501
Pull it hard my son

206
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,334
Pull it hard

207
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:55,959
Bravo

208
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,959
Bayard fished one

209
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,126
I got one

210
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,001
Let's go

211
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,042
A'ba, this one is still alive

212
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,959
Let it go

213
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:22,084
If it gets stuck again

214
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,792
it Will be the Will of Tengger

215
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,376
Let go the live one

216
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,751
These gazelles are such pitiful creatures

217
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,042
Wolves are evil, killing the innocent

218
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,709
oblivious t0 the value of life

219
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:33,417
No

220
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,709
gazelles are the cruel ones

221
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,959
They eat all the grass

222
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,001
Out here, the grass is life, the Big Life

223
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,667
All else is little life

224
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,626
that depends on the Big life for survival

225
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,292
If gazelles are so horrible

226
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,042
Why do you rescue and free them

227
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:54,167
This time the Wolves killed too many

228
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,167
We have t0 keep enough gazelles

229
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:58,376
for them to eat next year

230
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,376
If not

231
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,876
they Will attack our sheep

232
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,001
To the Venerable Tribal Leader

233
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,042
When Will you marry a Mongol girl

234
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,126
and father a Mongol brat

235
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,084
Then you'll be one of us

236
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,626
Especially our beauty Gasma

237
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,001
She howls at night

238
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:22,667
What are you talking about

239
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:23,167
Bullshit

240
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,334
We can't sleep Well

241
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,292
Be quite, be quite

242
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,417
She is

243
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:28,501
the Wolf

244
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,292
and you are

245
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,667
the sheep

246
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,542
She sticks her teeth in your neck

247
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,084
Shut up! You will pay for that

248
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:38,834
You always say bullshit

249
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,542
Dare you say that again

250
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,167
I am gonna teach you a lesson

251
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,917
Batu, did I say anything wrong

252
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,209
Lamj av said the same thing too

253
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:50,626
You have t0 blame yourself

254
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,459
You deserve it

255
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,959
You such a bad guy

256
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,792
Dare you say that again

257
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,209
You deserve that

258
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,376
Help

259
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,251
A present for you

260
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,167
Here you are

261
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,042
This is Yill, it is my dog

262
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:17,626
Yill

263
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:18,459
you stole my meat

264
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:20,126
What's up

265
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:22,584
Shartseren

266
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:23,792
Let's go

267
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:24,876
Let's stay

268
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,459
We can take more gazelles tomorrow

269
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:28,959
We have enough

270
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,042
What's left is the Wolves' share

271
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:33,126
Tengger is telling us to leave

272
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,126
OK

273
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,376
We have more than enough for ourselves

274
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,792
You'd never see this much meat in the east

275
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:01,167
Have you heard of

276
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,792
the famine there

277
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,209
So Where's this big snow lake of yours

278
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,917
There's no such place

279
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,334
One hundred and twenty yuan

280
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:13,917
Yes

281
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,251
Let's go

282
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:15,834
Bye

283
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,751
I don't have enough money

284
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,042
How much you've got

285
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,042
Eight)'

286
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,459
Bring us more gazelles, then

287
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,626
and you can pay for it

288
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,584
Cheers

289
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,834
To the grassland

290
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:52,876
It is forbidden t0 say

291
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,126
Hurry, dad is Waiting us for dinner

292
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:18,959
Thank you

293
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:22,917
Huffy

294
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:26,334
Load them all

295
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,542
Pack them fast

296
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,667
Let's get out of here

297
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,501
Hurry UP

298
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,209
One, two, three

299
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,792
Looks like

300
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,209
you've settled right here

301
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,542
We like it here

302
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,001
Don't get too comfortable

303
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,959
You're here

304
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,709
t0 pass on your knowledge

305
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,292
and change these primitives

306
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,376
Your Brigade has been chosen

307
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,709
t0 look after those horses

308
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,167
It's an immense honor

309
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:01,167
It shows how much the Superior Level
put its trust in you

310
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,376
These horses

311
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,084
are the cream

312
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:07,042
of the People's Liberation Army's stables

313
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,834
They are a national treasure

314
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,959
Brigade leader

315
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:14,542
who do you think

316
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,376
could look after these horses

317
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,459
Batu, my son, will be in charge

318
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,459
He is our best herder

319
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:24,084
Shartseren Will assist him

320
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,917
Thank you

321
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:27,876
Great

322
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,876
I received this directive

323
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,167
t0 rid the w01ves's lairs of their cubs

324
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:38,126
I know

325
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,292
it is your custom

326
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:49,584
You do it every spring, don't you

327
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:54,292
The wolves' meat storage has been looted

328
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,126
They're already hungry

329
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,459
That's not my problem

330
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,042
Killing the pups

331
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,417
will make them vengeful

332
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:04,126
They will hit back

333
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,167
and hard

334
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:09,334
Killing the cubs will reduce their numbers

335
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,626
Less Wolves

336
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:14,126
will mean more ground squirrels and rabbits

337
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,459
which destroy the pastures

338
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:18,917
That's an order

339
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,959
Shout if you see a lived one

340
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,292
This one is abandoned. No puppy inside

341
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,917
Over here

342
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,542
Here is a cub

343
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:36,542
Be careful

344
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,584
So cute

345
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:41,292
Here you are

346
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,126
Bayar, look

347
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,167
There is another one

348
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:47,959
It's so cute

349
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,417
Don't kill it

350
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,626
The wolf puppy belongs to Tengger

351
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,667
Tengger is calling him

352
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:01,209
We are helping him on his Way

353
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,042
It's alright

354
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:19,834
Don't cry my son

355
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:38,501
His soul will live forever. He will never die

356
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:49,626
Tengger, this newborn is Yours

357
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,417
Tengger, please

358
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,834
accept his soul

359
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,209
I love coming here

360
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,959
Sixty centuries of history under our feet

361
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,667
Incredible

362
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,834
What a madness

363
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,542
I still don't understand

364
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:28,792
Why did We build that Great Walls
in the first place

365
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,584
For thousand years

366
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,917
millions of Han Chinese

367
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,001
were frightened

368
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,376
by a handful of unlettered Mongols

369
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,501
They ride horses

370
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,459
We go on foot

371
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:43,584
They grow on meat

372
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:44,584
We grow on rice

373
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,001
Herdsman versus farmers

374
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,584
Wolves versus sheep

375
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:51,626
A Wolf

376
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,667
She dropped the lamb t0 run faster

377
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:08,209
Where has it gone

378
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,584
Over there

379
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:17,042
For sure it's a female

380
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:18,167
that protect her litter

381
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:19,126
Right

382
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:26,751
Come out

383
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:27,376
Come out

384
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:28,167
I've got an idea

385
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,251
Where did you get these

386
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:41,792
We'll smoke her out

387
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:44,834
There is another exit

388
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,417
Bravo Yill, good dog

389
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:01,667
They are very lovely

390
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,292
Want one?

391
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:07,126
But that little female, I'll keep for myself

392
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,209
Jealous of your friend?

393
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,001
I am just thinking

394
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,959
that she-Wolf fooled us

395
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:31,626
She hided her babies

396
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:33,876
They often do this

397
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,542
They lead us t0 an old lair

398
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,834
but hide their babies elsewhere

399
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,167
It's not the right place

400
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:45,626
We have t0 look somewhere else

401
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:46,792
No

402
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:48,792
she runs away this way

403
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:57,376
Hey hey

404
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,126
What did I tell you

405
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:00,542
Here she comes

406
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:01,376
Where

407
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,584
Look, she has black legs

408
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:03,584
That's the one

409
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:12,751
Come

410
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:13,959
Look

411
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:17,876
See that

412
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,126
Food scraps

413
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:21,792
see that?

414
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,126
And cub droppings

415
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:24,917
Don't touch it

416
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:25,667
Taste it

417
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:28,417
They are inside

418
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,042
Quiet

419
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,334
I am going t0 get it

420
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,209
I am going t0 get it

421
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:32,917
Take this

422
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:34,167
What

423
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,251
Leave me alone

424
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:36,042
Not Without dogs

425
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,376
The male may be inside

426
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:39,001
You moron

427
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,917
the male never stays with the cubs

428
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,167
Let's come back tomorrow

429
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:45,126
Chen Zhen

430
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:46,792
I have to do it right now

431
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:47,626
While the she Wolf is hunting

432
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,001
Tie up my foot

433
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:51,084
Later

434
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,584
pull me out

435
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,542
Give me the flashlight

436
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,209
Quick

437
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,834
the crowbar

438
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:11,209
Chen Zhen

439
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,084
don't go further

440
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,167
If the hole collapses, I even can't save you

441
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:17,126
Chen Zhen

442
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,626
don't go further

443
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:35,959
Chen Zhen

444
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:37,209
Are you OK

445
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,251
Come out

446
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,417
H%OK

447
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,251
Chen Zhen

448
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:00,917
can you hear me

449
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,584
Chen Zhen

450
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:05,626
Pull me out

451
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,251
OK! Let me pull you out

452
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:18,959
Quickly

453
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,792
Pull me out. I got them

454
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,376
Be quick, pull me out

455
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:26,834
You're insane

456
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:32,334
Look, you see, so adorable

457
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:35,251
I told you that they were here

458
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:36,501
It's so cute

459
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,626
Hi chaps

460
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,126
How are you

461
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,667
Everyone says you city guys

462
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,042
can't catch cubs

463
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:51,334
But you did great

464
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,876
You Want t0 sell them t0 me?

465
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,417
No, no, no

466
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:00,126
Show me

467
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,459
Excellent fur

468
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,251
It's cute, isn't it

469
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:06,626
Bravo

470
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:09,959
It Will sell Well

471
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:13,042
t0 make stoles for foreign ladies

472
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,834
May your soul fly to Tengger

473
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,292
Give me the other ones

474
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,709
Give me

475
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,376
Hand me the bag

476
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,501
May your soul fly to Tengger

477
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,876
Lamj av, no

478
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,459
Chen Zhen

479
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,042
It's for their salvation

480
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,417
Tengger will grant them eternal life

481
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:07,334
You sure you don't Want to sell them to me

482
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:08,959
No

483
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,834
our brigade need them to reach our quotas

484
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:12,501
Too bad

485
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:13,959
Never mind

486
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:16,667
Be careful when you skin them

487
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,167
Don't rip the pelt

488
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,542
or it'll be Worthless

489
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,209
Why didn't you stop him

490
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:39,667
Stop him?

491
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,292
Then we'd have had to kill them ourselves

492
00:35:58,709 --> 00:35:59,334
Chen Zhen

493
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,251
What are you doing

494
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:01,626
Chen Zhen

495
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,709
the rope

496
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,084
Chen Zhen

497
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:05,292
are you insane

498
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,959
How can I pull you out if you don't have the rope

499
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,667
I've had enough

500
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,417
Stroke her, keep stroking her

501
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,709
Don't let her see the cub

502
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,626
Or she will kill it

503
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:21,667
Good

504
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,459
Good Yill

505
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,126
Good

506
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,667
Will it Work

507
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,542
How could you know if you don't even try

508
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,542
Your babies are hungry

509
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:48,876
Good Yill

510
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,792
Good. Good wolf

511
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,459
Yill, don't move

512
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,959
Good Yill

513
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:55,667
Good Wolf

514
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:56,334
Good

515
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,334
Nurse your babies

516
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:00,709
Yill

517
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,917
you are the best

518
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:05,292
Look at him

519
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,209
A real bandit

520
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,751
Do you think this is right

521
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,126
To raise a Wolf in a shepherd's village?

522
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:20,542
You should have thought about that

523
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,209
before We brought the Wolf back

524
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,292
Me?

525
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,292
As though this Whole mess Was all my idea

526
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:28,667
OK

527
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:29,626
my idea

528
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,292
My idea, alright?

529
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:32,917
It is too much of a risk

530
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,459
t0 keep it here

531
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,042
Then What do you suggest

532
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:45,792
We should do

533
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,834
What the Mongols do

534
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,209
Kill it and be done

535
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,167
Good night

536
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,376
public enemy

537
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,292
Anticipated gale force Winds coming from Siberia

538
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,376
have moved down t0 the south

539
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,501
This cold front will bring

540
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,209
moderate gale and heavy snowfalls
in the border area

541
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,376
Shartseren, the day shift need help

542
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:29,167
OK

543
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:30,417
Hold it tight

544
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,084
The White hair blizzard is coming

545
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,667
Go fast t0 the army horse pasture

546
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,376
don't let anything go Wrong

547
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,167
Give me two Winter coats for the day shift

548
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,626
Come here kid

549
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,251
Be a good boy

550
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:55,792
Yes, dad

551
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,001
Be careful

552
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,167
Got it

553
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,126
I'm gOillg

554
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,917
Anyone there

555
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:53,376
Shartseren

556
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,292
Where are you

557
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,126
Can anyone hear me

558
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:02,126
Batu

559
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,209
Shartseren

560
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:06,417
Is it you

561
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,376
<i>Are Def) and Qaokt with you</i>

562
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:12,209
What? Aren't they with you

563
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,876
You're alone?

564
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,667
Yes. Where is the day shift

565
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:20,417
I can't find them

566
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:22,334
They have no rifles nor flashlights

567
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:23,542
They might have gone back to camp

568
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:24,959
Forget it, let's steady the horses

569
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,542
My horse is out of control, fears something

570
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,167
We may have wolves around

571
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:30,876
Then we need t0 move fast

572
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:47,459
Batu, let's gather the horses together

573
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,876
t0 deter the Wolves

574
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,084
OK

575
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:03,834
Wolves!

576
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:21,959
Damned Wolves know the lake is dead ahead

577
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,501
Bastards

578
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,251
Push the lead horse t0 the east

579
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,792
Get them away from the lake

580
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,626
To the left

581
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:15,167
Wolf! Help!

582
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:16,876
Somebody comes

583
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,792
Chen Zhen, come out! Wolves come

584
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:21,334
Hurry UP

585
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:22,167
Gasma

586
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,209
Chen Zhen, stay away

587
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:28,251
Stand back or the Wolf will bite you

588
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,542
Push the sheep aside

589
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,584
to let the dog through

590
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:39,417
Here, Bars

591
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,334
Send Bars over

592
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:43,334
Gasma

593
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,959
Let the dog come

594
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,876
Mama, mama

595
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,542
Let me help you

596
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:00,167
Move

597
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:02,626
Move

598
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,751
Shartseren

599
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,834
Get up! Get up fast

600
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,792
Damn it! Go away

601
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:40,334
Go away

602
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:44,626
My horse is panicking

603
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:48,001
Batu, I can't control it

604
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,709
Batu

605
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:54,084
You damn Wolves

606
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:57,126
Go t0 hell

607
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,126
I'll kill you all

608
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:35,751
Sharsteren

609
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,751
Stop them

610
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:45,584
Stop, you dumb horses

611
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,417
Don't go toward the lake

612
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:53,292
Stop please

613
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:57,001
Tengger, help me

614
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:25,751
This is a disaster

615
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,751
Your brigade is t0 blame

616
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:37,001
I will report your

617
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,459
gross negligence and disrespect to the leaders

618
00:50:39,084 --> 00:50:40,126
You'll pay for this

619
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,917
Each of you will take responsibility

620
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,042
for failing to protect state property

621
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,292
You especially

622
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,459
Deserted your post

623
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:55,209
You will be sent t0 quarantine

624
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,042
Do you have anything t0 say

625
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:59,126
I lost control of my horse

626
00:51:00,334 --> 00:51:01,584
It was bitten by a wolf

627
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,334
And then

628
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:06,459
then I fell off

629
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:08,542
I think

630
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,334
You're here t0 Work

631
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:13,292
not t0 think

632
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:15,251
Take him away

633
00:51:20,876 --> 00:51:23,209
We are still missing two herders

634
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,167
They probably froze to death

635
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,709
and were eaten by wolves

636
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:31,792
Incompetent bunch

637
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,167
Shut up

638
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,001
Forget it

639
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:39,459
Director Bao Shungui

640
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:41,709
I must beg t0 differ

641
00:51:42,126 --> 00:51:44,126
Our brigade did the best they could

642
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:46,167
Batu fought t0 death

643
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,751
He died a hero

644
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:50,542
A hero is someone Who succeeds
to keep those horses

645
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:53,126
What kind of hero is he

646
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:54,417
What kind of hero is he

647
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:56,792
The culprits are those

648
00:51:57,876 --> 00:51:59,876
Who stole all their gazelles

649
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,542
caused the Wolves to starve

650
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:04,292
and took their revenge on us

651
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:05,292
Enough

652
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,292
Let the authorities decide who the culprits are

653
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:16,917
I'll help you

654
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:17,917
Leave him

655
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:20,876
He chose t0 get off here

656
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,209
This place is suitable

657
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:44,667
A'ba

658
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:46,584
It's too rocky

659
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:47,626
to bury him here

660
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,584
Let's find another place

661
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,917
Mongols don't bury their dead

662
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:57,084
We grasslanders eat meat all our life

663
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:00,251
for which We killed many creatures

664
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:02,917
After We die

665
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:04,834
We donate our meat

666
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:08,084
back t0 the Grassland

667
00:53:35,876 --> 00:53:37,334
I stitched it up

668
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,542
Here you are

669
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:40,709
Thank you

670
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:48,042
Yesterday

671
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:50,751
You were very brave

672
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,084
My man says

673
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:56,084
thank you

674
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,542
He told me last night in my dream

675
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:04,251
Gasma

676
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:08,084
Thanks for your dog saving my life

677
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,501
Who is this meat for

678
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:13,834
Who is this meat for

679
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,001
You were right

680
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,501
I was jealous

681
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:19,459
I took one of Yill's puppies

682
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,084
Add millet in it

683
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:24,417
Wolf mothers chew meat and bones

684
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,459
for their babies

685
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,042
We use

686
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,417
porridge with meat
and milk in it t0 feed little dogs

687
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:00,876
The authorities

688
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,417
has completed its investigation

689
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:04,251
on the army horses disaster

690
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,459
All charges

691
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:11,292
are dropped

692
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:15,167
The authorities regret

693
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:17,167
the heavy losses your brigade suffered

694
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:19,542
Batu's

695
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,376
Work points

696
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:24,084
will be transferred t0 his Widow

697
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:35,667
As head of production

698
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:36,792
I entrust Bilig

699
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,251
with taking over

700
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:45,001
Batu's duties

701
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:51,084
But I Won't tolerate any more mistakes

702
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:58,167
All charges against Batu's assistant Shartseren

703
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:01,084
are dropped as Well

704
00:56:01,834 --> 00:56:03,626
Set him free

705
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:47,626
Chen Zhen

706
00:56:48,001 --> 00:56:49,251
do it now

707
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:51,084
What

708
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:52,751
Free your Wolf cub

709
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,251
I can't free him right now

710
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:57,209
He has the smell of man now

711
00:56:57,834 --> 00:56:59,417
The pack may kill him

712
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:18,709
Chen Zhen

713
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:27,792
What's this

714
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:28,959
Open

715
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:36,584
A Wolf cub

716
00:57:37,084 --> 00:57:37,584
Chen Zhen

717
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:38,626
What's this

718
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,584
I confess

719
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:44,917
I'm raising it

720
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:46,917
This is just an experiment

721
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:02,126
Chairman Mao says:

722
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,834
Study your enemy to defeat him.

723
00:58:04,126 --> 00:58:06,251
So I thought We should observe wolves

724
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:07,126
more closely

725
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:08,501
I say No

726
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,292
We could protect our herds

727
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:12,917
by mating him with our dogs

728
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:14,792
That can't Work

729
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,376
At university

730
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:18,751
I taught the improvement of species

731
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:20,001
That is my goal

732
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,251
Bullshit

733
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,042
Chen Zhen

734
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:27,376
your idea is good

735
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:28,626
You have my approval

736
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:31,417
Director Bao

737
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:33,084
the Wolves are all over the place

738
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:34,709
They heard the cub

739
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:35,959
and will come for it

740
00:58:36,334 --> 00:58:38,584
Good! Let them come

741
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,501
Your Wolf cub

742
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,209
Will lure them

743
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:48,417
Did you hear me

744
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:49,917
Leave it alone

745
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:51,292
Get back

746
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:52,959
Go away

747
00:58:56,751 --> 00:58:58,834
This is madness

748
00:58:59,001 --> 00:58:59,751
Lamj av

749
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,167
take him away

750
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:02,209
OK, OK

751
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:03,626
Back

752
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:05,417
Hurry, go back

753
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:13,334
Hurry UP

754
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:14,709
Got it

755
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:25,167
Brothers, this is Tenggefs Will

756
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,292
Wolves Won't come tonight

757
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,876
Brothers, let's go

758
01:00:33,084 --> 01:00:34,417
Let's go

759
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,001
The little wolf doesn't speak the pack's language

760
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,709
Waste of our time. Let's go

761
01:00:40,334 --> 01:00:41,626
They Won't attack for a puppy

762
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,167
they are not sure about

763
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:49,376
Bayar

764
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:50,792
Bayar

765
01:00:51,001 --> 01:00:51,917
come here

766
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,542
Are you mad

767
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:02,334
Let's go

768
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,042
A'ba

769
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:14,459
Please forgive me

770
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:21,292
You captured a god to turn it into a slave

771
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:23,209
What you are doing is an affront

772
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:24,959
to our ancestors and t0 Tengger

773
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:28,959
You will pay one day

774
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,709
And so Will this old man

775
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,334
A'ba

776
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,001
Don't call me that

777
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:40,209
I was Wrong

778
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:42,959
You're right

779
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,209
I offended you and the Mongols

780
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,084
Tell me how do you Want me

781
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:53,667
t0 dispose of this poor little Wolf

782
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:07,709
Look

783
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:09,667
that's the border

784
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:15,084
This is

785
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:16,751
the last piece of Chinese grassland

786
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,501
that has not been plowed

787
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:21,709
the last untouched lake

788
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:42,084
As soon as lambs are strong enough

789
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,626
to make the trip

790
01:02:44,376 --> 01:02:46,209
We will set our summer camp out here

791
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,667
You say I treat my Wolf as a slave

792
01:02:51,209 --> 01:02:53,292
In fact, it is I who am his servant

793
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:56,417
I Wait on him like I Would a Mongol Prince

794
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:58,501
I give him my ration of meat

795
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:00,459
I can't sleep Well at night

796
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:03,501
I Worry about him being cold, or sick

797
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:06,959
or bitten by dogs, or carried away by an eagle

798
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:09,334
Yang Ke says I am the Wolf's slave

799
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,792
Wolves Want the dignity to earn their own meat

800
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,501
They don't Want to be fed

801
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:22,626
They want to kill at the risk of being killed

802
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:24,501
They are Warriors

803
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:27,626
What sort of Warrior will he be

804
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:28,875
if you take his pride away

805
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:30,959
if you forbid him to kill

806
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:33,084
if you teach him to fear death

807
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:35,917
A'ba

808
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:38,292
I think here is a very good place

809
01:03:38,459 --> 01:03:40,334
for the Wolf cub to live

810
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,459
Give me a few weeks

811
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:45,876
t0 grow him stronger

812
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:47,834
When We come here

813
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:50,542
I Will set him free

814
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:52,501
I promise

815
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:54,209
As the old saying goes

816
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,501
"it's easier t0 climb on the tiger's back
than to get off it"

817
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:23,417
Chen Zhen

818
01:04:23,584 --> 01:04:24,501
What's going on

819
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:25,876
Just a second

820
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:28,792
What are you doing

821
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,542
I'm getting angry

822
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:32,667
You can't stay here you know

823
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:34,042
Dogs and eagles would eat you

824
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:35,417
Understand?

825
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:37,001
Don't you understand

826
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,667
Don't be silly

827
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:42,667
You are smart

828
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:44,959
We are going t0 a great new place

829
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,542
You'll be happy there

830
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:47,542
Come on

831
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:49,251
Come on

832
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:51,001
You have...

833
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:52,376
no choice

834
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:57,459
I'm angry with you now

835
01:04:58,376 --> 01:04:59,626
Hurry UP

836
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:00,501
Go

837
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,167
Let's go

838
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,376
StOP

839
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:16,834
StOP

840
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:20,417
Stop the carts

841
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,292
What's going on

842
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:26,459
Let him go, for God's sake

843
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,501
Once and for all

844
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,126
How can he survive if I let him go

845
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:34,959
He can't hunt

846
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:37,376
What Will he eat

847
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,542
Will the Wolves accept him

848
01:05:40,584 --> 01:05:42,292
I have to take care of him

849
01:05:53,084 --> 01:05:54,042
What are you doing

850
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,251
Are you crazy

851
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:02,084
What's Wrong

852
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:03,251
We need dry dung

853
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,292
for the journey

854
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:07,251
How are We going t0 cook

855
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:08,501
I'll take care of it

856
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:12,292
I'll pick up more on the Way

857
01:06:13,834 --> 01:06:15,501
Pick up more?

858
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,459
What if it rains

859
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:21,959
What are you thinking? Let him go

860
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:23,459
I've had enough

861
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:25,792
This is my Wolf, not your Wolf

862
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:28,251
I am the one who loves him

863
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,375
You don't understand. Go away

864
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:34,917
Go away

865
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:36,626
<i>HEY</i>

866
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,292
How long didn't you eat meat

867
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,334
I don't need t0 eat meat

868
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:12,209
Is he sick

869
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:15,209
He is punishing me

870
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:54,667
Yang Ke

871
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:56,501
Look

872
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,959
Behind this mountain it is the Swan Lake

873
01:08:59,126 --> 01:09:00,126
This is the place I told you about

874
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,792
that looks like heaven

875
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:02,959
Look

876
01:09:03,251 --> 01:09:04,084
look at the swans

877
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,584
There, do you see it

878
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:56,126
Here come the nomads

879
01:09:57,834 --> 01:09:59,001
Bilig

880
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:02,501
Welcome

881
01:10:03,209 --> 01:10:05,792
I didn't think you would come here, too

882
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,126
Did you see

883
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,376
These people will be you new neighbors

884
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,667
Just like me

885
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:19,376
they're Mongols from the east

886
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:22,167
Very experienced

887
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:23,209
in farming and agriculture

888
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,917
They come here

889
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,626
because they've ruined their own land

890
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:29,751
Our soil is too thin

891
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:31,584
It's not suited for plowing

892
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:34,084
Old Bilig

893
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,709
there are people starving down east

894
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:38,459
They have no choice

895
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:39,626
but making use of lands like this one

896
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:44,751
Look, We'll build a school here

897
01:10:45,001 --> 01:10:46,042
a dispensary there

898
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:48,292
We will use traps and poison

899
01:10:48,459 --> 01:10:50,334
t0 eradicate all toxic plants

900
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:52,126
Pests, mosquitoes

901
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:54,209
rats

902
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,459
and wolves of course

903
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:56,792
and wolves of course

904
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:03,792
Stop shooting

905
01:11:05,084 --> 01:11:06,501
Stop shooting

906
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:10,042
Let's find somewhere else

907
01:11:10,209 --> 01:11:10,667
Director

908
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:12,126
t0 settle down

909
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:13,167
Director

910
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:14,459
The swans are so beautiful

911
01:11:14,626 --> 01:11:15,542
Stop the shooting,

912
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:16,876
I beg you

913
01:11:17,042 --> 01:11:19,001
Have you seen Swan Lake

914
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:31,626
What are you doing

915
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,292
Want to run away?

916
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:57,542
Don't tell me

917
01:11:57,709 --> 01:11:58,792
this one was killed by an eagle too

918
01:11:59,751 --> 01:12:00,751
No?

919
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,334
By lightning, perhaps?

920
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,501
Do you know

921
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:07,417
What our parents would do

922
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:08,917
for a piece of meat like that in Beijing

923
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:41,084
Little Wolf, time t0 eat

924
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,626
Time t0 eat

925
01:12:57,584 --> 01:12:59,167
Grow up quickly

926
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,459
You have t0 become stronger

927
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:15,959
Stronger than foxes, eagles, and Wide wolves

928
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:16,917
Got it?

929
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:25,876
Watch out

930
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:29,417
See that?

931
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:30,667
Wolf trap

932
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:32,917
Remember it when you're free

933
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:34,876
Get it?

934
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,334
Don't be afraid

935
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,251
You know you have t0 learn how t0 swim

936
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:46,126
You are a real Wolf

937
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:46,876
Come on

938
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:50,834
Bravo

939
01:13:56,459 --> 01:14:00,376
In the grassland, the mosquito season came

940
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,626
As Bilig A'ba predicted

941
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,084
mosquitoes that survived the Winter

942
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:05,626
in marmot holes

943
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:07,626
invaded the grassland

944
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,542
in larger numbers than ever

945
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,542
Cattle withered

946
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,001
Unable t0 hunt

947
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:07,959
starving and scraggy

948
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:11,417
Wolves moved closer t0 populated areas

949
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:20,584
They preyed on cattle

950
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:23,792
The new settlers retaliated

951
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,667
Where are you going

952
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:10,792
Where are you taking me

953
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:36,917
What's that

954
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:39,042
What's that smell that makes you so happy

955
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:45,751
Slowly

956
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:49,292
Slowly

957
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:50,626
What's up With you

958
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,251
Come back

959
01:16:55,792 --> 01:16:56,917
I said come back, did you hear me

960
01:16:58,126 --> 01:16:59,126
Back

961
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,417
Come back

962
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,626
You monster

963
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,501
How dare you bite me

964
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:31,667
Sorry, I am Wrong

965
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:35,334
You are a real Mongolian Wolf

966
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:40,042
I am proud of you

967
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,084
What happened

968
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:46,042
Nothing

969
01:17:49,334 --> 01:17:50,917
Your Wolf did it?

970
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:52,376
You are mad

971
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:54,167
It's 0k

972
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:55,417
Just a scratch

973
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:56,917
I told you

974
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,959
they have poison in their teeth

975
01:18:01,501 --> 01:18:02,792
They don't

976
01:18:02,959 --> 01:18:03,959
That's just superstition

977
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:05,376
You don't get it

978
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,626
How do you think Wuli lost his leg

979
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:09,334
or Bayin his arm

980
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:12,501
It's like a snake's bite

981
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:19,167
Your arm will fester and they will cut it off

982
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,917
Without a injection, you will die

983
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:32,084
I don't need your help

984
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,501
Where can I get an injection

985
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:37,751
At the hospital

986
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:41,667
But

987
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:45,709
all those new settlers are using everything up

988
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,167
Maybe there is nothing left

989
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:55,417
It Will hurt a bit

990
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:14,792
You have t0 be careful

991
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,792
Does Batu

992
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:18,834
still come in your dream

993
01:19:21,334 --> 01:19:22,876
Sometimes

994
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:30,417
Is he happier now

995
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:32,959
No

996
01:19:37,626 --> 01:19:38,876
What does he Want

997
01:19:41,084 --> 01:19:43,167
None of your business

998
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:45,001
I know one thing

999
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,042
He Wants you t0 remarry

1000
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:54,792
Nothing strange about that

1001
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,542
His son needs a father

1002
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,667
His woman needs a man

1003
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:02,376
She doesn't

1004
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:04,459
She's too busy

1005
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:09,001
He Wants you to choose me

1006
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,542
Why would he Want me t0 choose you

1007
01:20:16,584 --> 01:20:18,251
You are a Han student

1008
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:24,709
Because he knows I love you

1009
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:27,084
You know it as well

1010
01:20:27,792 --> 01:20:29,292
Maybe you feel the same

1011
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:30,417
Gasma

1012
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:31,126
Stop it

1013
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:35,126
You Won't stay

1014
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:38,542
Who said I Won't stay

1015
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,917
Your home is Beijing

1016
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:43,751
There is no future for the two of us

1017
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:45,792
Everybody knows how these things end

1018
01:20:46,376 --> 01:20:47,542
They don't know me

1019
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:49,667
Here is my real home

1020
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,709
My life before was meaningless

1021
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:54,292
What can I do

1022
01:20:54,459 --> 01:20:55,584
t0 make you trust me

1023
01:20:58,626 --> 01:20:59,626
There is no need

1024
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,584
My new man has been chosen

1025
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,084
By Whom

1026
01:21:08,334 --> 01:21:09,334
BY you?

1027
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:11,417
He is Bao shungufs brother

1028
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:17,001
Have you already met him

1029
01:21:18,334 --> 01:21:19,417
Have you

1030
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:22,876
His wife's dead

1031
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:24,792
He is a peasant

1032
01:21:25,709 --> 01:21:27,959
A Mongol from the east

1033
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,584
It will help national unity

1034
01:21:30,876 --> 01:21:32,959
Nonsense

1035
01:21:33,126 --> 01:21:34,459
If you Want national unity

1036
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:35,667
marry me

1037
01:21:36,084 --> 01:21:37,001
It's ridiculous

1038
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:37,959
Does A'ba know

1039
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,042
I am going to ask A'ba

1040
01:21:39,209 --> 01:21:40,126
He gave his approval

1041
01:21:42,084 --> 01:21:44,751
He said We should keep up with the times

1042
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,459
Lock them in the sheep pen and We can go home

1043
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:36,709
Lock the sheep

1044
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,834
Seal the door, there are wolves outside

1045
01:22:52,584 --> 01:22:56,376
Little Wolf, little Wolf, time to eat

1046
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:07,501
Eat the bowl While you're at it

1047
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:17,042
Bayar

1048
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:18,876
I am off to my shift

1049
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:20,417
Could you look after the little Wolf

1050
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:23,417
Make sure that no one bothers him, 0k?

1051
01:23:30,126 --> 01:23:31,751

01:24:26,917 --> 01:24:28,876

Let me go first

1066
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:39,709
Leave him alone

1067
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,792
Don't pull the chain

1068
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:44,126
He will bite you

1069
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:48,750
Stay away

1070
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,542
There may be either bomb or poison

1071
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:30,667
Yang Ke

1072

Yang Ke

1073
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:39,501
Why is he here so early

1074
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,751
How can I know

1075

01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:58,084
Anyone there

1081
01:25:58,251 --> 01:25:59,167

01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:00,959
No, it's not

1083
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:02,584
Hide yourself anyway

1084
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,501
Crawl. Crawl

1085
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:07,126
Yang Ke, where is my belt

Bayar has been bitten

1087
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,834
Bayar has been bitten

1088
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:16,042
By What

1089
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,417

01:26:47,167 --> 01:26:49,876
Better t0 leave them open

1094

It's urgent

1107
01:27:57,959 --> 01:28:00,126
For the others too. Just wait

1108
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:01,792
Doctor

1109
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:04,084
Doctor! Doctor

1110
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:05,667
What are you shouting for

1111
01:28:06,209 --> 01:28:06,834
Doctor

1112
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:09,501
Stop shouting

1113
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:10,251
Are you the doctor

1114
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:10,751
Stop shouting

1115
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:11,667
Are you the doctor or not

1116
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:13,251
Don't you see the operating room

1117
01:28:13,459 --> 01:28:14,417
Where is the doctor

1118
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:16,501
Go sit there and Wait

1119
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:17,292
Doctor

1120
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:18,959
I told you to go there t0 Wait

1121
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:20,126
Whose horse is biting the tree

1122
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:21,959
Hey, your horse! Go look after your horse

1123
01:28:27,959 --> 01:28:29,084
What are you doing? Wait your turn

1124
01:28:29,251 --> 01:28:30,251
Doctor, I need penicillin

1125
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:31,126
Penicillin

1126
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:32,376
What penicillin

1127
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:34,376
I don't have Penicillin

1128
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:35,959
Don't go in there

1129
01:28:36,126 --> 01:28:37,001
Don't go in there

1130
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:39,001
Why do you need penicillin

1131
01:28:39,209 --> 01:28:40,292
A child has been bitten by a Wolf

1132
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:41,501
The doctor in the county-town said that

1133
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:42,626
Without Penicillin

1134
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:43,792
the Wounds will get infected and he will die

1135
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:46,376
I rode for twenty hours to get here

1136
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:47,667
Do you have Penicillin here

1137
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:50,626
Well

1138
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:51,709
Where is the Penicillin

1139
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:53,084
Stop that

1140
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:54,876
You Won't find Penicillin here

1141
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:56,584
Alright

1142
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,417
Wolf teeth, Wolf claws

1143
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:01,292
and

1144
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:04,584
Wolf heart, Wolf kidney

1145
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,251
Can you get me those things

1146
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:07,834
Then we could make a deal

1147
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:10,501
I just Want Penicillin

1148
01:29:11,126 --> 01:29:12,459
Then it's a deal

1149
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:16,126
Give me Penicillin

1150
01:31:35,459 --> 01:31:38,792
Wolves are attacking the sheep pen

1151
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:07,251
Let's go kill the Wolves

1152
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:23,959
Chen Zhen. Come out

1153

Anyone there

1157
01:32:41,584 --> 01:32:41,959
Chen Zhen

1158
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:44,292
Come out

1159
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:45,959
What are you doing

1160
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:48,626
Come out

1161
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:49,876
What is going on here

1162
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:51,126
Come out

1163
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:54,501
Where is your Wolf-loving friend

1164
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:56,459
He is not here, he went to town

1165
01:32:56,626 --> 01:32:57,917
That was five days ago

1166
01:32:58,459 --> 01:32:59,209
Why's he not back

1167
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:00,542
I don't know

1168
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:01,959
There was an emergency

1169
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:02,834
It is your Wolf cub

1170
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:03,667
who called the flying Wolves t0 attack

1171
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:05,959
What's flying Wolf

1172
01:33:06,126 --> 01:33:07,209
Wolves don't fly

1173
01:33:07,376 --> 01:33:07,959
They do

1174
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,001
My grandpa saw it With his own eyes

1175
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,126
That's right

1176
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:12,792
It's not here

1177
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:13,751
Then where is it

1178
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,251
Tell me the truth

1179
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:17,584
Where did you hide the Wolf cub

1180
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:18,709
He's on his chain

1181
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:22,042
Let's go

1182
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:23,459
He's been on his chain

1183
01:33:29,376 --> 01:33:30,584
You damn Wolf

1184
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:32,500
Get away from it! Drop the chain

1185
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:35,209
Move, move your ass

1186
01:33:36,959 --> 01:33:37,459
Don't beat it

1187
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:38,459
Beat the Wolf Beat the Wolf

1188
01:33:41,834 --> 01:33:42,876
StOP

1189
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:53,251
What is going on here

1190
01:33:53,417 --> 01:33:54,667
I'll kill you

1191
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:56,501
What's all this

1192
01:33:56,959 --> 01:33:57,584
Let it go

1193
01:33:57,751 --> 01:33:59,292
Wolves massacred our sheep

1194
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:00,251
Idiots

1195
01:34:01,209 --> 01:34:03,459
It's the Wild Wolves

1196
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:04,626

1197

Are you alright

1200
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:21,584
Where is Bilig

1201
01:34:22,126 --> 01:34:24,292
He is not well, he's been injured

1202
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:37,417
A'ba

1203
01:34:38,876 --> 01:34:41,209

Chen Zhen

1206
01:34:47,959 --> 01:34:52,626
It's important to keep one's appointment

1207
01:34:54,751 --> 01:34:59,792
I have heard Tengger a lot recently

1208
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:02,126
He's calling me

1209
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,792
Don't be silly

1210
01:35:05,959 --> 01:35:07,209
We are going to hunt Wolves

1211
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:09,959
Revenge for you

Your Wounds will be recovered soon

1213

Chen Zhen

1214
01:35:20,126 --> 01:35:21,251
I have to talk t0 you

1215
01:35:25,084 --> 01:35:28,501

1216
01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:29,959

1219
01:35:45,126 --> 01:35:46,126
Don't be afraid

1220
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:49,917
The bad guys are gone, promised

1221
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:51,876
They won't bother you anymore

1222
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,709
I'll be right back

1223
01:36:19,209 --> 01:36:20,376
Get in

1224
01:36:22,626 --> 01:36:24,209
The grass is too tall here

1225
01:36:24,376 --> 01:36:26,709
Why did you bring us here

1226
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:28,584
Go north, that way

1227
01:36:29,584 --> 01:36:31,667
Did you do it on purpose

1228
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:34,209
to stop us finding the Wolves

1229
01:36:34,376 --> 01:36:36,792
Most of them have already been killed

1230
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,876
Our jeeps make too much noise anyway

1231
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:39,959
Maybe We should

1232
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:40,834
Look

1233
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,167
On the hillside t0 the left!
Two Wolves, over there

1234
01:36:42,334 --> 01:36:43,167
Try t0 follow them

1235
01:36:43,709 --> 01:36:45,417
Stay parallel

1236
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:50,876
Ready

1237
01:36:51,959 --> 01:36:52,751
Fire

1238
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:05,792
Two down

1239
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:09,126
It is just a start

1240
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:10,126
Let's go

1241
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:12,542
Go fast! Go!

1242
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:28,876
There! Take the pack down slope

1243
01:37:49,584 --> 01:37:51,917
This is an old couple. They Won't go far

1244
01:38:09,834 --> 01:38:11,126
The wolf jumped

1245
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:12,751
What the

1246
01:38:26,584 --> 01:38:28,876
Their fur is Worthless

1247
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,626
Better die than get skinned

1248
01:38:52,667 --> 01:38:55,042
Mom, is it healing

1249
01:39:01,834 --> 01:39:04,001
It's alright, it's fine

1250
01:39:07,876 --> 01:39:11,209
Mom, then Why are you crying

1251
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:44,001
<i>Bring the jetty can</i>

1252
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:45,626
Bartel, come

1253
01:39:46,959 --> 01:39:48,167
Block their escape t0 the West

1254
01:39:49,959 --> 01:39:50,626
This Way

1255
01:39:52,167 --> 01:39:53,459
Don't let them escape

1256
01:39:53,626 --> 01:39:55,542
Go! Spill the fuel

1257
01:39:57,751 --> 01:39:58,792
StOP

1258
01:39:59,042 --> 01:39:59,959
StOP

1259
01:40:00,126 --> 01:40:01,542
Fire is forbidden in the steppe

1260
01:40:02,876 --> 01:40:04,167
So are Wolves

1261
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,542
The nomads will hate you

1262
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:13,417
They hate me anyway

1263
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:16,667
Even more so

1264
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,834
since I helped you

1265
01:40:20,084 --> 01:40:21,792
keep your Wolf

1266
01:40:24,251 --> 01:40:25,501
Being a leader

1267
01:40:26,001 --> 01:40:27,876
is not about being liked

1268
01:40:29,126 --> 01:40:31,876
Sometimes, you have t0 obey orders

1269
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:34,126
that your heart resents

1270
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:50,001
Save your bullet

1271
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:51,251
their fur is Worthless anyway

1272
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:07,292
The pack leader

1273
01:41:10,667 --> 01:41:12,209
Don't shoot

1274
01:41:12,376 --> 01:41:14,001
Don't shoot

1275
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,959
We need his fur intact

1276
01:41:16,626 --> 01:41:18,959
Without holes

1277
01:41:19,584 --> 01:41:21,251
Try t0 exhaust it

1278
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:23,876
Good, good

1279
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:28,209
I need it alive, don't be rush

1280
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:33,501
Bravo

1281
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:41,417
Go faster

1282
01:41:43,084 --> 01:41:45,751
No shooting

1283
01:41:50,251 --> 01:41:51,542
How long has it been running

1284
01:41:51,917 --> 01:41:53,251
About 38 kilometers

1285
01:41:53,959 --> 01:41:57,001
It will be done soon

1286
01:42:36,001 --> 01:42:37,209
Now What

1287
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:48,251
Chen Zhen

1288
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:49,959
Chen Zhen. Come back

1289
01:42:50,459 --> 01:42:51,667
Have you lost your mind

1290
01:42:54,834 --> 01:42:55,834
Chen Zhen

1291
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:02,959
Chen Zhen

1292
01:43:04,459 --> 01:43:05,167
Come back

1293
01:43:17,084 --> 01:43:19,501
You spared my life a year ago

1294
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:24,500
Go away

1295
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:29,251
Quickly

1296
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:31,417
They can't follow you

1297
01:43:31,959 --> 01:43:33,501
in those rocks

1298
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:34,917
Go away

1299
01:44:41,584 --> 01:44:43,167
Leave it here

1300
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:47,584
He belongs to Tengger

1301
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:54,001
Do What he says

1302
01:45:31,334 --> 01:45:32,834
I fed your Wolf

1303
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:34,084
His appetite is good

1304
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:34,751
Let's unload these dead Wolves

1305
01:45:35,584 --> 01:45:36,917
How is Bayar

1306
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:38,542
Fine

1307
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:41,751
But A' ba is not good

1308
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:04,334
The wolves are all dead

1309
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:08,292
Serf)'

1310
01:46:10,751 --> 01:46:12,001
Not all of them

1311
01:46:12,417 --> 01:46:15,334
Yours is still alive

1312
01:46:54,834 --> 01:46:56,751
I promised A'ba

1313
01:46:56,917 --> 01:46:58,459
I'd set the cub free

1314
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:00,834
The hunt is over

1315
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:04,251
It's the best time of the year

1316
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:07,251
He'll be safe

1317
01:47:07,667 --> 01:47:09,167
in the Northern range mountains

1318
01:47:11,126 --> 01:47:12,959
I have to do it

1319
01:47:13,334 --> 01:47:15,084
Because I love him

1320
01:47:16,334 --> 01:47:18,959
But I lack courage

1321
01:47:20,084 --> 01:47:21,167
Little Wolf

1322
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:23,792
Little Wolf, time t0 eat

1323
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:34,334
I'm sorry, I'm late today

1324
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:39,709
Little Wolf

1325
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:45,126
Little Wolf

1326
01:47:53,126 --> 01:47:54,251
Little Wolf

1327
01:47:55,667 --> 01:47:56,709
Little Wolf

1328
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:32,126
Where's little wolf

1329
01:48:34,292 --> 01:48:35,584
I returned him

1330
01:48:37,084 --> 01:48:38,126
to the grassland

1331
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:41,209
You killed him?

1332
01:48:41,376 --> 01:48:42,417
I should have

1333
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:45,501
But I couldn't

1334
01:48:48,334 --> 01:48:50,084
I freed it

1335
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:54,626
You had no right

1336
01:48:55,042 --> 01:48:56,042
He is my wolf

1337
01:48:56,459 --> 01:48:58,126
He is Tenggefs Wolf

1338
01:49:00,459 --> 01:49:01,876
I owned Him

1339
01:49:02,042 --> 01:49:03,084
a life

1340
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:05,917
Two actually

1341
01:49:06,084 --> 01:49:07,084
Two actually

1342
01:49:32,292 --> 01:49:34,167
Bayar is saved then

1343
01:49:35,501 --> 01:49:38,209
Almost healed, it's a miracle

1344
01:49:45,376 --> 01:49:48,626
It's the power of modern medicine

1345
01:49:49,084 --> 01:49:51,001
it's the future

1346
01:49:54,209 --> 01:49:56,001
You Han people

1347
01:51:37,417 --> 01:51:39,167
With Bilig's death

1348
01:51:40,626 --> 01:51:43,834
it Was the grassland I knew
and I loved that was dying

1349
01:51:45,834 --> 01:51:46,751
Time had come for me

1350
01:51:47,792 --> 01:51:50,751
to become again

1351
01:51:51,542 --> 01:51:55,126
the young city man I'd never ceased to be

1352
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:22,917
Little Wolf

1353
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:25,542
Little Wolf

1354
01:54:07,542 --> 01:54:09,542
The memory of the little Wolf
haunted Chen Zhen forever

1355
01:54:10,959 --> 01:54:12,959
He devoted his life to Write a book

1356
01:54:14,042 --> 01:54:16,042
in the hope that the Wolves' long-songs
will be once again

1357
01:54:17,834 --> 01:54:19,834
over the restored splendor of Mongolians grassland
