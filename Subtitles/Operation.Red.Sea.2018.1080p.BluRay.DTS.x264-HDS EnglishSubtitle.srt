2
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:07,708
Quick! To the safe room!

3
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,542
Run and you're dead!

4
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,500
We want hostages, not dead bodies!

5
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,208
Open up or we'll kill you!

6
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,333
Hurry! I can't hold on much longer!

7
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,125
<i>Mayday! mayday!

8
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,833
This is Chinese merchant ship, Guangdong.

9
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,333
<i>We're under pirates attack!
We're under pirates attack!

10
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,417
They're coming up!

11
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>This is the Chinese Navy.

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,958
<i>Stop the ship immediately!

13
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,625
<i>This is the Chinese Navy.

14
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,167
<i>Stop the ship immediately!

15
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,458
<i>Captain.

16
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,792
<i>Jiaolong Unit One and Unit Two
are near the hostage area.

17
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:00,667
<i>Jiaolong Unit Three is in the engine room
trying to stop the ship.

18
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,417
<i>Alpha position, report your situation.

19
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:08,667
<i>Reporting. There are 3 pirates
and 15 hostages on the bridge.

20
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,917
<i>Beta position, report your situation.

21
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,292
Canteen target locked. Over.

22
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,625
Reporting. They disabled the fuel valves.

23
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,417
<i>We can't turn off the fuel supply.

24
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,625
<i>I'll cut the power and stop the ship.

25
00:03:59,042 --> 00:03:59,917
<i>Captain, Commissar.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,375
They picked up the speed!

27
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,917
How much time is left?

28
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,000
Sir.

29
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,333
The ship is traveling at 23 knots.

30
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,583
At this speed,

31
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,833
we'll be in Somalian waters in 15 minutes.

32
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,583
Captain.

33
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,125
We must not enter territorial waters.

34
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,000
Rui Yang,

35
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,958
you have ten minutes.

36
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,667
Attention, everyone.

37
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,750
For the hostages' safety, attack as one.

38
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,250
Wait for the orders. Over.

39
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,167
Left flank, roger.

40
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,333
Sniper's hide.

41
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,542
<i>Roger.

42
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,083
<i>Can you get a fix on them?

43
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,208
<i>If not,

44
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,292
<i>we'll start the attack in three minutes.

45
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,792
Captain.

46
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:42,250
We'll report in two minutes. Over.

47
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,375
Dong Li.

48
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,292
What's our opening like?

49
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,833
The ship is rolling,
the direction is unsteady.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,958
Headwinds at 45-55.

51
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,667
<i>For a reliable line of fire,

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,583
<i>we need to be within 120 to 150 meters.

53
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,958
<i>At 23 knots,

54
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,167
<i>we'll have an optimal position

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,583
for only three seconds,

56
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,958
or we have a risk of collision.

57
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,375
<i>Seabird One, all clear?

58
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,375
All clear.

59
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,375
Captain.

60
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,083
We'll attack in ten seconds.

61
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,000
Over.

62
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,125
Standby.

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,125
Attack!

64
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,292
There is no changes.

65
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,208
Northwest wind.

66
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,333
The velocity is 20.8.

67
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,417
The time is three seconds.

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,458
<i>Data steady.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,875
<i>Steady.

70
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,500
<i>Steady.

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,208
<i>Steady.

72
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,167
Down! Everyone down!

73
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>Captain, the hostages are safe,

74
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,708
<i>but we can't stop the ship.

75
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,417
Reporting. If the ship still doesn't stop,

76
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,167
we'll have to abandon the ship
in five minutes.

77
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,958
Hong Xu, report your situation.

78
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,125
They have the generator.

79
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,458
We're running out of time.

80
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,042
We need to storm in
and blow up the hydraulics.

81
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,333
<i>If the ship doesn't stop,

82
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,375
<i>everyone must leave the ship
in five minutes.

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,458
Give me the shield!

84
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,250
You two stay here.

85
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:04,625
Shitou,

86
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
come with me!

87
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,125
Up there. One.

88
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,208
Ready to blow up the hydraulics!

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,208
<i>Captain, the hostage-taker
is escaping on a boat!

90
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,042
Captain!

91
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,458
I'll chase him.

92
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,458
No, Xing Luo!

93
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,833
There are too many of them.

94
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:19,917
It's too dangerous!

95
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,792
We can't let him go!

96
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,792
All right.

97
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,083
Permission granted,

98
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,083
but be careful.

99
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,667
Don't cross into territorial waters.

100
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,083
I promise I'll get him
before we cross into territorial waters.

101
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,708
Jiaolong Unit Two.

102
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,083
Board the ship and arrest them!

103
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,292
Captain, Commissar.

104
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,208
Three pirate boats are approaching!

105
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:10,667
<i>Xing Luo.

106
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,500
<i>We must maintain
a 300-meters safe distance.

107
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,167
Seabird One!

108
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,375
You can't go any further.

109
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,375
Stop now!

110
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,167
<i>Roger.

111
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,958
Give me one more chance!

112
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,583
Pull up the plane!

113
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,792
<i>Dong Li.

114
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,417
<i>You should handle the others!

115
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,667
<i>Steady!

116
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:11,792
<i>Sea One and Two.

117
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,958
<i>The target has stopped.

118
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,417
<i>Arrest them, I'll cover you!

119
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,750
<i>Sea One and Two copy that!

120
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,333
I got it!

121
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,750
Xing Luo!

122
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,750
<i>Man down!

123
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,167
<i>Repeating. Man down!

124
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,417
Who? Who was shot?

125
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,375
<i>Xing Luo. It's Xing Luo.

126
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,708
<i>Captain, Commissar.

127
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,333
<i>The pirates are in custody.

128
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,208
Xing Luo is safe.

129
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:19,625
His condition is stable.

130
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,917
But

131
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,667
he has to stay in Djibouti
to get treatment.

132
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,583
Don't worry.

133
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,792
Get some rest.

134
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,125
Captain.

135
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,542
Have you told them?

136
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,792
Yes.

137
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,917
Except that

138
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,125
it pierced his spinal nerve.

139
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't tell them that.

140
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,667
Rui.

141
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,792
Have you heard this?

142
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,833
A soldier should know about sacrifice.

143
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,500
And that he may never return.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,667
They should understand the soldiers' duty.

145
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,958
You can tell them the truth.

146
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,542
You're the captain, not their parent.

147
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,875
Don't take all of this personally

148
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,625
or the stress will kill you.

149
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,417
I can't help it. It's my responsibility.

150
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,000
ONE WEEK LATER

151
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,083
Bye-bye.

152
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,708
This is our target. William Parsons.

153
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,750
He is the head of development
at an energy company in Yewaire.

154
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,750
His department works on
the mining of uranium

155
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,833
and obtaining yellowcake
in foreign countries.

156
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:22,750
That's why we couldn't figure out
where the yellowcake came from.

157
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,625
October, 2014.

158
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,583
The month he was investigated.

159
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,583
That was the same time
the unmarked yellowcake was smuggled in.

160
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,917
Exactly.

161
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,042
My guy says that William still has access
to an abundant amount of yellowcake.

162
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,958
And he has just acquired the technology
to make 30 bombs.

163
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,250
The situation in Yewaire is tense.

164
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,250
If that yellowcake is still there,

165
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,500
he wants to finish the deal
and get rid of it.

166
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,708
We must follow this lead.

167
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,292
There is another report on William

168
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,667
about a sexual abuse case of a young girl.

169
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,917
Okay? And all evidence points to him.

170
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,542
My guy talked to the girl and she said

171
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,417
William never took off his necklace

172
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,958
because he said it contains a secret

173
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,958
that would turn the world into chaos.

174
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:22,792
I've got it.

175
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,958
I'm going straight there.

176
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,125
And tomorrow morning,

177
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,333
Abu will publish a full-page report.

178
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,125
Let's do something to sabotage their plan.

179
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,958
Don't take this any further.

180
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,000
You already know

181
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,000
the terrorists are onto you.

182
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,083
So what?

183
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,792
It's not about scaring you,

184
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,875
nor it is about you being scared.

185
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,833
Albert, you know better than anyone

186
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,042
why I left those big newspapers.

187
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,333
It's because they always do
selective reporting

188
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,375
and covered up the truth!

189
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,458
- When you hired me, you said--
- No!

190
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,792
- I have the guts to go expose the truth.
- No!

191
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,083
- That's why I'm here!
- No!

192
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,042
I appreciate your tenacity,

193
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,667
but there are limits.

194
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,333
Did you forget what you stand for?

195
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,667
<i>I definitely won't risk

196
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,417
the lives of my staff!

197
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,875
But there are things that are
more important than life.

198
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,417
At 0300 hours this morning,

199
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,583
the Foreign Ministry sent
an urgent message.

200
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,875
Five days ago,
there was a coup in Yewaire.

201
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,500
By order of
the Central Military Commission,

202
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,875
the Naval Command appoints us

203
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,542
to head to Yewaire immediately

204
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,542
and evacuate all Chinese citizens.

205
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:33,792
It has been five days since the civil war
broke out in the Republic of Ihwea.

206
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,292
And the insurgence played
by General Sharaf

207
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,833
have already seized
the Republic's major cities.

208
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,542
Our footage shows that large
groups of citizens and expats

209
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,625
are fleeing the war zone.

210
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,750
In addition, sources claim
that many people were missing

211
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,667
or abducted during the civil war

212
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,542
including expats and high-level officials

213
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,583
of the Ihwea government.

214
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,292
And is is expected to be

215
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,333
an act by the country's
extremist group Zaka.

216
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,000
This group, Zaka,
has been spreading terrorism

217
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,833
in the bid for recognition.

218
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,583
For the past two years,

219
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,333
<i>they joined other extremist groups

220
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,417
across Europe and Asia
and get into action.

221
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,917
During this coup,

222
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,667
Zaka has supported

223
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,833
General Sharaf who also known as Madman.

224
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,625
<i>According to the list given by
the Foreign Ministry,

225
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,833
<i>we need to evacuate
a total of 130 Chinese citizens

226
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,875
<i>and 30 foreign staff of Chinese companies.

227
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,250
<i>Linyi is to sail for Yewaire.

228
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,458
<i>The other ships will return home.

229
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,833
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

230
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,375
Let's go.

231
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,708
<i>Listen up!

232
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,417
<i>For this mission,

233
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,167
<i>we'll break into small teams.

234
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,042
<i>We can't carry much ammunition.

235
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,583
<i>The local army

236
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,125
<i>will supply materials.

237
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,625
<i>But their weapons and calibers

238
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>are different from ours.

239
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,417
<i>So we'll be using defensive weapons

240
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,167
<i>from the EU.

241
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,583
Did you touch my candy?

242
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,333
So they've sent us Shun Gu.

243
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,417
I heard he's pretty arrogant.

244
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,000
See for yourself.

245
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,625
Captain!

246
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,417
Sniper Shun Gu is reporting.

247
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:21,625
Welcome.

248
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,458
- Dong Li!
- Present!

249
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,417
Come here.

250
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,792
Meet Xing Luo's replacement.

251
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm the spotter, Dong Li.

252
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,708
I'm Shun Gu.

253
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,500
Captain.

254
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,583
We have a special mission.

255
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,792
They need us now.

256
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,125
Right.
You should introduce him to the rest.

257
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,375
Yes, sir!

258
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,208
If you were Xing Luo's spotter,

259
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,792
you must know your stuff.

260
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,875
I look forward

261
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,167
to seeing that.

262
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,583
The feeling is mutual.

263
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,292
You'll have your chance.

264
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,125
Listen, when the troop comes to take
Dr. William and the others,

265
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,083
I'll stop them and you will
take care of the rest.

266
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
You got it?

267
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:15,458
You got it?

268
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,333
Yeah, yes. I got it. Relax.

269
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,958
<i>Stop pushing me, Doctor.

270
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,583
<i>Look at the news.
The military is everywhere.

271
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,375
<i>And the chaos, it is everywhere.

272
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm not in the mood to hear any excuses.

273
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,458
You took the money,
now the job is to have it done.

274
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,625
You promised me one week.

275
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,208
So the shipment must be on the plane.

276
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,917
If it's not, I'm not the only one
who's going to be in trouble.

277
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,833
You are the General.

278
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,625
And I'm sure that you can handle
this situation.

279
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:10,167
<i>Consul He, the third group
has reached the port.

280
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,292
<i>Dr. Lu.

281
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,667
<i>Consul He.

282
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,833
Hello.

283
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,500
Where's your wife?

284
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,750
Her company is doing the evacuation.

285
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,208
How is it going over there?

286
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,250
You can't even imagine.

287
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,625
I rushed here in panic,

288
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't even know where my phone is.

289
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,708
- Call her now.
- Thank you.

290
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>Hello?

291
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,375
<i>- Mei?</i>
- Why didn't you pick up?

292
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,500
I was so worried!

293
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,958
<i>Don't worry, we're at the consulate.

294
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:39,875
How is it over there?

295
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,042
<i>Are you there with Xuan-xuan?

296
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,167
Yes, don't worry.

297
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,208
- Let me talk to her.
<i>- Make sure Xuan-xuan is with you.

298
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,083
- Consul He wants a word.
- Mei Deng?

299
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,125
It's Qing-liu He.

300
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,417
<i>What's your plan over there?

301
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,542
Hello, Consul He.

302
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,500
Government troops are coming

303
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,708
to coordinate our evacuation.

304
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,958
<i>Remember to keep in touch.

305
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:56,875
I know.

306
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,333
I'll call as soon as the troops arrive.

307
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:02,083
The situation could change so fast,
and that's not under my control or yours.

308
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:06,375
Yes, I'm using all of my resources
to settle this issue.

309
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,875
You have to trust me.

310
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,042
<i>Captain, Commissar.

311
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,208
<i>We have permission to enter the port!

312
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,083
- Battle-ready deployment grade two!
- Yes, sir!

313
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,917
That's our warship!

314
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,958
It's here!

315
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,000
Captain.

316
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,958
We have a new situation in Yewaire.

317
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,917
There is an assassination attempt
on the President.

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,583
The Chief Secretary Mohadi
has taken charge for now.

319
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,667
Their government is asking us

320
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,750
to take his family to safety.

321
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,292
Our superior has agreed

322
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,167
and given Linyi this duty.

323
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
Understood.

324
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,708
I'll check the security.

325
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:35,958
<i>Consul!

326
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,250
We've got everyone.

327
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,125
- How about the escort?
- They're here.

328
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,583
We'll leave straight away.

329
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:41,833
- Go tell them!
- Okay.

330
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,167
Get your bags quickly.

331
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,333
We're leaving now!

332
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:45,375
Quick!

333
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:59,083
The Chinese consul has left.

334
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,542
Let's go!
Let's force them into the war zone!

335
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,458
Hey, get down.

336
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,917
Shit, it's Zaka.

337
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,375
Zaka is coming! They've killed the guards!

338
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,250
Run! Hide yourselves!

339
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,250
Just push through!

340
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,667
Inform the army vehicle at the back
to overtake

341
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,750
and let the consul's vehicle
follow their back.

342
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,167
The convoy is in the war zone.

343
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,375
Reverse! Quick!

344
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,542
Hurry, reverse!

345
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,083
There are rebels behind us.

346
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,792
Contact the warship now!

347
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:37,917
Set up a defensive line!

348
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,417
Stay there, get down!

349
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,417
Don't let them trap us!

350
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,833
We need to hide, quick!

351
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,542
Everyone, get down from the car now!

352
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,375
- Hurry!
- Don't panic, one at a time!

353
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,333
Hurry!

354
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,750
Quick, quick!

355
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,375
Take the consul!

356
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,625
Consul, hurry!

357
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,792
The consul and others went into a factory.

358
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,167
Captain.

359
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,208
Rui Yang speaking.

360
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:45,083
<i>Consul Qing-liu He just sent an SOS.

361
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:48,250
<i>His convoy was ambushed.

362
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,125
<i>Yewaire can't spare any troops,

363
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,750
<i>but we have their permission to go in.

364
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,083
<i>They'll clear the roads out of the port.

365
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,250
Listen up, everyone.

366
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,542
<i>We can't get to the factory by road,

<i>What? We lost the Fifth Road?

375
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,750
<i>No, don't go by Lafayette.

Not yet.

<i>Find him! He's the key.

Base, we're on the factory roof.

394
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,250
Unit One is in!

395
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:03,000
If you stop, the kids will die!

396
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,083
Crash into them!

397
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:08,000
Or I'll blow their brains out!

398
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,667
Do you think I'm kidding?

399
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,167
See this? If you stop, they will be dead.

400
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,958
Go on, blow them up!

401
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:17,250
I understand!

402
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,083
Sniper in position.

403
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,417
It's a car bomb! Stop it!

404
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,000
Everyone, take cover!

405
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,792

- Hurry up!
- This is the fastest I can go.

412

Chinese military police!

417
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,792
- Chen Lu, check his wounds.
- Yes, sir!

Grenade!

425

There are two in the room
and one is outside!

426
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,708
Li Tong! Let them taste hell!

427
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,083
One down!

428
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,375
Watch out! Bazooka!

429
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,625

430
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,375

432
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,500
Shitou!

433
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,208
Come on, go!

439
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,333
Watch out, it is suspected that
there is a car bomb at 12 o'clock!

440
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,458
Quick, get in!

441

<i>Unit One! Hurry! There is a car bomb!

442
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,417
Stop the car!

443
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:24,042
Don't kill me! Don't shoot!

444
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,417
I'm not with them! They forced me!

445
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,708
He's not with Zaka! Lower your weapons!

446
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:31,333
What's wrong?

447
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:35,458
Those terrorists.
They've been bombing civilians.

448
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll handle it.

449
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,292
Tell your men to stay calm.

450
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,083
Shitou! Take my position.

451
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,250
Sniper's hide.

452
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,208
I read you.

453
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,917
<i>- Cover me. I'm going to that car.</i>
- Roger.

454
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:08,958
Relax, it's okay. It's okay.

455
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:23,292
Don't move.

456
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,958
American, please. Save my kid.

457
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,333
My kid, please.

458
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:27,875
Let's go.

459
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:29,375
Please.

460
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,917
We're coming out!

461
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,500
Tian-de Zhang, move out!

462
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,333
Quick, move out!

463
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:43,042
Sniper's hide! Move out!

464
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,708
Roger! Moving out!

465
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,667
Abu, are you okay?

466
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,458
I...

467
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,875
I will get his necklace first.

468
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,458
<i>We just received news
from The Foreign Ministry.

469
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:06,958
A French-Chinese reporter

470
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,375
called Nan Xia

471
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,167
contacted their 12308 hotline.

472
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,958
<i>She said she saw Zaka

473
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:16,375
kidnapping the staff of an energy company,

474
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,208
including a Chinese citizen, Mei Deng.

475
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:20,833
Is that reliable info?

476
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,875
We made contact with Nan Xia

477
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,250
and confirmed her identity.

478
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,083
The Yewaire government will help.

479
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,042
<i>They'll supply ground and air support

480
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,417
<i>for the joint rescue mission.

481
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,750
<i>Our mission this time

482
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,833
<i>is to give a message to all terrorists

483
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>that you can never harm a Chinese citizen.

484
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:38,958
<i>Unit Two,

485
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,625

<i>We'll send in the materials, supplies,

<i>- and wingsuits.</i>
- Yes, sir!

490
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:57,500
When he asked me to save his kids,

491
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,583
I felt awful.

492
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:01,667
We saved their lives,

493
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:03,917
but not their homes.

494
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,875
This country of theirs

495
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,917
is in such a mess.

496
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,375
At most, we complete our mission

497
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,750
and that's it.

498
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,958
Why do you like candy so much?

499
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:24,167
You still don't know after all this time?

500
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,000
I was a naughty kid.

501
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,083
I always got spanked.

502
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,292
But each time,

503
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,833
my mom gave me a candy.

504
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:31,208
So even now,

505
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:32,125
when I'm on a mission,

506
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,083
if I have candy,

507
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,375
I can handle anything.

508
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,292
What was that for?

509
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:40,875
Didn't you say

510
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,792
if you have candy, there is no pain?

511
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,750
Do you know Xing Luo and I were rivals?

512
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,083
Yes.

513
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:58,083
You guys were fighting for a spot
in a sniper training camp

514
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:00,292
at a commando school in Venezuela.

515
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,958
There's only one spot for Jiaolong.

516
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,833
It's a pity.

517
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,583
There is no chance to compete now.

518
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,667
He was the best sniper I ever saw.

519
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,708
Were you always like this?

520
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:16,958
Like what?

521
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,208
Tense.

522
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,833
Shaky under pressure.

523
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,333
On the battlefield,

524
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:25,667
you can't dodge bullets.

525
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,625
Take this as a free lesson for you.

526
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,917
Next time, I'll ask for fees.

527
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,333
Captain, we received news.

528
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,583
Yewaire can't spare any choppers.

529
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,708
We'll have to escort the convoy

530
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,750
of civilian evacuees by road.

531
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:47,375
If we go by road,

532
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,875
it'll take twice as long.

533
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,917
I worry they won't get back in time.

534
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,417
Get me Jiaolong Unit One.

535
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,333
Yes, sir!

536
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,625
Nan Xia's phone

537
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:02,042
was last found in the Northeast.

538
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,625
According to the Yewaire authorities,

539
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,250
there's a town there called Basem.

540
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,708
Zaka took over it

541
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:10,083
<i>a week ago.

542
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:13,792
<i>Go to the Yewaire Army Meeting Point.

<i>Follow the evacuation convoy.

544
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,167

<i>to rescue Mei Deng.

546
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,167

547
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,500
The operation is confirmed.

548
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,292
But we only have three hours.

549
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:27,500
We'll be deep in enemy territory.

550
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,458
But we don't have
any reliable Intel until now.

551
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,083
Only one thing is certain.

552
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,167
It will be a tough battle.

553
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,958
I want each of you

554
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:43,667
to give it your all

555
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,542
and return safely.

556
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:49,667
Do you understand?

557
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,667
Yes, sir!

558
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,667
Move now!

559
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,542
Sayyid.

560
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,750
The Chief Secretary's wife is at the port.

561
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,667
The Chinese hostage
is our bargaining chip.

562
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,875
But they won't give in easily.

563
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:22,917
<i>Stay there and observe everything.

564
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,125
There are three trucks on the hill.

565
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,375
Two are armed.

566
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm not sure about the third.

567
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,917
- When did they appear?
- Three minutes ago.

568
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,583
Prepare the auxiliary gun.

569
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:51,792
Yes, sir!

570
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,125
Thank you.

571
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,083
I understand. But I have to go to Basem.

572
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,542
It's not just to save my assistant.

573
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,208
There's something very important

574
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,708
I have to do there.

575
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,375
I'm sorry, Ms. Xia.

576
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,750
We can't take you with us.

577
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,417
We don't know the situation there. Right?

578
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,917
Captain Yang,
can you let me explain first?

579
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,083
Okay.

580
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:49,125
Hong Xu, get them moving. Quick.

581
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,708
It's about the black-market yellowcake.

582
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,917
Zaka has William Parsons,

583
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,292
the biggest dealer in the market.

584
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,292
We found out

585
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,208
that he's in touch with terrorist groups.

586
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,250
One of them

587
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,083
now has the technology

588
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,917
for large-scale dirty bombs.

589
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,875
Which means

590
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,542
once they get the yellowcake,

591
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:10,292
who knows how many they will kill?

592
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:11,667
Are you talking about Zaka?

593
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,708
Yes, all they want is the yellowcake.

594
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,667
- It's not our business.
- I hope you can save Abu,

595
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,083
- Our mission--
- William and all of them!

596
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,458
Ms. Xia, our mission

597
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:23,125
is to rescue a Chinese hostage.

598
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:24,292
If we can,

599
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,583
we'll rescue the others.

600
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:26,500
But I'm sorry,

601
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,417
you can't come with us.

602
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
If I don't go with you,

603
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,250
I'll never get what I came for!

604
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,458
Please get in the car.

605
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,167
Sorry, you can't leave.

606
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,542
Why not?

607
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,708
I already told you.

608
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,125
We were ordered

609
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:42,375
to take you to an army base.

610
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,208
You'll be evacuated from there.

611
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,125
Sir, this is Nan Xia.

612
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,375
- We have a situation.
- Ms. Xia.

613
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,875
In the next terrorist attack,

614
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,708
countless people will die
because of William's yellowcake.

615
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,417
What is it?

616
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,292
Zaka put out a video

617
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,000
addressed to the Chinese Navy.

618
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:05,958
Look.

619
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,542
<i>Chief Secretary Muhadi is a sinner

620
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:14,167
<i>who continues to suppress my people
with his abuse of violence.

621
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:19,167
<i>We demand that you stop harboring
the sinner and turn over Muhadi's family.

622
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,833
<i>We must avenge the brothers and sisters

623
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:24,458
<i>who sacrificed because of Muhad.

624
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,958
<i>If you refuse to cooperate,

625
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:29,750
<i>the Chinese citizens shall take
the punishment in their place.

626
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,542
<i>This is just an example.

627
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,167
<i>And this Chinese woman will be next.

628
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,917
Damn it!

629
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,083
Savages!

630
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,583
Our only hope

631
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:54,125
is for Jiaolong to rescue them all.

632
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:04,542
- Captain Yang.
- Yes?

633
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,875
We just got word about
possible danger ahead.

634
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:08,542
We have to look for a different route.

635
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,958
What?

636
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,708
Yu Zhuang, contact the base.

637
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,042
- Okay.
- Hurry!

638
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:18,125
Base, this is Unit One.

639
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,917
Do you read me?

640
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,958
Base, this is Unit One.

641
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,542
Request for signal. Over.

642
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,542
Base.

643
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,583
Mortar attack!

644
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,708
Is everyone okay? Answer me!

645
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:04,167
I'm okay!

646
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,625
- Chen Lu's okay!
- Hong Xu's okay!

647
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,792
Shun Gu, Dong Li, okay!

648
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:08,250
Tian-de Zhang and Li Tong, okay!

649
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,458
Don't move!

650
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,708
Shitou, go to the rear!

651
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,375
Li Tong, take the wing!

652
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,875
Come on! Get your gun!

653
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,583
Chen Lu, get me the enemy's position!

654
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,667
Hong Xu, bring everyone out!

655
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,792
Yu Zhuang, look for
any ammunition that is left!

656
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:07,792
Roger!

657
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,958
Open the door!

658
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,042
Mortars at two o'clock!

659
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:29,042
Hide!

660
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:31,667
Hong Xu!

661
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:35,708
I'm okay.

662
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:37,708
Save them!

663
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:38,792
Hurry!

664
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,000
Chen Lu, let's go!

665
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,667
Shun Gu, Dong Li.

666
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,208
Find an overwatch, wait for my orders!

667
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,292
Roger!

668
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,708
Tian-de Zhang, cover me!

669
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:15,208
Move!

670
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:23,375
Li Tong, cover me!

671
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:45,292
Dong Li, move!

672
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,417
His leg's gone,

673
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,750
let's cut it off!

674
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:01,708
Come on!

675
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:15,583
Take him.

676
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:20,000
Stay calm.

677
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:39,417
Captain, it's Hong Xu.

678
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,167
There's a live bomb on the bus.

679
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,250
<i>Shun Gu, are you in position?

680
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,458
Not yet.

681
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,583
Last round!

682
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:28,500
Watch out! There is a sniper!

683
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,792
Be careful, everyone!

684
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,042
<i>Dong Li.

685
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,000
Listen to me.

686
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,583
I'll hit their base.

687
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,708
<i>But as soon as I fire,

688
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,458
<i>they'll have a fix on my position.

689
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,458
<i>Find them quickly.

690
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,667
<i>Do you read me?

691
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,583
Roger!

692
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,000
<i>Shun Gu, quick!

693
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,167
<i>The smoke is clearing up!

694
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:19,750
Shun Gu in position.

695
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,833
<i>There is a sniper at 2 o'clock,

696
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,708
<i>on the hill, near the peak,

697
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,042
<i>by a boulder.

698
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:07,333
It's 22 degrees east, 602 meters.

699
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:42,625
Dong Li. Can you see him?

700
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,750
I see him.

701
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:49,500
On the highest ridge,

702
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:51,583
ten meters to the right.

703
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,625
Dong Li, pin him down.

704
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:55,875
I'll get the mortar.

705
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:39,292
<i>Shun Gu, I've pinned him down.

706
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:12,458
Everyone, retreat!

707
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,083
Don't move! Don't move!

708
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,833
Hold him down, I'll pull it out.

709
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,125
Okay.

710
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,500
Pull!

711
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:31,583
Hold him down.

712
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,500
Let's go.

713
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,375
Hurry!

714
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:19,917
Everyone, go now!

715
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,833
The bomb is going off!

716
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,042
Run!

717
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,583
Hong Xu, run!

718
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:36,792
<i>Captain.

719
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,458
Captain, are you okay?

720
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:40,167
Captain!

721
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:45,833
Where are the others?

722
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,500
- Are you okay?
- Hurry and save the others!

723
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,958
Come on!

724
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,417
Shitou!

725
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,083
- Hong Xu...
- Save the others!

726
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,375
Hong Xu...

727
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,083
Harder!

728
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,083
Pull!

729
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,708
Hurry!

730
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,500
Nan Xia!

731
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,208
- Nan Xia!
- Over here!

732
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,000
Pull!

733
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,000
Harder!

734
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,042
Are you okay?

735
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:54,375
We're 80 kilometers from our target.

736
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:57,292
But the ship sails in 90 minutes.

737
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:58,583
We only have one vehicle left

738
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,667
<i>and that's under repair.

739
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:02,333
We won't make it back in time.

740
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,792
Can their troops give us more support?

741
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:09,417
Our superiors put in a request,

742
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:12,958
but they've no troops to spare.

743
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:15,750
They can only get us out at a point

744
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,583
<i>60 kilometers north of the target.

745
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:20,583
<i>After the rescue,

746
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:22,000
go straight there.

747
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:27,500
But it's a very dangerous route.

748
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:30,417
You need to be on high alert.

749
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:31,583
<i>Roger that!

750
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,917
<i>Also, Zaka released a video.

751
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:38,167
They beheaded the reporter's assistant.

752
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,583
Despite all those drills

753
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,958
and training,

754
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,042
I never thought

755
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,458
I'd lose control like that.

756
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:03,708
Sir.

757
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,958
I'm not good enough for Jiaolong.

758
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,500
Do you remember how we became a team?

759
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,167
We went through tough times.

760
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:22,125
We were all tempted to quit,

761
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:25,875
but we held on, right?

762
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,583
The fact that we are here now

763
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,500
proves we are all qualified.

764
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:36,875
Think of our motto.

765
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,458
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

766
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:20,750
You did well just now.

767
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,833
It wasn't for show.

768
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:30,083
Well, I saw it.

769
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:43,500
Does it hurt?

770
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:45,833
A little.

771
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,000
Don't think too much.

772
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:20,917
You can come to Basem with us.

773
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,958
Are we getting reinforcements? When?

774
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,083
Listen.

775
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,208
If you come with us,

776
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:33,750
you have to follow orders, okay?

777
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:34,708
Captain, let me tell you.

778
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:36,750
Without reinforcements,
you have to be really careful.

779
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:37,958
It's more than an hour away.

780
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,042
Can you fix the vehicle?

781
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,292
We're doing our best.

782
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:42,917
That's none of your concern.

783
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,792
I'm talking about the orders.

784
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,333
It's about

785
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:48,417
the battle just now.

786
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,292
I told you to stay put.

787
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:52,167
Sure, it was to save a life.

788
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:54,500
But when there is action next time,

789
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,083
considering the danger,

790
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:58,167
no matter what happens,

791
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,125
you do exactly as we say.

792
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,333
- Okay?
- What if the order is wrong?

793
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,708
How do you know it's right?

794
01:13:07,292 --> 01:13:08,583
Yes, we have different roles,

795
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:11,958
- but as for our beliefs--
- If I'm wrong, I take responsibility!

796
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:15,167
But if you disobey and you die,
who will be responsible then?

797
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,417
If that's the case,

798
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:19,125
then don't save me.

799
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,417
<i>Captain, the vehicle has been fixed.

800
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,792
<i>Will be right there.

801
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:29,833
Roger.

802
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:32,792
Everyone, move now.

803
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:42,375
<i>Sayyid, how is Dr. William?

804
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,417
<i>He is alive.

805
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:46,042
But still unconscious.

806
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:52,250
<i>Besides the yellowcake,

807
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:57,667
<i>we need the formula for the dirty bomb.

808
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,917
<i>Understand?

809
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:01,917
Yes.

810
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:48,750
Yu Zhuang.

811
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:49,875
Find a high place.

812
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,125
Set up an antenna.

813
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,417
Keep contact with base.

814
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:53,375
<i>Roger that.

815
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:01,708
Testing, testing.

816
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,500
Don't be scared.

817
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:49,542
The Chinese Navy is here to rescue people.

818
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,750
Don't be scared.

819
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,458
The house owner, Bella,

820
01:15:57,542 --> 01:15:59,792
says they came a week ago,

821
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:01,000
killed all the men,

822
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,167
chased off the others,

823
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,667
and kept them here to cook.

824
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:04,667
In the town now,

825
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,583
there are about 150 terrorists.

826
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,208
They stay around the square.

827
01:16:08,292 --> 01:16:09,542
She drew a map.

828
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,167
This is their headquarters.

829
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,792
The hostage camp is to the north.

830
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,917
They have about ten guards

831
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,625
and 25 hostages in there.

832
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:20,083
They are all foreigners

833
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:21,292
except for five soldiers.

834
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,250
There are three women,
one of them is Asian.

835
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,083
Her description matches Mei Deng's.

836
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,083
Hold on.

837
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,250
How can we access the camp?

838
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,083
Only through the square.

839
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,167
Send a situation report to the ship.

840
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,250
Yes, sir.

841
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,917
It's eight against 150 people.

842
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,125
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

843
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,083
Our unit's mission

844
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,708
is not to deal with those 150 people.

845
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,208
It's to rescue the Chinese hostage.

846
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,250
So is there no hope for the others?

847
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:00,958
There's no time.

848
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,833
Is it possible

849
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,042
for you

850
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,000
to save one more person?

851
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,625
Is there any chance of that?

852
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,750
Your assistant, Abu

853
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,458
has been executed.

854
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:32,625
When did that happened?

855
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:34,292
Before we got here.

856
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,208
My husband and child

857
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,292
died on a bus just like today.

858
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,250
<i>In 2005,

859
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,000
<i>when they blew up the bus in London.

860
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:36,958
The police told me

861
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,917
that nothing was left of them,

862
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,500
but a little blue bracelet.

863
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,625
That's when

864
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,167
I vowed to fight against them to the end.

865
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:56,708
To fight against the terrorist groups.

866
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,292
I'm not afraid of anything,

867
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,500
even death.

868
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:04,167
I'm only afraid
of being powerless to help.

869
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:08,875
I've failed to protect anyone.

870
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,708
Not even Abu. I've failed to protect him.

871
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,292
I've failed.

872
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,542
The captain says, the only support

873
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:25,375
will be a chopper for evacuation,

874
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,917
but they can't say when.

875
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:30,708
In addition to Mei Deng,

876
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,417
I want to rescue the others too.

877
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,792
Do you have a strategy?

878
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,875
With so many people,

879
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,667
we can't take that road back.

880
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,875
It's better

881
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:47,167
to go north through the desert,

882
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,208
straight to the army base.

883
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:51,042
The problem is we'll be exposed
if they started to chase us.

884
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,708
Mei Deng is the priority.

885
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,000
Once she's safely out,

886
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,083
we regroup and get the hostages.

887
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,792
Quickly tell Shitou and Li Tong

888
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:02,792
to disguise themselves as terrorists

889
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:03,958
and infiltrate the camp.

890
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:08,083
Remember.
Li Tong and Mei Deng will trade clothes.

891
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:10,583
Shitou will take her back the way we came.

892
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:12,542
Tell Shun Gu and Dong Li.

893
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:13,792
Find an overwatch

894
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,833
where they can control the square.

895
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:18,208
Once we enter the town,

896
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,542
all our signals will be jammed.

897
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,042
So I have to tell Yu Zhuang

898
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,750
to set up an anti-jamming device

899
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,042
to secure our communications.

900
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:27,917
As for Nan Xia,

901
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,750
have her stay here with Yu Zhuang.

902
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,583
They'll go as soon as Mei Deng's out.

903
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:33,458
Finally, you, Chen Lu and I

904
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:35,208
will watch the square.

905
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:39,000
Once we know Mei Deng is safe
and has arrived at Bella's house,

906
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,208
we'll blow up

907
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,958
their access to the camp.

908
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,958
The three of us will go into the camp

909
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:46,375
and rescue the other hostages.

910
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,542
But if Li Tong is with them,

911
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:51,375
and a battle breaks out in the square,

912
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,958
we won't have enough firepower.

913
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,375
You're already outnumbered.

914
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:55,542
I'll switch with Mei Deng.

915
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,167
I look more like her too.

916
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:02,167
Captain, I think that's not a bad idea.

917
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,542
I disagree.

918
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,500
I know nothing.

919
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,208
Do you have nothing to say?

920
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:36,417
Please.

921
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:39,542
What do you want to know?

922
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:45,583
Your wound is not looking so good.

923
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,292
- I really don't know--
- Let me fix it.

924
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:59,000
Please, I know nothing!

925
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:02,583
You're hiding something. Where is it?

926
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:07,417
I really don't know...

927
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,083
Think it over.

928
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:16,042
Aluka Desert!

929
01:22:16,292 --> 01:22:18,000
Aluka Desert!

930
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,458
<i>Dong Li, you cover this area.

931
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:48,667
<i>Shun Gu, you take the arches.

932
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:51,208
No problem. Got them.

933
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:57,333
Captain, we're in.

934
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,792
Do as I say.

935
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,458
The Chinese Navy is here to save you.

936
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,500
<i>Chen Lu, I found a truck.

937
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,625
<i>I'll stop it near the hostage camp.

938
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,708
<i>Guard the right flank.

939
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:10,000
<i>I'll prepare the bomb.

940
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,542
Base, this is Unit One.

941
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:43,042
Can you read me?

942
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:45,500
<i>Yu Zhuang, what's wrong?

943
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,417
Captain, we lost contact with the ship.

944
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,958
I'll go check.

945
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:52,250
<i>Roger. Stay safe.

946
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:53,792
Will do.

947
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,250
<i>Boss.

948
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:17,583
<i>There's a Chinese soldier on the hill.

949
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:20,958
Execute the Chinese hostage.

950
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,125
If they want to rescue her,

951
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,083
let them rescue a corpse.

952
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:28,458
<i>And tell our brothers

953
01:25:28,542 --> 01:25:30,375
<i>to attack the ship.

954
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,958
What are you doing?

955
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:44,167
What are you doing?

956
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:48,250
Captain, they just took Nan Xia.

957
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:52,083
<i>Hong Xu, why was Nan Xia there?

958
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:56,750
Shitou,

959
01:25:57,042 --> 01:25:58,167
once you've left the camp,

960
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,417
<i>jump out and prepare to attack it.

961
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:01,917
<i>Everyone else,

962
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,667
hold fire until Mei Deng is safe.

963
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,042
What are you doing?

964
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:20,042
Dong Li, I'm going into the headquarters.

965
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:21,375
Cover me.

966
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:39,250
<i>I'm on the second floor, left passage.

967
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,167
<i>Can you see me?

968
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,125
I see you.

969
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:42,375
<i>Secure the area.

970
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:43,542
Roger.

971
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:57,583
She's so loud.

972
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:58,917
Turn up the music.

973
01:27:13,792 --> 01:27:14,833
Captain, Commissar.

974
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,542
Reporting, the weapons on the hill

975
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,667
are aiming at us!

976
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,458
Battle-ready deployment grade one!

977
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:21,750
- Yes, sir!
- Grade one!

978
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:28,708
Auxiliary gun on intercept!

979
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,042
- Main gun target the hill!
- Yes, sir!

980
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,000
Target is locked!

981
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:47,042
Fire!

982
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,583
Mohadi is ruining
our people's lives every day.

983
01:27:58,792 --> 01:28:01,292
And brave soldiers like us
can wait no longer.

984
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:03,958
We must punish this Chinese citizen.

985
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:05,833
- Only blood will teach--
- Wait!

986
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,000
Who are you?

987
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:15,833
Who are you?

988
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,417
Where is the other girl?

989
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,333
Where is the other girl?

990
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:21,083
Who brought you here?

991
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,542
How many of you are here?

992
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:24,833
Answer me!

993
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,292
Answer me!

994
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,042
How many of you are here?

995
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,417
Start talking or I'll break your legs!

996
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,167
Answer me now!

997
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:33,833
Do you want me to kill you?

998
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:56,958
I'm sorry.

999
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:00,667
Don't take it personally.

1000
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:16,083
Captain, we're leaving the camp.

1001
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,458
Come on!

1002
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:10,042
This is William. His necklace is gone.

1003
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:11,625
- What necklace?
- It has the information.

1004
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:12,542
Let's go.

1005
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:22,500
<i>Captain, I'm about to enter the square.

1006
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:23,833
<i>But I got a flat tire.

1007
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:28,875
Keep calm, everyone.

1008
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:45,375
<i>Dong Li, I'm coming out.

1009
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,833
<i>Is the path clear?

1010
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,250
All clear.

1011
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:50,583
<i>Everyone, listen to me.

1012
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:52,583
<i>No matter what happens over here,

1013
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:54,250
<i>stick to the plan.

1014
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,125
Your tire is flat!

1015
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,250
Remember.

1016
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,208
No matter what happens, take the girl

1017
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:04,250
and follow me.

1018
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,833
Don't be scared, Aisha. Stay with me.

1019
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:11,750
Wait, the tire is leaking air.

1020
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:14,083
Captain, they stopped Li Tong's truck.

1021
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,917
Intruders!

1022
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,750
We're retreating to the junkyard.

1023
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:46,875
Cover us!

1024
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:52,917
Follow me.

1025
01:32:58,583 --> 01:32:59,542
Go!

1026
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,208
Go in!

1027
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,042
Hide!

1028
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,417
Find cover!

1029
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:14,458
Put this on!

1030
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:24,708
Hong Xu, what's your status?

1031
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:27,417
<i>Captain, we're trapped in the square.

1032
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:28,792
<i>What about you?

1033
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,958
When you have the chance,

1034
01:33:30,042 --> 01:33:32,667
take them all out using the back way.

1035
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,667
<i>Roger.

1036
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,042
<i>What's your plan?

1037
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:36,208
I'll think of one.

1038
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:38,625
Remember, make sure Mei Deng is safe!

1039
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,583
YELLOWCAKE 27 TONS

1040
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:23,792
Keep on going.
I'll take care of the snipers.

1041
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:27,375
Dong Li, they saw me.

1042
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,792
He's close by.

1043
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,083
He know where I am.

1044
01:34:30,542 --> 01:34:31,917
Find him quickly.

1045
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:33,625
Do you read me?

1046
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:34,667
Roger!

1047
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:41,375
Captain, their sniper found me.

1048
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:43,167
<i>I've lost my position.

1049
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,333
<i>Be careful.

1050
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:34,125
Get up! We'll go that way! Heads down!

1051
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:41,917
Li Tong!

1052
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,292
Are you okay?

1053
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:44,500
Answer me!

1054
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,000
<i>Our exit is cut off by fire.

1055
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:47,250
<i>It's coming our way!

1056
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:53,583
Chen Lu! Give me a grenade!

1057
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,375
Here!

1058
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,167
<i>Li Tong! Get to the back.

1059
01:36:02,167 --> 01:36:03,333
Stay right here.

1060
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,042
Hong Xu!

1061
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,333
Li Tong, blast your way out.

1062
01:36:12,417 --> 01:36:13,375
I'll cover you!

1063
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,375
Go!

1064
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:25,875
Let's go!

1065
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,458
<i>Chen Lu, cover Li Tong.

1066
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:34,417
<i>We'll retreat to the camp.

1067
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,500
Li Tong, go!

1068
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:39,875
Follow me!

1069
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,500
Go back!

1070
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:54,167
Chen Lu, fall back!

1071
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:57,167
We have to escape.

1072
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,042
Pull this pin.

1073
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:01,000
When I say throw, you throw. Got it?

1074
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,375
We'll fight to the end!

1075
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,167
Let's go!

1076
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:12,333
Nan Xia, throw!

1077
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:26,042
Move!

1078
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,917
Blow them up!

1079
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,083
Do you hear me?

1080
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:41,958
Kill the hostages!

1081
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:44,542
They're going to kill the hostages!

1082
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:46,083
Shitou, go to the camp now!

1083
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:48,208
Save the hostages!
Don't let them kill the hostages!

1084
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:34,667
<i>Sir, the exit is clear.

1085
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:35,917
<i>The hostages are all safe.

1086
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,042
<i>Hurry over here!

1087
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:49,875
<i>Shitou, the exit's blocked!

1088
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,125
<i>Help us!

1089
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,250
Stay back, hide!

1090
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,250
<i>Hong Xu, I'm out of ammunition!

1091
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:02,375
Shitou! Go and help Chen Lu!

1092
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:03,917
Hang in there. I have a plan.

1093
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,917
Roger.

1094
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:25,208
<i>There is a way out to the small plaza
at right of the junkyard.

1095
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,292
<i>Use that way to get out.

1096
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:27,583
<i>I'll cover you.

1097
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:28,583
<i>Wait for my signal.

1098
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:39,083
Chen Lu, Li Tong.

1099
01:39:39,167 --> 01:39:40,375
<i>I've taken over a tank.

1100
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:41,958
<i>I'll deal with the enemies around you.

1101
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,500
<i>Stay hidden and wait for my signal.

1102
01:39:43,917 --> 01:39:45,125
<i>Li Tong.

1103
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:46,417
After you have escaped,

1104
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,000
- go to the meeting point.
<i>- Roger.

1105
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:50,500
<i>Captain, I'll rescue you next!

1106
01:39:51,667 --> 01:39:52,542
Ready.

1107
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,542
Ready.

1108
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,917
Fire!

1109
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,375
Captain, what's your position?

1110
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:36,833
<i>I'm at the right of the main passage.

1111
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,792
<i>But I'm surrounded
by the terrorists on the left.

1112
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:39,958
Got it.

1113
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:41,375
<i>Ready!

1114
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:42,542
<i>Take cover!

1115
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:44,042
<i>Fire!

1116
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:57,875
Wear this!

1117
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:14,000
Move!

1118
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,167
Captain, we found a truck.

1119
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,125
We're moving now.

1120
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:18,250
Mei Deng is safe.

1121
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:24,875
Go!

1122
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,125
<i>Yu Zhuang, do you read me?

1123
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,083
Yes.

1124
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:45,250
Contact base.

1125
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:47,500
<i>Then take Yuna to the meeting point
and wait for orders.

1126
01:41:47,583 --> 01:41:49,000
<i>- Do you read me?</i>
- Roger.

1127
01:41:49,292 --> 01:41:51,417
Base, this is Unit One.

1128
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:54,833
Base, this is Unit One!

1129
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:58,333
<i>Unit One, do you read me?

1130
01:41:58,667 --> 01:42:00,917
Captain, we've lost Jiaolong's signal.

1131
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:04,917
We tried to reach them,

1132
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,167
but to no avail.

1133
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,083
How about their individual positions?

1134
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:09,833
We've lost those too.

1135
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:13,583
Stay on high alert, keep trying.

1136
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:14,625
Yes, sir!

1137
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,500
Captain.

1138
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:19,958
The ship is under threat.

1139
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,583
To protect the citizens on board,

1140
01:42:21,667 --> 01:42:23,542
we'll move away from the port.

1141
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:24,542
Okay.

1142
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:28,750
Let me see if our superiors

1143
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:30,583
will approve of sending in a drone.

1144
01:42:32,417 --> 01:42:33,333
Follow me!

1145
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,000
Come on! Come on!

1146
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,208
Shun Gu!

1147
01:45:55,917 --> 01:45:57,667
Captain, do you read me?

1148
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:05,125
Get down!

1149
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:29,458
Shitou!

1150
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:07,750
Any Signal yet?

1151
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:08,750
No.

1152
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:09,792
To the meeting point.

1153
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:10,792
Go.

1154
01:47:14,667 --> 01:47:16,000
Shitou, don't move!

1155
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,167
Don't move!

1156
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:41,708
Out of the car!

1157
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:48,125
Hurry!

1158
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:50,417
Get down!

1159
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:02,000
Take cover!

1160
01:48:10,042 --> 01:48:10,917
Don't move!

1161
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:13,458
Don't move!

1162
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,625
Shitou, hold on!

1163
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:23,708
Li Tong and the others are in danger.

1164
01:49:24,292 --> 01:49:25,292
They are down there.

1165
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:29,792
<i>Reporting.

1166
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,375
We have Jiaolong but the signal's weak.

1167
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:34,000
But there's a sandstorm nearby.

1168
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:35,042
Did you make contact?

1169
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:36,958
Not yet for now due
to weather interference.

1170
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:38,083
How much longer?

1171
01:49:38,667 --> 01:49:39,708
We have seven minutes.

1172
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:01,667
You need it more.

1173
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,750
Stay there!

1174
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,708
<i>Li Tong, hang on!

1175
01:50:10,792 --> 01:50:11,875
<i>We're nearly there.

1176
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:13,833
Hurry!

1177
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:22,167
Chen Lu, secure the entrance.

1178
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:12,750
It's okay, Shitou.

1179
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:14,417
It's okay.

1180
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:25,708
It hurts...

1181
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:32,833
Have a candy.

1182
01:51:33,125 --> 01:51:34,000
The candy will help.

1183
01:51:34,083 --> 01:51:35,083
Didn't you say

1184
01:51:35,167 --> 01:51:36,500
that candy can kill the pain.

1185
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:37,917
It takes away the pain.

1186
01:51:44,958 --> 01:51:46,708
Here. Eat this candy.

1187
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:47,875
Come on.

1188
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:51,208
Candy takes away the pain...

1189
01:51:51,292 --> 01:51:52,458
We're going home.

1190
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:54,250
Going home...

1191
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,917
Going home...

1192
01:52:11,167 --> 01:52:13,250
Shitou!

1193
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:16,042
No more pain.

1194
01:52:16,125 --> 01:52:19,042
We're going home...

1195
01:52:57,458 --> 01:53:00,083
Tank Alpha, attack from the right!

1196
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:01,750
<i>Hong Xu.

1197
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:04,167
Turn 20 degrees left, hurry!

1198
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:15,625
Hong Xu.

1199
01:53:16,167 --> 01:53:18,417
The reactive armor protects them.

1200
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:20,125
<i>Turn a sharp left.

1201
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,917
<i>Shoot at their treads.

1202
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:32,125
Got them!

1203
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,958
Captain, they hit our cooling system.

1204
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,375
We won't last much longer.

1205
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:54,375
Captain, there is a sandstorm ahead!

1206
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:56,583
Charge straight at it.

1207
01:53:56,833 --> 01:53:58,625
<i>It will cover us.

1208
01:54:16,292 --> 01:54:17,417
Hong Xu.

1209
01:54:17,542 --> 01:54:18,958
Our turret took a hit.

1210
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:20,417
<i>Don't let them lock onto us!

1211
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:33,417
Hong Xu.

1212
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:36,250
I'll use your steering for aim.

1213
01:54:36,542 --> 01:54:37,750
Do you understand?

1214
01:54:38,292 --> 01:54:39,250
Roger!

1215
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:41,208
Nan Xia.

1216
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:43,542
We have to switch places.

1217
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:45,750
The handset has a trigger.

1218
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:48,000
When I say fire, press it.

1219
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:49,458
I'll help you.

1220
01:55:10,292 --> 01:55:11,125
Hong Xu.

1221
01:55:11,667 --> 01:55:13,667
Let the reactive armor take a hit.

1222
01:55:14,167 --> 01:55:15,625
<i>Follow my orders.

1223
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:17,750
<i>First, take a sharp left
and then sharp right!

1224
01:55:21,917 --> 01:55:24,000
Hong Xu, turn left!

1225
01:55:42,417 --> 01:55:43,708
<i>Turn right!

1226
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:47,583
Nan Xia, get ready!

1227
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:55,125
Fire!

1228
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:09,750
<i>Captain!

1229
01:56:09,833 --> 01:56:11,458
We're stuck!

1230
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,958
<i>Captain, I'll deal with their tanks!

1231
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,667
Hong Xu!

1232
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:26,750
Hong Xu!

1233
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:43,083
Nan Xia, we're going out.

1234
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:44,625
Remember.

1235
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:46,458
When we go out,
keep your hand on my shoulder.

1236
01:56:46,542 --> 01:56:47,583
Understand?

1237
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:31,208
Wait here, don't move!

1238
01:58:06,375 --> 01:58:07,500
Captain, Commissar.

1239
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:09,833
The drone has found Rui Yang and Hong Xu.

1240
01:58:09,917 --> 01:58:11,375
But we still don't have contact.

1241
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:14,125
Reporting, the drone is losing power

1242
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:15,458
and could drop at any time.

1243
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,000
They're attacking, quick!

1244
01:58:58,417 --> 01:58:59,750
Load up, hurry!

1245
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:08,625
<i>Prepare to fire!

1246
01:59:23,667 --> 01:59:24,625
Are you okay?

1247
01:59:24,708 --> 01:59:26,583
Yes, I am...

1248
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:48,583
You're a good shot.

1249
02:00:27,375 --> 02:00:28,500
Captain.

1250
02:00:29,083 --> 02:00:30,583
Our mission is accomplished.

1251
02:00:50,667 --> 02:00:51,625
Captain Yang.

1252
02:00:52,583 --> 02:00:53,750
Thank you so much.

1253
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:13,958
- Captain Yang.
- Thank you.

1254
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:18,833
<i>The weather is preventing us
from contacting your warship,

1255
02:01:18,917 --> 02:01:22,125
<i>and we are unable to deal with the
yellowcake situation at the moment.

1256
02:01:22,292 --> 02:01:24,167
<i>All we can provide is a helicopter.

1257
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:27,875
This

1258
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:31,125
works pretty well.

1259
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:34,875
Remember to give it back.

1260
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:41,083
We can't just ignore

1261
02:01:41,167 --> 02:01:42,583
this yellowcake crisis.

1262
02:01:43,167 --> 02:01:44,875
The hiding place for the yellowcake

1263
02:01:45,042 --> 02:01:46,458
is 80 kilometers from here.

1264
02:01:46,542 --> 02:01:47,625
But in 40 minutes,

1265
02:01:47,708 --> 02:01:49,333
the terrorists will leave
with the yellowcake.

1266
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:51,875
We have to hurry.

1267
02:01:51,958 --> 02:01:53,375
But I need to stress one thing.

1268
02:01:53,458 --> 02:01:54,625
This operation

1269
02:01:55,333 --> 02:01:56,875
hasn't been authorized yet.

1270
02:02:00,417 --> 02:02:01,333
If we do this,

1271
02:02:01,417 --> 02:02:02,292
we do it together.

1272
02:02:04,042 --> 02:02:04,958
Captain.

1273
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:06,708
I'll wait for your orders.

1274
02:02:19,958 --> 02:02:21,292
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

1275
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:54,208
<i>Two kilometers from destination!

1276
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,917
<i>Our target is the yellowcake.

1277
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,500
<i>Avoid engaging.

1278
02:03:46,875 --> 02:03:49,083
<i>Li Tong, we'll take the plane
and yellowcake.

1279
02:03:49,292 --> 02:03:51,500
<i>Shun Gu, Dong Li.
Find an overwatch and cover us.

1280
02:03:51,667 --> 02:03:52,708
<i>Split up!

1281
02:04:15,125 --> 02:04:16,875
<i>Captain, we're in position.

1282
02:04:22,417 --> 02:04:23,375
Clear.

1283
02:04:42,875 --> 02:04:44,792
Captain, we've taken the control tower.

1284
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:47,208
<i>Roger. Wait for orders.

1285
02:04:53,583 --> 02:04:55,667
You go first.
I'll wait for the next truck.

1286
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:08,625
Boss.

1287
02:05:09,208 --> 02:05:11,833
The rebels' representative will arrive
in five minutes.

1288
02:05:14,292 --> 02:05:16,875
<i>Attention, sniper's hide.

1289
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:19,042
<i>Li Tong is under the truck.

1290
02:05:20,083 --> 02:05:21,125
I see her.

1291
02:05:25,042 --> 02:05:27,375
You did a good job just then.

1292
02:05:28,125 --> 02:05:29,333
When we go back,

1293
02:05:29,417 --> 02:05:31,458
you can train as a sniper.

1294
02:05:32,667 --> 02:05:33,875
If I were that good,

1295
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,250
I should have hit it at once.

1296
02:05:37,583 --> 02:05:40,417
Even the experienced feel pressure.

1297
02:05:41,083 --> 02:05:42,292
Embrace it.

1298
02:05:42,792 --> 02:05:44,625
Pressure keeps you focused.

1299
02:06:36,375 --> 02:06:38,083
I didn't know it'd be you.

1300
02:06:39,583 --> 02:06:41,625
It's been a long time, boss!

1301
02:06:41,875 --> 02:06:44,875
You've not been home in a long time.

1302
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:47,167
We're fighting...

1303
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:50,708
for a better life.

1304
02:06:51,333 --> 02:06:54,083
Why go home?

1305
02:06:55,833 --> 02:07:02,167
We're not fighting this war for you.

1306
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,917
What about the formula, boss?

1307
02:07:32,083 --> 02:07:33,917
Everyone, listen up.
There is a change in our plan.

1308
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:35,833
<i>I'm going to go for their leader.

1309
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:37,958
<i>Dong Li, when I come out,

1310
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:40,167
<i>they'll be after me. Cover me.

1311
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:41,250
<i>Shun Gu,

1312
02:07:41,333 --> 02:07:43,458
<i>help Li Tong take the plane.

1313
02:07:43,542 --> 02:07:44,458
<i>Over.

1314
02:07:47,042 --> 02:07:47,958
Yes, sir.

1315
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:50,750
<i>The rebels will eat us alive.

1316
02:07:50,875 --> 02:07:54,167
<i>You must bring back all the yellowcakes.

1317
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:56,042
<i>Kill them all.

1318
02:07:56,625 --> 02:07:57,583
<i>From now on

1319
02:07:57,667 --> 02:07:58,958
<i>this war belongs to us.

1320
02:07:59,042 --> 02:08:00,042
I understand.

1321
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,625
Calling base! Mayday!

1322
02:08:07,708 --> 02:08:08,708
We're under attack! Help...

1323
02:08:11,875 --> 02:08:13,583
Li Tong, take control of the plane!

1324
02:08:18,417 --> 02:08:21,167
Don't move!

1325
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,500
<i>Everyone, I'm coming out.

1326
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:54,250
Dong Li, be careful!

1327
02:09:03,083 --> 02:09:04,667
Dong Li, take out the last car!

1328
02:09:33,958 --> 02:09:35,458
Shun Gu, Dong Li!

1329
02:09:36,333 --> 02:09:37,917
<i>Shun Gu, Dong Li!

1330
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,458
Li Tong, do you read me?

1331
02:10:25,833 --> 02:10:27,917
Don't move!

1332
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:31,708
Shun Gu!

1333
02:10:31,917 --> 02:10:32,958
Are you okay?

1334
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:46,917
Get out!

1335
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:48,167
Hurry!

1336
02:10:49,583 --> 02:10:50,458
Dong Li,

1337
02:10:50,833 --> 02:10:51,833
use my gun.

1338
02:10:57,583 --> 02:10:58,583
<i>Let him go!

1339
02:10:59,875 --> 02:11:01,250
There's no time to think!

1340
02:11:12,542 --> 02:11:13,583
Dong Li,

1341
02:11:14,125 --> 02:11:15,458
conquer the pressure.

1342
02:11:16,417 --> 02:11:18,125
Xing Luo chose you for a reason.

1343
02:11:19,667 --> 02:11:20,625
Captain,

1344
02:11:20,792 --> 02:11:22,542
I'll take down the guy with Li Tong.

1345
02:11:23,917 --> 02:11:25,125
I'm counting on you.

1346
02:11:28,417 --> 02:11:30,917
Do it now! I'll kill her!

1347
02:11:36,167 --> 02:11:37,042
Fuck!

1348
02:11:37,375 --> 02:11:38,708
<i>Fucking Chinese!

1349
02:11:48,792 --> 02:11:51,500
We need the yellowcake for this war!

1350
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:54,625
To become stronger!

1351
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:45,583
<i>Captain, the rebels are behind us!

1352
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,083
Calm down!

1353
02:13:02,375 --> 02:13:03,667
I'm from the Chinese military.

1354
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,500
Start the engine! Hurry up!

1355
02:13:14,333 --> 02:13:15,708
Hurry!

1356
02:14:00,708 --> 02:14:02,542
March forward!

1357
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,542
Turn right!

1358
02:14:26,125 --> 02:14:27,375
Attention!

1359
02:14:35,792 --> 02:14:38,667
YU ZHUANG

1360
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,917
TIAN-DE ZHANG

1361
02:15:00,833 --> 02:15:02,125
Salute!

1362
02:15:43,833 --> 02:15:46,375
<i>Attention! This is Chinese Navy.

1363
02:15:46,583 --> 02:15:48,750
<i>You're about to enter Chinese waters.

1364
02:15:48,833 --> 02:15:52,042
<i>Please turn around immediately!

1365
02:15:52,708 --> 02:15:55,708
<i>Attention! This is Chinese Navy.

1366
02:15:55,708 --> 02:15:57,792
<i>You're about to enter Chinese waters.

1367
02:15:58,375 --> 02:16:00,417
<i>Please turn around immediately!

1368
02:16:00,417 --> 02:16:01,667
<i>I repeat!

1369
