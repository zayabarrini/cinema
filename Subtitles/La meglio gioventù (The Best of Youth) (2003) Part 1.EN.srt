1
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:27,357
THE BEST OF YOUTH

2
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,071
ROME, SUMMER OF 1966

3
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,110
Can you give me a hand
with the TV?

4
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,514
I'm studying.

5
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,995
Come on,
it'll only take a minute.

6
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,829
My exam's in a few days.
Ask Nicola, he's with Carlo.

7
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,469
Fine.

8
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,796
I'll ask Nicola,
he's with Carlo.

9
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,868
"Natalino Sapegno.

10
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,514
World History..."
Who's that?

11
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,552
An Italian literature
professor.

12
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,716
-Is he famous?
-I'd say so.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,195
-He gives the exam?
-No, he has assistants.

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,518
-Don't they know what they're doing?
-Of course they do, Dad.

15
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,870
<i>Your thesis got published in
Il Messaggero.</i>

16
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,473
You should show that Sapegno guy
what a genius you are.

17
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,035
Maybe he'll give you a scholarship
to study abroad.

18
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,998
I'll talk to him if you want.

19
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,918
You, talk to Sapegno?

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,236
Why not?
I'm not ashamed.

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,589
Well, I am.

22
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,479
This is what I get
for offering...

23
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,758
<i>When do you leave for Norway?</i>

24
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,759
<i>-After my exams.
-I know people there.</i>

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,474
I can give you addresses.
They might know girls your age.

26
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,635
<i>Talk to them,
they're the experts.</i>

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,240
-Dad!
-Yeah, I'm closing it!

28
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,755
Thanks.

29
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,276
Boys, I have a mission
for you two.

30
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,717
Good, we're due for a break.

31
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,158
I'll leave it open.

32
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,709
Careful.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,876
-Nico, have you got keys?
-Yes.

34
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,153
Then I'll close it.

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,714
You never know.

36
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,595
How's it coming?

37
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,949
I'll get the door.

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,038
-Where?
-Right here.

39
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,549
<i>Put it on top,
otherwise it'll move.</i>

40
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,909
-On top?
-Yeah, I got it.

41
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,680
-Slowly.
-Careful. You got it?

42
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,199
-Here.
-I got it.

43
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,874
-There.
-All set.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,308
Hold on.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,719
-It should be tied.
-I'll do it.

46
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,433
-You will?
-Yeah.

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,232
-Bye.
-Bye.

48
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,715
Carlo, I have a question for you.
Nicola won't answer me.

49
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,156
-You know Matteo.
-Sure.

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,391
Tell me, what's his problem?

51
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,629
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

52
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,513
-Come on, we have to study.
-We're talking!

53
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,557
That's all you ever do!

54
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,718
Hold on, I've had this
in the car for a week.

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,198
-What is that?
-Nothing, I got a good deal.

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,908
Why give it to me?

57
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,190
You study medicine,
it'll be useful.

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,556
<i>It's now...</i>

59
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,995
<i>or never.</i>

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,678
<i>Now that you're holding me</i>

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,035
<i>in your arms.</i>

62
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,632
<i>The music's about to stop,</i>

63
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,035
<i>and you still don't know
what to say.</i>

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,390
<i>I see you,
don't you see me?</i>

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,433
<i>Why?</i>

66
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,876
<i>Why?</i>

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,757
<i>It's now or never...</i>

68
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,035
How's it going, old friend?

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,199
All right I guess.
But if things...

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,038
If the situation evolves...

71
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,515
Can I use your house
at the beach?

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,597
-No, no.
-Yeah, good idea.

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,119
Don't even think about it!

74
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,548
Why not? It's perfect!

75
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,557
Last time you made a mess.

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,079
My mom's still hot over it.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,429
Here we go again!

78
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,392
That's right!

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,478
By the way,
I spoke to Dad.

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,030
-Well?
-We can use the AIfa Romeo.

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,389
Great!

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,955
That's great news!

83
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,835
-Did you tell him where we're going?
-I said it was for a field trip.

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,473
<i>Leaving after exams, eh?</i>

85
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,955
He said no higher than
4,000 R.P.M.

86
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,589
Well?

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,392
Are you coming to Carlo's
beach house?

88
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,239
-Me and you?
-Yeah.

89
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,078
-Alone?
-Of course!

90
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,397
It's beautiful. Golden beaches,
briny Salt-ceders...

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,189
leaping dolphins...
I love you, I love you.

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,313
-Always kidding around!
-No, I love you, I swear.

93
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,635
Come on, let's dance.

94
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,276
Did you talk to your dad
about the job?

95
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,670
Meet him Tuesday
at the clinic.

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,468
You know where it is?

97
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,320
It's scientifically known
as speech therapy.

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,190
In practice it entails going
for a stroll with a patient,

99
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,950
having a chat,
helping her to feel normal.

100
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,988
The relationship shouldn't be
too friendly. It's rehabilitation.

101
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,595
Giorgia hasn't had a crisis
in ages,

102
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,956
so twice a week
should suffice.

103
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,195
Come.

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,191
There she is, that's her.

105
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,994
It'll be easier
than walking a dog.

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,753
What's your name?
What's your name?

107
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,669
-Giorgia! Don't talk to strangers.
-What's your name?

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,916
-Me? Matteo.
-Matteo, mattress, meatball...

109
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,599
-Be careful.
-Don't touch me!

110
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,949
I won't.
But be careful.

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,515
Always look both ways
before crossing.

112
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,595
Go on.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,153
You like it here?

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,913
<i>I come here often.</i>

115
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,914
It relaxes me.

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,631
And there are no cars.

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,431
Look, I know a great place.

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,958
You want to come?

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,468
Would you like that?

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,079
I come here when
I don't feel like studying.

121
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,312
I like it.

122
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,717
And it's empty at this hour.

123
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,758
Shall we read something?

124
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,476
Yes. The trains.

125
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,312
What trains?

126
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,996
When they leave,
when they arrive...

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,915
Oh, the schedule.
There isn't one here.

128
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,595
I have a book
I'd like to read you.

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,472
A poetry book.

130
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,389
Where is it?

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,312
American literature...

132
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,318
"Life is a bet
that's hard to cover.

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,877
We're dealt a hand
while we're weak

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,355
and not when we're at our best,

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,711
and we're given 70 years
to play.

136
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,918
If 70 years isn't enough,
you'll never make it.

137
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,149
Leave the room if you lose,

138
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,394
leave...

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,192
when your time is up.

140
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,990
Only cowards hang around
groping the cards."

141
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,511
Watch out for the cars!

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,510
Careful!

143
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,235
Damn...!
What are you doing?

144
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,998
-Don't touch me!
-I'm not!

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,633
-Fuck you!
-Up yours!

146
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,195
I'm not touching you!
You want to get run over?

147
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,391
You fucking dickhead!

148
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,431
You know what dying means?

149
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,868
-Asshole!
-You're the asshole.

150
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,638
-Fuck off!
-Fuck...!

151
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,469
Are you stupid?
Come on back to the clinic.

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,393
You don't want to do this again?
Fine, we won't.

153
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,791
Just say the word.
Here.

154
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,429
Here!

155
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,189
Right, it happens.
But what am I supposed to do?

156
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,868
Nothing. Don't react.

157
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,196
If you don't react
they calm down.

158
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,791
-But professor...
-Don't be so formal.

159
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,635
Okay, but maybe I did
something wrong.

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,229
You did nothing wrong, son.

161
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,716
The disease is at fault,
that's why we're here.

162
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,033
All set?

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,872
Have you washed my car?

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,590
I let them wash my car
sometimes.

165
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,913
They like that.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,752
It gives them
something to do.

167
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,990
We mustn't! We mustn't!

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,316
<i>Mortgage the house?</i>

169
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,513
It's for the kids!
We'd have nothing!

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,917
<i>Mortgaging the house is the most
normal thing in the world.</i>

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,596
You know what your problem is?
You're from Milan!

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,279
You're extraordinary,

173
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,438
intelligent,
full of vitality...

174
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,234
-So what?
-You have no imagination!

175
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,998
-Right.
-lmagination like me.

176
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,110
Oh, right.

177
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,880
Alice, what are you
still doing up?

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,229
Come here.

179
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,629
-They been arguing long?
-Since the movie ended.

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,751
-Did it end well?
-Yeah.

181
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,349
He found out he was king
and married

182
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,198
-the princess.
-Big mistake.

183
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,708
-Why?
-Because

184
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,319
they'll end up fighting,

185
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,636
like Mom and Dad.
Promise me when you grow up

186
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,912
you'll do like me:
never get married ever.

187
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,031
I want to marry you.

188
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,319
And Nicola, too.

189
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,234
A sister can't marry her brother.
Especially both brothers.

190
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,435
Go to bed, Alice.
We'll make them stop.

191
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,790
Someone with a head
on his shoulders!

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,959
-Hey, would you cut that out?
-Had enough?

193
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,276
What are you doing here?

194
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,630
Poor thing,
you're still awake?

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,515
-How is anyone supposed to sleep?
-Tell me what to do then.

196
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,472
Leave Matteo out of this.

197
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,636
You two should defend me
from your father.

198
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,637
From what?
Matteo, tell me.

199
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,671
-Am I a bad father?
-Oh, right.

200
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,758
<i>He's a great father.
He mortgaged the house!</i>

201
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,870
-This house?
-No, the palace!

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,354
Of course this one.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,278
Did you hear that?

204
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,836
If things get tight
we'll have to sleep under a bridge.

205
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,110
Under a bridge!
What fun, Matteo!

206
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,390
Finally someone
who likes adventure.

207
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,194
Right, we'll live under a bridge
as beggars.

208
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,757
Who cares if things
are tight or not?

209
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,709
You're crazy as well.

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,309
No, he's right!
What's so crazy?

211
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,318
Leave it to me.
I'm the head of the family.

212
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,029
-What does that mean?
-That you should trust me.

213
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,958
This is the time to invest,

214
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,116
to grow, to beat
the competition.

215
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,117
This is how it's done.

216
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,068
I can feel it in the air.

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,795
We'll all be feeling the air
living in the street.

218
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,474
-If only divorce were legal here...
-Like in America!

219
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,829
Yeah, like in America.

220
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,750
-I'm going out.
-Again?

221
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,838
-Yeah, they're waiting for me.
-Where are you going?

222
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,553
I don't know. Out.

223
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,715
Girls?

224
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,310
Maybe.

225
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,079
Where could she be?

226
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,079
Probably with a client.

227
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,759
Should we wait here?

228
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,678
Yeah, this is her fire.

229
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,194
It's embarrassing.

230
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,277
Why? She'll be back.

231
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,269
Is it her?

232
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,269
Yeah.

233
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,553
What's wrong?

234
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,909
Hi, Cati.

235
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,233
Hi, Matteo.

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,115
Who was that?

237
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,914
-And them?
-My brother and two friends.

238
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,315
Hi.

239
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,589
Hi.

240
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,158
Should we go to your place?

241
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,508
Come in.

242
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,673
Mind if I leave the light on?
That way the chickens

243
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,518
think it's day
and they eat.

244
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,318
No, fine.

245
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,074
Won't you undress?

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,194
Are you embarrassed?

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,797
Fine. I'll turn around.

248
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,988
Hey, we'd better not
do anything.

249
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,792
I'll pay you the same.

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,399
Are you sick?

251
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,989
Me? No.

252
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,278
No, I just...
I don't know, maybe...

253
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,879
Oh, come on!

254
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,154
-You're Matteo's brother?
-Yeah, why?

255
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,074
You're so different.

256
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,317
-Not at all like him.
-What's Matteo like?

257
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,348
Weird.

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,028
Okay, let's go.

259
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,832
Let's do it.
We're wasting time.

260
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,510
No kissing on the mouth.

261
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,073
Hello, Giorgia.

262
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,549
Why are you in here
with the blinds drawn?

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,999
Feel like coming outside?

264
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,919
Everyone's in the garden.

265
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,632
How about a few photos?

266
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,193
The light is good.

267
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,594
Come on, look at me.

268
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,955
Well?

269
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,629
Fine,

270
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,431
I'll photograph your hands.

271
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,437
You have beautiful hands.

272
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,235
What's that?
What happened to you?

273
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,716
Here. Read it and comment.

274
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,355
It's a poem by
Sennuccio del Bene.

275
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,997
Yes, but what comes to mind?

276
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,351
-Actually, nothing.
-Nothing?

277
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,232
Why nothing?

278
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,074
Because it's empty.

279
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,313
Even he's empty.

280
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,468
<i>Then give me an example of religious
poetry that particularly struck you.</i>

281
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,389
<i>Il Beccaio.</i>

282
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,319
Are you kidding me?

283
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,992
<i>Are you telling me Il Beccaio
by Cecco Angiolieri</i>

284
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,475
should be considered
religious poetry?

285
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,069
Someone who curses his parents,
the very seed from which he came?

286
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,952
-I think so.
-Well, I don't.

287
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,390
<i>And I'm the expert here,
thank you.</i>

288
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,868
What are you doing?

289
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,997
I don't feel like staying here.

290
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,876
They're signs of
electric discharge.

291
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,392
They gave her electroshocks.

292
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,475
-Where did you get these?
-Isn't that illegal?

293
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,238
<i>Unfortunately not.</i>

294
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,671
-Who's the girl?
-I'll tell you later.

295
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,191
Go study.
Isn't your exam tomorrow?

296
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,158
My professor's a jerk.

297
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,112
I'll never get a 30 like you.

298
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,233
"A 30."

299
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,033
Are you coming tomorrow?

300
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,310
We can leave as soon as I fail.

301
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,080
Come and get me at the "hole."
I'm sleeping there tonight.

302
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,431
A girl?

303
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,672
-Hi, Antonio.
-What are you doing here this late?

304
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,075
<i>I left a book upstairs.</i>

305
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,999
-I can't budge from here.
-It's okay, I'll go.

306
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,398
Don't wake them up,
or they're your problem!

307
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,594
"Giorgia Esposti. Pietracamela."

308
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,788
Giorgia.

309
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,798
Giorgia, wake up.

310
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,199
Wake up, Giorgia.

311
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,437
It's okay.
It's me, Matteo.

312
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,512
Listen to me.

313
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,837
Get your things, we're leaving.
I'll get you out of here.

314
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,710
You deserved a 28 or a 29.

315
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,150
I gave you a 30 because
I used what I call

316
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,111
"the sympathy quotient."

317
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,875
Nothing drastic,

318
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,548
but enough to get you the 30.

319
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,914
Some people disapprove

320
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,872
of my "sympathy quotient,"

321
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,839
but I believe

322
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,079
that sympathy, in the sense
of the term "sympasin,"

323
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,191
which means to share "pathos,"

324
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,112
<i>the suffering of others,
is important for doctors.</i>

325
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,949
To others I apply
the "apathy" quotient.

326
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,469
Which means I subtract
2 or 3 points.

327
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,274
Apathy is the worst thing
for a doctor.

328
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,872
In any case,
you earned it.

329
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,553
But don't be too confident.

330
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,592
You have two more
exams with me,

331
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,438
and I could still destroy you.

332
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,958
Friends of yours?

333
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,271
-Is that your clan?
-No, I...

334
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,596
<i>We're going on a trip after...</i>

335
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,518
Are they in my class?

336
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,039
I don't remember them.

337
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,552
No, Carlo studies Economics

338
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,399
<i>-and Berto, Philosophy.
-Spare me the biographies.</i>

339
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,914
Just as long as

340
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,270
they're bothering
somebody else.

341
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,517
Economics, Philosophy...
Wonderful.

342
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,957
As I was saying, you show promise.
I'm probably wrong.

343
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,952
But here's some advice.

344
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,312
-Are you ambitious?
-Well...

345
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,909
Then get out of Italy.

346
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,117
Leave before it's too late.

347
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,473
You want to be
a surgeon?

348
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,955
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind.

349
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,434
Whatever you decide,

350
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,833
go study in London or Paris
or the U.S. if you can.

351
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,192
Just get out of here.

352
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,718
Italy is doomed.

353
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,596
A beautiful, useless place...
doomed to death.

354
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,874
Are you referring to
the coming Apocalypse?

355
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,153
I wish. At least
we'd be forced to rebuild.

356
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,270
But nothing changes here.
The dinosaurs always rule.

357
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,754
Trust me, get out.

358
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,192
<i>Why haven't you left,
professor?</i>

359
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,674
Why, you ask?

360
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,357
Son, I'm one of the dinosaurs.

361
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,711
Excuse me, pardon me...
Come on, come on...!

362
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,912
<i>All aboard!
A thirty! A thirty!</i>

363
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,156
<i>A thirty on your first exam?
I hate you!</i>

364
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,909
-We're picking up Matteo, right?
-Come on, let's go!

365
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,192
What?
My dad said 4,000 R.P.M.

366
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,788
4,000 R.P.M...

367
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,956
4,000 R.P.M., come on!

368
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,720
4,000 R.P.M., here we...!

369
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,877
<i>Go, Berto, go!
Yeah!</i>

370
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,674
Giorgia.

371
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,749
Giorgia!

372
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,551
Wake up.
We have to leave.

373
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,518
I made you coffee.

374
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,389
Sugar?

375
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,198
One, two?

376
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,029
None?

377
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,795
If the professor was talking
about specializing, I agree.

378
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,468
But working abroad...
I don't know.

379
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,511
So you think there's work
here in Italy?

380
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,832
Yeah. There's 7 percent
annual growth,

381
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,031
and 3 percent unemployment.

382
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,958
-So?
-Thing's are good.

383
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,630
Unemployment only goes up
if growth dips under 4 percent.

384
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,274
So there'll be plenty of work.

385
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,993
No, I don't think that's

386
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,475
likely because
in the next few years

387
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,638
<i>the generation born after the war
will all graduate.</i>

388
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,478
Inflation will increase,

389
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,318
the job market will be tight.

390
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,274
I'd estimate that

391
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,278
one out of every three graduates
won't find work.

392
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,997
By far the dumbest
of the three.

393
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,716
Would you cut it out already!

394
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,355
I think the Appenine highway
is much better.

395
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,755
It would take us 20 days
to get to Turin!

396
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,599
We haven't seen a single
attractive hitchhiker.

397
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,075
That's all you ever
think about.

398
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,271
-What exactly?
-Where's Matteo?

399
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,629
How should I know?

400
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,319
Go find him.

401
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,114
-Fine, I'll just grab the keys...
-There he is.

402
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,515
-Just as well.
-Come on.

403
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,636
Come on.

404
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,432
-Who's that?
-No idea. I don't know her.

405
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,399
-Wasn't he coming alone?
-He didn't mention anything.

406
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,508
-Hold on, I'll go see.
-Find out.

407
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,430
We said no girlfriends.

408
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,679
Let's see what he has to say.
Maybe she's not coming.

409
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,035
No.

410
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,073
That girl is strange.
There's something...

411
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,432
Who is she,
the one in the photos?

412
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,271
-What's the problem?
-It's a delicate situation.

413
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,629
Well?

414
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,314
We'll meet in Brennero
in two days.

415
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,158
Are you crazy?

416
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,999
We were sleeping in Brennero
tonight. We'll lose two days.

417
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,670
-When will we get to Hamburg?
-In two days, at customs.

418
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,715
Because of that girl?

419
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,239
Yeah, because of her.

420
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,868
Is she a runaway?

421
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,074
More or less.

422
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,358
-Come on, we'll take you.
-No, it's okay.

423
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,120
We can handle it.
Have a good trip!

424
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,632
-Take care.
-Have fun.

425
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,308
Have a nice trip.

426
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,874
No speeding, -eh?

427
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,754
When I saw the state
she was in, I thought...

428
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,271
-You did the right thing.
-And the electroshock therapy...

429
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,113
You're right, it's awful.

430
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,990
But we have to
take her somewhere.

431
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,992
Her mother is dead.
Her father lives in Pietracamela.

432
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,999
-Where's that?
-I don't know.

433
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,679
In the Appenines, I think.

434
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,752
We'll drop her off there.

435
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,152
Okay. Giorgia!

436
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,270
Giorgia!

437
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,356
Giorgia!

438
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,029
Come here.

439
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,631
You see how she acts?
She's weird.

440
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,598
What's wrong with her?

441
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,319
She's crazy.

442
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,638
No, she isn't.

443
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,358
She has intelligent eyes.

444
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,593
You and her...

445
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,393
Nice couple.

446
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,755
Giorgia!

447
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,679
Giorgia!

448
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,799
So you do remember, eh?
Giorgia!

449
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,712
How are you, Giorgia?

450
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,431
My priest can't remember me,
but you sure remember yours.

451
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,868
You're so beautiful!

452
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,989
You look absolutely wonderful.

453
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,548
-Who are they?
-Hello.

454
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,193
-Hello.
-Nicola.

455
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,516
-Vito, nice to meet you.
-Likewise, Matteo.

456
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,158
-Can I help you?
-We're looking for Giorgia's father.

457
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,950
<i>Giorgia's father
left years ago.</i>

458
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,277
-He went to Ravenna.
-Ravenna?

459
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,112
Three or four years ago.

460
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,273
Are you from the clinic?

461
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,835
Yeah, we're from Villa Quieta.

462
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,479
So young?

463
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,074
So why have you brought
this beautiful girl home?

464
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,511
-For a vacation.
-A vacation.

465
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,436
I had her confirmed.
We're all God's creatures.

466
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,191
Giorgia, tell me,
what were your lines?

467
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,276
What did you say?

468
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,268
<i>"Lord, I am not worthy of You...</i>

469
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,278
...but a single word of Yours
will cure me."

470
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,993
Very good!

471
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,631
When she was little
she knew the whole Angelus.

472
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,349
Though for her
the word of God

473
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,556
was like a game, a routine,
nothing more.

474
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,432
It happens to many.

475
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,597
You're right.
What's your name?

476
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,994
-Matteo.
-And you?

477
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,918
-Nicola.
-Hello, Nicola.

478
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,832
Maybe because her mother died
when she was young.

479
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,478
And she became obsessive.

480
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,638
<i>She'd clean everything
and then start all over again.</i>

481
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,230
The bedrooms, the kitchen,
the stable...

482
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,155
I don't know why.

483
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,675
When's the next train
to Ravenna?

484
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,799
<i>It just left.</i>

485
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,918
You should have asked sooner.

486
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,078
<i>You can take it tomorrow at 7
and arrive in the afternoon.</i>

487
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,191
Tomorrow?
We have to leave now!

488
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,556
That's impossible, okay?

489
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,752
-You know what that means?
-Then what do we do?

490
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,239
I have a place where
you can sleep. It's a...

491
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,317
Not a stable, a shed.

492
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,389
Better than a punch
in the face.

493
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,915
Am I right?

494
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,272
Here we are, Madame.
We've prepared for you

495
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,677
<i>the imperial suite.
Make yourself comfortable</i>

496
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,316
on this magnificent
bed of straw.

497
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,790
We also have a beautiful divider

498
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,710
to provide you intimacy

499
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,832
from the two heroes,
Ajax Paddycake

500
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,349
and Achilles Quick Foot.
We have a lovely blanket,

501
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,995
kindly donated
by the clergy of Pietracamela.

502
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,318
So if you're cold
you can cover yourself.

503
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,351
My dress stays on, eh?

504
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,476
My dress stays on.

505
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,788
It stays on.

506
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,033
Fine, leave it on.

507
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,471
You know what?
I'll leave mine on, too.

508
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,672
Let's go to sleep.

509
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,515
Giorgia.

510
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,470
Tomorrow you'll sleep
at your father's.

511
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,069
I have no father.
I have no father.

512
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,073
Thief! Thief!

513
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,679
Let go, you bastard!

514
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,313
You're a thief!
A thief!

515
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,636
-Calm down!
-Let go, it's mine!

516
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,279
Thief!

517
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,756
Giorgia!

518
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,315
Come here!

519
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,589
Let me go!

520
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,279
-What?
-Leave me alone!

521
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,593
-Let go!
-I didn't know.

522
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,075
-Let go, thief!
-Listen.

523
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,793
-Thief!
-No I'm not!

524
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,514
-You're a thief!
-I didn't know it was yours!

525
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,398
-Thief!
-It was on the ground...

526
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,556
-Stop it!
-I didn't know.

527
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,479
-What happened?
-Nothing, I picked up...

528
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,989
Stop! You have to leave!

529
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,072
-It was on the ground.
-Go away.

530
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,033
I didn't do anything.

531
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,148
I'll handle it.

532
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,794
Giorgia.

533
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,470
-Come in, it's raining.
-Stop it!

534
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,588
Come on, we'll get wet.
Giorgia, let's go inside.

535
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,029
Come on!

536
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,112
You should put something on.
Try something of mine.

537
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,389
You like it?

538
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,393
Go on, put that on.

539
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,309
Are you ashamed?

540
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,753
Go behind there.

541
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,955
Go on.

542
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,154
Next time you want a shower,
I'll take you to the Grand Hotel.

543
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,468
Ready?

544
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,160
-What's taking so long?
-The buttons...

545
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,788
-Can I?
-Yes.

546
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,548
I'll help you.

547
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,358
<i>Sure, the buttons are
the most complicated part.</i>

548
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,070
So are the shoelaces,

549
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,920
but the buttons
are pretty tough.

550
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,396
lmagine if the priest
came in right now.

551
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,711
He'd curse us
and we'd go to hell.

552
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,238
You're pretty when you smile.

553
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,878
You did it, see?

554
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,432
Go on, go to sleep.

555
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,799
Good night.

556
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,555
-Shall I turn off the light?
-No, no.

557
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,558
Okay, the light stays on.

558
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,553
Good night.

559
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,552
What happened?

560
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,034
Nothing.

561
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,236
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

562
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,273
-Do you know where Mr. Saro lives?
-Here, he's my husband.

563
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,152
Where can we find him?

564
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,039
What do you want?

565
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,196
Nothing.
Personal business.

566
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,397
Aren't you Giorgia?

567
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,911
Shouldn't you be at the clinic?

568
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,719
Who are these two?

569
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,669
Bitch.

570
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,279
Giorgia!

571
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,275
Giorgia!

572
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,593
What are you doing here?

573
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,755
-What happened?
-Nothing.

574
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,315
We think the clinic
isn't right for her.

575
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,189
What do you mean?

576
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,309
They mistreat her.

577
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,955
They give her electroshocks.

578
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,388
Electroshocks?

579
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,028
What does that mean?

580
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,674
-Electrical discharges.
-What?

581
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,359
<i>Doesn't that hurt?</i>

582
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,959
It isn't pleasant.

583
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,429
<i>I pay a fortune for her to be
at the clinic,</i>

584
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,596
so that she's all right...

585
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,915
So she gets better!

586
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,395
Why not keep her at home?

587
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,156
How can I?
What about my other kids?

588
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,352
Brothers live together.

589
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,118
They're not her brothers.

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,276
They're Rosa's kids.
But Rosa loves you.

591
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,279
And them, too.

592
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,119
It's you,
you're the one out of place.

593
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,353
Look, I...

594
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,630
I took you there
so you'd be all right,

595
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,910
so you'd get better.

596
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,069
Giorgia.

597
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,110
Giorgia, now...

598
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,109
We'll take you back
to the clinic.

599
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,668
Why not give it a chance?

600
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,474
We'll take you back
to the clinic, that way

601
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,159
you'll be okay and...

602
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,549
What Giorgia needs is a father!

603
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,354
But I... I am a father!

604
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,758
Giorgia, I love you.
You know that, don't you?

605
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,394
Then prove it.
Keep her here with you.

606
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,876
How can I?
Life is expensive!

607
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,071
With what the clinic costs me...

608
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,432
She needs family affection!

609
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,798
-We tried, but...
-Oh, right! You're too sick!

610
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,271
I won't discuss private stuff

611
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,710
-in front of strangers.
-What kind of father are you?

612
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,035
-Who are you?
-It's your daughter!

613
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,958
I know it's my daughter!

614
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,559
Mind your own business!

615
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,557
-What did you say?
-Calm down!

616
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,591
-Don't touch me!
-What?

617
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,119
Calm down!

618
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,673
Calm down!

619
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,912
-Stay calm! Relax!
-Damn!

620
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,114
-Now where do we go?
-I don't know.

621
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,629
Did you have to rough up
her dad like that?

622
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,309
She can come with us.

623
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,999
Where?

624
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,154
<i>To meet Carlo and Berto,
in Brennero.</i>

625
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,232
How do we cross the border?

626
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,794
<i>She has no passport.</i>

627
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,991
Think a little for a change.

628
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,989
What do you want to eat?

629
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,709
Nothing.

630
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,753
You don't eat or drink...
Besides...

631
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,791
Leave her alone.
She cut herself.

632
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,956
Don't sit there,
get a napkin.

633
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,674
-What if she hit a vein?
-What vein?

634
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,310
-She should go to the hospital.
-Just get a napkin.

635
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,910
Cheyenne method.
Make a tourniquet.

636
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,349
What happened?

637
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,629
Nothing, we broke a glass.

638
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,308
-Korea scored.
-Who cares?

639
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,479
That's right, we could care less.
We don't give a hoot.

640
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,789
You know what?
I want Korea to win.

641
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,075
Korea, Korea, Korea!

642
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,551
<i>Porto Marghera Station.</i>

643
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,870
<i>Porto Marghera Station.</i>

644
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,238
<i>Connections to Mestre,
Ponzano Veneto...</i>

645
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,351
-Bye.
-Bye.

646
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,512
-Okay, wait for me here.
-What will you tell Giovanna?

647
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,360
<i>That we had a problem
after we left.</i>

648
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,120
<i>How will you explain
Carlo and Berto not being here?</i>

649
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,116
Trust me.

650
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,029
I'm a specialist, right?

651
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,678
I don't trust my sister.

652
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,714
-She'll have all 3 of us locked up.
-That's why we're not all going.

653
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,355
-And what should we do?
-Use your imagination!

654
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,316
There's a bar, have a drink.
I'll leave my stuff.

655
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,272
All right? See you later.

656
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,430
Bye.

657
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,353
You want something to drink?

658
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,237
Oh, you're angry with me.
Don't talk to me.

659
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,875
Give me a sign.

660
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,673
Say yes or no.

661
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,073
What's that, a yes?

662
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,436
-Hello.
-Hi. What'll it be?

663
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,719
What do you want to drink?

664
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,668
Giorgia.

665
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,552
You want to hear something?

666
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,759
What do you like?

667
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,549
EIvis?

668
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,474
Sandy Shaw?

669
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,559
What does that mean?

670
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,275
Oh, "A chi," Fausto Leali.

671
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,034
I'll see if they have it.

672
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,152
Here it is. B3.

673
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,115
B3.

674
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,719
<i>Who will</i>

675
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,954
<i>I smile at</i>

676
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,237
<i>if not at you?</i>

677
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,797
<i>Who...</i>

678
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,148
<i>if you're...</i>

679
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,954
<i>not here anymore?</i>

680
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,071
<i>By now...</i>

681
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,230
<i>it's over,</i>

682
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,956
<i>it's over</i>

683
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,830
<i>between us.</i>

684
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,076
<i>Your friend Berto
is in trouble.</i>

685
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,909
The girl's father is her legal
guardian. It's up to him.

686
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,429
It's the law.

687
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,632
He thought they'd kill her
if he left her there.

688
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,149
He should have reported it
to the authorities.

689
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,749
He took control of
another person.

690
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,790
-Do these things happen to you?
-I don't let them.

691
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,434
You wouldn't know it,
but thousands work in there.

692
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,914
Lots of problems?

693
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,590
The usual. Labor issues,
firings, diseases, accidents...

694
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,028
We have it all.

695
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,312
The factory never closes.

696
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,318
They work day and night,
through summer and winter.

697
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,359
That's why the sea and sky
have changed colors.

698
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,638
They say it's nothing
to worry about,

699
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,309
but last week
they handed these out.

700
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,032
-Toothpaste?
-Yeah.

701
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,357
The message was make sure
you brush before eating

702
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,788
<i>and not after, get it?</i>

703
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,758
Not really.

704
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,558
The dust that gets
on your teeth

705
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,557
and in your nose
is toxic.

706
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,069
In the long term
it can cause cancer.

707
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,589
Listen.

708
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,673
This happened to you, right?
I mean, Matteo.

709
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,474
<i>-He got you into this.
-No, it was Berto.</i>

710
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,277
Why don't you contact the
psychiatric hospital in Gorizia?

711
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,471
I'm sure they're great.
But it's still an asylum.

712
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,796
At least they don't
tie people up

713
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,399
or electroshock them.

714
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,198
What if we bring her here?

715
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,914
<i>I'd have to report it.</i>

716
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,833
They'd come

717
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,634
and take her back
to her father, got it?

718
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,438
When does the train come?

719
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,038
In half an hour.
Hey, go buy three ice creams.

720
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,991
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

721
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,798
No, not me.

722
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,434
Why not? It's easy.
You have legs, don't you?

723
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,390
-I'll go.
-No, wait.

724
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,828
She's going.

725
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,429
Go on, three ice creams.

726
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,714
-I won't be able to.
-Sure you will, it's easy.

727
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,119
Yes, young lady?

728
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,675
-Three ice creams.
-Three ice creams.

729
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,275
You think taking her to Gorizia
is the answer?

730
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,073
I think so.

731
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,550
Giovanna says
it's a good hospital.

732
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,592
If the doctors
don't convince us,

733
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,756
we can take a vacation
or something.

734
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,274
How about Sicily?

735
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,235
Here.

736
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,634
Your change.

737
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,036
Miss, wait! Your change!

738
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,518
<i>-Afternoon.
-Afternoon.</i>

739
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,358
-Two coffees.
-Coming right up.

740
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,039
Miss, your change.

741
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,118
-Your change.
-Your change, Miss.

742
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,994
-Do you know her?
-No.

743
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,714
-She just came in.
-Is something wrong?

744
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,873
I don't know,
she won't take her change.

745
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,514
-I see.
-Are you with someone?

746
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,395
-No, I'm alone.
-Have you got any ID?

747
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,957
She won't answer.
We'll take her in.

748
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,834
Come with us.
Come on.

749
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,559
What do we do with this?

750
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,828
I don't know.

751
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,798
What will happen to her?

752
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,112
They'll take her back
to the clinic, I guess.

753
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,677
Can't anything be done about it?

754
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,034
We'll take the train
in the morning then.

755
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,518
-We continue the trip, right?
-Yeah, sure.

756
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,159
Okay, let's get some rest.

757
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,471
<i>Now arriving on platform one,</i>

758
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,559
<i>the 02:10 train to Padua,
Florence and Rome.</i>

759
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,233
<i>Now arriving on platform one,</i>

760
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,511
<i>the 02:10 train</i>

761
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,915
<i>to Padua, Florence and Rome.</i>

762
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,352
Matteo, what are you doing?

763
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,759
-My trip is over.
-Over?

764
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,359
I'm going back to Rome.

765
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,395
Why?

766
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,475
What's wrong?
Have you gone mad?

767
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:09,206
You know that exam I had?

768
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:10,717
What about it?

769
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:12,837
I failed it.

770
00:56:13,043 --> 00:56:14,396
You failed it?

771
00:56:15,483 --> 00:56:16,632
Why didn't you tell me?

772
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:20,442
What's that got to do
with the trip?

773
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,158
-Nothing.
-Then get off.

774
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:27,519
The train's leaving!
Get off!

775
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:29,714
You leave me sitting here
on a bench?

776
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:32,198
-Get off!
-Goodbye.

777
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:34,281
What do you mean, goodbye?

778
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:49,312
Nicola!

779
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:54,991
Nicola!

780
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:47,082
Where's the recruiting office?

781
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:55,238
What should I do if I want
to join the army right away?

782
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:01,958
What should you do?

783
00:58:04,363 --> 00:58:06,752
Have your head examined.

784
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:09,722
<i>Dear Matteo,</i>

785
00:59:10,643 --> 00:59:12,395
<i>I assume Mom and Dad
will know how</i>

786
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:14,241
<i>to get you this letter.</i>

787
00:59:14,443 --> 00:59:16,035
<i>Where are you?</i>

788
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:18,155
<i>Any news from Carlo and Berto?</i>

789
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:20,718
<i>I haven't seen them.
I took the trip alone.</i>

790
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:22,720
<i>But here I am.</i>

791
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:27,596
<i>Norway is magnificent,
I'm especially impressed</i>

792
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:29,475
<i>by the people I've met.</i>

793
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,758
<i>Martin, for example,
an American desertor.</i>

794
00:59:32,963 --> 00:59:36,000
<i>He fled America to avoid
having to go to Vietnam.</i>

795
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:08,801
-Who wrote that?
-A genius.

796
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:11,563
-What's his name?
-AIlen Ginsberg.

797
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:47,316
<i>I've left my friends
and I continue north.</i>

798
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:51,802
<i>You won't believe me, but there's a
wooden church right in front of me</i>

799
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:54,881
<i>a few feet away
from a marker that says</i>

800
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:58,234
<i>that the Arctic Circle line
passes through here.</i>

801
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:01,035
<i>Right now my classmates</i>

802
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:04,121
<i>are probably arriving
at class with the old dinosaur.</i>

803
01:02:04,723 --> 01:02:06,475
<i>I don't feel guilty,</i>

804
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:08,794
<i>no sense whatsoever
of time wasted.</i>

805
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:13,718
<i>My dear animal,
here's some important news:</i>

806
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:16,841
<i>I'll never shave again,
or get a haircut.</i>

807
01:02:17,403 --> 01:02:18,677
<i>I'll send a photo.</i>

808
01:02:20,963 --> 01:02:22,112
<i>I look good, eh?</i>

809
01:02:45,323 --> 01:02:47,917
What the fuck are you doing?

810
01:02:52,283 --> 01:02:55,275
Get back or I'll break your arm!

811
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:57,519
-Relax!
-I'm not kidding!

812
01:02:57,723 --> 01:02:58,917
Don't joke around!

813
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,559
-Cut it out!
-Are you nuts?

814
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:04,242
Don't bust my balls!

815
01:03:09,523 --> 01:03:12,083
-He's crazy.
-Are you bonkers or what?

816
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:15,112
Are you okay?

817
01:03:15,363 --> 01:03:16,557
<i>He hurt me.</i>

818
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:58,275
<i>I've run out of money,
I'll stop at a sawmill.</i>

819
01:03:59,163 --> 01:04:02,121
<i>They pay well
and they always need people.</i>

820
01:04:19,483 --> 01:04:21,838
<i>The girls are beautiful,
easy-going,</i>

821
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:23,999
<i>without all the usual
Italian melodrama</i>

822
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:26,000
<i>when you give them
a compliment.</i>

823
01:04:35,483 --> 01:04:36,393
Move!

824
01:04:36,603 --> 01:04:38,321
Come on, move!

825
01:04:38,643 --> 01:04:40,440
Move your ass!

826
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:45,034
You want to get killed?
You bunch of pussies!

827
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:47,160
Come on, move it, fuckers!

828
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:49,953
You'll be at it all day!

829
01:04:50,163 --> 01:04:53,075
I'll kick your asses!
Move it!

830
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:01,323
<i>-Shave!
-Keep quiet! Step forward!</i>

831
01:08:01,523 --> 01:08:02,638
Remember,

832
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:04,834
you represent more
than just yourselves.

833
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,238
You represent the army,
got it?

834
01:08:10,363 --> 01:08:12,672
And let's get
one thing straight.

835
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:14,516
<i>No smart-asses.</i>

836
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,520
No clowning around.

837
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:18,759
And no bullshit.
Got it?

838
01:08:22,283 --> 01:08:23,682
<i>-Necktie!
-Step forward!</i>

839
01:08:23,883 --> 01:08:25,839
<i>-Dirty shoes!
-Step forward!</i>

840
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:28,997
-Is that a backpack?
-Sorry.

841
01:08:29,203 --> 01:08:30,875
<i>-Back in line!
-Step forward!</i>

842
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:33,362
You can't do this to me.

843
01:08:33,563 --> 01:08:36,316
I called my mother,
she's all alone.

844
01:08:36,523 --> 01:08:39,515
My father's ill.
I'm the only paycheck they've got.

845
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:41,151
Ten hut!

846
01:08:50,723 --> 01:08:52,475
-What are you doing?
-I'm not going.

847
01:08:57,603 --> 01:08:58,752
Wonderful.

848
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:04,753
Then you won't go
tomorrow, either!

849
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,358
Shut-ins stay in the barracks!

850
01:09:15,603 --> 01:09:17,594
Everyone else outside!

851
01:10:09,523 --> 01:10:12,083
<i>Sometimes I remember Giorgia.</i>

852
01:10:12,363 --> 01:10:14,923
<i>How she got away,
how we couldn't protect her...</i>

853
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:19,002
<i>When I get back
I might study psychiatry.</i>

854
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:22,242
<i>Something must be done
for people like her.</i>

855
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:27,320
<i>We can't leave them at the mercy
of electroshock therapy.</i>

856
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:29,276
You're amazing, Matteo.

857
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:32,519
You sure got up
the lieutenant's ass.

858
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:35,397
But you're odd.

859
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:37,918
You got yourself
shut in for 3 days.

860
01:10:38,123 --> 01:10:40,478
Well, you could have come up
with a better excuse.

861
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,839
A sick father,
a sister out of work...

862
01:10:43,123 --> 01:10:44,954
What excuse?
It was all true.

863
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:47,513
You don't get it.
I don't have a job.

864
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,322
I'm hoping to enlist.

865
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:52,272
But you said you were
already getting paid.

866
01:10:53,043 --> 01:10:54,840
Okay, that was my only lie.

867
01:10:57,683 --> 01:10:58,832
And you know what?

868
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:01,241
You should enlist as well.

869
01:11:01,443 --> 01:11:02,671
Are you stupid?

870
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,316
You could make general.

871
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:46,434
Move it! Get moving!

872
01:13:55,123 --> 01:13:56,033
Nicola!

873
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,042
Ten hut!

874
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:00,276
Five minutes of rest

875
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:01,996
<i>and we start.</i>

876
01:14:02,523 --> 01:14:03,922
At ease!

877
01:14:04,643 --> 01:14:05,758
Fall out!

878
01:14:06,163 --> 01:14:07,152
Nicola!

879
01:14:07,683 --> 01:14:08,638
Nicola!

880
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:10,921
Matteo?

881
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:14,432
Hey!

882
01:14:15,923 --> 01:14:18,357
-What's with the disguise?
-It's real.

883
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:21,277
-What about school?
-I dropped out.

884
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:24,236
I'll explain later.
Luigi, come here.

885
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,680
This is Nicola, my brother.

886
01:14:27,883 --> 01:14:29,111
-Hi.
-Nicola.

887
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:30,517
Is this my brother?

888
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:33,032
How should I know?
You don't look alike.

889
01:14:37,883 --> 01:14:39,032
Coming through.

890
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:41,917
Excuse me.

891
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:46,594
Excuse me, pardon me.

892
01:14:48,163 --> 01:14:49,118
Thanks.

893
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:54,199
Excuse me, professor.
Anything valuable?

894
01:14:54,643 --> 01:14:57,157
-Yes, I'm checking.
-I'll send people.

895
01:14:57,363 --> 01:14:58,478
Thank you.

896
01:15:00,483 --> 01:15:02,041
Slowly, careful...

897
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:03,676
Careful with the water.

898
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:05,512
Slowly.

899
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,116
Watch out...

900
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,122
Watch your step.

901
01:15:09,603 --> 01:15:11,321
They're valuable books.

902
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:13,436
There's no hurry.

903
01:15:13,723 --> 01:15:15,042
It's slippery.

904
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:18,397
Carati, where are you?

905
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:21,113
Over here, sir!

906
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:28,515
-You guys all right?
-Yeah, no problem.

907
01:15:28,883 --> 01:15:30,282
Then Pezzuco can come with me.

908
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:31,673
Yeah.

909
01:15:41,963 --> 01:15:44,238
What's with that expressive,
vernacular gesture?

910
01:15:44,443 --> 01:15:47,082
I can see you've never served.

911
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:50,076
-I wouldn't want to.
-The guy with the beard.

912
01:15:50,443 --> 01:15:52,513
The guy with the beard
who saved up a ton.

913
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:54,880
They pay great up there.

914
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,311
Yeah, congratulations.

915
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,316
I won't go back to Rome.

916
01:15:58,523 --> 01:16:00,798
-What about school?
-I'll study somewhere else.

917
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:01,958
Careful.

918
01:16:02,163 --> 01:16:05,235
<i>After seeing Europe,
going back to Mom and Dad</i>

919
01:16:05,443 --> 01:16:06,558
depresses me.

920
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:08,834
What about you?
When do you get out?

921
01:16:09,043 --> 01:16:11,557
-Never.
-What do you mean, never?

922
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:15,756
-I'm going to enlist.
-Enlist?

923
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:19,400
-Yeah, to be a cop.
-Are you kidding me?

924
01:16:19,683 --> 01:16:20,752
Not at all.

925
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:23,081
You're going to be a cop?

926
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:25,842
What are you talking about?

927
01:16:30,923 --> 01:16:32,436
You fell for it.

928
01:16:33,123 --> 01:16:35,398
-You were kidding?
-Nicola!

929
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:39,718
Look!

930
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,236
Who knows what it was before.

931
01:16:50,163 --> 01:16:53,280
-Illumination code, in Latin.
-I've got a flashlight.

Why did the line stop?
Come on, boys!

939
01:17:17,483 --> 01:17:19,394
-Move your asses!
-You hear that?

940
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,798
lmagine an idiot like that

You look like a lumberjack.

-We waited two days in Bolzano.
-Three.

950

You weren't there
so I kept going.

Liar. He called your mother.

952
01:18:14,243 --> 01:18:16,552
I called your mom.
"He's in Hamburg."

953
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:19,596
Let's have a look around.
What do you say?

954

<i>-You left me at the exams.

What about girls?
No...

-They said over here.

01:19:36,643 --> 01:19:37,712
What have they got?

967
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:39,197
Wine, bread, stuff...

968
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,722
Nice coats!

969
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,193
They're Lorenzo the Magnificent's
grandchildren!

970
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:48,117
-Full of mud.
-He's unbelievable.

971
01:19:49,443 --> 01:19:51,718
A wonderful character,
right out of Chekov!

972
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:54,956
Right out of
"The Cherry Orchard."

973
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:57,074
-Firs, it's him.
-Who's Firs?

974
01:19:57,283 --> 01:19:59,592
The old crippled guy, right?

975
01:19:59,803 --> 01:20:03,591
The angels of mud have come
from everywhere to help us.

976
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:05,361
Give them a sandwich.

977
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:07,037
That's it, good.

978
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:10,198
Let's see how
those boys are doing.

979
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:14,639
Good morning, ladies.

980
01:20:14,883 --> 01:20:17,636
-What are you doing?
-I was kidding.

981
01:20:17,843 --> 01:20:20,038
Oh, right.
Give them some, too.

982
01:20:20,243 --> 01:20:22,552
A bottle of wine,
a sandwich...

983
01:20:23,003 --> 01:20:24,231
Just one, you see?

984
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:26,559
-There.
-Who are the girls?

985
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:28,401
The Riccobaldi daughters.

986
01:20:28,643 --> 01:20:31,760
You could say we were lucky.

987
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:35,717
The house is high up
and suffered no damage.

988
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:39,234
The Marquis wanted,
through his daughters,

989
01:20:40,323 --> 01:20:44,760
to offer...
a gesture of gratitude.

990
01:20:45,323 --> 01:20:47,439
How nice of the Marquis!

991
01:20:47,763 --> 01:20:49,640
And I'm stuck
with the wheelbarrow!

992
01:20:50,923 --> 01:20:54,074
Well, I don't know.
I'm joking, of course.

993
01:22:54,323 --> 01:22:56,678
<i>I started studying piano
when I was ten.</i>

994
01:22:58,003 --> 01:23:00,039
Now I'm studying Mathematics
in Turin.

995
01:23:01,283 --> 01:23:03,672
What's that got to do
with the piano?

996
01:23:05,003 --> 01:23:07,801
The piano was my mother's choice,
Mathematics was mine.

997
01:23:08,523 --> 01:23:10,400
Who would choose Mathematics?

998
01:23:10,603 --> 01:23:12,833
Someone who wants to solve

999
01:23:13,043 --> 01:23:15,193
the jealous husband problem.

1000
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:16,631
What's that?

1001
01:23:16,843 --> 01:23:19,198
-What do you mean?
-Never heard of it?

1002
01:23:19,403 --> 01:23:21,280
It hasn't made it to Rome yet.

1003
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,912
Let's see.

1004
01:23:23,363 --> 01:23:24,796
Three couples.

1005
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:26,278
-Couples.
-Couples.

1006
01:23:26,483 --> 01:23:27,962
-They have to be couples.
-Yeah.

1007
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,677
How boring!

1008
01:23:31,763 --> 01:23:33,401
They have to cross a river.

1009
01:23:33,923 --> 01:23:35,197
There's only one boat

1010
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:38,641
that can only carry
two people at a time.

1011
01:23:39,243 --> 01:23:40,722
But the jealous husbands

1012
01:23:40,923 --> 01:23:44,154
don't want their wives
to ride with anyone else.

1013
01:23:44,363 --> 01:23:46,638
-No wonder.
-What's the game?

1014
01:23:46,843 --> 01:23:49,232
How all six of them
cross the river.

1015
01:23:50,003 --> 01:23:51,118
It's simple, look.

1016
01:23:51,923 --> 01:23:54,801
Well, first...

1017
01:23:55,003 --> 01:23:57,801
two women cross,
they reach the other side.

1018
01:23:58,003 --> 01:23:59,595
One of them goes back.

1019
01:24:00,843 --> 01:24:01,958
Her husband gets in,

1020
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,835
they cross together...

1021
01:24:04,043 --> 01:24:05,158
What do you know?

1022
01:24:06,203 --> 01:24:07,875
She leaves him there,

1023
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,277
goes back again...

1024
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:12,435
-No.
-Drops him off, goes back...

1025
01:24:12,683 --> 01:24:13,718
No, no, wait.

1026
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:16,995
First the two husbands cross.

1027
01:24:17,203 --> 01:24:19,080
-It's the same.
-It's the same!

1028
01:24:19,283 --> 01:24:21,353
Where are we going?
I give up.

1029
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:23,241
-Good.
-It's not so hard.

1030
01:24:23,763 --> 01:24:25,719
-I can tell you.
-Another time.

1031
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:27,595
Okay? Another time.

1032
01:24:27,923 --> 01:24:28,992
-Another time.
-Hey, tell me.

1033
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:30,682
When you finish,

1034
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:32,874
will you be a math professor

1035
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:36,598
-or a musician?
-Not a professor.

1036
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:40,193
I don't think a musician,
either.

1037
01:24:40,683 --> 01:24:42,162
She's got her ideas straight.

1038
01:24:43,683 --> 01:24:45,560
You have to be
one or the other.

1039
01:24:45,763 --> 01:24:46,718
Yeah, right.

1040
01:24:48,123 --> 01:24:50,432
We should all enroll in Turin
like her.

1041
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:52,122
Why in Turin?

1042
01:24:52,323 --> 01:24:53,358
In Turin, in Turin.

1043
01:24:54,283 --> 01:24:56,751
-He's crazy!
-Basically, yes.

1044
01:24:58,363 --> 01:25:00,797
<i>-Berto, let's go to Turin.
-Right, Turin.</i>

1045
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:03,039
I won't even finish
my studies in Rome.

1046
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:04,722
My dad wants me
at the factory.

1047
01:25:06,683 --> 01:25:08,514
-It's not funny.
-What about you, Carlo?

1048
01:25:09,363 --> 01:25:10,512
You like Turin?

1049
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:12,042
Turin?

1050
01:25:12,243 --> 01:25:13,835
Agnelli, Fiat...

1051
01:25:14,043 --> 01:25:15,032
All that candy...

1052
01:25:15,323 --> 01:25:17,200
-Come on!
-I don't know.

1053
01:25:20,763 --> 01:25:21,878
Are you cold?

1054
01:25:25,643 --> 01:25:27,520
-What are you doing?
-Giving you this.

1055
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:29,555
-No.
-Come on.

1056
01:25:32,603 --> 01:25:34,002
<i>-Berto.
-Yeah.</i>

1057
01:25:34,603 --> 01:25:36,958
I think it's time for bed.

1058
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:39,040
-I'm not sleepy.
-Good night.

1059
01:25:39,243 --> 01:25:40,232
Come on.

1060
01:25:40,443 --> 01:25:41,842
Oh, good night.

1061
01:25:42,123 --> 01:25:44,239
-Good night.
-Bye.

1062
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:46,352
Good night.

1063
01:25:50,523 --> 01:25:51,842
You didn't get rid of them...

1064
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:55,156
No... just good night.

1065
01:26:00,043 --> 01:26:01,317
Listen...

1066
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:03,721
if I come to Turin,

1067
01:26:04,203 --> 01:26:05,522
can I stay with you?

1068
01:26:05,723 --> 01:26:07,122
You're out of your mind.

1069
01:26:07,603 --> 01:26:09,082
I don't even know you.

1070
01:26:13,763 --> 01:26:15,754
TURIN, FEBRU ARY OF 1968

1071
01:26:16,363 --> 01:26:17,398
Nicola!

1072
01:26:18,763 --> 01:26:20,401
No, you have to pull...

1073
01:26:20,923 --> 01:26:23,483
<i>A bit further...
No, to the right.</i>

1074
01:26:23,683 --> 01:26:26,436
A bit more on the...
No, no, no.

1075
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:27,917
No, no, look.

1076
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,682
Watch what he does.

1077
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:31,795
No, no. Nicola.

1078
01:26:32,483 --> 01:26:33,677
Nicola!

1079
01:26:34,043 --> 01:26:35,192
Nicola, I love you.

1080
01:26:36,683 --> 01:26:38,594
<i>I love you with all my heart.</i>

1081
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:41,842
Nicola! Nicola, careful!
The riot police!

1082
01:26:42,763 --> 01:26:44,037
Let them go!

1083
01:26:46,363 --> 01:26:51,517
Police, get out!
Police, get out!

1084
01:26:58,523 --> 01:26:59,592
Hi, Paolo.

1085
01:27:20,243 --> 01:27:23,155
Bring your bike inside.

1086
01:27:24,843 --> 01:27:27,641
Sure, with all these people
from the south around...

1087
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,152
Shut up and make the puree.

1088
01:27:30,363 --> 01:27:32,399
-Right away, dear.
-With those hands?

1089
01:27:32,763 --> 01:27:35,038
-That's right.
-Where's Carlo? Carlo!

1090
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:39,441
Come here.
Your master calls...

1091
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:43,235
Vitale, we need information
as well.

1092
01:27:44,363 --> 01:27:47,480
Someone needs to find out
what they want.

1093
01:27:47,843 --> 01:27:51,882
Why even read the papers? They want
to stick it to us right here.

1094
01:27:53,363 --> 01:27:54,762
How English of you.

1095
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:56,362
-"Very British."
-Oxford.

1096
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:57,757
All right, guys.

1097
01:27:57,963 --> 01:28:00,477
No more calling me a hick.

1098
01:28:00,683 --> 01:28:02,639
I'm really from Turin.

1099
01:28:02,843 --> 01:28:04,117
Really?

1100
01:28:06,003 --> 01:28:07,152
Look at that.

1101
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:09,718
It's not even funny.

1102
01:28:10,563 --> 01:28:13,157
While the cops fight with
little rich boys like you...

1103
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:15,202
That's enough!

1104
01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:18,677
<i>Yeah, let the painters
and reporters step forward.</i>

1105
01:28:18,923 --> 01:28:22,120
That would have
the riot police running!

1106
01:28:22,323 --> 01:28:23,881
Cut it out!

1107
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,311
Run!

1108
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:27,713
The union said
not to provoke anyone!

1109
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:31,882
Watch what you say
about the union!

1110
01:28:32,523 --> 01:28:33,751
Yeah, very funny.

1111
01:28:33,963 --> 01:28:36,238
Did some friends of yours
write this?

1112
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:39,239
Have you read it?
Here.

1113
01:28:40,123 --> 01:28:42,239
They were handing these out
yesterday.

1114
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,711
-Yeah, well...
-What is it?

1115
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:46,642
"The school should be demolished,
not changed."

1116
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:49,915
I don't want to demolish
the school.

1117
01:28:50,123 --> 01:28:51,442
What does that mean?

1118
01:28:51,803 --> 01:28:53,953
I want going to school
to be a right.

1119
01:28:54,163 --> 01:28:57,155
For me, since I couldn't go,
and for my kids, who will.

1120
01:28:57,443 --> 01:28:59,513
What kids, Vitale?
As if you had any!

1121
01:29:04,243 --> 01:29:05,358
Learn how to speak!

1122
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:07,554
He's right, Vitale.
You have no kids.

1123
01:29:07,763 --> 01:29:09,913
Well, I'm still young.

1124
01:29:10,323 --> 01:29:12,200
I don't mean to pry,

1125
01:29:12,683 --> 01:29:15,595
but don't you have to go
to your Economics meeting?

1126
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:18,280
-Can someone make coffee?
-I'll do it.

1127
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,633
Didn't you have
a factory meeting?

1128
01:29:20,843 --> 01:29:23,232
What, are you afraid
I'll get in trouble?

1129
01:29:23,443 --> 01:29:25,081
No, I just want you to leave.

1130
01:29:26,123 --> 01:29:27,397
What's the hurry?

1131
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:29,798
I have to study,
I have an Anatomy exam.

1132
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,916
-What do you have to study?
-Anatomy!

1133
01:29:35,323 --> 01:29:38,201
<i>Anatomy!</i>

1134
01:29:43,363 --> 01:29:45,399
-Good morning, Mr. Piero.
-Hello.

1135
01:29:45,483 --> 01:29:48,202
Hey, watch it, Naples!

1136
01:29:55,883 --> 01:29:57,475
-Hi, Giulia.
-Hi.

1137
01:29:58,883 --> 01:30:00,953
You see?
She passed Anatomy.

1138
01:30:17,243 --> 01:30:20,997
<i>-My lip hurts!
-Sorry, I forgot.</i>

1139
01:30:25,803 --> 01:30:29,034
-You're freezing.
-I came running. I'm hot.

1140
01:30:30,483 --> 01:30:31,962
It's freezing out.

1141
01:30:32,723 --> 01:30:34,759
Because you're standing still.

1142
01:30:35,043 --> 01:30:36,635
You have to keep moving.

1143
01:30:37,923 --> 01:30:39,072
Moving?

1144
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:35,560
TURIN, SPRING OF 197 4

1145
01:31:35,763 --> 01:31:37,481
Go, go, go!

1146
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:21,755
Open up!
I'm pregnant!

1147
01:32:21,963 --> 01:32:23,396
Please open the door!

1148
01:32:24,483 --> 01:32:25,472
Please!

1149
01:32:25,683 --> 01:32:26,638
Open up!

1150
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:29,872
Come on!

1151
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:37,959
With all the chaos outside...

1152
01:32:38,963 --> 01:32:40,840
This is a paradise.

1153
01:32:43,923 --> 01:32:45,276
Pretty, isn't it?

1154
01:32:45,923 --> 01:32:47,197
Would you live here?

1155
01:32:49,443 --> 01:32:51,513
Yeah, I'd live here.
Why, wouldn't you?

1156
01:33:00,043 --> 01:33:01,112
What are you doing?

1157
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:03,236
You've got stones
in your pockets?

1158
01:33:03,443 --> 01:33:05,035
You saw the cops
beating people.

1159
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:07,595
Well, so what?

1160
01:33:08,043 --> 01:33:09,112
What are you doing?

1161
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:11,682
Throwing stones?

1162
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:14,072
No.

1163
01:33:14,963 --> 01:33:18,239
<i>But if they come after me,
I know how to defend myself.</i>

1164
01:33:25,243 --> 01:33:26,437
How strange.

1165
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:30,396
Someone let us in,
but it looks like no one's here.

1166
01:33:34,243 --> 01:33:35,562
I love your excuse.

1167
01:33:36,323 --> 01:33:37,676
"Help, help!

1168
01:33:37,963 --> 01:33:39,954
Open the door!

1169
01:33:40,163 --> 01:33:42,677
Help, I'm pregnant!"

1170
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:55,514
Careful, don't lose them.

1171
01:34:00,963 --> 01:34:02,601
Stop at the corner.

1172
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,195
First and second on the right.

1173
01:34:15,403 --> 01:34:18,315
<i>Third and fourth on the left,
come on!</i>

1174
01:34:19,603 --> 01:34:21,082
Keep going!

1175
01:34:21,363 --> 01:34:22,591
Slow down.

1176
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:24,602
I don't like this.

1177
01:34:27,443 --> 01:34:28,762
Not at all.

1178
01:34:33,203 --> 01:34:34,636
Back up!

1179
01:34:34,843 --> 01:34:36,515
Back up!

1180
01:34:44,843 --> 01:34:46,640
Everyone out!

1181
01:34:46,843 --> 01:34:48,959
Let's get out of here!

1182
01:34:49,843 --> 01:34:51,162
Regroup!

1183
01:34:51,443 --> 01:34:53,240
<i>Back here!
Turtle formation!</i>

1184
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:00,517
Are we all here?

1185
01:35:03,083 --> 01:35:03,833
Luigi!

1186
01:35:04,723 --> 01:35:07,556
Luigi! Luigi!
Bastards!

1187
01:35:25,843 --> 01:35:26,593
Luigi!

1188
01:35:37,803 --> 01:35:38,952
Gigi...

1189
01:36:28,603 --> 01:36:29,752
How are you?

1190
01:36:32,963 --> 01:36:35,431
What a way
to see each other again.

1191
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,914
I thought you were in Treviso.

1192
01:36:40,603 --> 01:36:42,241
Yeah, they asked for

1193
01:36:42,483 --> 01:36:44,439
reinforcements
for the protest.

1194
01:36:44,923 --> 01:36:46,561
What a joke.

1195
01:37:15,243 --> 01:37:17,359
It was legitimate
self-defense, right?

1196
01:37:21,563 --> 01:37:24,396
If they hadn't pulled me off
I would have killed him.

1197
01:37:31,683 --> 01:37:33,435
Are they going to
discipline you?

1198
01:37:33,883 --> 01:37:35,157
I don't know.

1199
01:37:37,323 --> 01:37:39,234
I'm getting a transfer.

1200
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:41,514
-Where to?
-Bologna.

1201
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:43,156
I leave tomorrow.

1202
01:37:46,203 --> 01:37:49,752
<i>The guy you hurt will survive,
fortunately.</i>

1203
01:37:54,323 --> 01:37:55,915
I don't give a shit.

1204
01:37:59,483 --> 01:38:01,553
Are you going to keep this up?

1205
01:38:19,363 --> 01:38:21,035
<i>All right, let's start over.</i>

1206
01:38:25,883 --> 01:38:27,521
Hi, Matteo.
How are you?

1207
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,514
You want to come with me?
I'll show you my house.

1208
01:38:33,763 --> 01:38:35,481
We can relax a bit.

1209
01:38:37,083 --> 01:38:38,562
How do you get out of here?

1210
01:38:39,763 --> 01:38:41,594
What do we have to do?

1211
01:38:41,963 --> 01:38:44,761
Ask for permission from
the Minister of the Interior?

1212
01:38:47,563 --> 01:38:50,031
Lick the police chief's boot?

1213
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:54,315
Pray to St. Michael the Archangel,
the patron saint of the police?

1214
01:38:57,803 --> 01:39:00,556
All I need is
the boss's signature.

1215
01:39:01,003 --> 01:39:03,233
Then sign it already!

1216
01:39:07,323 --> 01:39:09,154
And this is the patio.

1217
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:13,553
Good morning, Tota Bianco.

1218
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:16,558
"Tota" means "miss"
in Piemontese.

1219
01:39:17,003 --> 01:39:19,676
I'll go buy a cake.
We should celebrate.

1220
01:39:19,883 --> 01:39:22,351
-Celebrate what?
-I'll explain later.

1221
01:39:58,003 --> 01:39:59,072
May I help you?

1222
01:39:59,963 --> 01:40:01,999
Light of my life...

1223
01:40:02,443 --> 01:40:05,162
-No keys again, eh?
-Sorry, honey.

1224
01:40:06,523 --> 01:40:07,478
This is Matteo.

1225
01:40:09,523 --> 01:40:10,399
Hi.

1226
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:11,918
Hi.

1227
01:40:12,243 --> 01:40:13,358
Come in.

1228
01:40:14,643 --> 01:40:15,632
Thank you.

1229
01:40:23,923 --> 01:40:25,561
Gigi will be paralyzed.

1230
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:30,880
You two met, at the floods
in Florence, remember?

1231
01:40:35,203 --> 01:40:37,239
Right, in uniforms
we all look the same.

1232
01:40:38,763 --> 01:40:41,755
-He's a friend of yours?
-Like everyone in the section.

1233
01:40:41,963 --> 01:40:43,112
Bad idea.

1234
01:40:43,763 --> 01:40:45,719
Why's that?

1235
01:40:46,043 --> 01:40:47,874
You're on the wrong side.

1236
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,562
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1237
01:40:49,763 --> 01:40:52,960
And what's the right side,
the poor people?

1238
01:40:54,843 --> 01:40:57,801
Luigi knows more than you do
about defending the poor.

1239
01:40:58,123 --> 01:41:00,876
He's poor.
The guy who hit him wasn't.

1240
01:41:01,163 --> 01:41:03,199
-Are you poor?
-What's that got to do with it?

1241
01:41:03,403 --> 01:41:05,712
-I don't beat people up.
-Right, you don't.

1242
01:41:05,923 --> 01:41:09,199
We're sitting here having cake,
and he's in a wheelchair.

1243
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:13,277
-I won't listen to this crap!
-Giulia, please!

1244
01:41:20,843 --> 01:41:21,958
She's nice.

1245
01:41:22,163 --> 01:41:23,755
You two hit it off.

1246
01:41:24,883 --> 01:41:25,838
Anyway...

1247
01:41:26,483 --> 01:41:29,122
We're celebrating.
We're having a child in September.

1248
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:32,199
A child?
What will you name it?

1249
01:41:32,403 --> 01:41:33,836
Sara.

1250
01:41:34,603 --> 01:41:35,672
How do you know it's a girl?

1251
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:38,602
Giulia thinks so.
I trust her.

1252
01:41:39,283 --> 01:41:40,682
Sara's a nice name.

1253
01:41:41,603 --> 01:41:43,195
A biblical name.

1254
01:41:45,443 --> 01:41:46,671
Is that her?

1255
01:41:52,563 --> 01:41:54,281
When she plays she seems nice.

1256
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:55,882
She is nice.

1257
01:41:58,443 --> 01:41:59,956
She thinks she's always right.

1258
01:42:00,163 --> 01:42:01,801
Good. Just like you.

1259
01:42:10,643 --> 01:42:11,712
Go to sleep.

1260
01:42:23,883 --> 01:42:25,202
Nicola...

1261
01:42:25,403 --> 01:42:27,792
Does the baby have
to sleep in here?

1262
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,794
It's not exactly a good idea.

1263
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:34,601
Be quiet.

1264
01:42:34,803 --> 01:42:35,792
Sara.

1265
01:42:36,323 --> 01:42:37,995
Could you go
in the other room?

1266
01:42:39,163 --> 01:42:41,472
Go on, Sara. Daddy

1267
01:42:41,683 --> 01:42:43,560
has to do something
with Mommy.

1268
01:42:44,323 --> 01:42:45,597
Go on, Sara.

1269
01:42:48,483 --> 01:42:49,393
Go.

1270
01:42:50,843 --> 01:42:54,552
He could have picked us up.
A 9-hour trip and he's busy?

1271
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,716
Try to be nice
and say pleasant things.

1272
01:42:58,043 --> 01:43:01,672
Don't say it's crazy to have kids
without a steady job.

1273
01:43:02,163 --> 01:43:03,676
Because Nicola has one.

1274
01:43:03,883 --> 01:43:07,353
Right, a six month contract
at the asylum. That's a job?

1275
01:43:07,603 --> 01:43:10,163
-She works, too.
-In a junk store?

1276
01:43:10,683 --> 01:43:14,198
<i>Wait till they have to buy
clothes, shoes, mini-skirts...</i>

1277
01:43:14,763 --> 01:43:16,640
<i>Mini-skirts already?</i>

1278
01:43:17,243 --> 01:43:20,360
And don't mention them
having kids out of wedlock.

1279
01:43:20,563 --> 01:43:22,997
Who gets married nowadays?

1280
01:43:24,603 --> 01:43:26,480
What, you wouldn't marry me now?

1281
01:43:37,723 --> 01:43:39,600
Is it pretty enough for you?

1282
01:43:40,363 --> 01:43:43,036
What are you talking about?

1283
01:43:45,523 --> 01:43:46,922
Staircase A.

1284
01:43:52,883 --> 01:43:54,236
-Hello.
-Hi.

1285
01:43:55,803 --> 01:43:57,634
-How are you?
-Fine, how was your trip?

1286
01:43:57,843 --> 01:43:59,162
-Fine.
-Can you open it?

1287
01:43:59,363 --> 01:44:01,194
-Yeah.
-Here we are.

1288
01:44:01,603 --> 01:44:03,161
-What is it?
-A carriage from England.

1289
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:05,433
I ordered it special
for the lady.

1290
01:44:06,043 --> 01:44:07,476
Thanks.

1291
01:44:07,683 --> 01:44:09,514
-How pretty!
-Here's the rest.

1292
01:44:09,723 --> 01:44:11,122
Leave it here.

1293
01:44:12,963 --> 01:44:14,362
Hi, beautiful.

1294
01:44:14,683 --> 01:44:16,753
This place is spacious.

1295
01:44:17,003 --> 01:44:18,834
Yeah, we got lucky.

1296
01:44:19,243 --> 01:44:22,315
-Was it already painted?
-No, I painted it.

1297
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:24,998
Very nice, well done.

1298
01:44:29,243 --> 01:44:30,312
Is she asleep?

1299
01:44:44,883 --> 01:44:46,032
Hi.

1300
01:44:46,523 --> 01:44:47,842
Hello, gorgeous!

1301
01:44:48,603 --> 01:44:49,877
I'm your grandma.

1302
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:53,041
I'm your grandma
and this is your grandpa.

1303
01:44:53,483 --> 01:44:55,201
Look at that face.

1304
01:44:55,403 --> 01:44:57,439
My goodness, what eyes!

1305
01:44:58,003 --> 01:44:59,800
And the chin, too.

1306
01:45:00,123 --> 01:45:02,398
She doesn't look at all like you.
I was hoping she wouldn't.

1307
01:45:02,603 --> 01:45:05,561
Wait till she grows up.
You can't tell yet.

1308
01:45:06,403 --> 01:45:08,359
My how she's grown

1309
01:45:08,563 --> 01:45:10,838
since the last time!

1310
01:45:11,043 --> 01:45:12,795
We become grandparents
overnight.

1311
01:45:13,003 --> 01:45:14,675
Sarita? Sarita!

1312
01:45:15,563 --> 01:45:17,394
You like having such
a young grandpa?

1313
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:19,195
She's looking at me!

1314
01:45:19,443 --> 01:45:21,399
She's in your pocket.

1315
01:45:22,603 --> 01:45:23,752
Where's Nicola?

1316
01:45:23,963 --> 01:45:25,157
<i>At court.</i>

1317
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,633
-What did he do?
-They're prosecuting

1318
01:45:27,843 --> 01:45:30,232
a psychiatrist from the asylum.
A monster.

1319
01:45:30,443 --> 01:45:31,796
He did lots of horrible stuff.

1320
01:45:32,003 --> 01:45:34,073
-He went to help.
-By testifying?

1321
01:45:34,283 --> 01:45:37,912
No, not him. The patients.
They've been admitted

1322
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:40,114
as witnesses and we're hoping

1323
01:45:40,323 --> 01:45:43,121
the judge will hear them out.
It'd be a first in Italy.

1324
01:45:44,363 --> 01:45:46,752
No, a first in the world.

1325
01:45:47,523 --> 01:45:51,232
Marino, when they ask you
"Do you swear to tell the truth...?"

1326
01:45:51,443 --> 01:45:55,197
Girolamo, listen.
You'll all be asked this.

1327
01:45:55,803 --> 01:45:57,714
You have to say:
"I swear."

1328
01:45:58,203 --> 01:46:00,080
-Marino, say "I swear."
-I swear.

1329
01:46:00,283 --> 01:46:02,751
<i>Okay, otherwise
they won't listen.</i>

1330
01:46:02,963 --> 01:46:05,875
How old were you
when you were committed?

1331
01:46:06,803 --> 01:46:10,716
-I don't know. Four, nine...
-No, you have to be specific.

1332
01:46:10,923 --> 01:46:12,914
You have to say "eight."
Eight.

1333
01:46:13,483 --> 01:46:17,237
Yeah, eight, I remember
I wanted to dress like a girl.

1334
01:46:17,603 --> 01:46:20,356
-They shouldn't have locked you up.
-Nicola.

1335
01:46:20,563 --> 01:46:22,838
I'll kill the electrician
when I see him.

1336
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,681
I'll rip him to shreds...

1337
01:46:24,883 --> 01:46:28,273
No, don't.
You have to be good, AIdo.

1338
01:46:28,483 --> 01:46:29,279
Nicola!

1339
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:32,759
Just sit by me and stay calm.
You promise, AIdo?

1340
01:46:33,043 --> 01:46:34,681
Look me in the eye.

1341
01:46:34,883 --> 01:46:36,396
Nicola!

1342
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:38,833
Are you calm?
Will you be good?

1343
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:42,516
What's wrong, Mario?

1344
01:46:43,723 --> 01:46:46,283
He looks like my cousin Ignazio.

1345
01:46:47,723 --> 01:46:49,395
Yeah, he does a bit.

1346
01:46:50,603 --> 01:46:52,798
What's that?
Where did you get that stuff?

1347
01:46:53,043 --> 01:46:55,318
I found it
behind the statue.

1348
01:46:55,523 --> 01:46:57,161
Don't take anything.

1349
01:46:57,403 --> 01:46:59,394
Don't pick up anything
off the floor.

1350
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:02,880
Whose pamphlets are these?

1351
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,118
RED BRIGADES

1352
01:47:04,483 --> 01:47:06,633
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole...?

1353
01:47:06,723 --> 01:47:09,442
They had us all go in
and lie down

1354
01:47:09,643 --> 01:47:12,157
-beside each other.
-No, excuse me.

1355
01:47:12,923 --> 01:47:14,402
Wait, you have to say "I swear."

1356
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,880
I swear.
Eight years old.

1357
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:20,675
Committed ten times...

1358
01:47:20,883 --> 01:47:22,077
Objection.

1359
01:47:22,723 --> 01:47:25,157
The witness is reciting
from memory.

1360
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:29,678
Counselor, the witness
needs to calm down.

1361
01:47:30,043 --> 01:47:31,396
Your honor.

1362
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,479
Mr. Levi,
please just say "I swear."

1363
01:47:35,003 --> 01:47:35,958
I swear.

1364
01:47:36,763 --> 01:47:38,162
Fine, proceed.

1365
01:47:39,243 --> 01:47:40,995
When... he'd come in...

1366
01:47:41,403 --> 01:47:42,677
the electric doctor...

1367
01:47:42,883 --> 01:47:45,920
I'd close my eyes. I could hear
the ones that went before me

1368
01:47:46,123 --> 01:47:47,397
screaming.

1369
01:47:48,363 --> 01:47:50,160
Four nurses held my arms

1370
01:47:50,363 --> 01:47:51,716
and legs.

1371
01:47:52,803 --> 01:47:56,034
A hand put an eraser
between my teeth.

1372
01:47:57,723 --> 01:47:59,441
Then the first shock.

1373
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:05,393
I escaped from the asylum
one time.

1374
01:48:06,643 --> 01:48:08,520
But I got caught.

1375
01:48:08,803 --> 01:48:10,953
They beat me up

1376
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,240
and tied me to the bed.

1377
01:48:13,763 --> 01:48:16,721
Then the electrician showed up

1378
01:48:17,243 --> 01:48:18,961
with his machine.

1379
01:48:22,203 --> 01:48:23,477
While...

1380
01:48:26,643 --> 01:48:28,201
he gave me the charges,

1381
01:48:29,283 --> 01:48:30,636
he'd scream:

1382
01:48:32,603 --> 01:48:35,037
"Tell me who helped you escape!"

1383
01:48:35,563 --> 01:48:37,076
"Give me names!"

1384
01:48:38,323 --> 01:48:42,157
But since I didn't want
to give him names,

1385
01:48:43,843 --> 01:48:47,961
I clenched my jaws
as tight as I could,

1386
01:48:49,483 --> 01:48:50,916
so tight

1387
01:48:51,163 --> 01:48:53,916
that I split all my upper teeth.

1388
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:42,314
Giovanbattista,
can you hear me?

1389
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:45,320
I have your statement here.

1390
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:47,962
You must repeat

1391
01:49:48,163 --> 01:49:49,642
everything you know.

1392
01:49:52,883 --> 01:49:53,872
Look at him.

1393
01:49:57,003 --> 01:49:59,233
Is that the man you spoke of?

1394
01:50:01,123 --> 01:50:03,159
Can you speak,
Giovanbattista?

1395
01:50:06,443 --> 01:50:08,673
You said,
these are your words:

1396
01:50:10,563 --> 01:50:14,397
"The doctor said he gave me
electromassage because I drank."

1397
01:50:15,283 --> 01:50:16,398
Is that true?

1398
01:50:20,323 --> 01:50:23,235
"In five days
they gave me five treatments,

1399
01:50:23,443 --> 01:50:26,276
once a day."
Is that right?

1400
01:50:28,563 --> 01:50:30,679
It's normal in cases
of alcoholism.

1401
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:33,443
-Plenty of publications...
-Shut up! You're finished!

1402
01:50:33,643 --> 01:50:36,111
-You can't kill any more people!
-AIdo, calm down!

1403
01:50:36,843 --> 01:50:40,233
If that happens again,
I'll have to clear the room.

1404
01:50:41,043 --> 01:50:43,762
Your honor,
please forgive AIdo.

1405
01:50:43,963 --> 01:50:45,078
And the others.

1406
01:50:46,883 --> 01:50:50,558
They're very upset,
they can't help themselves.

1407
01:50:51,803 --> 01:50:54,317
As you can see, Giovanbattista
can't even speak.

1408
01:50:55,043 --> 01:50:57,477
I know silence proves nothing.

1409
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:00,513
But it's all he has left.

1410
01:51:01,443 --> 01:51:03,638
He should get a life sentence.

1411
01:51:03,843 --> 01:51:05,401
I'd settle for a day.

1412
01:51:05,643 --> 01:51:06,712
I'd settle for that.

1413
01:51:06,923 --> 01:51:09,073
It's a question of principle.

1414
01:51:09,603 --> 01:51:12,163
Why exactly did Dad
come to Turin?

1415
01:51:12,403 --> 01:51:15,395
He's looking for investors
for his projects.

1416
01:51:15,603 --> 01:51:19,755
He thinks typewriters
could end up being replaced

1417
01:51:19,963 --> 01:51:22,523
by processors or calculators
or something.

1418
01:51:25,403 --> 01:51:26,552
Listen.

1419
01:51:27,643 --> 01:51:29,440
I have something to tell you.

1420
01:51:33,563 --> 01:51:37,078
He doesn't know I found them.
He hasn't said anything.

1421
01:51:40,883 --> 01:51:43,033
But I saw that he was worried.

1422
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:49,165
I'd never gone through
his drawers before.

1423
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:58,688
You're a doctor.
Is there anything you can do?

1424
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,398
No, Mom.

1425
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,008
But there is treatment

1426
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:07,246
that can slow the process.

1427
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:09,722
It might give us
a few years...

1428
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,524
Yes, I know.
I've read everything I found.

1429
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:15,167
It all says the same thing.

1430
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:19,648
That it's hopeless.

1431
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:36,281
-What are you writing?
-A memoire for the organization.

1432
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:38,242
For the trial.

1433
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,448
You still type with two fingers.
Come on, let me.

1434
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:44,847
-No, let me.
-Oh, come on.

1435
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:47,364
I'll give you a hand.

1436
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:50,964
"The lawyer has sustained

1437
01:52:52,570 --> 01:52:54,367
that the treatments

1438
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:57,158
were not intended
as punishment,

1439
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:59,408
and has chosen to specify

1440
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:04,079
that homosexuality
is a disease

1441
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:06,406
that requires
precise treatment."

1442
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:10,160
-What, it isn't a disease?
-No, it isn't.

1443
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,202
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

1444
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,809
If you say so...

1445
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:19,688
<i>Look at that!
At least change the cartridge.</i>

1446
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:22,643
I like it that way.
Forget it.

1447
01:53:22,850 --> 01:53:25,728
Forget it?
You need a new one.

1448
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:27,204
I have an idea.

1449
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:28,684
I'll find an investor.

1450
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:30,801
Better yet,
if you don't mind,

1451
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:33,883
I'll stay in Turin
to find some financing.

1452
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:37,167
-There are good mechanics here.
-Fine, good idea.

1453
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:39,761
And I thought
you'd say I was nuts!

1454
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:43,724
You're not nuts,
you're just thinking ahead.

1455
01:53:44,410 --> 01:53:45,763
You're a visionary.

1456
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:47,881
Is Mom staying, too?

1457
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,888
No, she's going back.
Her leaving Francesca 4 days

1458
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,842
is already a miracle.
Hey...

1459
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:56,485
I'd like to go to Milan
to see Giovanna.

1460
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,159
I'll catch a train...

1461
01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:02,440
-No, I'll take you.
-No, why?

1462
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:04,322
That way I can see Carlo.

1463
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:06,442
-Remember him?
-Of course!

1464
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:09,645
-I thought he taught in England.
-He's visiting.

1465
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:13,206
-I'll get to see him.
-I can tell him about my project.

1466
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:15,886
In England
there are investment banks,

1467
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:18,968
not like here.
He might know someone.

1468
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:20,364
Go on, dictate.

1469
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:26,128
What, are you out?

1470
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:29,809
Out of what?

1471
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:32,440
Two sixes of clovers,
you can't.

1472
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:35,448
Sorry. But that's 40, right?

1473
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:38,164
No, count them. Is that 40?
Count them.

1474
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:40,600
-6, 18, 20...
-No, it's 40.

1475
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:43,085
No it isn't.
Okay, I'll take them.

1476
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:45,807
-Hey, Adriana.
-Yeah?

1477
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:49,327
About the subject of people
not marrying nowadays...

1478
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:52,768
I think that today

1479
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:54,888
I would marry you again.

1480
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,522
My little girl!

1481
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:02,402
Don't be silly.

1482
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:43,523
<i>Have you got an apartment?</i>

1483
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:45,402
-Lodging?
-No.

1484
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:50,122
There's a room here,
but no one wants to use it.

1485
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:52,964
Fine by me.
I don't like houses.

1486
01:55:55,730 --> 01:55:59,769
So why did you change
from Bologna to Sicily?

1487
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:01,198
I got transfered.

1488
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:03,878
-I heard they need people.
-You could have refused.

1489
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:06,081
I never disobey an order.

1490
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:10,245
Don't just stand there.
Put that down.

1491
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:14,599
What's inside?

1492
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:16,479
Books.

1493
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:19,284
-Books?
-Yeah, books.

1494
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:22,048
You're weird, you know.

1495
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:25,566
I read your personal attributes

1496
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:27,763
and what do I see?

1497
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,402
Nothing, I see nothing.

1498
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,680
Besides an occasional mess.

1499
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:38,044
<i>Bad temper, but a soft hand.</i>

1500
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:42,087
Why did you join the force?
What were you looking for?

1501
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:43,525
Rules.

1502
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:45,165
To do what?

1503
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,286
To be applied.

1504
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:49,163
-Applied?
-Yes.

1505
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:51,243
I do as I'm told.

1506
01:56:51,770 --> 01:56:53,522
And I keep to myself.

1507
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:55,442
Then you'll be fine.

1508
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:58,847
Sicily is the kingdom
of people who keep to themselves.

1509
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:10,921
It looks like he got shot
in the head.

1510
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:13,958
-What?
-Shot in the head.

1511
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:15,882
He has a hole in his brain.

1512
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:32,169
You live around here?

1513
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,645
-We're finished.
-One second.

1514
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:37,928
Did you find the body?

1515
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:38,721
Yes.

1516
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,522
-First thing this morning?
-Yeah.

1517
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,687
Why were you here?

1518
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:45,358
I was grazing my donkey.

1519
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:47,359
Right, grazing.

1520
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:48,605
Yeah.

1521
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:50,722
You or the donkey find it?

1522
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:51,999
I did!

1523
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:53,768
And did you touch it?

1524
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:55,119
-No.
-Right.

1525
01:57:55,330 --> 01:57:57,161
Good, never touch it.

1526
01:57:58,490 --> 01:58:00,720
But did you see him?
Is he from around here?

1527
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:03,807
-Yeah.
-So you know him.

1528
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,765
Did you know him or not?

1529
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:07,164
-No.
-You didn't?

1530
01:58:07,730 --> 01:58:10,198
If he's from around here,
why didn't you know him?

1531
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:11,923
Did you recognize him?

1532
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,689
-You know him?
-Yeah, I know him.

1533
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:17,046
Good. You see?
You know him.

1534
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,241
Tell me, who was he?

1535
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:22,726
-Was he a good person?
-He was a good Christian.

1536
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:25,000
Anyone who knew him
knew that.

1537
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:29,203
So tell me, why is it you say
he was a good person

1538
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:31,805
and others thought
he was a bad Christian?

1539
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:36,202
How should I know?
I don't know anything.

1540
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:39,959
Sure, you don't know anything.
Nobody does.

1541
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:43,165
The pigs were about
to eat the poor guy...

1542
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:46,521
-May he rest in peace.
-Yeah, whatever.

1543
01:58:46,730 --> 01:58:48,482
That's good, okay?

1544
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:55,442
<i>I remind you all that you must
respect this court.</i>

1545
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:58,321
Whatever the verdict,

1546
01:58:58,530 --> 01:59:01,169
I will not stand for
any outbursts.

1547
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:03,479
<i>The court,</i>

1548
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:05,646
<i>in view of articles 483</i>

1549
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:07,522
and 488 of the Penal Code,

1550
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:10,447
declares the defendant guilty

1551
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:13,164
of a crime,
and sentences him

1552
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:14,883
to five years in prison

1553
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:17,399
and orders he pay
the costs of the trial.

1554
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:19,445
Silence!

1555
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:20,605
Silence!

1556
01:59:23,010 --> 01:59:23,886
Silence!

1557
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:28,363
The colors aren't so bad
once you get

1558
01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:30,443
used to them.

1559
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:33,889
Besides, dolls are pretty cute.

1560
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:36,126
Well done. Congratulations.

1561
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:39,239
Listen.

1562
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:42,599
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yes.

1563
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:47,368
That piano over there...

1564
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:52,841
-Why don't you ever play it?
-I never play it because

1565
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:55,202
I'm not good enough.

1566
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:58,004
And since talent
can't be learned,

1567
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:00,482
I decided to give it up.

1568
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:02,043
I'm not talking about

1569
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:05,048
playing in public.
Why not play at home?

1570
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:07,525
-At home, for you.
-For me?

1571
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:31,560
-What?
-That's enough.

1572
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:35,008
-Why?
-I made lots of mistakes.

1573
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:36,962
I didn't hear any.

1574
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:38,644
You didn't, but I did.

1575
02:00:38,850 --> 02:00:40,522
It's for me
so it doesn't count.

1576
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:43,039
Go on, more Ravel.

1577
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:47,569
I like Ravel.

1578
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:49,570
Don't you ever ask her to play?

1579
02:01:50,610 --> 02:01:51,599
No.

1580
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:53,883
Why not?

1581
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:55,969
Because she doesn't want to.

1582
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:00,563
That's not it.
She played the other day.

1583
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:02,886
She did that for you,
to please you.

1584
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,206
It was a special case.

1585
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:07,082
You haven't got a clue.

1586
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:08,928
<i>You're smart,
but some things</i>

1587
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:10,404
just escape you.

1588
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:12,601
<i>Always tell women
how smart they are,</i>

1589
02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:15,285
<i>how pretty,
how important they are</i>

1590
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:18,288
to us. Tell her: "Giulia,

1591
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:21,209
play for me,
for the two of us."

1592
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,282
-Like I do with your mother.
-All you two do is fight.

1593
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:29,164
Fighting is good.

1594
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:30,519
It keeps you in shape.

1595
02:02:32,770 --> 02:02:33,919
The 26 principles

1596
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:35,961
and the 109 recommendations
of the United Nations,

1597
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:38,126
approved two years ago
in Stockholm,

1598
02:02:38,530 --> 02:02:40,919
are constantly broken
here in Italy.

1599
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:44,398
By people like those
we judge here today

1600
02:02:44,610 --> 02:02:47,249
and for whom I request
the maximum penalty.

1601
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:52,242
I also request they be ordered
to pay the costs of the trial

1602
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:54,725
as well as punitive damages

1603
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:57,000
for having dumped
industrial refuse in a river

1604
02:02:57,210 --> 02:03:00,361
with grave consequences to
the environment and public health.

1605
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:03,080
Consider that
in the last 10 years

1606
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:05,565
almost 2 billion dollars a year
have been spent

1607
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:08,045
per year on military expenses.

1608
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:12,038
Right now half is unaccounted for,
including in Italy.

1609
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:15,560
-Will you have them arrested?
-I need names.

1610
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:18,330
-Tell her about the state companies.
-Putting words in his mouth?

1611
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:20,646
No, you know the state companies,
they're in the papers.

1612
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:23,603
You read the papers, right?

1613
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:25,402
-Dad!
-What?

1614
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:26,565
Look.

1615
02:03:27,330 --> 02:03:29,048
-The chopsticks.
-Dad!

1616
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:30,639
Fork.

1617
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:33,000
-Yeah, okay.
-It's the crab technique.

1618
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:35,883
Forget it, Carlo.
I eat with a fork.

1619
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:42,883
<i>Will that little car of yours
make it to the airport?</i>

1620
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:44,724
How dare you!

1621
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,124
Take a taxi!

1622
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:49,527
You're going to Cambridge
with all there is to do here?

1623
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:51,129
No, I'm coming back.

1624
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:53,522
<i>After I finish my master's</i>

1625
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:57,439
next year.
I want to get a job with

1626
02:03:57,650 --> 02:03:59,129
-the Bank of Italy.
-You see?

1627
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:00,763
He wants to be governor,

1628
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:02,608
he wants his name on money.

1629
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:06,644
-A toast to the governor.
-To the governor.

1630
02:04:06,850 --> 02:04:09,728
To the governor.
Long live the governor!

1631
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:21,240
This may sound absurd,

1632
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:25,200
but if you want him to believe
he can be cured,

1633
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:28,324
you have to believe it
yourselves.

1634
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:31,567
-He doesn't know we know.
-That doesn't matter.

1635
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:35,240
Your father can sense it.
He senses everything.

1636
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:38,999
-He senses that you know.
-I don't believe in miracles.

1637
02:04:39,650 --> 02:04:43,165
-Forget that you're a doctor.
-Okay, you want to help me.

1638
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:45,247
Thanks, but that's enough.

1639
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:48,525
Okay, sorry.

1640
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:50,368
Thank you, thank you.

1641
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:08,489
I think that's mine.

1642
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:15,130
-Sorry about before.
-No, I'm sorry.

1643
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:16,888
I'm full of shit.

1644
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:21,960
Don't let England
make you stupid.

1645
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:24,366
Try not to let Italy
do the same.

1646
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:28,243
Bye.

1647
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:40,368
I haven't told anyone.

1648
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:43,848
Not even Nicola,

1649
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:46,761
he'd have psychoanalyzed me.

1650
02:05:46,970 --> 02:05:48,926
All that psychological crap

1651
02:05:49,210 --> 02:05:51,929
about the will to live
and all that.

1652
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:56,082
I can tell you.
But not him.

1653
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,368
Keep it between us.

1654
02:05:59,730 --> 02:06:01,686
Promise me
you won't tell anyone.

1655
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:04,685
Okay, but stay with
the treatment

1656
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:06,881
so that you can get cured.

1657
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:08,887
All of it.
All the treatment.

1658
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:10,565
Everything.

1659
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,687
Be patient with Matteo.

1660
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:18,687
I don't know why,
but I can never

1661
02:06:19,730 --> 02:06:21,243
understand that boy.

1662
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:24,167
He agonizes over everything.

1663
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:28,130
Then there's Francesca, Mom

1664
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:30,364
and Nicola.

1665
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:32,682
Nicola's strong.

1666
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:35,121
Well, he seems strong.

1667
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:37,088
He's like the others.

1668
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:44,127
<i>And most importantly,</i>

1669
02:06:44,690 --> 02:06:46,442
think of yourself.

1670
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:49,803
You have to laugh,
be happy.

1671
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:51,363
Try to have fun.

1672
02:06:52,690 --> 02:06:53,918
Where's your husband?

1673
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:56,439
-On a business trip?
-We never see each other.

1674
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:58,806
It hasn't been working lately.

1675
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:01,399
-Is there someone else?
-No way!

1676
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,441
It just isn't working,
that's all.

1677
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:05,768
We're getting a separation.

1678
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:08,359
A separation?
And you didn't tell me?

1679
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:11,246
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not.

1680
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:13,209
It's for the best.

1681
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:18,403
Right, we'll find someone else.

1682
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:38,528
Are you looking for mystery?

1683
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,843
Are you talking to me?

1684
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,882
You have to find your soul.

1685
02:07:47,370 --> 02:07:49,122
How do I do that?

1686
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:54,168
You have to search,
deep inside yourself.

1687
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:58,203
PALERMO, SUMMER OF 1977

1688
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:00,809
You know how to do that?

1689
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:03,725
That's right.

1690
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:09,205
You see that boy?

1691
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:10,885
Look at his hand.

1692
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:12,648
Sure of itself, demanding...

1693
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:14,761
Powerful.
The top of his class.

1694
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:18,439
Maybe.

1695
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:22,042
You see that elderly woman?

1696
02:08:22,890 --> 02:08:24,846
Two rings on her ring finger.
A widow.

1697
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:26,644
And she's lonely.

1698
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:33,483
You're not Sicilian.

1699
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:35,639
Are you kidding me?

1700
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:40,526
Did you see "Stromboli,"
with Ingrid Bergman?

1701
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:41,560
Yeah.

1702
02:08:42,290 --> 02:08:44,804
I live there,
for the moment.

1703
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:47,879
I did a librarian's course.

1704
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:50,087
I want to leave the island.

1705
02:08:51,410 --> 02:08:52,081
Very nice.

1706
02:08:53,130 --> 02:08:56,327
-A professional camera.
-You understand this stuff?

1707
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:59,249
I also know a lot
about libraries.

1708
02:08:59,450 --> 02:09:01,361
-Really?
-Yeah.

1709
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:03,567
Then which library
should I request?

1710
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:05,529
In Palermo I don't know.

1711
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:07,689
In Rome...

1712
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:10,484
Villa Celimontana.
A beautiful old one.

1713
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:13,801
-Give me a little mystery.
-Oh, come on.

1714
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:15,238
What mystery!

1715
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:24,043
I have to go.

1716
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:26,488
-Right now?
-Yes.

1717
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:30,048
-What's your name?
-Me? Nicola.

1718
02:09:30,690 --> 02:09:32,521
-Mirella.
-Nice meeting you.

1719
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:34,083
Goodbye, Nicola.

1720
02:09:35,690 --> 02:09:37,089
-What is it?
-A corpse.

1721
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:39,360
-You have to take photos.
-I haven't got a camera!

1722
02:09:39,570 --> 02:09:41,003
I've got one.

1723
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:43,122
You think of everything.

1724
02:09:43,370 --> 02:09:44,849
Where did you get it?

1725
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:47,562
Watch what I do.

1726
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:51,081
It's easy. Watch Daddy.

1727
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:53,645
Look, watch Daddy.
Watch Daddy.

1728
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:58,323
<i>I'm hurt!</i>

1729
02:10:00,290 --> 02:10:02,679
Sara should be asleep by now.

1730
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:04,243
Is that what the doctor said?

1731
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,327
Daddy's the doctor!
Listen to him!

1732
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:10,645
Go to bed.

1733
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:24,164
-What's wrong?
-I'm tired.

1734
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:28,923
I had a fight with Stefania.

1735
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:32,406
I told her it's over.
I'm fed up with arguing.

1736
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:36,080
-You used to like it.
-That was before.

1737
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,364
It's for the best.

1738
02:10:40,570 --> 02:10:42,765
Maybe you can play piano again.

1739
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:45,404
I sold it.
They're coming tomorrow for it.

1740
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:47,639
Are you crazy?

1741
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:49,723
It's possible.

1742
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,642
Where have you been?

1743
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,643
Are you checking up on me?

1744
02:10:58,450 --> 02:11:00,566
At one of the group meetings.

1745
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:02,522
-Any objections?
-Too bad.

1746
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:04,528
What's that supposed to mean?

1747
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:07,725
Everything in this country sucks.

1748
02:11:08,250 --> 02:11:09,729
And we just sit here watching.

1749
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:12,161
You hear about the kid
that got killed in Bologna?

1750
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:14,927
-Yeah.
-What about us?

1751
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:16,927
When will we make them mourn?

1752
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:19,682
Make them mourn?

1753
02:11:20,490 --> 02:11:22,685
Take that off,
you look ridiculous.

1754
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:32,921
-Listen...
-Don't touch me.

1755
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:34,199
You can't stand me either?

1756
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:35,200
No!

1757
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:37,968
No, I can't.

1758
02:11:39,570 --> 02:11:42,562
All you care about is the hospital.
I have to do everything.

1759
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:45,889
I disagree.

1760
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:49,282
I hate these arguments!

1761
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:51,162
I hate couples that argue!

1762
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:54,199
Gentlemen...

1763
02:11:57,530 --> 02:11:58,645
Gentlemen...

1764
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:01,719
If you're going
to make so much noise,

1765
02:12:02,530 --> 02:12:04,202
Bobby can't sleep.

1766
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:07,888
You're right, darling.
We'll be quiet.

1767
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:13,844
<i>Dear Carlo:</i>

1768
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:16,810
<i>I'm glad to hear things
are going well at Cambridge.</i>

1769
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:19,127
<i>Here nothing has changed.</i>

1770
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:21,521
<i>It's hard to work
with so many institutions,</i>

1771
02:12:21,730 --> 02:12:23,960
<i>trying to change them
little by little.</i>

1772
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:26,759
<i>Things with Giulia are bad.</i>

1773
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,120
<i>She's become agressive,
hostile,</i>

1774
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:35,203
<i>dissatisfied with something
I still don't understand.</i>

1775
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:39,285
<i>We haven't made love
in 6 months.</i>

1776
02:13:29,610 --> 02:13:32,044
This way,
I'll show you the room.

1777
02:13:32,810 --> 02:13:35,688
I'd like to know
who orders these inspections.

1778
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:38,162
The Minister of Health.

1779
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:41,806
And what are you, a lawyer?
A judge? Come in, please.

1780
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:45,203
-A psychiatrist.
-Good.

1781
02:13:45,850 --> 02:13:47,522
This is the room.

1782
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:50,359
As you can see,
everything's clean.

1783
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:52,322
Everything's in order.

1784
02:13:53,170 --> 02:13:56,526
-Where are the patients?
-I sent them on a field trip,

1785
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:59,569
to the sanctuary at Oropa,
because I care about them.

1786
02:14:00,170 --> 02:14:02,843
<i>I want them to be entertained,</i>

1787
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:05,006
normal, like anyone.

1788
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:09,080
Where are you going?
There's nothing in there!

1789
02:14:09,370 --> 02:14:10,803
-It's the basement!
-What's inside?

1790
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:13,604
-Nothing, storage.
-Open this door.

1791
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:15,528
-No, I won't!
-Do your thing.

1792
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:17,527
-The chain.
-Show me a warrant!

1793
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:19,482
I want to talk
to a lawyer first!

1794
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:21,203
You hear me?

1795
02:14:24,210 --> 02:14:26,678
Where are you going?
Are you satisfied?

1796
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:29,688
There's nothing to see,
just...

1797
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:31,881
Trash!
Where are you going?

1798
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:34,447
-No, you can't!
-What's in there?

1799
02:14:35,370 --> 02:14:38,123
-There's nothing!
-Restrain her.

1800
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:40,845
-You have no right!
-Get out of the way!

1801
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:42,688
-It's not fair!
-Put her in the car.

1802
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:44,801
If she resists, cuff her.

1803
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:46,284
-I'll call my lawyer!
-The door.

1804
02:14:46,490 --> 02:14:48,048
I'll get you for this!

1805
02:14:48,530 --> 02:14:50,885
You can't treat people
this way!

1806
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:53,724
I protest! I protest!

1807
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:13,963
Order ambulances.

1808
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:17,409
Untie them and cover them up.

1809
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:23,245
<i>Call headquarters.
Ferrario.</i>

1810
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:25,529
Give me a hand.

1811
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:38,959
Giorgia...

1812
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:44,679
Giorgia...

1813
02:15:48,970 --> 02:15:50,688
Giorgia,
here's your jacket.

1814
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:54,403
Be good.
We'll give it to you

1815
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:56,766
and you can put it on, okay?

1816
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:02,399
Look, I'll leave it here
and we'll turn around.

1817
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:29,320
Here, Giorgia.

1818
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:31,408
No, it's okay.

1819
02:16:32,330 --> 02:16:33,479
Thank you.

1820
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:44,319
How are you?

1821
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:53,083
Have you eaten today?

1822
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:00,404
You want some?

1823
02:17:06,210 --> 02:17:08,201
You remember our trip?

1824
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:12,728
To Vito's village?

1825
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:15,366
That time we slept in the barn?

1826
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:21,725
The soccer match?

1827
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:25,488
Italy lost and we laughed
and laughed...

1828
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:33,448
You remember Matteo?

1829
02:17:39,770 --> 02:17:40,725
The orange.

1830
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:53,121
They need water.

1831
02:18:11,610 --> 02:18:13,965
You're right,
I always forget.

1832
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:22,526
Sorry, I won't touch you.

1833
02:18:28,890 --> 02:18:31,120
I'd like you to come every day.

1834
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:36,400
To keep the plant alive.

1835
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:48,449
Have you called the judge?

1836
02:18:48,650 --> 02:18:50,800
-Yeah.
-When?

1837
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,084
Two hours ago.

1838
02:18:54,210 --> 02:18:55,484
He isn't here yet?

1839
02:18:59,450 --> 02:19:00,485
Are you smoking?

1840
02:19:00,690 --> 02:19:04,080
-In a slaughterhouse?
-Get rid of that.

1841
02:19:04,330 --> 02:19:05,604
We have to go.

1842
02:19:05,810 --> 02:19:07,402
Can we move him?

1843
02:19:07,690 --> 02:19:10,727
<i>After the judge gets here.
Always the same question!</i>

1844
02:19:11,490 --> 02:19:13,082
<i>Our shift is over.</i>

1845
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:15,326
<i>Your shift?
There's a dead person here!</i>

1846
02:19:19,330 --> 02:19:22,003
Enzo, what did I tell you?
Keep them quiet.

1847
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:24,360
-They don't want to.
-I don't care!

1848
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:26,606
Come on, get moving.
Outside.

1849
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:28,004
Please, get going.

1850
02:19:28,210 --> 02:19:30,599
There's a kid!
Get out of here!

1851
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:33,606
Are you his father?
Get him out of here!

1852
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:36,449
<i>-He's not hurting anyone.
-Get him out of here!</i>

1853
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:39,369
Who do you think you are?
How dare you.

1854
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,644
You like the show?

1855
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:45,006
There's a dead body!
This isn't a movie!

1856
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:47,403
Where were you
when he got shot?

1857
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:49,601
How should I know?
I forget!

1858
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:51,004
You know nothing!

1859
02:19:51,210 --> 02:19:53,166
Nobody knows anything!
The same old story!

1860
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:54,689
He died by himself!

1861
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,608
And bringing kids in here.

1862
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:58,880
-Go on, get out.
-Don't touch him!

1863
02:19:59,090 --> 02:20:01,399
What are you teaching him?

1864
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:05,483
Don't touch my son!
Who do you think you are?

1865
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:11,522
Here's your leave of absence.

1866
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:14,961
I don't want to see you
for two weeks. Take a vacation,

1867
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:16,649
go home,

1868
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:17,965
just get out.

1869
02:20:19,890 --> 02:20:23,405
I have enough problems.
What are you, a vigilante?

1870
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:26,727
Some kind of savior?
Get out of my sight!

1871
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:35,646
-What's up, Carati?
-Nothing.

1872
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:38,808
-Transfer?
-No, leave a absence.

1873
02:20:39,010 --> 02:20:41,604
-Typical.
-It could have been worse.

1874
02:20:42,370 --> 02:20:44,930
Here, this came this morning.

1875
02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:51,883
<i>Dear Matteo:</i>

1876
02:20:52,330 --> 02:20:54,400
<i>I'm writing you with good news.</i>

1877
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:56,883
<i>I found Giorgia.</i>

1878
02:20:57,770 --> 02:21:00,125
<i>I think she's suffered a lot
these last years.</i>

1879
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:03,728
<i>For her it's as if
time stood still.</i>

1880
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:06,526
<i>Seeing her
has really affected me.</i>

1881
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:09,683
<i>I'm reminded of that summer
so long ago,</i>

1882
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:13,087
<i>when all of our lives
changed so drastically.</i>

1883
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:15,603
<i>And I thought:</i>

1884
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:18,240
<i>why don't you take a break
for a few days</i>

1885
02:21:18,450 --> 02:21:20,361
<i>and come to Turin for a visit?</i>

1886
02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:26,403
"What happened in April
is no isolated case.

1887
02:21:27,130 --> 02:21:28,961
<i>After 50 days of striking
at FIAT,</i>

1888
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:31,240

achieved to date
by the worker class."

1892
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:41,639
No good. Too bureaucratic.

1893
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:45,039
You have to distinguish
between wishes and needs.

1894
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:48,040
Needs are a serious issue.

1895
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:50,764
They lead you to question things
and take risks.

1896
02:21:51,010 --> 02:21:53,365
Even to die or fight,
if necessary.

1897
02:21:53,730 --> 02:21:55,686
The need for communism,
for example.

1898
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:58,362
<i>-Afternoon.
-Afternoon.</i>

1899
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:00,038
Excuse me.

1900
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:02,844
-You finished early today.
-Yeah.

1901
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:05,368
I finished early.

1902
02:22:06,210 --> 02:22:07,882
-Hi, Sara.
-Hi.

1903
02:22:08,090 --> 02:22:09,762
-Are you drawing?
-Yeah.

1904
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:13,409
-Let's go for a walk.
-Yeah!

1905
02:22:13,810 --> 02:22:16,005
It's bad for kids
to be inside too much.

1906
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:18,886
And for people's brains.

1907
02:22:19,810 --> 02:22:21,607
"The need for communism..."

1908
02:22:21,930 --> 02:22:23,841
I need to drink, to eat...

1909
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:26,086
Sara, don't listen
to that bullshit.

1910
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:28,963
-That's a bad word!
-You're damn right.

1911
02:22:29,170 --> 02:22:32,640
<i>What do you say to someone
who lies at kindergarten?</i>

1912
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:35,080
-Lying bastard!
-Very good.

1913
02:22:36,130 --> 02:22:39,645
Come on, let's go
for a nice little stroll.

1914
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:43,078
-Bye!
-Bye!

1915

But it's cold,
it's cold...

1916
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:50,129
Let's take our coats.
Come on.

1917
02:22:50,330 --> 02:22:53,163
Let's get some air,
sweetie. Come on.

1918
02:22:57,770 --> 02:23:00,967
-Giulia...
-I know, I'll deal with it.

1919
02:23:26,210 --> 02:23:27,768
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1920
02:23:27,970 --> 02:23:30,086
-Luigi Pezzuco.
-Look inside.

1921
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:32,285
Thank you.

1922
02:24:11,290 --> 02:24:12,359
<i>Despite my misfortune,</i>

1923
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:14,401
I was lucky.

1924
02:24:14,810 --> 02:24:16,209
The doctors always say that.

1925
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:19,208
Two millimeters more
and I'd have lost both arms.

1926
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:22,568
Anyway,
that's how things always work.

1927
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:25,767
Well, almost always.

1928
02:24:26,450 --> 02:24:28,361
I even met a woman.

1929
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:31,721
Her name's Patrizia.
I want you to see her.

1930
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:35,243
I have a photo.

1931
02:24:36,370 --> 02:24:38,281
<i>It was taken of us
at a party.</i>

1932
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:41,729
It's in here.

1933
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:44,167
I know it is.
Here.

1934
02:24:48,770 --> 02:24:49,885
Very pretty.

1935
02:24:50,410 --> 02:24:51,365
Congratulations.

1936
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:52,844
She is pretty.

1937
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:55,128
We're getting married
in September.

1938
02:24:55,370 --> 02:24:57,679
And we want kids, too.

1939
02:24:58,170 --> 02:24:59,319
Lots of kids.

1940
02:24:59,690 --> 02:25:00,805
You're wondering how we...

1941
02:25:02,130 --> 02:25:04,564
Slowly,
with a little patience.

1942
02:25:05,090 --> 02:25:06,523
It's nice that way.

1943
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:07,879
So she says.

1944
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:09,639
Sure.

1945
02:25:09,890 --> 02:25:11,323
Reaching this point,

1946
02:25:11,650 --> 02:25:13,368
where I am with Patrizia,

1947
02:25:13,810 --> 02:25:16,165
would have been impossible
without your mom's help.

1948
02:25:16,810 --> 02:25:18,926
-My mom?
-Matteo.

1949
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:23,240
I have tons of notebooks
like this one.

1950
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:30,404
Without your mom,
I'd never have recovered

1951
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:31,759
the use of this hand.

1952
02:25:34,050 --> 02:25:35,722
He's been visiting you
all these years?

1953
02:25:35,930 --> 02:25:39,286
Once a week.
He's never missed.

1954
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:42,963
-You didn't know that?
-Of course I did.

1955
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:45,730
He's helped me
with more than my hand.

1956
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:48,360
AIso my brain.

1957
02:25:48,850 --> 02:25:51,239
I'd never read poetry before.

1958
02:25:51,570 --> 02:25:52,798
Listen to this:

1959
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:56,440
"Tears of honor you shall have,
Hector,

1960
02:25:56,650 --> 02:26:00,040
for holy are the tears of blood
spilt for one's country..."

1961
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:01,600
I can't read this.

1962
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:05,201
<i>"...as long as the sun shines
on human misfortune."</i>

1963
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:04,528
Dr. Carati?

1964
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:08,122
What a surprise!

1965
02:27:09,130 --> 02:27:10,085
How are you?

1966
02:27:10,290 --> 02:27:12,121
-Fine, you?
-Fine.

1967
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:14,560
-Where's your beard?
-Sara said it scratched too much.

1968
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:16,761
-Scratched?
-So I shaved it off.

1969
02:27:17,130 --> 02:27:19,769
Speaking of Sara,
this is for her.

1970
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:21,449
Thanks. Very nice.
What is it?

1971
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:23,606
A doll.
You can play with it, too.

1972
02:27:23,810 --> 02:27:27,405
Great! Did you go through Rome
on your way here?

1973
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:30,324
Yeah, but I didn't go home.

1974
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:33,524
These drawings?

1975
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:35,408
My patients do them.

1976
02:27:35,810 --> 02:27:37,562
We're organizing an exhibition.

1977
02:27:37,770 --> 02:27:39,442
-An exhibition?
-Yeah.

1978
02:27:42,770 --> 02:27:45,887
Did you know Mom's
been helping Luigi?

1979
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:48,565
That friend of mine
who was paralyzed?

1980
02:27:48,770 --> 02:27:49,885
Yeah, I knew.

1981
02:27:56,890 --> 02:27:58,767
-Who's that?
-My mentor.

1982
02:27:58,970 --> 02:28:00,289
Franco Basaglia.

1983
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:04,881
-The one who would free the mad.
-He has this crazy idea

1984
02:28:05,090 --> 02:28:07,923
that they're not actually inmates,
but people.

1985
02:28:08,130 --> 02:28:09,961
And that mental illness isn't

1986
02:28:10,170 --> 02:28:12,286
a sin to be expunged.
How about that!

1987
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:19,243
How is Dad?

1988
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:21,244
He's...

1989
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:23,602
-You should go see him.
-I will!

1990
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:26,483
I will.

1991
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:31,326
I'd already decided to.

1992
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:36,605
-Let's go see Giorgia.
-Yeah.

1993
02:28:37,090 --> 02:28:39,524
-How is she?
-Better.

1994
02:28:39,730 --> 02:28:40,765
You'll see.

1995
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:43,805
If she keeps improving
we'll release her.

1996
02:28:44,410 --> 02:28:46,765
We try to release them
as soon as possible.

1997
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:49,245
<i>Find them jobs,
an apartment...</i>

1998
02:28:50,170 --> 02:28:51,523
What's wrong with them?

1999
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:54,603
Doctors used to diagnose them
with schizophrenia,

2000
02:28:54,810 --> 02:28:56,482
but that has no meaning.

2001
02:28:56,850 --> 02:28:59,364
It means they're split in two.

2002
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:02,209
Who isn't?
Are you just a cop?

2003
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:03,843
Am I just a doctor?

2004
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:06,487
The truth is,
we know nothing.

2005
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:09,727
Just that these walls
make them crazy.

2006
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:12,923
-How do you treat that?
-By opening the patio.

2007
02:29:23,770 --> 02:29:27,683
-I'll wait in my office.
-Don't leave me alone with her.

2008
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:32,286
-What will I tell her?
-Maybe she has something to say.

2009
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:53,483
Hello, Giorgia.

2010
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:04,242
It's good to see you.

2011
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:40,568
How are you?
Are you okay?

2012
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:47,287
<i>Right, "are you okay?"
is sort of an absurd question.</i>

2013
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:51,408
It has no meaning.

2014
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:56,281
Nicola said you can go out.

2015
02:30:56,610 --> 02:30:58,965
You want to go for
an ice cream?

2016
02:30:59,730 --> 02:31:02,119
We'll find a jukebox
and play some music.

2017
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:05,808
You used to like music.

2018
02:31:12,490 --> 02:31:14,446
He also said you read,

2019
02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:18,522
that you like books.

2020
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,484
What do you read?

2021
02:31:27,370 --> 02:31:29,406
What words are in your head?

2022
02:31:39,570 --> 02:31:40,798
You can't hear.

2023
02:31:41,770 --> 02:31:44,045
Sound... air...

2024
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:46,402
concern... nothing.

2025
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:48,722
Nothing gets through.

2026
02:31:49,490 --> 02:31:51,560
The response would be:
"absent."

2027
02:31:53,930 --> 02:31:55,158
Absent.

2028
02:31:58,850 --> 02:32:00,442
As if you didn't know.

2029
02:32:08,210 --> 02:32:10,565
You remember that summer,
when we were kids?

2030
02:32:14,690 --> 02:32:16,043
What were you like?

2031
02:32:20,930 --> 02:32:22,249
What was I like?

2032
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:39,679
Crazy.

2033
02:32:39,890 --> 02:32:42,279
Crazy Matteo.

2034
02:32:45,130 --> 02:32:46,483
Giorgia!

2035
02:32:51,970 --> 02:32:55,280
-You think she'll be okay?
-Of course, you'll see.

2036
02:32:56,450 --> 02:32:59,522
It reminded me of that time...
Remember in the station?

2037
02:33:00,050 --> 02:33:01,961
Yeah, what about it?

2038
02:33:02,170 --> 02:33:04,809
Nothing, we were there,
listening to the song...

2039
02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:08,245
And she turned
and looked at me.

2040
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:11,442
-You were in love with her.
-No, you were.

2041
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:13,801
Well, we both were a bit.

2042
02:33:14,410 --> 02:33:16,970
-What song was it?
-"A chi," Fausto Leali.

2043
02:33:29,170 --> 02:33:30,523
Nicola!

2044
02:33:47,530 --> 02:33:48,929
Your father...

2045
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:10,726
Matteo,
can you slow down?

2046
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:18,088
Slow down.
Nobody's chasing us.

2047
02:34:23,650 --> 02:34:25,003
You want to drive?

2048
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:29,360
-Just slow down.
-This is how I drive.

2049
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:33,123
-Shit, Matteo, slow down.
-Giulia, please.

2050
02:34:33,330 --> 02:34:35,798
I'm scared. There's a child
in the car.

2051
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:37,843
You understand?

2052
02:34:43,890 --> 02:34:45,881
Why don't you answer?

2053
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:48,889
Why don't you answer?

2054
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:50,762
If you want to get out...

2055
02:34:50,970 --> 02:34:53,723
Stop the fucking car!
Tell him!

2056
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:55,523
Stop!

2057
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:58,884
Stop the car!
Get off the fucking road.

2058
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:02,082
-I'll bust you up!
-Okay, I'll pull over.

2059
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:11,764
What's your fucking problem?

2060
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:13,085
Turn around!

2061
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:16,965
Turn around!

2062
02:35:19,650 --> 02:35:21,003
Turn around!

2063
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:23,364
Matteo!

2064
02:36:30,050 --> 02:36:32,200
Thanks for coming.

2065
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:33,805
Hi.

2066
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:38,278
Thanks.

2067
02:36:46,370 --> 02:36:47,519
And your mom?

2068
02:36:48,250 --> 02:36:50,810
-How is she?
-She's devastated.

2069
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:53,160
Hi.

2070
02:36:54,370 --> 02:36:56,406
Hi, I'm Francesca.

2071
02:37:05,850 --> 02:37:08,239
Cops nowadays haven't got
a moment free.

2072
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:10,209
<i>He said he'd come after work.</i>

2073
02:37:10,410 --> 02:37:11,843
If he can make it.

2074
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:14,689
Why don't you come to Milan
for a while?

2075
02:37:15,610 --> 02:37:17,168
Francesca can manage
on her own.

2076
02:37:17,370 --> 02:37:19,964
It's not Francesca.
My work is here.

2077
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:22,685
<i>I know the school
would fall apart without you.</i>

2078
02:37:22,890 --> 02:37:24,562
But you should think
of yourself.

2079
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:26,283
That's what I'm doing.

2080
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:28,328
Working helps me.

2081
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:32,365
Giulia.

2082
02:37:32,570 --> 02:37:34,242
-How about some coffee?
-I'll make some.

2083
02:37:34,450 --> 02:37:36,008
No, I'll do it.

2084
02:37:38,970 --> 02:37:41,086
-You want a coffee?
-Yes, thank you.

2085
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:49,202
Excuse me, Francesca.

2086
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:52,049
-Where's the coffee pot?
-In that cabinet.

2087
02:37:54,290 --> 02:37:56,440
No, the one on the right.

2088
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:04,762
<i>Nicola says you'll make head of
the Treasury Department in 10 years.</i>

2089
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:06,723
Does he?

2090
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:09,888
I've only been at
the Bank of Italy for a year.

2091
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:13,685
Besides, that's a whole
different job.

2092
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:16,279
Meaning?

2093
02:38:16,490 --> 02:38:17,639
Well...

2094
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:20,281
that would be
a political office.

2095
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:22,967
We're mere specialists.

2096
02:38:23,490 --> 02:38:27,085
<i>Go on, be modest. Nicola says
you're smarter than he is.</i>

2097
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:28,645
Very impressive,

2098
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:30,442
coming from my brother.

2099
02:38:31,050 --> 02:38:32,369
Nicola's crazier
than his patients.

2100
02:38:32,570 --> 02:38:34,049
You're right.
God!

2101
02:38:35,570 --> 02:38:37,049
You're a clumsy one!

2102
02:38:37,570 --> 02:38:40,130
-How are things?
-Well, I passed my exam.

2103
02:38:41,290 --> 02:38:42,928
<i>I start university this year.</i>

2104
02:38:43,330 --> 02:38:44,763
Letters and Sciences.

2105
02:38:44,970 --> 02:38:46,449
I want to study Archaeology.

2106
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:48,569
Travel the world.

2107
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:51,082
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

2108
02:38:51,850 --> 02:38:54,410
I've competed in plenty
of student competitions.

2109
02:38:55,490 --> 02:38:57,003
I cook and play the violin.

2110
02:38:57,210 --> 02:38:58,928
-Is that it?
-Lots of other things.

2111
02:38:59,130 --> 02:39:01,041
I get bored doing
only one thing.

2112
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:03,559
You're bored now,
making coffee.

2113
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:05,442
I'm making coffee,
preparing

2114
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:07,049
sweets with Sara,

2115
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:09,605
and talking to
the Bank of Italy.

2116
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:13,603
That's plenty.

2117
02:39:20,370 --> 02:39:22,167
-Auntie, come quick!
-I'm coming.

2118
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:24,565
-Look how many I made.
-Good Lord!

2119
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:26,681
Look at all those!
You're a genius!

2120
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:29,085
-Ladies...
-Would you like more pasta?

2121
02:39:29,610 --> 02:39:31,407
-Yes.
-Can I take one?

2122
02:39:32,050 --> 02:39:34,962
-Carlo, get lost!
-Not yet. Go on.

2123
02:39:35,170 --> 02:39:37,161
Francesca is great with kids.

2124
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:40,363
Not me, though.

2125
02:39:41,130 --> 02:39:45,009
-I just don't have the knack.
-There are mothers of all kinds.

2126
02:39:45,490 --> 02:39:46,684
All different styles.

2127
02:39:46,890 --> 02:39:49,848
I wasn't a good mother
for Matteo.

2128
02:39:50,130 --> 02:39:53,042
At least, I wasn't
the mother he wanted.

2129
02:39:53,890 --> 02:39:56,882
You were a wonderful mother.
I can see that by Nicola.

2130
02:39:58,530 --> 02:39:59,724
Excuse me.

2131
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:05,883
-I'll go for milk.
-There should be some.

2132
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:09,163
Yeah, but not enough
to last till morning.

2133
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:14,284
I'm going for milk.

2134
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:15,889
I already bought some.

2135
02:40:16,730 --> 02:40:18,880
Is there no way out
of this house?

2136
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:23,204
Sorry.

2137
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:28,080
Sorry, darling.
Forgive me.

2138
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:55,609
-You're late.
-I'm sorry, I had problems at home.

2139
02:40:55,810 --> 02:40:58,085
You shouldn't keep
people waiting.

2140
02:40:58,570 --> 02:40:59,639
It's dangerous.

2141
02:41:00,970 --> 02:41:03,325
Sitting here with a briefcase
is suspicious.

2142
02:41:04,570 --> 02:41:07,130
-Have you got the keys?
-They're inside.

2143
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:10,044
With the money, the papers
and the gun.

2144
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:13,044
Know how to use it?

2145
02:41:13,410 --> 02:41:14,365
No.

2146
02:41:14,570 --> 02:41:15,798
You'll learn.

2147
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:54,318
Let me go.

2148
02:42:55,530 --> 02:42:57,680
Let me go, let me go.

2149
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:00,209
Nicola, let me go.

2150
02:43:02,290 --> 02:43:03,564
Let me go.

2151

2153
02:43:12,570 --> 02:43:13,923
Let me go.

2154
02:43:15,290 --> 02:43:16,086
Let me go.

2155
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:18,201
Just tell me why.

2156
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:33,403
Let me go.

2157
02:43:36,170 --> 02:43:37,319
Let me go.

Congratulations.

02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:33,648
-Sara, hi!
-My niece, Sara.

2244
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:35,398
Give your uncle a kiss.

2245
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:49,921
Nice wedding, eh?

2246
02:50:52,970 --> 02:50:55,962
-When are you getting married?
-Who would marry me?

2247
02:50:56,850 --> 02:50:58,841
What? You're a real catch.

2248
02:51:00,170 --> 02:51:03,003
Brakes and muffler repair,
blue collar aristocracy.

2249
02:51:03,810 --> 02:51:05,926
<i>I was a real catch.</i>

2250
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:08,202
What do you mean?

2251
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:10,962
This just came.

2252
02:51:23,130 --> 02:51:24,279
They fired you?

2253
02:51:24,490 --> 02:51:27,209
Basically.
Laid off with minimum benefits.

2254
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:29,487
They sent out 23,000 of these.

2255
02:51:29,930 --> 02:51:33,240
-Can't you do something?
-We've been on strike for a month.

2256
02:51:34,490 --> 02:51:35,843
You said things were okay.

2257
02:51:36,850 --> 02:51:40,445
I didn't want to ruin
Carlo's wedding.

2258
02:51:45,690 --> 02:51:46,918
Read this.

2259
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:03,442
What do you think?

2260
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:05,726
Do you study this
at the Bank of Italy?

2261
02:52:05,930 --> 02:52:07,249
Yeah, more or less.

2262
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:09,529
So what can be done?

2263
02:52:12,530 --> 02:52:14,839
Fiat is 7 billion lira
in debt.

2264
02:52:15,850 --> 02:52:17,966
Lots of smaller companies
are worse off,

2265
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:20,400
they don't produce enough.

2266
02:52:20,610 --> 02:52:22,328
They can't compete with

2267
02:52:22,530 --> 02:52:24,202
-the international market.
-So?

2268
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:26,202
The workers can't win.

2269
02:52:26,730 --> 02:52:29,005
That's his opinion.
He's not a genie.

2270
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:31,400
-I wish I were wrong.
-Pay no attention.

2271
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:33,441
You've got unions.

2272
02:52:33,650 --> 02:52:34,844
The unions, right.

2273
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:37,562
They're legs are broken.

2274
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:40,208
People are scared.

2275
02:52:40,410 --> 02:52:42,128
Carlo, say something!

2276
02:52:42,330 --> 02:52:44,400
They can just fire him?
Like 100 years ago?

2277
02:52:44,650 --> 02:52:47,084
What, you want me to lie?

2278
02:52:47,810 --> 02:52:50,483
They're reorganizing
the industrial system.

2279
02:52:50,690 --> 02:52:53,682
The industries are modernized
and they reduce costs

2280
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:56,165
-to remain competitive.
-Who cares?

2281
02:52:56,610 --> 02:52:58,043
I don't know.

2282
02:52:58,250 --> 02:53:00,286
We have to pay them
to screw things up?

2283
02:53:00,610 --> 02:53:02,248
To hell with the system.

2284
02:53:02,450 --> 02:53:04,884
Please!
To hell with the system?

2285
02:53:05,810 --> 02:53:08,324
Then what would you
replace it with?

2286
02:53:09,090 --> 02:53:10,364
-Any ideas?
-Me?

2287
02:53:10,650 --> 02:53:12,686
You're the ones
who should have them!

2288
02:53:12,890 --> 02:53:17,088
Okay, that's enough.
No need for an arguement.

2289
02:53:17,410 --> 02:53:20,208
<i>This is a party.
Forget about it.</i>

2290
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:29,242
I already knew
this was our swan's song.

2291
02:53:29,450 --> 02:53:31,600
They'll have forgotten us
in a few years.

2292
02:53:33,690 --> 02:53:35,169
Don't worry, doc!

2293
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:38,840
They can't beat me.
I won't sit at home

2294
02:53:39,050 --> 02:53:41,200
crying.
What do I care?

2295
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:43,287
Vitale'll find another job.

2296
02:53:43,490 --> 02:53:46,527
Or I'll invent one.
I'll fix kitchen sinks,

2297
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:50,279
TV sets, radiators...
They fill our homes with appliances

2298
02:53:50,490 --> 02:53:52,162
which inevitably break.

2299
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:54,679
Somebody has to fix them.

2300
02:53:54,890 --> 02:53:57,609
-Why not me?
-lmpeccable logic.

2301
02:53:59,050 --> 02:54:02,486
Or I'll check into a clinic,
dress up like Napoleon...

2302
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:04,409
Yes, sir!

2303
02:54:06,970 --> 02:54:08,801
I feel like dancing.

2304
02:54:09,170 --> 02:54:12,401
-Come on, let's go dance.
-Okay.

2305
02:54:12,610 --> 02:54:14,726
Come on, you two deadbeats!

2306
02:54:15,250 --> 02:54:16,365
Come and dance.

2307
02:54:21,930 --> 02:54:23,966
-You know "Anatomy"?
-What's that?

2308
02:54:26,650 --> 02:54:28,208
-"Amado mio."
-That one.

2309
02:54:34,930 --> 02:54:37,285
Mrs. Tommasi,
may I have this dance?

2310
02:54:47,450 --> 02:54:49,202
Hey, careful with my mom!
