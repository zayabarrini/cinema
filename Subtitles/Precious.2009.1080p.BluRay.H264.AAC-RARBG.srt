1
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,602
My name is Clareece "Precious" Jones.

2
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:41,275
I wish I had a light-skinned boyfriend
with real nice hair.

3
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,903
And I wanna be on the cover of a magazine.

4
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,365
But first, I wanna be
in one of them BET videos.

5
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:49,784
Momma said I can't dance.

6
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:53,371
Plus, she said, who wants
to see my big ass dancing, anyhow?

7
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,124
Well, if there's no volunteers,
then I'm going to have to call people.

8
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,045
Okay, Leticia, you got number one. Leticia!

9
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,505
Jess Wesley, number two.

10
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,716
I like math. I don't say nothing.

11
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:09,971
I don't open my book,
even. I just sit there.

12
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,597
- You down?
- Number six.

13
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:15,643
Every day I tell myself
something's gonna happen.

14
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:16,852
I'm... I'm dead serious.

15
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,271
Like, I'm gonna break through.

16
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:22,566
Or somebody's gonna break through to me.

17
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,277
I'm gonna be normal

18
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,280
and pay attention,
and sit in the front of the class.

19
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,574
Distributive principles...

20
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,742
Someday.

21
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:34,078
...are principles that
you can do in your head.

22
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,247
I like Mr. Wicher.

23
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:41,585
I pretend he my husband
and we live some place like Westchester.

24
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:46,298
Look at him. He like me, too, I know it.

25
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,846
I can tell by his eyes.
He always looking at me and smiling at me.

26
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,015
Boys! Boys! Boys!

27
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,307
I'm not your fucking boy!

28
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,517
You're disrupting the class.

29
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,020
Yeah, well, I'm talking now,
so you listen.

30
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,690
Shut the fuck up! I'm trying to listen!

31
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:08,279
Mr. Wicher know I got his back.

32
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,239
One twenty-two.

33
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,909
Why are we barking, Jess?

34
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:18,873
Monday's assignment.
I'm assuming everybody did it.

35
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,292
- No.
- No.

36
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,341
Please... Quiet. Precious, get your things.

37
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,510
I have... Come here for a second.

38
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:32,720
Now this shit.

39
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:35,806
Is there anybody
who didn't do their homework?

40
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,105
Why? These aren't requests.
These are requirements. Okay?

41
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:49,695
You have to go to the principal's office.

42
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,707
Go to the principal's office!

43
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,710
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

44
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:08,172
No, he's not allowed on campus.
Where was he seen?

45
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:10,174
Could you get Mr. Tork from Room 25,

46
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,676
tell him to go to Room 16 right away?
Thank you.

47
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,513
No. He was seen on the second floor.

48
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,349
Yes. Thank you.

49
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,601
Send Clareece in here!

50
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,856
She's ready for you now.

51
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,821
Mr. Taylor? Ms. Lichenstein.

52
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,614
Come in.

53
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:36,367
Matthew Williams, second floor.

54
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:40,496
In front of his locker.
Yes. Suspended last week.

55
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,416
Yeah.

56
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,169
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

57
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,131
Hello, Clareece.

58
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,929
Are you pregnant?

59
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,274
You're 16. You're still
in junior high school,

60
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,987
and you're pregnant with your second child.

61
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,239
Is that correct, Clareece?

62
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,952
Are you pregnant again?

63
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,628
What happened, Clareece?

64
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,423
I had sex, Ms. Lichenstein.

65
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:41,891
Do you have any other thoughts
about your situation, Clareece?

66
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,480
Clareece?

67
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,608
Am I in trouble?

68
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:55,196
Thank you. I gotta get back to math.

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,365
Sit down, Clareece. Sit down right now.

70
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:04,371
We should have a parent-teacher's
conference with you, me and your mother.

71
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,540
My mother's busy.

72
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,959
All right. Well then,
how about if I come to your house?

73
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,003
If I were you, I wouldn't.

74
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,797
I... I'm going to have to suspend you.

75
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,968
That ain't fair! I didn't do nothing!
I do my work!

76
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:19,136
My grades is good!

77
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,138
Is something going on at home?

78
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:25,351
If something's going on at home,
I want you to tell me right now.

79
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,156
You get my cigarettes?

80
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,408
No, they didn't have it.

81
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,745
I played the number, though.
I couldn't box it.

82
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,233
Yes. Yeah.

83
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,904
Right there. Yeah. Daddy loves you.

84
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,957
Precious, what did you think of the film?

85
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,208
I thought it was fabulous.

86
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,794
- What's next for you?
- What?

87
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,463
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great!

88
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,967
Just one more, just one more, quick!

89
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:41,677
I love you, too!

90
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,264
You know I love you!

91
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,932
Hey, boo!

92
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,443
I ain't gonna say it no more.

93
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,783
The door was open, so I let myself in.

94
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:08,245
Well, there goes my chance
to tell you I'm not home.

95
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,539
Now, Mary, this is important.

96
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:17,148
Now, come on, Mary,
she'll have a great time.

97
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:20,591
I'd enroll myself, but I became ineligible
for teen pageants a few days ago.

98
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:24,470
Yeah, I see your acne's cleared up.

99
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,750
You know, this pageant can do Brenda
a world of good, Mary.

100
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,477
And the man in charge, he's tops
in his field. A brilliant promoter.

101
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,645
How long have you two been dating?

102
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,191
A dance teacher.

103
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,071
Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell.

104
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:44,823
I hate crackheads.

105
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:48,410
No one ever ring this bell
except for crackheads.

106
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,621
Why they fucking with us?

107
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,504
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzers,
motherfuckers!

108
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,756
Give the ghetto a bad name.

109
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,972
Stop ringing the goddamn buzzer!

110
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,693
Stop it!

111
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,154
Press "listen," stupid.

112
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:33,330
It's Sandra Lichenstein
for Clareece and Ms. Mary Johnston.

113
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,335
Who is that, Precious?

114
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,921
White bitch from school.

115
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,013
What do you want?

116
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:54,017
Clareece, I want to talk to you
about your education.

117
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,773
Eighty-six that bitch.

118
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,609
My mother don't wanna get cut off welfare.

119
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,237
And that's just what this visit
gonna result in.

120
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:11,285
Ms. Lichenstein, get out of here
before I kick your ass.

121
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,620
All right, Clareece, I spoke to Mr. Wicher,

122
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:16,540
and he told me
that you're one of his best math students.

123
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:19,585
If your fat ass don't get
that bitch away from here...

124
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,296
...like a, like a potential for math.

125
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,922
So I called Mrs. McKnight

126
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:28,135
from Higher Education Alternative
Each One Teach One.

127
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,138
It's an alternative school.

128
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,224
Clareece, are you listening to me?

129
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,893
Yeah.

130
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,813
Okay. Mrs. McKnight. Each One Teach One.

131
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:45,903
It's located at the 11th floor,
Hotel Theresa, 125th Street.

132
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,864
- Get rid of that bitch.
- The semester started a few days ago,

133
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,990
so you're not too late.

134
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,617
Eleventh floor.

135
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:53,702
I heard you the first time.

136
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,829
Okay.

137
00:10:57,248 --> 00:11:01,585
I don't know what an alternative school is,
but I feel I wanna know.

138
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,797
My heart is all warm inside.

139
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:09,301
Mr. Wicher think I'm a good student.

140
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,804
I knew that he liked me.

141
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,327
School ain't gonna help none!

142
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,955
Take your ass down to the welfare.

143
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,290
Who the fuck she think she is?

144
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:46,046
So I guess you think you cute now, right?
Uppity bitch.

145
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,132
You should have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

146
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,072
Just 'cause he gonna give you
more children than he give me,

147
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:55,347
you think you something fucking special?

148
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,432
Fuck you and fuck him!

149
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,188
Precious!

150
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:07,609
Precious! Precious!

151
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,237
Get down here, bitch!

152
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,698
You brought that white bitch up
in my house!

153
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,536
You...
Why would you bring that bitch up in here?

154
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,660
I didn't bring her here.

155
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,621
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

156
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,457
I can't hear you, Precious.

157
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,585
Since you got
so much motherfucking mouth,

158
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,349
and you gonna bring a bitch up
in my house,

159
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:28,463
why would that bitch ring
my goddamn buzzer?

160
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,257
I didn't tell her to come here.

161
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:34,052
See, I think right now, you feeling
like you're becoming a grown woman.

162
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,971
'Cause of that shit you pulled
in the kitchen.

163
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,433
I should've fucked you up,
but I let you walk away,

164
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,435
and I let you come get yourself together.

165
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,563
But, bitch, I'm gonna let you know
if you ever pull that shit on me again,

166
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:47,190
that will be your last
motherfucking day standing,

167
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,275
I promise you that.

168
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,902
You gonna send a white bitch
to my motherfucking buzzer?

169
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,613
Talking about some higher education?

170
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:55,949
You're a dummy, bitch,
you will never know shit.

171
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,327
Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.

172
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,038
You done fucked around
and fucked my motherfucking man

173
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:03,040
and had two motherfucking children,

174
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:04,791
and one of them is a goddamn animal,

175
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:07,961
running around,
looking crazy as a motherfucker.

176
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:12,049
Bitch, you know what? See, I
think you... I think you're trying me.

177
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:16,637
I think you're really trying to fuck
with me. You're fucking with my money.

178
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,805
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

179
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,474
like you're a motherfucking woman.

180
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,517
I'm gonna show you
what real women do, bitch.

181
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,062
See, you don't know
what real motherfucking women do.

182
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,105
Real motherfucking women sacrifice.

183
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,567
I should've aborted your motherfucking ass.
'Cause you ain't shit.

184
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,236
I knew it the day the doctors put you
in my goddamn hand

185
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,821
you wasn't a goddamn thing,

186
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,199
and you have that smirk
on your face, bitch?

187
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,992
Get it off your fucking face!

188
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:42,663
Now smile about that!
Smile about that, you fat bitch.

189
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,377
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

190
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,013
Get off me, bitch!

191
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,684
And "blank" and eggs?

192
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,102
- Bacon?
- Right.

193
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,729
- And "What's up, Doc?" He eats these.
- Carrots.

194
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:11,191
- Right. And ice, it comes in a tray.
- Ice cubes.

195
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:14,194
Right. And the best
part of the steak. The...

196
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,737
- The T-bone. The...
- No.

197
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,155
- Filet mignon.
- Right!

198
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,701
- And an English... Thomas' English...
- Muffin!

199
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,577
- Right.
- That's it!

200
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:33,672
You really need to get some rest.

201
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,550
You have such a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

202
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,803
And remember, Mommy loves you.

203
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:48,478
Describe these things that are planned.
Things that are planned. Ready? Go!

204
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,776
Precious, you know I love you.

205
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,863
I'm gonna kick that white lady
out of my house,

206
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,781
move you in with me.

207
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,992
Wanna live in Westchester?

208
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,162
- Commit a...
- Crime.

209
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:07,205
And this is you get back together again.

210
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,331
- A class...
- Reunion.

211
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,916
And this is when you're like this,

212
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:11,251
- you're expecting...
- Pregnant.

213
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,795
- Yeah. And this is you make a fast...
- Escape.

214
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,630
- Right.
- That's it!

215
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:52,125
Where you going?

216
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:56,379
Make sure you play my 852
and tell them to box it.

217
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,052
And get some kitty litter.

218
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,308
Ethel, where you at?

219
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,540
Precious, what are we gonna play?

220
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:14,625
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

221
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,168
Ain't you supposed to be
at school or something?

222
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,818
You said we was gonna play.

223
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:20,028
That's exactly why
we ain't gonna be playing.

224
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,696
I never said nothing like that.

225
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,554
You would say some shit like that to me,
and you don't even mean it?

226
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:31,808
No, I'm not playing with you.
No, and she call... Hold on.

227
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,270
Each One Teach One, hold, please.

228
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:39,274
Yes. She called my house.
I know it wasn't your sister, Trey.

229
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,902
Because it wasn't her.

230
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,365
What this is here?

231
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,326
Each One Teach One.

232
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,245
I'm looking for an alternative school.

233
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,122
This is an alternative.

234
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,333
What alternative is?

235
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,877
What exactly are you asking me?

236
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,004
Lady at my other school
told me to come here.

237
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,424
Hotel Theresa.
Said it's an alternative school.

238
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:10,555
An alternative school, it's like a choice.
It's a different way of doing things.

239
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,309
So, I need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.

240
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,312
I got kicked out of school
'cause I was pregnant.

241
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,273
Well, I still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.

242
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,400
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

243
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,819
You the one she called about.

244
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:28,365
Clareece P. Jones?

245
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:32,202
They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.

246
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,912
I could start today?

247
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,332
Yeah. Are you currently receiving AFDC?

248
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,460
My mother get AFDC
for me and my daughter.

249
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:43,755
So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?

250
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,800
Okay, well, I'm gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,

251
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,886
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.

252
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:53,264
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,

253
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,016
see where to place you.

254
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:58,520
Hold on, baby. Each One Teach One, hold.

255
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,984
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.

256
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,601
There's always something wrong
with these tests.

257
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,814
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.

258
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,192
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,

259
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,737
my whole family, as less than dumb.

260
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:52,907
Just ugly, black grease to be wiped away,
find another job for.

261
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,911
Sometimes I wish I was dead.

262
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:02,292
I'll be okay, I guess,
'cause I'm looking up.

263
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,047
I'm looking up for a piano to fall.

264
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:11,092
Or a desk, couch, TV... Momma, maybe.

265
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,304
Always something in my way.

266
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:16,639
Yeah, man.

267
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,975
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.

268
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,560
Alternative.

269
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,645
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.

270
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,023
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.

271
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,983
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.

272
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:29,027
It is what it is.

273
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,196
Then my mind come back down to Earth.

274
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,824
Let me get some of that sweet ass, orca!

275
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:36,326
What up, mama?

276
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,453
Why boys always grabbing on themselves?

277
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,373
You heard what the fuck I said?
I said give me some fucking ass.

278
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,251
I'm serious!
When you gonna let me hit that?

279
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,377
That bitch is laughing...

280
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,837
I wish they'd leave me alone.

281
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:49,923
- She's stupid.
- Yeah.

282
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:54,469
Yo, that's not even funny.

283
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,347
That's what she'd get anyway, no.

284
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,351
Precious!

285
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:04,098
Ma, I need some money!

286
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,021
Ma, I'm hungry!

287
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,651
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.

288
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,950
I wish she'd stop this shit.

289
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,959
The other day I cried.

290
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:35,713
I felt stupid. But you know what?

291
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,924
Fuck that day.

292
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:43,054
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.

293
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,515
Still hungry, though.

294
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,690
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

295
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,401
They're my kids.

296
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,448
- What do you want, baby?
- Give me a basket, please.

297
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,367
- Sides?
- I don't know yet.

298
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:08,079
Still thinking about it.
Trying to watch my figure.

299
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,919
Butchie, you got a 10-piece ready?

300
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,234
Potato salad.

301
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:39,902
Thank you.

302
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,744
Hell, no, she didn't!

303
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,788
Get her ass! Get that big bitch!

304
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,908
No, I am not the one.

305
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,184
You in ABE?

306
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,354
Yeah.

307
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,732
Time's a-wasting.

308
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:06,757
What's your name?

309
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,051
Clareece.

310
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,013
Are you coming in?

311
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,897
That door closes in 20 seconds.

312
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,571
How are you guys doing today?

313
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:32,658
Would you like to join us, Consuelo?

314
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,329
Consuelo, class is beginning.

315
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,627
You guys know
that you are in the ABE class.

316
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,631
This is not GED.
This is to get you ready for your GED.

317
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:11,239
These journals are very important
to this class, so do not forget them.

318
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,699
You will need to use them every day
that you are here.

319
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:15,243
They are the key to this class.

320
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,661
It's 9:07, Joann. You're late.

321
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,432
You're the one who said breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

322
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:22,416
Tomorrow, that door will be locked at 9:00.

323
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:29,382
I want you to state your name,
where you were born,

324
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:34,136
your favorite color, something you do well
and why you're here.

325
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,014
I'll go first.

326
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,641
When you due?

327
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,686
- My name...
- What you mean, you don't know?

328
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,437
...is Blu Rain.

329
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,773
- That's your real name?
- Yes, it is.

330
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,317
Your first name's Blu?

331
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,825
My favorite color is purple. I sing well.

332
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,744
And I'm here

333
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:03,666
because I love to teach.

334
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,209
She like to sing.

335
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,752
Rhonda?

336
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:10,840
I wish I could sing.
Go to church and sing in the choir.

337
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,092
Show them how it's done.

338
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:17,888
All right.
My name is Rhonda Patrice Johnson.

339
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,100
Problem?

340
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,395
- I should smack her.
- What?

341
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:30,026
I was born in Kingston, Jamaica,
and my favorite color is blue.

342
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:32,111
And I cook good.

343
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,822
My mother, she used to have a restaurant
over on 7th Avenue.

344
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,491
Before she get sick,
she teach me everything.

345
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:41,412
So I'm here to get my reading up,
so I can get my GED.

346
00:29:46,627 --> 00:29:50,212
My name is Rita Romero.
I was born here in Harlem.

347
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:55,551
I'm here 'cause I was an addict
and I dropped out of school.

348
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:59,513
So I never got
my reading and writing together.

349
00:30:00,057 --> 00:30:01,849
My favorite color's black.

350
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,309
What do you do good?

351
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:06,145
"Well," Joann. "What do you do well?"

352
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:09,148
- What do I do well?
- No. Rita?

353
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,485
I'm a good mother. Very good mother.

354
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:18,949
My name's Jermaine.
My favorite color is red.

355
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,160
Tell us where you were born first.

356
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:24,413
I was born in the Bronx. Still live there.

357
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:28,417
My favorite color is red. Used to be blue.

358
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,004
I can dance real good.

359
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:34,298
Homie of mine told me
about Each One Teach One,

360
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:37,134
so I came here to stay out of trouble.

361
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:40,012
So you came here to Harlem
to stay out of trouble? Is that right?

362
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,472
Yeah.

363
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,225
- Consuelo?
- This is bullshit.

364
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,851
You think so?

365
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:51,982
Clareece?

366
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,278
Can I skip, too?

367
00:30:58,281 --> 00:30:59,740
Joann?

368
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,285
Okay. I'm Joann. Hey.

369
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,124
My favorite color is fluorescent beige

370
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,085
and my ambition is to have
my own record layer.

371
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,211
What's a record layer?

372
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:15,214
Tell us where you come from
and why you come to this school.

373
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:17,258
I was born in Kings County Hospital,

374
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,760
but my mother moved us to Harlem
when I was nine.

375
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:24,890
I'm here to get my GED, and then...
Well, I'm already into the music industry.

376
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,561
I'm just trying to take care of this
little education thing so I can move up.

377
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:33,691
Let's begin. This is ABE.

378
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:35,109
Can I go?

379
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,993
I wish I could sit
in the back of the class again.

380
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:56,547
My name Clareece "Precious" Jones.

381
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:59,425
I go by Precious.

382
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:04,555
I live in Harlem. I like yellow.

383
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,687
And I had problems at my other school,
so I come here.

384
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:15,941
Something you do well?

385
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:19,820
Nothing.

386
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,865
Everybody's good at something.

387
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,328
Come on.

388
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,668
Well, I can cook. And...

389
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,924
I never really talked in class before.

390
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:46,055
How does that make you feel?

391
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,605
Here.

392
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,402
It makes me feel here.

393
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:04,865
Everybody open theirjournal.

394
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,994
Write the date at the top of the page,
and write.

395
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:12,790
I don't care if you spell everything wrong.

396
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,061
I don't care if it's grammatically
incorrect. But just write.

397
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:16,794
Write anything that you're feeling.

398
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,213
This class will be a revolving door.

399
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,466
Some of you will make it
and some of you won't.

400
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,928
Fifteen minutes. Go.

401
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:33,936
Before, I got a A-minus at English,
and I didn't have to say nothing.

402
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,358
Ms. Rain said we gonna read
and write in our notebooks every day.

403
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,610
How we supposed to do that?

404
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:47,199
But then she see the worry on my face
and she say,

405
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:50,452
"The longest journey
begin with a single step."

406
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,749
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

407
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,377
Come on, come on, do the work.

408
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:01,881
You love it, love it, learn it.

409
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,341
Consuelo?

410
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,969
"C" for Consuelo.

411
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,179
"C" for kick your ass.

412
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,599
It's "K" for kick your ass, stupid.

413
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,684
I got the "D," Ms. Rain.

414
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,523
"D" for dick.

415
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,545
Ms. Rain, tell this little-ass bitch
that she don't know me.

416
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,528
Which you wish you had.

417
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:33,954
- Help her.
- "E."

418
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:38,667
"E."

419
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:06,737
"F" for fat.

420
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:09,406
What?

421
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,033
Good.

422
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:17,706
Hey! Hey! Hey! Quit it! Hey!

423
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,709
- What?
- Hey, you stop it right now!

424
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,336
- You fucking...
- Quit it!

425
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,545
- She just hit me!
- Drop it!

426
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,755
Shut the fuck up!

427
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,091
She just slapped me!

428
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,509
Get out.

429
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:31,845
We don't fight in my class. Sit down.

430
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:38,560
"C" for cold.

431
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,114
Do you live with anybody?

432
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,866
My mother.

433
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,244
What does she do?

434
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:59,289
She don't do nothing.

435
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,754
I want you to read a page from this book.

436
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:15,180
Try.

437
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:20,769
All I need you to do is sound out
these words for me.

438
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,396
You don't have to know every word.

439
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,191
You just have to... It doesn't matter
if you stumble or... Try for me...

440
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:30,404
...or trip up on it.
You just need to say what you know.

441
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,116
Come on. You can do this.
Try. Take it word by word.

442
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,785
- Are you listening to me?
- Precious!

443
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,872
I just wanna know where you are
in your reading skills.

444
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:41,308
'Cause I'm looking at your test scores...

445
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,834
Some higher fucking learning.
You're a dumb bitch!

446
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,544
Try to read, okay?

447
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:47,963
Just help me and then I can help you.

448
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,466
We'll start from scratch. Word for word.

449
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,093
I want you better than your mother.

450
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:56,555
- I'm gonna call the nurse.
- No.

451
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:03,979
It all look the same to me.

452
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,234
What's this?

453
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:13,989
I can't do that, Ms. Rain.

454
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,700
Push yourself.

455
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:20,496
A.

456
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,749
What's this word?

457
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,799
Do you know the letters? Come on.

458
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,510
"D."

459
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:39,139
"A."

460
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,101
"Y."

461
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,853
Do you know that word?

462
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:48,565
"Day."

463
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,486
What word is that?

464
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,365
Ate. Ate.

465
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:58,867
Good. Almost. The word is "At."

466
00:38:00,703 --> 00:38:01,912
"At."

467
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,791
"The."

468
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:09,586
Sound it out.

469
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,171
"Beach."

470
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,383
The word is "Shore."
It's almost like "Beach."

471
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,552
Very good.

472
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,721
Now, read the whole thing for me.

473
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:22,891
"A

474
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,853
"Day.

475
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,607
"At The.

476
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,068
"Shore."

477
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:42,911
Get your big ass in here.

478
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,885
Where was you at this morning?

479
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,060
You hear me talking to you?
Where was you at this morning?

480
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,521
School. I was at school.

481
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:11,023
You a lying whore.

482
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,108
- I'm not lying.
- You is.

483
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:16,255
The welfare done called here saying
they gonna remove you from my budget

484
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:18,199
'cause you ain't been
attending school regularly.

485
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,948
I told you I got kicked out.

486
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,075
I been home nearly every day
for two weeks now.

487
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,537
You ain't told me nothing
about no damn school today.

488
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:28,624
I told you I was going
to school this morning.

489
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:33,503
You plan on putting some food
in that frying pan?

490
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,345
Precious, you got something
you wanna say?

491
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:43,555
- No.
- Then don't be slamming shit down in here.

492
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,224
You understand?

493
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:47,601
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:52,731
You need to forget about that school shit
and take your ass down to the welfare.

495
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,650
I'm getting a stipend from school.

496
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:56,944
Fool, what the fuck is a stipend?
What is that?

497
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,614
Fuck a stipend.
I said take your ass down to the welfare.

498
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:01,823
Right now?

499
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:05,577
Why in the fuck would you go right now?
It's at nighttime. Shit is closed.

500
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:06,912
You gotta be there by 7:00 a.m.

501
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:09,581
in the morning
if you wanna talk to somebody.

502
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:11,291
Fucking stupid.

503
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,632
You think you're too good now?
Is that what it is?

504
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:22,344
You think you is too good for the welfare?

505
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:29,977
There's more white folk getting assistance
than it is niggers, Ms. Onassis.

506
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,397
I think I said therapy...

507
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:37,234
Hurry your ass up.
I am in here fucking starving.

508
00:40:37,986 --> 00:40:39,672
Now what you gonna do
if I die of starvation?

509
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,863
Where you gonna go after that?

510
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:44,992
I forgot. School.

511
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,288
Each... What that bitch say?
Each one do what?

512
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:51,456
Each one teach one?

513
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,060
Well, they don't know
who the fuck they teaching,

514
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,252
'cause you can't learn shit.

515
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:58,672
Keep on listening to them white people.

516
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,425
That's what's gonna get you fucked up.

517
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,263
Precious, I'm hungry.

518
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:36,084
You ain't cooked no collard greens
with the fucking pigs' feet?

519
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:39,588
Like, how am I supposed to eat pigs' feet
with no collard greens?

520
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:43,508
And why in the fuck does that pigs' feet
have so much hair in it?

521
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:46,887
You eat it. You come eat this shit.

522
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,264
- I'm not hungry, though.
- Yes, you is.

523
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:52,517
Precious, if you don't get
this goddamn plate...

524
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:02,444
You just fix mine when you get done. Since
you fucked it up, you gonna eat it up.

525
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,864
Hurry up and eat, Precious.
I'm fucking hungry, too.

526
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,329
And don't let it get cold, 'cause
cold-ass pigs' feet is nasty as shit.

527
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,211
So, tell me about...
Tell me about your home life.

528
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:29,758
Ain't nothing to really talk about.

529
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:32,761
You're in a safe place. Just talk.

530
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:34,095
What's going on?

531
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,574
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

532
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:37,724
when you think about home?

533
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,520
I just wish I had my own TV,
so I could watch it in my room.

534
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,815
If I had my own TV,
I wouldn't have to watch it with my mother.

535
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,693
And what's it like,
watching TV with your mother?

536
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,530
You enjoy watching TV with your mother?

537
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:56,618
I need to know about your home life. I
need to know what it's like where you live.

538
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,746
My mother's like a whale on the couch.

539
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,833
She say I eat all the time,
but she always making me eat.

540
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:06,127
Then she call me a fat mess.

541
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:09,339
She say the apartment
is little 'cause of me.

542
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:12,217
Only time she ever leaves
is to play her numbers.

543
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:15,220
I feel like I could just sit in the house
with her every day,

544
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:16,721
the shades drawn,

545
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:21,017
watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

546
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:24,145
Can you help out with that?

547
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:28,024
Can we talk about something else now?

548
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:36,241
How about your firstborn?

549
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:37,659
Mongo?

550
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:41,580
Mongo is her... Is that...

551
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:44,916
Mongo. That's short for "mongoloid."

552
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:50,130
Is that what you call her? Or that's...
What is that? A nickname?

553
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,757
She got Down's syndrome.

554
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:01,975
How you doing, Precious?

555
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:04,603
My grandmother Toosie
bring little Mongo over to our house

556
00:46:04,687 --> 00:46:09,024
on days when the social worker come,
so it look like she live with us.

557
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,569
Answer the fucking door.

558
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,489
Do you see what you did? God damn it.

559
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:19,868
Then my mother gets money
and the food stamps for me and Mongo.

560
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:21,369
Who is it?

561
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:23,580
It's Ms. Turner.

562
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:25,665
Social worker's here.

563
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,461
Why didn't you tell me that bitch
was coming so fucking early?

564
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:32,213
My fucking wig. Come get my wig!

565
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:33,632
Come up!

566
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:40,221
Where's my lipstick?

567
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,603
Thank you, thank you.

568
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,783
- Get off of me.
- Leave that child alone, please.

569
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:02,077
Mind your goddamn business.

570
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,955
- Hi, Precious.
- Hey.

571
00:47:06,374 --> 00:47:09,167
- Hello, Ms. Turner. How you doing?
- Hi, Mary. How are you?

572
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:12,504
Please excuse that.
My sweet grandbaby just knocked it over.

573
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,881
Please, have a seat. Excuse the mess.

574
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,508
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

575
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:17,842
How are you, Mary?

576
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,929
I'm doing really good, Ms. Turner.
Thank you.

577
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:24,307
When was the last time
you've taken her to the doctor?

578
00:47:25,434 --> 00:47:27,769
Precious, when...
When did we take her? The baby?

579
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:28,895
Last month.

580
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,399
Yeah... On the 16th.
On the 16th. Yes, yes, ma'am.

581
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,568
Okay, and what did the doctor say?

582
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,116
They said
that she's progressing really good.

583
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,992
She's doing really good.

584
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:45,245
- That's good.
- Yes, ma'am.

585
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,080
And have you been looking for a job?

586
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,459
I have, Ms. Turner. I am.
But they've all been saying the same thing.

587
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:55,046
You know, they'll call me back.
They'll get back to me.

588
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:59,551
When did you go looking for the job?

589
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:03,805
I went last week
and I filled out several applications.

590
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:07,600
And they all said the same thing,
that they would call me.

591
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:10,979
Mommy!

592
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,857
No! No!

593
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:17,402
Is that a new microwave oven?

594
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,779
A... A microwave?

595
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:24,492
No, ma'am.
We warm our things up in the oven.

596
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:28,288
- I see. It's a toaster oven.
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

597
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:32,667
Okay.
I will be seeing and speaking with you

598
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:34,961
in a week or so.

599
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,087
- In a week or so?
- Yes.

600
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:39,674
Okay, do you know what time you'll be...
You'll be coming?

601
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:41,009
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

602
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:42,529
- I'll let you know.
- Thank you so much.

603
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:45,346
Precious, any questions for me?

604
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,517
How are you, Precious?

605
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:52,687
I'm doing good. How you doing?

606
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,440
I'm good, thank you.

607
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,610
Ladies, thank you for your time.

608
00:48:58,694 --> 00:49:00,612
Thank you so much, Ms. Turner.
Have a great day.

609
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:02,864
- And you. Bye, Sheila.
- Bye.

610
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:10,413
Come get this motherfucking... Get her.

611
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:13,374
Moving all around and shit
while I'm trying to talk to this bitch.

612
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:15,376
Makes me fucking itch.

613
00:49:16,629 --> 00:49:19,422
She done threw her fucking candy
on the floor.

614
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,049
Goddamn animal.

615
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:25,804
And now you gonna give it to her?
Put the fucking candy back on the floor!

616
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:27,491
Then you go and pick it up
and let her have it.

617
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:30,725
You're so fucking stupid.
Just like her dumb ass.

618
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,521
That bitch gonna come up in here
and I gotta fucking make pretend?

619
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:35,939
I'm so sick of it.

620
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:38,483
I don't know what the fuck
you shaking your head for.

621
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,026
You didn't do no goddamn better.

622
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,195
You know what?
Let's talk about your father.

623
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,739
Tell me about your relationship with him.

624
00:49:44,824 --> 00:49:47,283
I don't know much more
than you do, Ms. White.

625
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:49,035
It's Ms. Weiss.

626
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,788
Talk to me about
the little you do know about your father,

627
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:55,124
'cause it is important,
whether you know it or not.

628
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:58,503
He give me this baby
and my one before it, but I...

629
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:01,172
What did you say he gave you?

630
00:50:01,257 --> 00:50:02,734
- Nothing.
- No, Clareece, you just said

631
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:03,985
your father gave you something.

632
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:06,010
- I heard you just say...
- You didn't hear shit.

633
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,949
- I heard you say your father...
- I ain't say nothing. I ain't say shit like it.

634
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,867
- I don't care, honey.
- I didn't say nothing like that.

635
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,475
- I need to know this.
- Let's move on.

636
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,935
I need to know this to help you.

637
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:17,021
- Bitch, can we change the subject?
- Okay.

638
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:20,275
Well, I'll see you next time, then.
Or maybe you'll see someone else.

639
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,946
But you're gonna have to talk to somebody
if you want your check, sweetie.

640
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,208
I see vampires, too.

641
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:43,381
They come at night.
They tell me I'm one of them.

642
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:47,886
They say, "Precious, you belong with us."

643
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:52,807
And then they go downstairs
through the floor.

644
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:55,727
The people that live under us,
they is vampires,

645
00:50:55,811 --> 00:50:58,146
so that's where they should go.

646
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,857
They be so nasty, though,

647
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:03,318
leaving their dirty tampons and shit
in the garbage.

648
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:05,820
Don't even offer to take it out.

649
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:08,448
They got no fucking home training.

650
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:15,246
I been going to the doctor, too. It's nice.

651
00:51:16,665 --> 00:51:21,002
Ms. Rain fall out when she found out
I ain't never been to no doctor before.

652
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:26,549
Don't know how I had my first baby
on the kitchen floor

653
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:29,552
with my momma kicking me
upside my head.

654
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,658
Them the kind of things
you're talking about

655
00:51:33,682 --> 00:51:36,517
when you say,
say whatever come to my mind?

656
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,816
That's the end of them welfare checks.

657
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:47,946
I just couldn't lie no more.
I shouldn't have said none of that.

658
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,284
Momma gonna kill me.

659
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:03,711
Motherfuckers!

660
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,967
Are we done?

661
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:10,802
I'm not doing this with you today.

662
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:13,554
At night, we went out on a field trip.

663
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:20,645
These girls is crazy.

664
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:24,399
Ain't nobody ever grabbed my hand
like that before.

665
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,584
...as a candidate
for the Democratic nomination

666
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:46,671
for the presidency
of the United States of America.

667
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,092
...and by having destroyed it,
now we don't know...

668
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:58,433
...and the testimony you're about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth...

669
00:52:58,517 --> 00:53:00,393
I still have a dream.

670
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:05,857
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

671
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:10,862
I have a dream that one day

672
00:53:12,364 --> 00:53:17,535
this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of...

673
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:19,746
I'm gonna teach my baby all of this.

674
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,874
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

675
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,043
"that all men are created equal."

676
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:27,378
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

677
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:28,606
You mean, write a whole new one?

678
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,507
No, girl, if I need to
explain myself to you...

679
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:33,403
- You'll figure it out.
- You think that I'm stupid?

680
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,471
Oh, my God. That I believe in you?

681
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:40,016
That I think you're incredible?

682
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,809
Yes, but I don't know what to do.

683
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:44,937
All right, pull it together. Okay.
Who's next?

684
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:47,231
I'm happy to be writing.

685
00:53:47,316 --> 00:53:50,318
- Go ahead, Rhonda.
- I'm happy to be in school, too.

686
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:53,738
Ms. Rain say we gonna write
every day in our notebook.

687
00:53:53,822 --> 00:53:55,782
She gonna write back to us every day, too.

688
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:59,660
"Yesterday I went to church for the
first time since I come to this country.

689
00:53:59,745 --> 00:54:01,037
"I got all the way to Brooklyn.

690
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,915
"The church was up the block and around
the corner upon the 3 train.

691
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:05,679
"The preacher preached
two and a half hours

692
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:08,252
- "about Jehovah.
- Rhonda! Rhonda!

693
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:11,756
"And how Lord Jesus, Son of God, Messiah,
Jehovah delivers."

694
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,841
Is that a fairytale?

695
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,719
Sit down.

696
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:18,096
Did anybody do this assignment?

697
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,681
Momma say this school ain't shit.

698
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:23,226
She say you can't learn nothing
writing in no book.

699
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:28,523
- This is a fairytale called "Enchanted."
- She wrong about that. I is learning.

700
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:34,737
"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

701
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:39,283
"there lived a beautiful princess
named Joann-a.

702
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:44,163
"She was very, very
fly and extra, extra tall,

703
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,251
"and every single boy loved her,
big and small.

704
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:53,131
"Except for one idiot boy
who was so stupid and dumb.

705
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:57,426
"And out of all the cute boys who
loved her, he was the cutest one."

706
00:54:58,554 --> 00:55:01,848
- That's all I got so far.
- That's a good beginning.

707
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:05,476
Thinking about little
Mongo, too. I miss her.

708
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:07,311
That's how you start a fairytale.

709
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:09,689
I'm happy my baby coming up.

710
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:14,652
I'm gonna read to this baby, too,
and hang colors on its wall.

711
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:18,489
Listen, baby. Mother not dumb.

712
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:20,867
Mother love you. Listen.

713
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:25,037
"Once upon a time,
there was a magical princess

714
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:28,291
"who lived in a magical bubble
under the sea.

715
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:30,918
"And she was from land."

716
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:47,810
Stop screaming.

717
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,627
His name's Abdul Jamal Lewis Jones.

718
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:16,464
He healthy. His mother love him.

719
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,815
The food in this hospital's nasty.

720
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:36,609
It's not from here.

721
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,277
Where it from?

722
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:40,905
A little shop by my house where

723
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:43,407
I get my organic food,
so I don't have to eat that

724
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:46,077
nasty mystery-meat stuff
they got downstairs.

725
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:49,163
Can you bring me something?
I don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.

726
00:56:49,248 --> 00:56:51,457
First of all, I don't eat McDonald's.

727
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,210
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.

728
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:55,336
It's not healthy.

729
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,630
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?

730
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,341
We like McDonald's, too, over here.

731
00:57:00,425 --> 00:57:01,926
I don't like no damn McDonald's.

732
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,096
I want some of that organic shit
like you got.

733
00:57:05,514 --> 00:57:06,973
Well, I tell you what,

734
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,617
when you get up out of here,
you go with all your little friends,

735
00:57:09,685 --> 00:57:10,685
and you go to McDonald's,

736
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,603
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.

737
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:15,147
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.

738
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,941
Are you a doctor?

739
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,986
- Are you her doctor?
- Am I a doctor?

740
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,738
- Yeah.
- I am a nurse's aide.

741
00:57:22,823 --> 00:57:24,615
Nurse John-John.

742
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,367
Oh, that's funny?

743
00:57:26,868 --> 00:57:28,619
Well, you're a man.

744
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:32,039
- You've never seen a male nurse?
- No.

745
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:34,292
Not looking like you do.

746
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:39,213
I am a male nurse.
I am Nurse John McFadden.

747
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:41,882
So was you up in the room
when she popped the baby out?

748
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:43,069
You was like, all up in between her...

749
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,136
Joann, don't be nasty!

750
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,804
How was it? Was he screaming?

751
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:47,972
It hurt.

752
00:57:48,056 --> 00:57:49,640
Tough gal like you had to scream?

753
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:53,978
Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
It hurt. And it burned.

754
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,313
- Are you married?
- Shut up!

755
00:57:55,397 --> 00:57:57,064
You got a girlfriend?

756
00:57:57,149 --> 00:57:59,567
- Why you asking? He don't want you.
- How would you know?

757
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:01,379
Why don't you stop being a ho
for 10 minutes?

758
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:02,630
What's wrong with these people?

759
00:58:02,654 --> 00:58:04,030
You don't want her, right?

760
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,907
I wish I was a cantaloupe in that cup.

761
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:08,492
So he could eat you?

762
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:12,204
Okay, no. I gotta go. I gotta go.

763
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,416
No, that's all right. That's all right.

764
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,629
Can I get a kiss, too, Nurse John?

765
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:23,466
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Bye, Nurse John.

766
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,427
- Bye!
- Good night, Nurse John-John!

767
00:58:27,846 --> 00:58:30,139
Precious and John-John.

768
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:32,183
Sitting in a tree.

769
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:36,062
- F-U-C-K-I-N-G.
- Shut up! Y'all are nasty.

770
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:42,443
You think he's spending the night
up in here?

771
00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:47,823
Now she gonna write
about Nurse John in her book!

772
00:58:49,117 --> 00:58:50,785
"Dear Ms. Rain,

773
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:54,455
"All the years I sit in
class, I never learned.

774
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:57,625
"Now I got a baby again by my father.

775
00:58:58,377 --> 00:59:01,003
"I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls.

776
00:59:01,088 --> 00:59:04,256
"Then I'll feel right
that I have to quit school.

777
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:07,843
"I love my baby, but I want school, too.

778
00:59:07,928 --> 00:59:10,304
"Social worker ask me
if I wanna give little Mongo

779
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:13,933
"and Abdul up for adoption.
I could kill her.

780
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:18,104
"She never helped before.
Now she wanna take my kids away?

781
00:59:18,814 --> 00:59:22,066
"If she takes Abdul,
I won't have nothing no more."

782
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,110
"Dear Precious,

783
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,488
"I think your first responsibility
has to be to yourself.

784
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,241
"If you keep Abdul, you might have nothing.

785
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:32,785
"You're learning to read and write.
That's everything.

786
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,538
"You come back to school
when you get out of the hospital.

787
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:36,747
"You're only 17."

788
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:39,250
This looks like a big-ass condom.

789
00:59:41,128 --> 00:59:43,212
Use that for Nurse John.

790
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,881
Not looking like that.
Your hair looks a mess.

791
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:48,676
- I'm giving you banjee.
- Shut up!

792
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,261
I got yourjournal.

793
00:59:50,345 --> 00:59:51,846
Thank you.

794
00:59:57,102 --> 00:59:58,644
What's wrong?

795
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,062
Nothing.

796
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:01,730
Are you sure?

797
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:02,857
Yeah, I'm sure.

798
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:07,361
All right. I'm bored.
I'm about to leave. Bye.

799
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,698
Bye, Ms. Toosie.

800
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:12,783
You got a nasty-ass mouth.

801
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:14,952
You got a nasty-ass hat.

802
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:20,166
That's what's wrong,
you hanging out with bitches like that.

803
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,834
Here's your baby.

804
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,295
It's probably the last time
you're gonna ever see him.

805
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:25,796
Grandmother come and visit and say,

806
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:28,466
"Only a dog would drop a baby
and walk off."

807
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,842
Not even a dog.

808
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:32,553
Say later, "Not even a dog."

809
01:00:32,637 --> 01:00:35,723
I'm proud of you.
Ain't nothing like your mother.

810
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:39,143
"Where was your grandmother
when your father was abusing you?

811
01:00:39,227 --> 01:00:41,312
"Where is little Mongo now?

812
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:44,815
"What is going to be the best thing for you
in this situation?"

813
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,193
"Ms. Rain, you ask too many questions.

814
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,820
"Sometimes I wish I could stop breathing.

815
01:00:49,905 --> 01:00:52,281
"I just wanna be a good mother."

816
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:55,493
"Being a good mother might mean
letting Abdul be raised

817
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:59,246
"by someone who's better able than you
to meet his needs."

818
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,459
"Ms. Rain, I is the best
to meet my child's needs."

819
01:01:12,844 --> 01:01:14,678
"Who's gonna help you?

820
01:01:15,222 --> 01:01:17,515
"How will you support yourself?

821
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:21,769
"How will you keep learning
to read and write?"

822
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,897
"The welfare helped Momma."

823
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:29,276
"You look and see
how much welfare has helped your mom.

824
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:33,197
"You could get your GED,

825
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:35,950
"and go to college.
You can do anything, Precious."

826
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,491
You back?

827
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,452
What's his name?

828
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:03,537
Can I hold it?

829
01:04:07,352 --> 01:04:08,936
Hey, Precious.

830
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,941
Hey.

831
01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:19,113
You had the baby?

832
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:20,989
A boy.

833
01:04:22,242 --> 01:04:24,493
Where you been all this time?

834
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:32,793
Let me see him.

835
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,760
Can I hold him?

836
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,282
He look like his daddy.

837
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,330
He named Abdul.

838
01:05:11,624 --> 01:05:15,210
Put all this shit down
and go get me something to drink.

839
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:35,147
You bitch!

840
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,941
- You fucking bitch!
- You crazy, Momma?

841
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:40,527
Am I crazy? Bitch, if I was to...

842
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:43,238
You ruined my fucking life!

843
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:45,991
You done took my man,
you had those fucking babies,

844
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,386
and you got me put off the welfare

845
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,703
for running your goddamned
stupid-ass mouth!

846
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:53,665
I ain't stupid and I didn't take your man.
Your husband raped me!

847
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,250
Didn't no-fucking-body rape you!

848
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,669
Bitch, don't you put
your fucking hands on me!

849
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,567
Mary, leave that girl alone!

850
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,108
Can I see the baby now?

851
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:15,826
B... C... D...

852
01:09:16,744 --> 01:09:21,164
E... F... G... H...

853
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,543
I... J... K...

854
01:09:31,592 --> 01:09:33,176
I'm tired of shopping.

855
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:35,220
Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.

856
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,180
They don't...

857
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,735
I'm calling the cops.

858
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:57,451
Tell me what you see back there.

859
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:14,342
I could tell by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeless no more.

860
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:16,470
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.

861
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:18,138
I'll hold.

862
01:10:20,058 --> 01:10:21,808
I feel bad for her.

863
01:10:21,893 --> 01:10:25,645
She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.

864
01:10:27,273 --> 01:10:28,523
What's going on?

865
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:29,775
But she all I could think of.

866
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,319
Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing.

867
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:34,571
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?

868
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:36,335
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.

869
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:38,594
Ms. Rain, I can't stay. I'm serious.
I've tried to talk...

870
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:41,263
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and I'm not dealing with this right now.

871
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:43,622
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.

872
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:46,166
Quick. And bring back my change.

873
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,961
Sixteen years old. A three-day-old infant.

874
01:10:50,588 --> 01:10:52,748
The baby not bleeding.
I think this is Precious' blood.

875
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:55,675
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

876
01:10:57,011 --> 01:10:59,471
We'll find you a place to live.

877
01:11:02,683 --> 01:11:04,392
Joann, you're late.

878
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:06,686
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

879
01:11:06,813 --> 01:11:09,147
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,

880
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:11,358
so I am the teacher today.

881
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:13,318
Okay. Why?

882
01:11:13,778 --> 01:11:15,589
- Where's Precious?
- Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

883
01:11:15,613 --> 01:11:18,031
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?

884
01:11:18,116 --> 01:11:19,533
What's the baby doing here?

885
01:11:19,617 --> 01:11:21,326
- Joann's gonna rap for you.
- Let me see.

886
01:11:21,536 --> 01:11:23,829
She all right. She's doing good.

887
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:27,499
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?

888
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,335
- Joann, what's so funny?
- For real. What happened?

889
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,897
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.

890
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,065
You know what your problem is, Joann?

891
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,881
That you can't take anything
serious enough.

892
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:37,384
- Jermaine, me expect better from you.
- Okay, Rhonda.

893
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:40,011
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

894
01:11:41,681 --> 01:11:42,973
Queens.

895
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:47,060
Let me call you back.

896
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:48,436
Just tell me what happened!

897
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:49,855
No, it's not funny.

898
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:52,774
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.

899
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,711
I got a West Indian friend
who's a Council member.

900
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:56,862
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.

901
01:11:56,946 --> 01:12:00,240
I found a lesson plan in our notebooks.
We're gonna...

902
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,493
Clareece Jones.

903
01:12:03,578 --> 01:12:05,871
Hey, Ms. Lisa. How you been?

904
01:12:06,706 --> 01:12:07,914
I don't know.

905
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:11,918
I went to see that movie,
Barfly, last night. Piece of shit.

906
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,047
- I'm sorry.
- It's on my desk. Can you hold?

907
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:18,425
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

908
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:20,051
This baby stink.

909
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,456
Well, we don't have a Pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.

910
01:12:22,513 --> 01:12:25,182
- I am sitting.
- In your seat, please.

911
01:12:25,266 --> 01:12:27,350
The first thing

912
01:12:27,435 --> 01:12:33,106
is shut the bumba-ros-clot...

913
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,484
Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?

914
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:38,209
She don't even know how to speak English.

915
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:39,321
Let Rhonda take over.

916
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:43,033
- Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
- What the fuck is a "ros clot"?

917
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:45,035
Yeah, Brenda, you there?

918
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:47,704
The last four of the Social are...

919
01:12:47,788 --> 01:12:50,373
2-4-2-1.

920
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:52,584
- Rita?
- I just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius."

921
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,545
- Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"?
- It's A-Q-U-A-R-I-U-S.

922
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,838
Can you spell "boy" then?

923
01:12:56,923 --> 01:12:58,173
Can you spell "slut" then?

924
01:12:58,257 --> 01:12:59,883
Let's explore that.

925
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:03,303
You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo,
I'll give you the first letter.

926
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:05,513
Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then?

927
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:07,641
Great, thank you.

928
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:11,728
Can you please use "slut" in a sentence?

929
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:13,188
Consuelo is a slut...

930
01:13:13,272 --> 01:13:16,066
- You the one who's the ho up in here...
- Joann is not a slut.

931
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,526
Perfect. You get a gold star.

932
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,072
But you know she likes that.

933
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:24,449
Well, she's just insecure.

934
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,159
- You think?
- Yeah.

935
01:13:26,661 --> 01:13:30,247
- That chicken was good.
- Really good. Did you have enough?

936
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:32,249
There ain't more, is there?

937
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,000
- Is there more?
- Yeah.

938
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:36,628
Maybe later. Not now.

939
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,672
I don't want you to think I'm greedy.

940
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:41,151
You're not greedy.
If you're hungry, let's get you some more.

941
01:13:41,175 --> 01:13:44,344
I guess I kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.

942
01:13:44,428 --> 01:13:45,679
No, you don't.

943
01:13:45,763 --> 01:13:47,639
- Blu, is that you?
- Not always.

944
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,808
What are you doing here?

945
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,936
I live here. Why didn't you tell me?

946
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,814
- Hey, sweetie.
- Is this... Is this...

947
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,609
This is Katherine, Precious.

948
01:13:59,694 --> 01:14:01,736
- Are you okay?
- It's so nice to meet you, finally.

949
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:05,240
Oh, my God. These straight-up lesbians.

950
01:14:05,324 --> 01:14:08,910
- This is Abdul.
- He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

951
01:14:09,954 --> 01:14:11,288
Precious, can I hold him?

952
01:14:11,372 --> 01:14:13,123
You know how to?

953
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:15,208
They still nice enough
to let us stay in their home

954
01:14:15,293 --> 01:14:17,627
until I get situated, though.

955
01:14:17,712 --> 01:14:21,798
- He's heavy. Oh, my God!
- You wanna hold him?

956
01:14:21,882 --> 01:14:24,384
I guess this is how the peoples
on TV feel at Christmastime.

957
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:27,053
- Don't drop him.
- Come on. I only work with children.

958
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:28,240
You know how you are. I saw you...

959
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:30,367
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.

960
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:31,975
They're so nice to me and Abdul.

961
01:14:32,059 --> 01:14:34,144
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
- Please.

962
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:35,937
Oh, Abdul.

963
01:14:37,898 --> 01:14:40,066
Merry Christmas, Precious.

964
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:42,027
Thank you.

965
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,445
Why peoples that barely know me

966
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:46,865
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?

967
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:48,908
I felt warm.

968
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:50,452
- What?
- I'm just...

969
01:14:50,536 --> 01:14:53,705
I'm just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.

970
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:54,956
They're fine.

971
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,042
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

972
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,544
I know that's why
she ain't letting me stay with her.

973
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,546
If Ronald McDonald were running things...

974
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,424
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

975
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:07,552
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.

976
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:10,263
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

977
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:11,598
Just write the book.

978
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:14,934
- Well, who's gonna read it?
- Nobody, if you don't write it.

979
01:15:15,019 --> 01:15:18,563
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.

980
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,900
Is that right?
What do you write about, Precious?

981
01:15:22,693 --> 01:15:23,943
Stuff.

982
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:27,447
My life. Abdul.

983
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:32,035
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

984
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:33,953
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

985
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,122
so that her point could be
more easily understood.

986
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:37,207
Yes.

987
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,793
They talk like TV channels I don't watch.

988
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:41,252
My Uncle Clayton.

989
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:44,798
I'm glad Abdul here to listen in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.

990
01:15:44,882 --> 01:15:46,299
Before he got saved,

991
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:49,052
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.

992
01:15:49,136 --> 01:15:51,179
I don't understand a word they're saying.

993
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:52,847
You understand?

994
01:15:56,435 --> 01:15:57,894
Y'all be watching Oprah?

995
01:15:57,978 --> 01:16:00,897
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time I get home from work.

996
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:04,109
- I watch it.
- Momma say homos is bad peoples.

997
01:16:04,819 --> 01:16:07,237
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.

998
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,614
And what do that make you?

999
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:13,827
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
all them years and never learn nothing.

1000
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:16,788
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peoples in Harlem.

1001
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,934
- ...that I have ever seen. Tell her!
- That doesn't work.

1002
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:21,543
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

1003
01:16:21,627 --> 01:16:24,003
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chalk in my hand,

1004
01:16:24,088 --> 01:16:26,548
made me queen of the ABC's.

1005
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,428
After I settled at the halfway house,

1006
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:33,930
I worked my hardest
to memorize letter sounds,

1007
01:16:34,014 --> 01:16:37,016
writing in the journal,
and reading smaller and fatter books.

1008
01:16:37,143 --> 01:16:40,353
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a literacy award

1009
01:16:40,438 --> 01:16:42,188
and a check for progress.

1010
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:46,359
One, two, three.

1011
01:16:46,444 --> 01:16:48,194
The party is on.

1012
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:49,863
Go, Joann!

1013
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,243
Let me see what you got!

1014
01:16:55,327 --> 01:17:00,415
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.

1015
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:03,209
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

1016
01:17:03,544 --> 01:17:04,836
Precious.

1017
01:17:08,048 --> 01:17:09,466
What's up?

1018
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:11,468
What's that?

1019
01:17:12,052 --> 01:17:13,720
What does it look like?

1020
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:15,722
Plastic stupid apple.

1021
01:17:18,893 --> 01:17:20,560
A little something for you.

1022
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:23,354
- Is there more money in it?
- You're so greedy.

1023
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,191
Yo, who's that?

1024
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,361
What?

1025
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,241
- What?
- Come on.

1026
01:17:35,743 --> 01:17:38,203
Precious, where are you taking me?

1027
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:43,333
What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.

1028
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:44,959
Yeah...

1029
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,257
My mom called last night.

1030
01:17:53,928 --> 01:17:57,222
And we don't really have a relationship.

1031
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:00,517
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with...

1032
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:04,354
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peoples.

1033
01:18:04,438 --> 01:18:07,524
I think maybe some of them was in tunnels,

1034
01:18:07,608 --> 01:18:10,318
and in that tunnel,
maybe the only light they had

1035
01:18:10,402 --> 01:18:11,945
was inside of them.

1036
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:15,281
Then I thought about how strong
you've had to be.

1037
01:18:17,868 --> 01:18:21,621
And then,
even long after they escaped that tunnel...

1038
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:25,792
- I'll help you clean up.
- Okay.

1039
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,462
...they still be shining
for everybody else.

1040
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,718
That's Ms. Rain to me.

1041
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:40,223
"Award for Outstanding Achievement."

1042
01:18:40,307 --> 01:18:43,935
In a book I read,
this lady escaped to a halfway house.

1043
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,228
And when she was there,

1044
01:18:45,312 --> 01:18:48,231
she asked the people there
what a halfway house was.

1045
01:18:48,315 --> 01:18:52,652
They told her it was halfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.

1046
01:18:52,736 --> 01:18:54,654
That's kind of nice.

1047
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:59,409
That also mean I can't stay here forever.

1048
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:01,661
There's still a way to go.

1049
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:05,331
It'd be something to get my own apartment.

1050
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:09,669
Abdul nine months and almost walking.
He's smart, too.

1051
01:19:10,337 --> 01:19:13,423
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.

1052
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,551
He's barely talking,
but he's already counting.

1053
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:19,345
Momma, Daddy,

1054
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:24,517
IS 111, 444 Lenox all seem
like some old, bad dream.

1055
01:19:26,687 --> 01:19:30,690
I wish I could've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.

1056
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:36,279
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.

1057
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:39,449
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

1058
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:41,743
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.

1059
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:43,578
- Who is it?
- I didn't ask who it was.

1060
01:19:43,662 --> 01:19:44,871
You want me to watch the baby?

1061
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:47,832
No, I gotta go down and get him anyway.

1062
01:20:22,242 --> 01:20:23,910
Your daddy dead.

1063
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:27,288
That's all?

1064
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:34,253
He had that AIDS virus.

1065
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,020
There you go, dreaming again!

1066
01:20:51,105 --> 01:20:53,773
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?

1067
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:56,317
Did you hear what I said?

1068
01:21:01,281 --> 01:21:02,699
You got it?

1069
01:21:03,951 --> 01:21:05,576
Got what?

1070
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:07,620
- The AIDS virus.
- No.

1071
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:10,289
How do you know?

1072
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:13,251
We never did it up in the ass, so I know.

1073
01:21:17,631 --> 01:21:20,091
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

1074
01:21:22,803 --> 01:21:24,512
You coming home?

1075
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:42,989
Yo, Precious!

1076
01:22:01,633 --> 01:22:04,635
Rita, what do I mean when I say the author

1077
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:09,390
describes her protagonist's circumstances
as "unrelenting"?

1078
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,727
I don't know. I don't know.

1079
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:18,691
It's like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,

1080
01:22:18,776 --> 01:22:21,235
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her

1081
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,946
and she no stop, she keep on going.

1082
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,365
Relentless-un.

1083
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:21,546
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

1084
01:24:10,637 --> 01:24:12,138
Come with me.

1085
01:24:13,557 --> 01:24:14,974
Precious?

1086
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,269
Excuse me?

1087
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:22,315
Nurse say I'm HIV positive.

1088
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:31,490
I ain't got nothing to write today.

1089
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:34,994
Is your baby okay?

1090
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,415
He all right.
I just got to stop breastfeeding him.

1091
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:45,296
Remember, you once told me

1092
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:48,674
you never really got to tell your story.

1093
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:52,178
- Write.
- Fuck you!

1094
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:55,681
You know nothing
of what I've been through.

1095
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,185
I ain't never had no boyfriend.

1096
01:25:01,855 --> 01:25:04,440
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

1097
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:08,402
How he gonna do that?
It would fucking be illegal!

1098
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:25,878
Write.

1099
01:25:28,006 --> 01:25:30,549
I'm tired, Ms. Rain.

1100
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:34,595
If not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.

1101
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,472
Nobody loves me.

1102
01:25:36,556 --> 01:25:38,808
People do love you, Precious.

1103
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,727
Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

1104
01:25:42,562 --> 01:25:44,939
Love ain't done nothing for me.

1105
01:25:45,983 --> 01:25:49,402
Love beat me, raped me,

1106
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:54,824
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.

1107
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:57,076
Make me sick.

1108
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:01,497
That wasn't love, Precious.

1109
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:05,418
Your baby loves you.

1110
01:26:08,714 --> 01:26:10,172
I love you.

1111
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:18,723
Write.

1112
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,608
What are you thinking?

1113
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:35,990
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.

1114
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:40,411
I didn't, did I?

1115
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:43,706
Really, I'm here to help you.

1116
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,959
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.

1117
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:49,670
You're right.

1118
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:52,298
We could talk about your daddy instead.

1119
01:26:52,382 --> 01:26:55,217
We could talk about my mother, my father,

1120
01:26:55,302 --> 01:26:59,680
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.

1121
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,849
You don't even like me.

1122
01:27:01,933 --> 01:27:04,977
Have we not been in this room together

1123
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:08,314
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

1124
01:27:08,398 --> 01:27:11,400
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?

1125
01:27:11,485 --> 01:27:12,943
I can't speak for you.

1126
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:17,490
I can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.

1127
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:19,992
So, are you Italian, or...

1128
01:27:20,077 --> 01:27:21,368
What color are you, anyway?

1129
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:23,537
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

1130
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:25,831
What color do you think I am?

1131
01:27:27,793 --> 01:27:31,128
No, I'd like to know.
What color do you think I am?

1132
01:27:31,963 --> 01:27:33,672
My throat is dry.

1133
01:27:34,508 --> 01:27:36,258
Your throat is dry?

1134
01:27:36,676 --> 01:27:38,385
It's really hot in here.

1135
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:40,554
It is kind of hot in here.

1136
01:27:41,098 --> 01:27:43,974
I'm gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?

1137
01:27:44,351 --> 01:27:46,185
Soda sounds fine.

1138
01:27:46,269 --> 01:27:47,686
All right.

1139
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:19,718
Thank you.

1140
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:21,762
No problem.

1141
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:28,686
So, I have to talk to
you about your mother,

1142
01:28:29,229 --> 01:28:31,564
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,

1143
01:28:31,648 --> 01:28:34,400
but she says she wants to see you

1144
01:28:34,484 --> 01:28:39,113
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.

1145
01:28:39,698 --> 01:28:42,658
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.

1146
01:28:42,742 --> 01:28:44,326
What did you tell her?

1147
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:47,246
I said I had to speak to you about it.

1148
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,292
It's up to you.

1149
01:28:51,376 --> 01:28:54,336
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

1150
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:58,382
Ms. Weiss said in that file I got HIV.

1151
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:00,885
She said I was supposed to die from it.

1152
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,012
I ain't worried about dying.

1153
01:29:03,096 --> 01:29:07,057
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

1154
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:10,561
I was just writing, like, about...

1155
01:29:11,271 --> 01:29:13,355
I wanna open up this clinic

1156
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,650
about, like, mothers and their children.

1157
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:20,529
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.

1158
01:29:20,614 --> 01:29:24,283
I always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.

1159
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:27,244
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if I did that,

1160
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,996
and my children, too.

1161
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,791
I want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?

1162
01:29:33,919 --> 01:29:38,464
- That's always what I wanted to do, so...
- That's good. That's really nice.

1163
01:29:42,052 --> 01:29:46,513
I don't really want to read the whole thing,
I kind of just wanna say what it's about.

1164
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:51,393
Okay, the counselors
at Advancement House,

1165
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:55,731
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?

1166
01:29:55,815 --> 01:29:57,566
But it's not really about them.

1167
01:29:57,651 --> 01:29:59,735
They're trying to get me to do workfare.

1168
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:02,196
- They want me to be a home attendant.
- How do you know?

1169
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,573
Because I stole my file and I read it.

1170
01:30:04,658 --> 01:30:06,575
All they want me to do is work.

1171
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:09,912
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.

1172
01:30:09,996 --> 01:30:11,413
What kind of sense that make,

1173
01:30:11,498 --> 01:30:14,416
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED

1174
01:30:14,501 --> 01:30:17,127
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?

1175
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:20,297
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

1176
01:30:20,382 --> 01:30:21,882
Rhonda used to home attend.

1177
01:30:21,967 --> 01:30:24,969
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.

1178
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:28,389
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.

1179
01:30:28,473 --> 01:30:30,516
She'd be on call, right?

1180
01:30:30,934 --> 01:30:35,145
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.

1181
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,856
That equal out to $50.96.

1182
01:30:38,858 --> 01:30:40,298
But that's not a whole lot of money,

1183
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,487
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.

1184
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:48,284
So, $50.96 divided by 24

1185
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:52,288
is $2.12 an hour.
That's not a lot of money.

1186
01:30:52,372 --> 01:30:56,750
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell

1187
01:30:56,835 --> 01:30:58,729
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.

1188
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,463
- You don't want to do that shit.
- Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

1189
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:04,591
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.

1190
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:08,554
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday.
Plus, I'd have to leave class.

1191
01:31:08,888 --> 01:31:12,182
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.

1192
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:15,394
Plus, I'm gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.

1193
01:31:15,478 --> 01:31:16,979
It's "incest."

1194
01:31:18,732 --> 01:31:21,900
- That ain't what I said?
- No, you said "insect."

1195
01:31:22,485 --> 01:31:23,777
What's the difference?

1196
01:31:23,862 --> 01:31:25,654
Well, one's where your family molests you,

1197
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:28,407
the other's like a roach or bugs.

1198
01:31:31,077 --> 01:31:33,704
- So, you a scientist now?
- I'm just saying.

1199
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,582
No, that's cool. Thank you. Thank you.

1200
01:31:42,756 --> 01:31:46,342
It was hard telling them strangers there
what my father did.

1201
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,427
Sometimes it felt good.

1202
01:31:53,683 --> 01:31:57,895
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.

1203
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:01,857
I wrote that I be real skinny,

1204
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:04,818
with light skin and long hair.

1205
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:07,946
Loretha Holloway?

1206
01:32:09,157 --> 01:32:10,282
Go on back there.

1207
01:32:10,367 --> 01:32:12,201
She read it and said
I'm beautiful like I am.

1208
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:15,788
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.

1209
01:32:17,957 --> 01:32:19,917
Just shut up and sit there, then.

1210
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:23,379
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.

1211
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:24,922
But somehow,

1212
01:32:26,049 --> 01:32:29,301
right now... And I don't know why, but...

1213
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:33,180
I think she right.

1214
01:32:39,562 --> 01:32:40,646
Here.

1215
01:32:49,322 --> 01:32:50,948
Clareece Jones?

1216
01:32:56,913 --> 01:32:58,914
I think she right.

1217
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:06,255
Okay, Mrs. Johnston,
let's talk about the abuse.

1218
01:33:06,339 --> 01:33:08,549
There were no drugs in my house.

1219
01:33:08,633 --> 01:33:10,653
I didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.

1220
01:33:10,677 --> 01:33:12,344
Precious knew I would whup her ass

1221
01:33:12,429 --> 01:33:13,989
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.

1222
01:33:14,013 --> 01:33:16,390
You know what I'm talking about.

1223
01:33:17,517 --> 01:33:22,688
I'm referring to specific
sexual and physical acts

1224
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:25,023
involving Precious.

1225
01:33:25,692 --> 01:33:27,693
Why you ain't say that?

1226
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:30,028
Yes, that.

1227
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:33,991
What do you wanna know?

1228
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:36,076
According to Precious' files,

1229
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:40,205
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,

1230
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:44,543
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.

1231
01:33:50,842 --> 01:33:52,843
- Yeah.
- This is accurate?

1232
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:57,055
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

1233
01:33:57,557 --> 01:34:00,642
I need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office

1234
01:34:00,727 --> 01:34:04,646
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.

1235
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:08,233
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

1236
01:34:08,318 --> 01:34:10,444
Ms. Weiss,
I understand we need to discuss it,

1237
01:34:10,528 --> 01:34:11,862
but I'm just telling you.

1238
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:14,698
You said I've been calling here
and I've been wanting to see.

1239
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:16,241
Precious and my grandson.

1240
01:34:16,326 --> 01:34:20,829
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

1241
01:34:20,914 --> 01:34:23,957
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

1242
01:34:24,042 --> 01:34:25,834
and I done told her that.

1243
01:34:25,919 --> 01:34:29,546
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

1244
01:34:29,631 --> 01:34:32,341
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1245
01:34:32,425 --> 01:34:37,137
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

1246
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:42,601
The summertime.
She was born in the summertime.

1247
01:34:42,685 --> 01:34:44,686
Remember? Remember that?

1248
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,939
I was born in November.

1249
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,982
November.

1250
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:52,319
Yeah, that's right.

1251
01:34:53,613 --> 01:34:55,489
My Scorpio child.

1252
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:59,117
You know...

1253
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:03,872
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1254
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:09,628
And, I'm not saying that they lie.
I'm not saying that.

1255
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,506
But you just gotta watch them.

1256
01:35:16,469 --> 01:35:20,264
Can we talk about the actual acts

1257
01:35:20,348 --> 01:35:23,058
of physical and sexual abuse

1258
01:35:23,142 --> 01:35:25,602
that occurred in your household?

1259
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:27,729
When it first began,

1260
01:35:27,814 --> 01:35:30,816
where it happened
and how did you respond?

1261
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:39,366
Precious was a little girl.

1262
01:35:40,827 --> 01:35:43,829
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

1263
01:35:48,126 --> 01:35:49,668
She was three.

1264
01:35:51,629 --> 01:35:55,090
And I had been giving her the bottle

1265
01:35:57,010 --> 01:35:59,469
and I was giving Carl the tittie

1266
01:35:59,846 --> 01:36:03,890
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

1267
01:36:05,018 --> 01:36:08,353
but not from her, but because Carl was...

1268
01:36:09,522 --> 01:36:11,440
Because Carl was sucking on them

1269
01:36:11,524 --> 01:36:15,360
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1270
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:20,866
And I thought that that was for hygiene.

1271
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:24,536
I did what my mother told me

1272
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:28,999
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what I did.

1273
01:36:29,459 --> 01:36:32,127
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me...

1274
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:35,047
I'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

1275
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:37,549
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

1276
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:40,052
But, Ms. Weiss,
I don't like you looking at me like that.

1277
01:36:40,219 --> 01:36:43,680
You got this bitch looking at me
like I'm some kind of fucking monster.

1278
01:36:43,765 --> 01:36:45,682
We don't talk like this in my office, okay?

1279
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:49,311
I didn't want her sucking behind him,
because that was nasty.

1280
01:36:49,395 --> 01:36:53,106
And things that he was...
It was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1281
01:36:58,738 --> 01:37:02,366
I had a man, and I have a child

1282
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,996
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

1283
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:14,670
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

1284
01:37:16,756 --> 01:37:19,091
Because I would lay my baby.

1285
01:37:19,175 --> 01:37:23,804
I would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

1286
01:37:25,556 --> 01:37:27,724
and it was pink

1287
01:37:28,434 --> 01:37:31,478
and it had this little white writing on it

1288
01:37:31,562 --> 01:37:35,691
and it had her name,
because she was precious.

1289
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:38,944
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

1290
01:37:39,028 --> 01:37:42,406
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1291
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:47,703
and then we would...
We would start doing it

1292
01:37:47,787 --> 01:37:49,913
and he reached over

1293
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:54,209
and he touched my baby.

1294
01:37:54,293 --> 01:37:55,836
And I asked him,

1295
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:59,214
I said, "Carl, what are you doing?"

1296
01:37:59,298 --> 01:38:01,717
And he told me to shut...

1297
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:04,803
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

1298
01:38:04,887 --> 01:38:08,140
- And what did you do then?
- I shut my fat ass up.

1299
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:11,977
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1300
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:13,872
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

1301
01:38:13,896 --> 01:38:15,856
I did not want him to abuse my daughter.

1302
01:38:15,982 --> 01:38:17,501
- I did not want him to hurt her.
- But you allowed him

1303
01:38:17,525 --> 01:38:19,461
- to hurt her.
- I did not want him to do nothing to her.

1304
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:21,403
I wanted him to make love to me.

1305
01:38:21,487 --> 01:38:24,489
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

1306
01:38:24,657 --> 01:38:27,492
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

1307
01:38:28,786 --> 01:38:31,079
And that's why I hated her.

1308
01:38:31,164 --> 01:38:34,166
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

1309
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:37,085
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

1310
01:38:38,171 --> 01:38:40,422
was fucking my baby.

1311
01:38:40,506 --> 01:38:44,134
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

1312
01:38:44,677 --> 01:38:45,837
So, whose fault was it, then?

1313
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:49,055
It's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

1314
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,724
and she didn't say nothing.

1315
01:38:50,808 --> 01:38:52,809
She didn't scream. She didn't do nothing.

1316
01:38:52,894 --> 01:38:56,438
So, those things she told you I did to her,

1317
01:38:56,522 --> 01:38:59,691
who else was gonna love me?

1318
01:39:02,695 --> 01:39:06,323
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

1319
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:10,452
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

1320
01:39:10,536 --> 01:39:14,206
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

1321
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:16,833
And she made him go away, so...

1322
01:39:17,585 --> 01:39:21,087
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad

1323
01:39:21,172 --> 01:39:25,217
about who you think I am,
and why I did it, all of that.

1324
01:39:26,552 --> 01:39:28,762
Because I didn't have nobody.

1325
01:39:37,563 --> 01:39:40,732
The people from.

1326
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,402
Each One Teach One,

1327
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:48,073
they had... They called me

1328
01:39:51,035 --> 01:39:54,120
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.

1329
01:39:54,205 --> 01:39:55,705
In fact, you know what, I got...

1330
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:57,374
Wait a minute.

1331
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:24,818
I'm sorry.

1332
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:29,197
I'm sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

1333
01:40:29,282 --> 01:40:33,493
I don't need no more money. Please.
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:40:34,412 --> 01:40:36,580
I took that TABE test again.

1335
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:38,915
And what happened?

1336
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,667
I scored a 7.8.

1337
01:40:42,378 --> 01:40:44,296
Last time it was 2.8.

1338
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:48,049
According to that test,

1339
01:40:48,134 --> 01:40:50,844
I'm reading at
a seventh- and eighth-grade level.

1340
01:40:52,138 --> 01:40:55,307
Next year, high school.
After that, college.

1341
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:03,648
Well, I like you, too.

1342
01:41:05,985 --> 01:41:08,028
But you can't handle me.

1343
01:41:09,822 --> 01:41:12,157
You can't handle none of this.

1344
01:41:20,082 --> 01:41:23,501
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.

1345
01:41:23,586 --> 01:41:26,338
Not even after all them things you did.

1346
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,343
Maybe I was too stupid, or
maybe I just didn't want to.

1347
01:41:33,804 --> 01:41:36,139
You ain't gonna see me no more.

1348
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:41,019
Bye!

1349
01:41:44,732 --> 01:41:46,608
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1350
01:41:46,692 --> 01:41:49,110
Please, God,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1351
01:41:49,195 --> 01:41:52,072
Ms. Weiss,
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1352
01:41:52,156 --> 01:41:53,949
I would say to him, I would say...

1353
01:41:54,033 --> 01:41:57,285
"Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?"

1354
01:42:06,379 --> 01:42:07,963
Can you go get her back?

1355
01:42:08,047 --> 01:42:10,632
You can do that,
because that's what you do.

1356
01:42:10,716 --> 01:42:12,550
That's what you do.

1357
01:42:12,969 --> 01:42:16,680
I need you to go
and I need you to get my baby back.

1358
01:42:16,764 --> 01:42:20,392
You told me that I could come in here
