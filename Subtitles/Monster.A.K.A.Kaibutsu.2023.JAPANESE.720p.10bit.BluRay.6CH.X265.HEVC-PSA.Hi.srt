1
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,030
<i>Firetruck behind you.
Please clear the road.</i>

2
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,050
MONSTER

3
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,730
Minato?

4
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,570
A fire, a fire.

5
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,380
Minato?

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,290
Come look.

7
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,090
It's a fire.

8
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,850
Don't fall.

9
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,350
If a human gets a pig's brain
transplanted, is it a human or a pig?

10
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,020
What are you talking about?

11
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,240
There's research.

12
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,030
Who told you that?

13
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,200
My teacher, Mr. Hori.

14
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,340
They teach weird stuff these days
That's not a human being, listen...

15
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,340
It started.

16
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,310
Go for it!

17
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,590
Not so loud.

18
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,310
Go for it!

19
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,290
Wait.

20
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,950
Wait, wait.

21
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,620
Your water bottle!

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,260
The bottom kids support gymnastic
formations, so hang in there.

23
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,260
Off you go.

24
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,970
Over the white line,
you go to hell.

25
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,090
That was when I was a kid.

26
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,390
You still are.

27
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,280
Excuse me.

28
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,570
Yes, welcome.

29
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,490
Welcome I'll take care of it.

30
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,090
I just passed it, and it
was completely burned.

31
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,640
Well, you know,

32
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,350
I could hear the fire
trucks until after 1am.

33
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,520
There was a hostess bar on
the third floor Did you know?

34
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,860
I saw a girl in short skirt
handing out tissues to promote it.

35
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,900
And according to what I heard,

36
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,060
Mr. Hori was there.

37
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,530
A teacher in a hostess bar...

38
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,080
Is he lonely?

39
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Word gets around fast
about something like that.

40
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm tired.

41
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,670
Minato?

42
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,580
In the bathroom?

43
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,840
Sorry, I'll make
dinner right away.

44
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,880
What? Oh, no, what the...

45
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,940
What are you doing?

46
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,100
- What, what?
- I'm naked.

47
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,900
What, what are you up to?

48
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,740
Against school rules.

49
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,330
About your curly hair?

50
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,570
Was it Kamata? Did he
say something again?

51
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,870
What the hell is this?

52
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,620
- Hello.
- Manager, customer.

53
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm home.

54
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,940
<i>Here goes,</i>

55
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,740
<i>Happy birthday to you,</i>

56
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,580
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

57
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,030
<i>Happy birthday, dear Father.</i>

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,370
<i>Happy birthday, to you.</i>

59
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,120
Enough.

60
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,790
Blow them out.

61
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,980
The cake got smaller again Dad
would have eaten it in two bites.

62
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,350
He won't eat it,
he's already dead.

63
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,190
He can hear you.

64
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,110
Give him an update.

65
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,400
About school and
about your friends.

66
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,110
Out loud.

67
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,610
Did they throw dirt
over him in his grave?

68
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,500
He was cremated first,
so there was no dirt.

69
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,080
Is he already reborn?

70
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,920
Then I wish he'd come see us.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,750
What if he's reborn
as a stink bug?

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,300
He's reborn into
something more noble.

73
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,540
Like a giraffe?

74
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,640
I'd have to look up at him.

75
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,350
Meet him on the veranda.

76
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,260
I prefer a horse.

77
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,320
He liked horses,

78
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,070
and he could give us rides.

79
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,700
Give him an update.

80
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,700
If I talk to him,
you can hear me, too.

81
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,580
Got it.

82
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,970
What is it?

83
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,300
Go see the doctor?

84
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,880
Will you be OK?

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,480
Time to get up and get ready.

86
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
OK?

87
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,330
An experiment.

88
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,830
For Science.

89
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,190
Wait for me, I'm hungry!

90
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,120
What time did Gaku last see him?

91
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,630
He was riding his bike? Where?

92
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,370
What?

93
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,910
Minato?

94
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,350
I'M HERE.

95
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,200
Who's the monster?

96
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,050
Who's the monster?

97
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,080
Minato?

98
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,840
- Who's the...
- Minato!

99
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,140
Minato!

100
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,540
Sorry.

101
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,240
Your ear hurt?

102
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,710
I...

103
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,090
be like Dad.

104
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,620
Your father was much worse.

105
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,970
He was a rugby player.

106
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,460
He'd come home with a complex
fracture like it was no big deal.

107
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,010
But I've promised your father.

108
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,470
That I'll hang in there until you're
married and have your own family.

109
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,410
Just an ordinary family
you see anywhere is fine.

110
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,450
Until you have your own family,
the greatest treasure...

111
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,700
Minato?

112
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,550
Minato!

113
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,280
Mugino Minato.

114
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,430
Come to the exam room.

115
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,780
Let's go.

116
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,580
Come in.

117
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,860
Please, come in.

118
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,200
You'll be fine.

119
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,290
Let's just have
them take a look.

120
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,010
Please wait outside
for your son.

121
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
Can't we get the car back?

122
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,690
If we can't, I'll go crazy
at the police station.

123
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
Don't worry.

124
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Mom, did you

125
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,150
see the X-rays?

126
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,240
The CT scan? Sure.

127
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,330
Everything looked normal.

128
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,500
Oops, I'm in hell.

129
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,580
You're really fine.

130
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,680
Nothing's wrong with you.

131
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,550
What is it?

132
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,050
What's up?

133
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,440
Did something happen at school?

134
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,200
That you're a slow eater?

135
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,780
Why did you cut your hair?

136
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,790
Why did you lose your sneaker?

137
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,950
What happened here?

138
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,140
It's a pig's brain My brain
was switched with a pig's.

139
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,100
That's what's strange about me,

140
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,590
I'm a monster...

141
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,850
Who told you that?

142
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,060
Was it Kamata? It
was Kamata, right?

143
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,740
Who told you that!

144
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,150
Minato, who told you that!

145
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,330
Who said that?

146
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,420
Mr. Hori.

147
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,010
- Bye.
- Bye.

148
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,340
Principal...

149
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,020
I had been using this at home.

150
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,680
Bye.

151
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

152
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,240
I'm fifth grader
Mugino Minato's mother.

153
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,070
His gym bag was
thrown down the hall,

154
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,000
or not allowed to eat lunch because
he wasn't prepared for class.

155
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,590
He's told me these things.

156
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,130
Yes.

157
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,750
His ear was pulled
so hard it bled.

158
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,920
He said, "Mr. Hori,
stop, it hurts,".

159
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,180
Mr. Hori told him, "Your
brain is a pig's brain,

160
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,270
you won't learn until
it really hurts".

161
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,740
Yes.

162
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,730
Sorry we're late.

163
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,700
Ms. Mugino, it's been awhile
I was his second grade...

164
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,210
Mr. Kanzaki, hello.

165
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,050
And now?

166
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,380
I teach first graders...

167
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,960
That must be tough.

168
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,510
A war zone.

169
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,880
Please sit down.

170
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,730
Please.

171
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,100
- Please share your concerns.
- I just explained to the principal...

172
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,650
The principal has
pressing business.

173
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,120
But it's about a student
What other business...

174
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,190
The principal recently

175
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,230
lost her grandchild
in an accident.

176
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,580
It's an appointment about
that, but if you insist...

177
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,780
No.

178
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm sorry, I didn't know...

179
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,120
<i>Ouch!</i>

180
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,670
<i>Ouch! What, what?</i>

181
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,300
<i>And here's how we tricked her.</i>

182
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,520
Maybe it's faked Would you
get tricked that easily?

183
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,230
You know it's a lie
because it's on TV.

184
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,100
<i>My skin's super supple!</i>

185
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,100
Super supple!

186
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,350
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

187
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,750
We've kept you waiting.

188
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,730
Regarding

189
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,760
the concerns that
you shared with us,

190
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,770
Mr. Hori would like to
offer you an apology.

191
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,820
Stand up.

192
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,410
In this case, because
my instruction,

193
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,130
toward Mugino, to Mugino,

194
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,710
resulted in a misunderstanding

195
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,810
I feel most regretful.

196
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
I do formally apologize.

197
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,680
And, so?

198
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,100
- We are terribly sorry.
- That's not right.

199
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,850
This isn't right at all.

200
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,660
Please, please wait.

201
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,490
You see,

202
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,610
can't we all sit down?

203
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,240
Please sit down.

204
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,180
My son

205
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,420
was wounded by his
teacher's cruel remark.

206
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,600
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

207
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,010
We believe his instruction
was not accurately conveyed.

208
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,150
What instruction?

209
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,160
Which one?

210
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,740
We believe his instruction
required the utmost attention.

211
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,240
May I confirm, Mr. Hori?

212
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,280
Mr. Hori!

213
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,200
You were violent
towards my son, right?

214
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,920
It seems there was
a misunderstanding.

215
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,790
There was no misunderstanding...

216
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,170
My son was wounded because
this teacher hit him.

217
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,630
Do you understand?

218
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,390
We accept your opinion
with seriousness

219
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,190
and we will provide appropriate
instruction in the future.

220
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,320
So,

221
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,950
did you hit him? Or
didn't you hit him?

222
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,780
Please answer yes or no.

223
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,830
Now.

224
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,960
Now!

225
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,120
We have confirmed

226
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,410
that there was contact

227
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,590
between the teacher's hand
and Mugino Minato's nose.

228
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,380
That means you hit him.

229
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,560
There was contact between
the hand and the nose.

230
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,470
The hand?

231
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,280
And the nose
contacting like this?

232
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,610
Twisting his arm,

233
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,700
and pulling his ear, is
a lot more than contact.

234
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,410
What did you put in your mouth?

235
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,500
Candy?

236
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,620
Why's he eating candy?

237
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,630
Do you,

238
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,260
understand what we're
talking about now?

239
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,110
This is typical of single
mothers like mine, so I know...

240
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,520
Mr. Hori.

241
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,010
What about single mothers?

242
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,940
They tend to worry too much...

243
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,270
You're saying I'm
overprotective?

244
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
We accept your opinion
with seriousness

245
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,530
and we will provide appropriate
instruction in the future

246
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,000
I hope you can understand.

247
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,200
Mr. Hori.

248
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,330
I am terribly sorry.

249
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,610
You'll get scolded.

250
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,130
What are you doing!

251
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,380
You can't run like
that Be careful.

252
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,550
Hurry, go pick it up.

253
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm getting sesame oil
at the convenience store.

254
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
Sorry, I'm late We
got a watermelon...

255
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,280
What are you doing?

256
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,960
I dropped my eraser.

257
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,510
Do you have a fever?

258
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,150
Did your teacher
say something again?

259
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,410
We will reconfirm the facts...

261
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,370
Now! Confirm them now!
I mean, I'm asking.

262
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,780
- Yes.
- Don't "Yes" me.

263
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,750
Well...

264
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,240
I didn't ask you to
change "Yes" to "Well".

265
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,330
At this rate, I'll have to
transfer him to another school.

266
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,640
You were a good teacher.

267
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,520
On parents' day in second grade,
Minato read his composition.

268
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,940
That his dream was to
become a single mother.

269
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,190
I think he wrote that

270
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,570
because I raise him alone
and he wanted to help me.

271
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,860
Everyone in his class
burst out laughing.

272
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,690
But you didn't laugh.

273
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,170
"Be kind to your mother,"

274
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,960
is what he said while
praising Minato.

275
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,120
So I don't think all the teachers
in this school are awful,

276
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,880
but I do know that the person
at the top is the worst.

277
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,060
You don't have a human heart!

278
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,090
I'm sorry...

279
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,940
That's not it.

280
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm not asking for an apology.

281
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
Please have Mr. Hori come here.

282
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,190
Unfortunately he's out

283
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,570
I just saw him over there.

284
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,370
Principal, you just lied to me.

285
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,160
You just said he's out.

286
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,540
When a teacher is out, it doesn't
mean he's not at school...

287
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,670
Get it together!

288
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,840
You know...

289
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,520
I don't see any life
in any of your eyes.

290
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,110
Am I talking to human beings?

291
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,990
Yes.

292
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,700
Can you please
answer my question?

293
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,460
About whether we're human?

294
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,070
No.

295
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,370
Fine, just answer that.

296
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,430
You have to check your notes?

297
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,840
We're human.

298
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,940
In that case,

299
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,020
I'm here because I'm
worried about my child.

300
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,820
Could you please deal with
me as a fellow human being?

301
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,870
Just for this meeting,

302
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,250
please.

303
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:38,580
We accept your opinion with
seriousness and believe...

304
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,020
I'm sorry.

305
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,730
Thank you.

306
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,730
This is really not a good time.

307
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,040
She's here now...

308
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,620
Please wait.

309
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,960
Let's go over there.

310
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,330
Um, we should go...

311
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,540
- Fine, I'll apologize.
- It's not...

312
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,350
I'm very sorry.

313
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
A teacher with a school like...

314
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,300
I can't send my child to a
school with a teacher like this.

315
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,680
Make him quit.

316
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,060
- Did I say something amusing?
- Bye.

317
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,400
- Did I say something funny?
- Don't get so excited

318
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,860
I'm not excited,
just asking for...

319
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,080
Your son is a bully.

320
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,950
What are you saying?

321
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,660
Mugino Minato is
bullying Hoshikawa Yori.

322
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,130
- There's no evidence.
- Mr. Hori, take it back.

323
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,000
Does Mugino have a knife
or a weapon at home?

324
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,960
What are you talking about?

325
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,310
You're full of crap You
were at that hostess bar.

326
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,300
Oh, I know.

327
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,400
You set fire to that
bar You're the arson?

328
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,230
You're the one with a
pig's brain in your head.

329
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,230
DO NOT ENTER.

330
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,910
You really did it.

331
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,800
Watermelon.

332
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,710
It happens, it does.

333
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,810
It's a release.

334
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,680
A release.

335
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,000
Yes?

336
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,960
You're Hoshikawa?

337
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,290
Yes.

338
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,100
Hoshikawa Yori?

339
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,260
Yes.

340
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,480
You're Minato's friend, right?

341
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,140
Yes.

342
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,770
Please.

343
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,930
Please, come in.

344
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,610
Please.

345
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,960
This looks like
Minato's sneaker.

346
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,820
Yeah, he loaned it to me.

347
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,240
Just the one?

348
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,130
Just the one.

349
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,510
Is your mother not at home?

350
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,930
Won't she get mad, letting
a stranger in your house?

351
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,970
It's fine.

352
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,270
Is Mugino still
sick with a cold?

353
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,060
Yeah...

354
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,650
Write a letter?

355
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,510
Like we write to kids out sick.

356
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,750
How is

357
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,650
your cold?

358
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,530
Listen,

359
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,450
We are all worried

360
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,160
about...

361
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,790
Yori, here,

362
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,250
this letter here is flipped.

363
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,980
You wrote this backwards.

364
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,570
Here.

365
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,610
Thank you, say, this...

366
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,330
What happened?

367
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,170
Is it a burn?

368
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,550
Yori,

369
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,220
are you being bullied at school?

370
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,820
According to Mr. Hori,
Mugino often mistreats you...

371
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,330
I've never been
bullied by Mugino.

372
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,410
- What are you saying...
- And Mr. Hori...

373
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,500
OK, thanks, let's
go back to class.

374
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,370
What about the teacher?

375
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,710
He's always hitting Mugino.

376
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,720
What is that?

377
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,170
The other kids all know, but keep
quiet because they're afraid of him.

378
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,630
- Let's go back to class.
- Back to class.

379
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,620
Hoshikawa?

380
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,570
Don't run away, Principal.

381
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,610
You lost your
grandchild, didn't you?

382
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,940
I heard about it.

383
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,360
Your husband was parking his car

384
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,700
and ran over your
grandchild behind the car.

385
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,040
Did it make you sad?

386
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,050
Did it make you grieve?

387
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,920
That's exactly how I feel now.

388
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,210
Good morning.

389
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,670
Saori, Saori.

390
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,510
You've had it rough.

391
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,930
Unfortunately,

392
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,170
something happened that
should never have happened.

393
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,630
Mr. Hori.

394
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,330
I inflicted violence on
fifth grader, Mugino Minato.

395
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,320
I hit Mugino's face
I twisted his arm

396
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,490
I also used terrible
words with him.

397
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:05,180
TEACHER PHYSICALLY PUNISHES
"PIG BRAIN" STUDENT.

398
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,220
Good bye.

399
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,560
- The stairs, he fell from the stairs?
- We're not sure...

400
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,940
He fell running from Hori...

401
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,100
Let's go

402
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,610
Mr. Hori? Why's he here?

403
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,350
Didn't he quit?

404
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,910
Why's he here?

405
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,040
- Minato fell down the stairs.
- Shut up, go home.

406
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,820
Eel keeper!

407
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,130
- Where is he?
- Go home!

408
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,920
- The Guidance Counseling Room.
- Eel keeper!

409
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,370
Minato?

410
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,970
What?

411
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,680
He was just here.

412
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,020
No, no, no.

413
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,690
No, no, no.

414
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,150
It's OK.

415
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,110
Don't worry, it's fine.

416
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,500
Enough...

417
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,580
We're going, Gaku.

418
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,900
He was in the bathroom.

419
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,100
<i>Typhoon, 50 kms south of
Yakushima, heading north,</i>

420
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,800
<i>expected to land on
southern Kagoshima soon.</i>

421
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,470
I saw Dad...

422
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,810
He asked me to tell you.

423
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,350
Did he appear in a dream?

424
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,280
He said, "Thank you for
everything, I love you".

425
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,500
I'm just no good.

426
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,130
I feel like I don't take care
of you and I feel sorry for you.

427
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,470
Do you think Dad's reborn?

428
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,890
Maybe.

429
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,530
I wonder what I'll be reborn as.

430
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,040
But you're still
totally alive, Minato.

431
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,610
Yeah...

432
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,870
Don't talk like that.

433
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,090
Mom,

434
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,790
don't feel sorry for me.

435
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,530
Mugino!

436
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,150
Mugino!

437
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,110
Mugino!

438
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,830
Mugino!

439
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,460
MONSTER

440
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:08,880
What's wrong?

441
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,090
What did you say?

442
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,550
Let's get married.

443
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,300
That's a proposal, you're
supposed to make it

444
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,960
somewhere with a beautiful
view of the night.

445
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,300
Night view?

446
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,440
Everybody says it's beautiful,
but it's just light bulbs.

447
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,110
It's bad The whole
thing's on fire.

448
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,160
Kamata, Hamaguchi,
what are you doing?

449
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,950
It's Hori.

450
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,250
- Stop filming me!
- Girl from the hostess bar!

451
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,760
Hirohashi, you too, go home.

452
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,540
Burning crazy!

453
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,590
- Taking her home!
- Gross!

454
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,130
It'll burn the
whole building down.

455
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,480
I wonder if they
all went home...

456
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,990
It's like you, Hori
I feel sorry for it.

457
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,420
Don't feel sorry for me.

458
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,380
It has swim bladder disease.

459
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,210
Don't be rude,

460
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,460
my mind and body are healthy.

461
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,850
Says someone whose hobby is sending
letters about typos to publishers?

462
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,760
Look at this.

463
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,490
I wonder what "fish" fell from my
eyes, a yellow tail or a sardine.

464
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,110
Can't you find a
hobby that's more fun?

465
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,060
It makes me squirm with joy.

466
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,610
When you're having
fun, your face is scary

467
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,990
I bet your students
are put off, too.

468
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,130
Try smiling.

469
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,500
Your smile is so stiff,
you'll make children cry.

470
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,430
And make flowers wilt.

471
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,770
Stop trying to act like you're a
good teacher and just be yourself.

472
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,360
You don't have condoms.

473
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,560
It'll be fine.

474
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,860
Don't you teach at school

475
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,290
not to trust a woman's "Next
time" and a man's "It'll be fine?"

476
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,170
It'll be fine.

477
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,740
Next time, then.

478
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,330
Watch your hands, hey.

479
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,520
- Morning.
- Morning.

480
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,800
Did you eat all your breakfast?

481
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,900
What did you eat?

482
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,520
Corn soup and bread.

483
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,820
- Sounds tasty.
- I ate soft noodles.

484
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,480
Soft noodles.

485
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,160
What's up, Hoshikawa?

486
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,610
Good morning, my shoe fell off.

487
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,820
Here.

488
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,530
Thank you.

489
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,790
I'm waiting for the parents
to schedule a meeting.

490
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,710
You'd better be careful.

491
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,470
They're more trouble than
their kids, these days.

492
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,150
Do some parents always complain?

493
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,480
They're monsters Teachers are
being crucified, these days.

494
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,730
Hey, little eel.

495
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,160
Oh, Principal.

496
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,870
I am resuming my
duties as of today.

497
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:20,500
Thank you for all of your
kind notes while I was away.

498
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,470
Today, on April 25th,

499
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,840
physical measurements and
eye exams for sixth graders.

500
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,310
I took time off just when
you started teaching here.

501
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,560
Don't...

502
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,280
Please take good care
of your students.

503
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,490
Yes.

504
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,410
"Like player Nomo, who didn't
fear public opposition when

505
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:57,070
"he joined Major League
Baseball, I also declare.

506
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,420
"Practicing my swing
on a West Coast beach,"

507
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,670
"I've been reborn"

508
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:07,920
"I solemnly swear, I will
marry the idol Nishida Hikaru."

509
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,720
"Fifth Grader, Hori Michitoshi."

510
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,990
- Hey, Tanaka, class is starting.
- Oh, bathroom.

511
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,820
No need to rush.

512
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,490
I have

513
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,280
attended two weddings
of women I once loved.

514
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,460
Will the kids find it funny?

515
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,090
Sounds like a stalker
when you say it.

516
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,390
Save your obsessions
for the hostess bar.

517
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,820
Mugino, hey!

518
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,600
What are you doing?

519
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,820
Mugino, stop!

520
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,940
I'm sorry, you OK?

521
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,440
You OK?

522
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,740
Why do you do this?

523
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,210
What happened? Why?

524
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,790
Playing around?

525
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,370
Pissed off.

526
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,630
Pissed off?

527
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,540
How do you think they feel having
their things thrown like this.

528
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,380
How do they feel?

529
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,850
Don't like it.

530
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,270
Right?

531
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,980
Let's apologize to them.

532
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,240
I'm sorry.

533
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,400
- Oh, no, nosebleed.
- Nosebleed.

534
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,660
His mom is a single
mother That's why.

535
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,840
My mom was, too.

536
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,840
She becomes overprotective
with a shrewd perspective.

537
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,720
You're using "shrewd
perspective" in the wrong way.

538
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,140
It actually means perceiving
the essence of things...

539
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,560
When things are tough, don't
take yourself so seriously.

540
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,600
Do you even remember your
elementary school teacher's name?

541
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,650
- No.
- See?

542
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,770
They're going to forget you,
so don't take it too seriously.

543
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,440
I get off early tomorrow, so
let's meet up and go shopping.

544
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,250
- Shut up.
- Don't say that.

545
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,590
Second tier.

546
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,340
Hang in there, hang in.

547
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,220
Hang in.

548
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,170
OK, third tier!

549
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,560
Oh, hang in there, first
tier Don't sway, second tier.

550
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,480
You call yourself a man?

551
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,890
Again, from the second tier

552
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:15,810
<i>5pm by the station.</i>

553
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,510
Found him, here he is.

554
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,930
Ouch.

555
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,800
Mugino Minato's guardian
is here to protest.

556
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,600
Protest what?

557
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,300
You're shifty-eyed and
creepy, so stay here

558
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,470
I haven't done anything
I can explain it to her.

559
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,020
We can't let this
get out of hand.

560
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,280
We're used to dealing with
guardians, leave it to us.

561
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,270
Leave it.

562
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:03,440
You may not know, but
Mugino's father died...

563
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,240
I know that, but what does...

564
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,460
In the parents' meeting, did she
say he'll test for middle school?

565
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,840
Yes, she did.

566
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,960
If he has to transfer for bullying,
he can't test for any school.

567
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,220
I didn't hit him My
arm just grazed him.

568
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,140
I can explain that I stopped
Mugino from acting out.

569
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,300
If you blame the child, the
parent will become furious.

570
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:32,180
If this gets to the Education Board,
the whole school will be punished.

571
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,480
- Maybe all of us...
- But actually...

572
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:38,360
What actually happened
doesn't matter.

573
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,240
Start over.

574
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,860
Because my instruction...

575
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,000
- Well...
- No "Well" needed.

576
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,990
Sit in the guardian's seat.

577
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,470
Can you see this?

578
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,100
Yes, I can see it perfectly.

579
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,720
Mr. Hori?

580
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,470
Mr. Hori?

581
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,190
In this case, because my
instruction to Mugino...

582
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,780
She placed the photo like this
and said, "can you see it?"

583
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,530
The principal does
love this school.

584
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,660
But still...

585
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,700
She lives in my neighborhood.

586
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,930
There's a rumor that it was
actually the principal's fault.

587
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:45,680
What?

588
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,930
That it wasn't her husband
who ran over their grandchild,

589
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,100
but it was the
principal herself.

590
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,770
Hoshikawa.

591
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,370
There they were
Thank you, Mr. Hori.

592
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,990
What is it?

593
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:36,210
Excuse me, I'm Hori I'm
Yori's homeroom teacher.

594
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,540
His teacher.

595
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,880
I wanted to talk
to you about him.

596
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,370
Your college?

597
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:43,870
Excuse me?

598
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,680
I hear teachers
don't get paid much.

599
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,720
Do you know Mega-City
Real Estate?

600
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,770
I used to work there

601
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,550
I see, amazing.

602
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,060
It's not amazing, but

603
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,700
maybe for an elementary
school teacher.

604
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,780
Um...

605
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,330
- About Yori.
- I'm sure he's a pain,

606
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:19,450
you don't have to tell me about him
I'll take responsibility for him.

607
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,700
He's not a pain,
he's a great kid.

608
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,550
No good,

609
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,170
he's...

610
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,960
A monster.

611
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,600
What?

612
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,480
His brain isn't a human
brain, it's a pig's brain.

613
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,850
Which is why I plan to

614
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,230
turn him back into a human.

615
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

616
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,960
Did you pee?

617
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,560
Who's the monster?

618
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,780
Are you OK?

619
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,060
Are you...

620
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,830
- Hoshikawa?
- Oh, it's you, Mr. Hori.

621
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,090
Thanks.

622
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

623
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,570
When I found it, it
was already cold.

624
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,910
The cat?

625
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,740
I saw it.

626
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,920
I saw Mugino toying
with the cat.

627
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,270
Hoshikawa?

628
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,050
- Hey, Hoshikawa?
- No!

629
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,020
Kida, come here.

630
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,160
Can you please tell the Principal
what you told me the other day?

631
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,000
That Mugino might
have killed the cat?

632
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,570
What? I never said that.

633
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,870
What...

634
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,300
Why do you tell lies?

635
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,380
- What are you doing!
- Hurts.

636
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,800
Did everyone get a copy?

637
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:24,270
This questionnaire will be filled
out by all the fifth graders.

638
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:28,050
- So, all homeroom teachers need to...
- What is this?

639
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,230
Return...

640
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,720
What is this?

641
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,820
What is this! What is this!

642
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,820
Ms. Mugino has hired a lawyer.

643
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,910
It arrived by
certified delivery.

644
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:51,620
Bathroom, bathroom.

645
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,660
Really think about it.

646
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,290
And write down

647
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,710
your honest answer.

648
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,260
HAVE YOU EVER FELT
AFRAID OF MR. HORI?

649
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,290
DID HE EVER SCREAM
AT YOU OR GRAB... YES

650
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,190
I really haven't done anything.

651
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,080
I'm sure.

652
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,790
In that case, please stop this.

653
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,080
If you object now, it will
only strengthen their case.

654
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,710
Then why didn't you...

655
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,370
You are going to
defend our school.

656
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,260
Let's go, Mr. Hori.

657
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:15,260
A long day for you.

658
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,710
Who actually drove that car?

659
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,140
You're the principal, so to protect
your position and your name,

660
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,990
you made your husband
take the blame.

661
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,660
The principal and everyone
told me to apologize anyway.

662
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,620
My apology would
satisfy everyone.

663
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,470
So I had no choice and
even apologized to Mugino.

664
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,750
But...

665
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,720
Have you been busy, recently?

666
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,380
Well, I still have
some work to do later.

667
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,480
Good evening.

668
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,890
You're Mr. Hori, the teacher
at Johoku Elementary, right?

669
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,200
I see you went shopping.

670
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,870
- I'm sorry.
- Please stop that.

671
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,490
I'd like to interview you.

672
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,780
Please stop that.

673
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,140
I think they left.

674
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,710
They were taking your picture.

675
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,260
Why the pajamas?

676
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,890
Why aren't you staying over?

677
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,020
No reason, you've
got a lot going on

678
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,020
I'm fine A lot of
things happened, but...

679
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,860
I wasn't in the photos
they took, was I?

680
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:12,120
Even so, I'll be the
only one in the newspaper

681
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,860
I'm sorry.

682
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,170
That hurt.

683
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,130
You know I'm innocent, right?

684
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,710
I know that, hang in there.

685
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,590
See you next time.

686
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,760
"PIG'S BRAIN" ABUSIVE
TEACHER'S TAUNT.

687
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,980
Pig's brain! Pig's brain!

688
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,760
It's Hori.

689
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,850
Mugino.

690
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,980
Mugino.

691
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:59,810
Mugino!

692
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,400
Mugino!

693
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,910
Why?!

694
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,080
Did I do something to you?

695
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,920
I haven't done anything, right?

696
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,770
Yeah, right.

697
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,070
Oh, I see.

698
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,780
You OK?

699
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,450
I'll call a teacher!

700
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,820
- What happened?
- Hori pushed him.

701
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,850
Hori? Hori? What?

702
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,690
Watch out, be careful!

703
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,530
- Mr. Hori!
- Mr. Hori!

704
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,990
Mr. Hori!

705
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,710
Mr. Hori!

706
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,640
Mr. Hori, calm down!

707
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:56,750
Mr. Hori!

708
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,700
"Selective Breeding?"

01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,500

FIFTH GRADER HOSHIKAWA YORI

MI

712

NA

713
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:08,230
TO

714
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,160
Mugino Minato.

715
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,610
Hoshikawa...

716
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,840
Mugino!

717
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,800
Mugino!

718
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,180
I'm sorry!

719
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,280
I was wrong!

720
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,310
You did nothing wrong!

721
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,020
There's nothing wrong with you!

722
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,250
Mugino!

723
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,740
Mugino!

724
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,750
Please, let me see Mugino.

725
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,250
Please.

726
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,430
Please!

727
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,680
MUGINO MINATO.

728
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,220
Since he was little, he
always woke up crying.

729
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,720
He always dreamed that the people
he loved were gone and cried.

730
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,570
He's a sweet child.

731
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,400
Um, wait...

732
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,120
Have you seen a child, a boy!

733
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,540
A boy? No, I haven't.

734
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,710
There's an evacuation order
Mudslide in the mountain.

735
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:50,960
Mudslide?

736
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,630
The old railroad tracks ahead
of here Go back! Go back!

737
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,290
Stop! Stop!

738
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,380
Wait...

739
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:12,300
Hey, you can't!

740
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:15,680
You'll die up in
the mountain! Hey!

741
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,740
Further ahead!?

742
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,000
Minato!

743
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,490
Minato!

744
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,340
Mugino!

745
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:43,370
Hoshikawa, you here?

746
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,640
Minato?

747
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,590
Are you OK?

748
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:58,070
It's caved in! Caved in!

749
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,180
Minato!

750
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,320
The train car!

751
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:19,380
What did he mean
by being reborn?

752
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,616
What?

753
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,190
What did he mean by being
reborn? Reborn? Minato!

754
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,130
Minato!

755
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,430
Window! Window!

756
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,060
Mugino!

757
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,030
Hoshikawa!

758
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,550
Hey!

759
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,970
Can you hear me? Minato!

760
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:08,080
It's your mom!

761
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:12,840
Minato!

762
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,150
Hey!

763
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:32,740
- Minato?!
- Mugino!

764
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,580
Hoshikawa!

765
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,230
When we went to the supermarket,

766
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:07,110
and I told her to buy
whatever she liked,

767
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,940
she refused, saying,

768
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:14,080
"if I buy my favorite candy,
the candy robber will come."

769
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,820
Candy robber?

770
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,070
She said it was real.

771
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:26,120
That if you looked away, it'd
steal the candy and run away.

772
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,460
So, I see.

773
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:34,180
Whatever I say, you
say, "So, I see".

774
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,810
I just remembered, last night.

775
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,390
I'm going back to
school from tomorrow,

776
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,480
so I thought.

777
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:54,610
I should tell you while I can.

778
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,950
What about the grave?

779
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,660
They'll get one elsewhere.

780
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,580
I thought that was for the best.

781
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,790
You're right.

782
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,880
A candy robber, huh?

783
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,600
That's a great line.

784
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,570
Right?

785
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,300
Oh, this...

786
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:58,180
Thanks.

787
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,460
Stop, stop, it's dangerous!

788
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,660
- We're fine.
- Where are you going?

789
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,580
<i>- Stop!
- Please stop!</i>

790
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:37,590
<i>- It's Hoshikawa Yori.
- It's not Hoshikawa.</i>

791
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,920
<i>Please stop!</i>

792
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,850
<i>You sound just like him.</i>

793
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,010
No, he doesn't.

794
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,906
<i>- What are you doing?
- It's Hori, Hori!</i>

795
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:53,100
- <i>Stop filming me!</i>
- Girl from the hostess bar!

796
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,230
- Good morning.
- Morning.

797
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,930
What time did you go to bed?

798
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,100
Midnight

799
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,610
2am for me

800
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:36,890
2am?

801
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,490
2am? What were you doing?

802
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,440
Do you ever think sleeping is
a waste of time? No, right?

803
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,110
Bam!

804
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:49,040
Why are you talking to an alien?

805
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,700
- It's a prank! Surprised?
- No.

806
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,370
Party pooper,
party pooper alien.

807
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:59,460
- Sounds tasty.
- I ate soft noodles.

808
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:01,220
Soft noodles.

809
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,220
What's up, Hoshikawa?

810
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,460
Good morning, my shoe fell off.

811
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,110
Out loud.

812
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:17,480
Our Future

813
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:21,410
I wrote this composition
when I was in fifth grade.

814
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,660
Never heard of Nishida Hikaru?

815
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,750
- Who?
- Which celebrity?

816
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,200
Oh, tambourines.

817
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,120
Mugino.

818
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,080
Here.

819
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,810
Kida, you're on music duty,
right? Please go with him.

820
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:48,180
Hoshikawa is, too.

821
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,180
OK, Hoshikawa, take this.

822
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,060
Yes.

823
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,730
Please take this.

824
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,360
- Watch your step.
- Yes I will.

825
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,550
Secret.

826
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:44,490
I haven't touched them,
so they're not dirty

827
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,060
I don't think they're dirty.

828
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,080
You might catch my disease.

829
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:52,070
Just surprised you
brought snacks.

830
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,450
What disease?

831
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,010
I told you.

832
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,920
Is your

833
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,220
brain really a pig's brain?

834
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,240
I thought I wouldn't make
friends in my new class, either.

835
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:30,780
We're friends, but...

836
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,080
Don't talk to me in
front of the class.

837
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,310
OK, I won't talk to you.

838
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,470
Well, thanks.

839
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,820
Cleaning, cleaning.

840
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:45,900
- Is he here yet?
- Stop that, Daito.

841
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,360
Stinks, stinks.

842
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,400
Mugino, hurry, hurry.

843
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,950
It's a prank, a prank.

844
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,830
Do it.

845
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,460
Do it more, more!

846
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:00,000
Keep doing it, more!

847
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,450
Keep doing it, more!

848
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,500
Here he is.

849
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,560
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

850
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:27,700
Don't just clean it up, react.

851
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,450
Hey, Hoshikawa.

852
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,660
Kuroda's mole looks
like a black bean.

853
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,660
Look at it!

854
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,360
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

855
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:46,420
Say, "Kuroda's mole
is a black bean".

856
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,160
I can't say what I don't think.

857
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,140
Why do you take the
girls' side? You a girl?

858
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,390
A girl alien?

859
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:57,100
My lips are super supple!

860
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:03,940
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
- Cut it out.

861
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,060
I mean it, cut it out.

862
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,860
Mugino, what are you doing!

863
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:22,570
Mugino...

864
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,460
Ouch.

865
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,220
Hurts.

866
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,560
No way, no way

867
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,770
I can't let you out.

868
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:46,510
Just stay there.

869
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,430
You can't.

870
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,990
What? Do you hear something?

871
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:56,020
A cat.

872
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:19,510
It's a prank.

873
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,650
Sorry for today.

874
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,830
Sorry for today.

875
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,620
Ever buy a Coke from the vending
machine by the liquor store?

876
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:49,840
Yeah.

877
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,460
One in every three times,
the Coke comes out hot.

878
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:57,640
- No way.
- Never got a hot one?

879
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:59,350
I have.

880
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:16,820
Sorry, kept you waiting.

881
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,650
Let's go.

882
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,070
Primrose.

883
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,630
Blue star creeper.

884
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,460
Why do you know flower names?

885
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,830
Because I like them.

886
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,370
Kerria! Columbine!

887
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,710
White nettle, celandine.

888
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:24,770
Mom said girls prefer boys
who don't know flower names.

889
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,130
That boys who know
flower names are creepy?

890
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:31,610
She wouldn't say
creepy She's a mom.

891
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,150
You're right.

892
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,860
Girls don't like boys who
are scared of the dark.

893
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:52,630
Let's go.

894
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,310
Will you tell?

895
01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:00,440
I won't tell It would spoil it.

896
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,480
All aboard!

897
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,830
Clickety-clack,
clickety-clack, clickety...

898
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:13,320
Hello.

899
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,830
Is it sunny where you are?

900
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,170
It's sunny here.

901
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,960
All aboard!

902
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,140
You put this here

903
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,130
and then tape it like this.

904
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,980
Like this.

905
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,830
The end of the line.

906
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:20,110
"The fa-ther said,
'No, but, then,"

907
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:23,280
"af, ter, think, ing it over,"

908
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:26,280
"he, said, OK,"

909
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,270
"and la, laugh, laughed."

910
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,860
OK, next.

911
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,360
- Fujimori.
- Yes.

912
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,990
- I made mistakes.
- It's OK.

913
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,770
Look, it's here.

914
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,220
A cat.

915
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,030
Actually, a former cat.

916
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,240
Does it stop being
a cat when it dies?

917
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:13,490
That's true of
everything that dies.

918
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:18,360
Left like this, it
might not be reborn.

919
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,290
Cover its face with dirt, too?

920
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,630
It's already dead.

921
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:04,620
Is it OK?

922
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:07,510
Will it burn like in California?

923
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,470
Maybe a fire truck will come.

924
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,770
Did you burn the hostess bar?

925
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,110
Because your dad was there?

926
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:48,710
Drinking alcohol is
bad for your health.

927
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,840
Stinks.

928
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,220
Stinks.

929
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,940
Please, open the door.

930
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,580
Please, open the door.

931
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,080
Mugino? It's you, Mugino,
right? Let me out.

932
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,870
Did you pee?

933
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:41,630
Who's the monster?

934
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:43,590
Are you OK?

935
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,760
Why not tell Mr. Hori?

936
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,930
He's kind.

937
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,530
He'll just say I'm
not acting like a man.

938
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,270
You don't want to?

939
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,770
Well, I have a pig's brain.

940
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:02,950
You don't have a pig's brain.

941
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:05,660
Your dad is wrong.

942
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,710
My dad is kind He promises
to cure my disease.

943
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,580
When I'm cured,
Mom will come back.

944
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,140
I don't think you
have a disease.

945
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,930
He is my dad, so there are
things I just can't say to him.

946
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:23,550
There are things I can't
say to Mom, either, but...

947
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,510
Your dad died, right?

948
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:37,910
Actually, he died on a trip
with a lady, Noguchi Minako

949
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:39,610
I see.

950
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,460
Noguchi Minako was wearing
a tacky knit dress.

951
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:48,500
I see, that's super interesting.

952
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:51,540
Glico.

953
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:54,160
- Glico.
- Big Crunch?

954
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:57,250
Yeah, the universe
keeps expanding.

955
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:00,260
Right now, it's blowing
up like a balloon.

956
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:05,010
In the end, when the universe
can't get any bigger.

957
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,940
It will split, bam!

958
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,260
Glico.

959
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,720
Will the universe break?

960
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:17,310
Yeah, time will go
backwards It will turn back,

961
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,570
so clocks, people, trains and
cats will all move backwards.

962
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:25,160
Beef on rice will
turn back into cows,

963
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,150
and poop goes back
into your butt.

964
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:28,780
Really?

965
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:33,000
Humans will turn into monkeys,
the dinosaurs will come back

966
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,410
and we'll go back to before
the universe was born.

967
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,710
So, we're going to be reborn.

968
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,010
That's right.

969
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,340
Shall we get ready?

970
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,150
"I'm here."

971
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,260
Maybe here?

972
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,770
If it isn't a horse,
I would say, "Wrong".

973
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,580
- OK?
- OK

974
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:49,250
It's tasty.

975
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,226
PIG

976
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,820
You eat concrete.

977
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:55,020
SNAIL

978
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:56,520
Am I a woodlouse?

979
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,670
No, you're not.

980
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
You can't look up at the sky.

981
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:06,100
Am I chubby?

982
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:09,300
Like king of chubbiness.

983
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,180
Am I edible?

984
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,090
You're a gourmet food.

985
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,720
I know.

986
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,820
One, two.

987
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:21,320
- A pig.
- A snail.

988
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:23,410
- Correct.
- Correct.

989
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,270
Yeah!

990
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,610
- Who's the monster?
- Who's the monster?

991
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,450
SLOTH

992
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,826
You have an amazing talent.

993
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,960
SUNFISH

994
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:37,590
You have an amazing talent.

995
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,170
Do I kick?

996
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:41,580
You don't kick.

997
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,830
Do I bite and release a poison?

998
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:48,930
When you're attacked,

999
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:52,760
you let go of all your
strength and give up.

1000
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:54,480
That's not a talent.

1001
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,600
You stop feeling.

1002
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,110
Am I Hoshikawa Yori?

1003
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,250
My future.

1004
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:14,610
Bull's eye.

1005
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:18,710
Rugby player.

1006
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,500
My future...

1007
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,170
My future...

1008
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,680
"Mu-Gi-No Mi-Na-To."

1009
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,820
"Ho-Shi-Ka-Wa Yo-Ri."

1010
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,990
Do you think
Mr. Hori will notice?

1011
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:55,330
I don't think he will.

1012
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,250
Ouch!

1013
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:09,130
Oh, wait!

1014
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:17,020
So many Over here, too.

1015
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:18,970
There.

1016
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:20,180
Thanks.

1017
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,060
Where else?

1018
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,490
Up there, up!

1019
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,040
I found a lot!

1020
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,510
- Ouch.
- You OK?

1021
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,670
It's not your fault.

1022
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,430
I was thinking about something.

1023
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:07,400
It seems like I have
to change schools.

1024
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:10,480
Where?

1025
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,020
Grandma's house.

1026
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:18,650
So you won't have
to worry anymore.

1027
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,250
Your dad's abandoning you.

1028
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:35,750
What a laugh.

1029
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:38,550
Yeah.

1030
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:43,300
No, I said it on purpose
to make you laugh.

1031
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:45,400
I'm not mad.

1032
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,310
I don't want you to go away...

1033
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,400
I'm sorry.

1034
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:08,160
Minato...

1035
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,430
Wait, wait, get away.

1036
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:16,810
Get away.

1037
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,910
It's OK.

1038
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,690
It happens...

1039
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,530
To me, sometimes.

1040
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:41,180
Hey, you're supposed to laugh!

1041
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,840
Pass!

1042
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,270
Over here!

1043
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:55,950
Pass it, Minato!

1044
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:57,910
Pass it to me! Pass it!

1045
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,490
Minato!

1046
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:02,910
Are you friendly with Hoshikawa?

1047
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:05,200
Do you like Hoshikawa?

1048
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:08,460
Gross. You two are lovey dovey.

1049
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:12,800
Yeah, lovey dovey!

1050
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,600
What?

1051
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:31,220
What are you doing? Stop it!

1052
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:33,770
- No good!
- Mugino!

1053
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,230
Teacher's here!

1054
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,250
You're bandaged.

1055
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,320
You're OK!

1056
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,480
I'm supposed to report you

1057
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,690
but let's keep it a secret.

1058
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,480
Time to make up.

1059
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:21,400
Shake hands like men.

1060
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,870
Time for you both to change
into your gym clothes.

1061
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,600
Three, two, one.

1062
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,750
Who's the monster?

1063
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,380
Who's the monster?

1064
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:05,580
- Who's the...
- Minato?

1065
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,520
Minato?

1066
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:27,330
Your ear hurt?

1067
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:31,280
I'm sorry.

1068
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:32,940
I...

1069
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:35,870
Can't be like Dad.

1070
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:40,210
I've promised your father.

1071
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,590
That I'll hang in there until
you're married and have your...

1072
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:46,910
Just an ordinary family
you see anywhere is fine.

1073
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,010
YORI

1074
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:50,100
own family, the
greatest treasure...

1075
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,170
Minato?

1076
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,350
Why was I born?

1077
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:55,870
- Say...
- Tell him.

1078
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:59,070
I'm cured of my sickness now.

1079
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:03,460
I worried you, but
I'm all fine now.

1080
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:05,080
Cured of what?

1081
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:07,510
- I'm normal now.
- You were always normal.

1082
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:11,300
There's a girl you like
near grandma's house, right?

1083
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,380
She's Shindo Ayaka.

1084
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:16,510
Thank you for playing with him.

1085
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:18,590
Thank you.

1086
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:39,830
I'm sorry, I lied!

1087
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:43,880
Hoshikawa! Hoshikawa!

1088
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,920
- Hurts!
- Why can't you do what I tell you!

1089
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,290
I'll punish you again.

1090
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,300
- Shut up!
- Stop! It hurts.

1091
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:57,970
We'll have... Confiscated.

1092
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,770
We'll have a new teacher
replace Mr. Hori.

1093
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:07,860
If you have any problem at all,
discuss it honestly with a teacher.

1094
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:14,440
Is that Hori?

1095
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:17,160
It's Hori.

1096
01:49:18,490 --> 01:49:19,860
Why's Hori here?

1097
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,370
Mugino.

1098
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,500
Mugino, Mugino!

1099
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,960
Why is he back now?

1100
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:33,330
- Is he angry about his punishment?
- It's his own fault.

1101
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:36,710
We've had enough
of his problems.

1102
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,620
I'm sorry.

1103
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:04,950
Who are you apologizing to?

1104
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,220
Mr. Hori did nothing wrong.

1105
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:20,220
I told a lie.

1106
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:24,190
I see.

1107
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:28,760
So did I.

1108
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:41,030
I used to be a music teacher.

1109
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:47,210
My brass band club used
to compete nationally.

1110
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,300
Hold it this way.

1111
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,390
Your left hand holds this.

1112
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:15,360
Have you ever seen
one? You extend this

1113
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:17,650
to change the pitch.

1114
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:25,670
And then your mouth
here Loosen your lips.

1115
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:42,880
Not bad.

1116
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:48,150
Maybe a lighter
instrument is better.

1117
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,600
I see,

1118
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:57,150
so you told a lie...

1119
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:11,070
I, um...

1120
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,180
I'm not really sure,

1121
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:30,230
but I like someone.

1122
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:36,900
I see.

1123
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,190
I can't tell anyone, so I lie.

1124
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,290
Cause they'll know I
can never be happy.

1125
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,250
In that case,

1126
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:08,980
whatever you can't tell anyone,

1127
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,230
blow it away.

1128
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:30,400
Blow it away.

1129
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:54,390
But that's nonsense.

1130
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:00,980
If only some people can have
it, that's not happiness.

1131
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,110
That's just nonsense.

1132
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:11,360
Happiness is something
anyone can have.

1133
01:55:27,610 --> 01:55:29,110
Hoshikawa?

1134
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,500
Hoshikawa?

1135
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:02,810
Hoshikawa?

1136
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,110
Hoshikawa?

1137
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:17,740
Hoshikawa! The Big
Crunch is coming.

1138
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,130
It's safe!

1139
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:19,600
You're right.

1140
01:58:05,230 --> 01:58:06,400
Want to eat?

1141
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:23,110
Will it take off?

1142
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,750
Sounds like it's taking off.

1143
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:50,800
Were we reborn?

1144
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:53,220
I don't think that happened.

1145
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:55,270
We weren't?

1146
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:58,280
We weren't, we're the same.

1147
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,320
OK, great.
