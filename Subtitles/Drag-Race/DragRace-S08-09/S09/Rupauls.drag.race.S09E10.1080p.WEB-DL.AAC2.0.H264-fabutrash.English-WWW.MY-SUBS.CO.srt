       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

        - [laughs] Okay.

12

   a script would have helped?

13
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,754
      - The clever wordplay     
         and the writing

14
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,555
    I do think came from me.

15
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:33,424

           right now.

        you're the winner       
    of this week's challenge.

            Valentina           
     and Nina Bo'nina Brown,

20
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:46,501
   you are up for elimination.

21
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,170
     Stop. Hold up, hold up.

22
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:51,972
       Valentina, this is       
    a lip sync for your life.

23
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:53,106
    We need to see your lips.

24
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:54,507
         Take that thing        
       off of your mouth.

25
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,942
           - I'd like           
     to keep it on, please.

26
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,243
       - It's a lip sync.

27
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,945
        What part of that       
     do you not understand?

28
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:04,948
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,

29
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,649
       shantay, you stay.

30
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:10,219
     Valentina, sashay away.

31
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,596
             - Girl.

32
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,664
      - What just happened?

33
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,098
           - Valentina          
      was just eliminated,

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,967
     and we are all shocked.

35
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:30,302
          - "I love you         
      with all of my heart.

36
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,803
            Kisses."            
        - Oh, Valentina.

37
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:33,638
        - Oh, Valentina.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,972
    - I'm so stunned, though.

39
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:36,640
          I don't know          
     what got into her head.

40
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,908
     - But that being said,     
     Nina, you earned that.

41
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,776
            Not only            
     did you know the words,

42
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:41,910
            you like            
       put on a fun show.

43
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:44,012
         -Come on, Nina.        
           -Go, Nina.

44
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:46,948
  [chanting] Nina! Nina! Nina!

45
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:49,517
  - Yeah, I mean, it was cute.

46
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,351
     I did what I had to do.

47
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:54,088
   But for me, this is, like,   
   not, like, a happy moment.

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,755
        I feel horrible.

49
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:56,022
           I feel bad           
    because I feel like maybe

50
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:57,857
          if she wasn't         
      in the group with me,

51
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,258
          she probably          
      would still be here.

52
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,692
              -No.              
           -No, Nina.

53
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:02,293
    - You can't take that on,   
              girl.

54
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,894
     That ain't your fault.

55
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:05,595
          - Oh, my God.         
           Not again.

56
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:07,630
       - I'm just saying,       
      hear me out, y'all--

57
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:08,464
   before y'all curse me out,

58
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:11,533
 the negative one is still here 
     and the positive one--

59
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,001
          - But, Nina,          
     we're rooting for you.

60
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:16,104
    The way you just fought,    
       that was beautiful.

61
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,439
  - Yeah, but I just feel bad.

62
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,540
          - It's tough          
      being in the bottom,

63
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,575
          but is there          
      a little piece of you

64
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,810
      that feels victorious     
           after this?

65
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,311
              - No.

66
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,813
       I can't explain it.      
       I can't explain it.

67
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,115
      - Can we stop talking     
      about this, actually?

68
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,149
           -This is--           
             -Sorry,

69
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,250
         I'm not having         
       this conversation.

70
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,819
           I love you.          
    That's all I have to say.

71
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:39,389
    I've never heard of that    
  in any situation in humanity.

72
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,590
  I need to make you feel good

73
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:43,526
         about the fact         
    that you did a great job?

74
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,761
     So I'm not gonna do it.

75
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:47,896
           Bitch, snap          
       the fuck out of it.

76
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:51,633
 - I guess I don't really care, 
that's the thing, like I should,

77
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:52,567
          but I don't.

78
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,235
         I'm not asking         
    for anybody to go, like,

79
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:55,302
      oh, Nina, it's okay.

80
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:56,770
         I mean, that's         
     what they chose to do.

81
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,738
     - We've asked ourselves    
         how many times

82
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,706
           did we try           
    to snap her out of this,

83
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,607
  and the answer is it's over.

84
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,343
      - These conversations     
  are not helping her, clearly.

85
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,812
           It may even          
      be doing more damage.

86
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,713
   This is not group therapy.

87
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,147
     This is a competition.

88
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,215
         We just cannot         
          fight for her

89
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:16,218
 in a way that she's not willing
      to fight for herself.

90

     we don't support Nina,

00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,432
    [laughter and screaming]

131
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:03,603
   In a makeover sponsored by

132
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,104
            Oh, crew?

133

           [all laugh]

134
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,543

             Sarge.

141
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:30,957

              Josh.             
             - Yes!

144
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,663
     - Okay, just one more.

145
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,064
             Duncan.

146
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:45,536
     [screams and laughter]

147
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,573
    Gentlemen, say your name    
        and what you do.

148
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,374
          - I'm Sarge.          
     I'm a camera operator.

149
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,809
           - I'm Aaron          
   and I'm an art coordinator.

150
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,610
          - I'm Rizzo.          
        I am a set P.A.,

151
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,379
        and I pretty much       
 make sure that they're in drag

152
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,047
        when we tell them       
         to be in drag.

153
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,649
      - Oh, how the tables      
          have turned.

154
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,516
           [all laugh]

155
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,519
       - My name's Brady.       
 I work in the audio department,

156
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,187
         and I make sure        
          you all sound

157
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,888
    as beautiful as you look    
         every episode.

158
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,055
             -Aw...             
             -Aw...

159
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,056
         - Hey, queens.         
        My name is Josh.

160
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,590
       You see me around.       
           I'm a P.A.

161
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,558
          - I'm Duncan.         
   I'm the associate director.

162
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,626
    We're all in Ru's house.

163
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,562
       When Ru's not here,      
         it's my house.

164
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,363
           [all laugh]

165
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,733
       - Ladies, these men      
     are like family to me.

166
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,368
         Now I want you         
       to share with them

167
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,738
            firsthand           
      the miracle of drag.

           [all laugh]

170
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:39,544
  And we've got these gorgeous  
          RockStar wigs

171
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,078
       to top things off.

172
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,482
 Shea and Sasha, since you both 
   won last week's challenge,

173
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:49,052
   you get to pair the queens   
         with the crew.

174
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:52,155
    First, who do you choose    
         for yourselves?

175
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:54,390
           Shea first.          
             - Josh.

176
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:56,158
           - Oh, damn!

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,260
         - I picked Josh        
        because obviously

178
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:01,196
      we share the closest      
       family resemblance.

179
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:03,464
        - I like a strong       
       and powerful woman,

180
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,332
    so I'm going with Duncan.

181
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,800
           [all laugh]

182
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,169
      I feel like Duncan's      
           so serious

183
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,537
    when he's being our A.D.,

184
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,373
        and I want to see       
        his playful side.

185
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,241
             - Nina,            
     we're going to pair you

186
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:17,910
        with the lovely,        
         artistic Aaron.

187
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:18,744
          - All right.

188
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:19,644
  - Ain't no shenanigans here.

189
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,178
          We really try         
     and match the girls up

190
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,979
        with someone that       
       at least feels like

191
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:25,648
        their personality       
       will match up well.

192
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,785
       - With Peppermint,       
      we are putting Sarge.

193
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,419
     [laughter and applause]

194
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:34,488
       - Who do you choose      
          for Trinity?

195
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,555
             -Rizzo.            
             -Rizzo.

196
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,290
     [laughter and applause]

197
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:41,594
      - Which means Alexis      
   will be making over Brady.

198
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:42,361
           [applause]

199
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:44,062
         -Come to mama.         
              -Yes.

200
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,565
        - Now, remember,        
   the judges will be looking

201
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,436
          for a strong          
    drag family resemblance.

202
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,639
      So don't fuck it up.

203
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,877
          - So you said         
        you're an artist.

204
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,746
    - I'm a graphite artist,    
   you know, outside of work,

205
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,747
   you know, a pencil artist.

206
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,415
       - 'Cause I do drag,      
    but I don't just do drag.

207
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,818
       I do like artistic       
  and different kind of things.

208
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,786
       - Dope. I dig this.

209
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,954
        Do you want to do       
       like creature like?

210
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:13,654
     - Yeah. I'm thinking--

211
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:14,888
     - I think that would be    
          fucking cool.

212
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,724
 - And I keep having this vision
     of like a white rabbit.

213
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:18,357
          - Hell, yeah.

214
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,059
       - But the thing is       
  getting the garment together.

215
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,361
          That's where          
       the trick comes in.

216
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,329
     Y'all know I don't sew.

217
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,464
             For me,            
       my drag is my face,

218
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,965
    but I wanted to show that

219
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,267
       I can try to create      
     something from scratch.

220
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,969
       So I decide to sew.

221
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,205
            [laughs]

222
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:39,539
             - Hip.

223
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,842
        - One of my major       
      inspirations for drag

224
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,009
       is Naomi Campbell.

225
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,577
   That strength, that power,   
        that confidence.

226
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,580
    So, like, what are some,    
    like, female celebrities

227
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,814
    that, like, come to mind

228
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,682
     when you're just, like,    
    I like the way she looks

229
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:53,250
         when I see her         
       on the red carpet?

230
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:56,019
        - I have a thing        
      for Natalie Portman.

231
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,320
       - Natalie Portman?

232
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:01,156
     She don't really match     
     with the Coulee brand.

233
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:04,759
   I want you to just give me,  
  like, your best runway walk.

234
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,494
         Let me have it.

235
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,333
        I know your mama        
      don't walk like that.

236
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:16,602
    Don't think about putting   
 the emphasis in your shoulders.

237
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:17,436
      Take all that energy

238
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,870
         and channel it         
         into your hips.

239
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:23,207
    You really want to, like,   
  loosen, like, all of this up.

240
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:23,907
        So try it again.

241
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,875
       I'm gonna watch you      
          from behind.

242
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,479
   - Have you ever seen a dog   
          walk in snow?

243
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:32,713
             - Ooh.

244
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:33,680
     - It's just like that.

245
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,049
    Your sister looks strong.

246
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,050
        - She is strong.

247
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:39,218
        - And I'm talking       
        about that walk.

248
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,953
           - [laughs]

249
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,388
          - Bye, girl.

         <i> - Coming up...</i>

251
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,524
     Oh, and one more thing.

252
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,995
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

253
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,765
         [RuPaul laughs]

254
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:58,499
           - Oh, fuck.

255
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,633
        - Walk naturally.

256
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:00,634
        Go to the store.

257
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:01,668
        - Okay. Oh, God.

258
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,402
          - Oh, Jesus.

259
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:03,703
  - This week's maxi challenge

260
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,771
           is to turn           
      the "Drag Race" crew

261
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,806
     into our drag sisters.

262
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,707
    Okay, I'm known for body,

263
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,911
     so I would like to make    
       a swimsuit for you.

264
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,246
         How do you feel        
         about tucking?

265
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,248
          - Gonna hurt.

266
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,384
     - But with a swimsuit,     
  it's, like, it's very there.

267
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:23,451
     You gotta pull it back

268
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,119
          or I'm gonna          
      pull it back for you.

269
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,186
             - Oh...

270
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,755
          - With Rizzo,         
    I'm gonna crack the whip.

271
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:30,523
    I haven't won a challenge   
         in a few weeks,

272
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,826
   and so I have to work hard   
          and show them

273
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:36,361
        that I'm gonna go       
          all the way.

274
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,329
       - Hey, kitty girls.

275
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,097
              -Hey.             
              -Hey.

276
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,832
           - How's my           
       2 Live Crew doing?

277
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,166
             -Good.             
             -Good.

278
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,434
           - [laughs]           
           Hey, Brady.

279
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,802
    - Well, hello there, Ru.

280
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:47,636
          -Hi, Alexis.          
              -Hi.

281
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:50,271
   - Now, you've just sort of   
   dipped your toe in so far.

282
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:53,641
     What personality traits    
          are emerging?

283
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,809
 - Oh, the bitch and the diva's 
       already coming out.

284
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:56,442
            - Really?

285
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,110
   - You know, we're supposed   
 to adopt the same personality.

286
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,411
     I think it's happening     
           naturally.

287
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,179
        - Well, like I've       
     always said, you know,

288
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,847
  drag actually reveals your--

289
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,748
      I knew I was powerful     
            in drag.

290
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,150
      It didn't occur to me     
    that I could utilize that

291
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,117
   in other areas of my life.

292
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:10,586
    - So you telling me that    
   I'm co-hosting next season?

293
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,553
           - [laughs]

294
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:12,887
           - Fuck you,          
        Michelle Visage.

295
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,489
       We don't need you.       
             - Aah!

296
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,289
             Oh, no!

297
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,558
    - I know your girlfriend    
    is a big fan of the show.

298
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,425
  Is that why you're doing it?

299
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:22,660
      - No. I mean, before      
   I started working with you,

300
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,094
    I really kind of thought    
        that it was just

301
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:27,497
   a man dressed like a woman   
    and that kind of was it.

302
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:28,331
     But I'm starting to see

303
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,132
    all the different aspects   
       of drag or others,

304
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,733
       the comedic drags,

305
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,067
           and there's          
      like the runway drags

306
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,401
          and the fish.

307
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,435
              -Yes.             
    -That's a new one for me.

308
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,436
    That was new this season.   
            - Uh-huh.

309
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,638
 - There's no way I could say no
      to this opportunity.

310
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,407
   - Now, Alexis, you were in   
   the bottom three last week.

311
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,175
         - Yes. I don't         
     want to be there again,

312
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:46,244
   and I know that we're going  
  to put our best foot forward.

313
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,478
  - We're already a good team.

314
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,645
          - All right.          
        Get back to work.

315
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,980
            -Will do.           
           -Thank you.

316
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,215
       - Well, well, well.

317
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,382
        Duncan and Sasha.

318
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:57,451
      Now, you're cinched.      
       How does that feel?

319
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:59,019
        - Feels good, Ru.

320
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,754
          - [all laugh]

321
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:01,855
       - She's a natural.

322
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,022
      - Now, you have a boy     
           and a girl.

323
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:04,056
         I've met them.         
         They're lovely.

324
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,858
   What's your family going to  
   think about daddy in drag?

325
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,460
        - I think my son        
   will probably have pointers

326
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,795
     on how I walk in heels.

327
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,529
        Since he was two,

328
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,998
    he loves clomping around    
       in my wife's, so...

329
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,165
      - It is so much fun.

330
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,801
        If I had a daddy        
      who was brave enough

331
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,537
      to use all the colors     
       in the crayon box,

332
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,306
      that would have been      
         life changing.

333
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,340
      So thank you so much.

334
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:28,275
   - I want to do RuPaul proud

335
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:30,110
    with my Duncan makeover.

336
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,412
         The two of them        
        have a great love

337
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:33,479
   and respect for each other,

338
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,914
     and so I really, really    
       cannot disappoint.

339
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,817
  - Now, Duncan, you have seen  
     the queens come and go

340
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:40,851
      for years and years.

341
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,019
           What advice          
      have you given Sasha?

342
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,754
      - To try and stay out     
        of your own head.

343
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:45,287
              - Mm.

344
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,189
        - We talked about       
 over-intellectualizing things,

345
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,425
   and that getting in the way  
       of just being free.

346
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:52,793
      - How do you do that?

347
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:53,927
            - Drugs.

348
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:57,163
   - You know, I'm pretty sure  
       this is going to be

349
00:12:57,165 --> 00:13:00,132
           my favorite          
    all-time challenge ever.

350
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,167
       -Can't wait, Sasha.      
          -I'm excited.

351
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:04,435
         - Turn it out.

352
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:08,238
     - Right. I know we both    
   have the same battle here.

353
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,906
           - Gorgeous.

354
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:11,507
       - Oh, my goodness.

355
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:14,309
        - Oh, hello, Ru.        
          How are you?

356
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:16,878
      - I am over the moon.

357
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,413
         Sarge, how long        
       have you been here?

358
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,181
        - Since Season 4.

359
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:22,115
   - You know, you and I joke.

360
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:25,251
   Sometimes I'll shoot a look  
          over to you,

361
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,418
    and there's an intellect

362
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,154
    and there's a fun energy    
      that comes from you.

363
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:31,556
    - I would agree with you    
            tenfold.

364
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,158
       I definitely caught      
       a really open vibe

365
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,059
     from Sarge right away.

366
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:38,661
     - Yeah. I've never seen    
      any sort of judgment

367
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,029
      about our girls here.

368
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:40,963
        - No, no, no, no.       
         Absolutely not.

369
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,564
         I never thought        
     before doing this show

370
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:45,934
  I would have as much respect  
    for drag queens as I do.

371
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:47,635
            I'm just            
      absolutely flattered

372
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:50,938
     to be able to document     
     those life experiences.

373
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
     - Now, how did you get     
         the name Sarge?

374
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,474
       - I was a sergeant       
          in the army.

375
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:56,309
        - Well, if you've       
    been through all of that,

376
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:58,744
           doing drag           
       is a piece of cake.

377
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,178
             -Uh-uh.            
              -No?

378
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,779
            - Huh-uh.           
           [all laugh]

379
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,313
    I'm scared shitless, Ru.

380
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:04,647
   - I think you'll be great.

381
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,982
         But, you know,         
    we're in the home stretch

382
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:07,916
      of this competition.

383
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:08,750
      Gotta bring it, mama.

384
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,118
   - I'm gonna bring it hard,   
              girl.

385
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
             - Okay.            
     I can't wait to see it.

386
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,421
   - I can't wait to show you.

387
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,356
          - Say it with         
   a little more sass, honey.

388
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,591
      - Girl, I cannot wait     
          to show you.

389
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:18,725
           [all laugh]

390
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:21,694
    -I can't wait to see it.    
             -Okay.

391
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:24,163
          -How'd I do?          
 -You did great. You did great.

392
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,631
         She's into you.

393
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:28,300
      - All right, ladies,      
          gather round.

394
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,067
      Gather round, ladies.

395
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:33,905
   Now, tomorrow, in addition   
  to your runway presentation,

396
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,507
        you and your new        
         sisters in drag

397
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,377
         need to prepare        
     a lip sync performance

398
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,413
    to my song "Click Clack."

399
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,282
     [screams and laughter]

400
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,351
      So don't fuck it up.

401
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,221
         - Oh, Trinity,         
        I didn't realize

402
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,456
      that you were serving     
      some shrimp cocktail

403
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,623
       with your makeover.      
          That's cute.

404
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,758
        - You worry about       
     your man's feet, okay?

405
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,726
      You don't worry about     
     our man's feet, honey.

406
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:02,361
        - One could wear,       
         like, overalls,

407
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,563
     and then I could have,     
         like, a hoodie.

408
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,731
   It shouldn't be that hard.

409
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:12,803
       - Nina wants to sew      
 two whole outfits from scratch,

410
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,371
            and Nina            
     don't know how to sew.

411
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,973
   Hey, I'm all for ambition,

412
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:20,776
     but ambition is nothing    
       without execution.

413
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,511
        - Ah, here we go.

414
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,580
        Yeah, I'm having        
        a hard time here.

415
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:29,250
    - Oh, I just hope we can    
    execute this right, man.

416
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,252
       Don't curse me out.

417
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,854
         No, I'm sorry.         
      No, I apologize, no.

418
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:37,590
     If you can just show me    
   how to thread the machine,

419
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:38,924
      then I'm good, y'all.     
             - Okay.

420
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:42,060
     Even though me and Nina    
         had our moment,

421
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,361
     I still feel for Nina,

422
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:46,731
       so I'm here to help      
        as much as I can.

423
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,999
     But I got to help Josh.

424
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,835
       - Let me watch this      
           completely.

425
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,637
           - And then           
      you just hit the gas,

426
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,838
   and it'll spin the bobbin.

427
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,206
         - Oh, I got it.        
           Thank you.

428
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,440
        Okay, here we go.

429
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,207
     - This is the top six.

430
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,642
      This is not the time      
      to learn how to sew,

431
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,945
  especially when you're having 
   to make two of everything.

432
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,579
       - Am I even on it?

433
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:07,780
            Oh, shit.

434
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,915
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

435
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,083
            - [sighs]           
        Fuck, this hurts.

436
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:15,453
          - What the--          
      Get the--out of here.

437
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:16,353
           - [laughs]

438
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:18,555
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

439
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,890
         [RuPaul laughs]

440
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,925
          - Yes. Work.

441
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,960
   - I'm just gonna tighten it  
         one more time.

442
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:26,927
             - Okay.

443
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,429
          -Oh, my God.          
     -Hold on tight, Sarge.

444
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,730
  Our maxi challenge this week

445
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:34,767
         is to make over        
    the crew of "Drag Race."

446
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,835
           - [groans]

447
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,007
         - That's great.        
 You're walking like Pearl now.

448
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,776
         That's perfect.        
         He looks stoned

449
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:47,511
      and very fashionable.

450
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:49,679
      I was a little scared     
            of Duncan

451
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:52,415
      'cause he's so strict     
            with us.

452
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,351
           But Duncan           
     is feeling the fantasy.

453
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,920
            - Mm-hmm.

454
00:16:57,922 --> 00:16:59,688
       - Oh, my goodness.

455
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,222
   Look at those little shoes.

456
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,390
   These are real drag heels.   
            [laughs]

457
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,458
   - Oh, yeah, Sarge? Uh-huh?

458
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,261
 - Mommy's taking you to church 
       for the first time?

459
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:10,061
        Working with him,

460
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,197
        it's amazing how        
   I'm not in my head at all.

461
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,133
   I haven't had this much fun  
      or felt this relaxed.

462
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,468
         - Whoo-hoo-hoo!        
  It's like The Little Mermaid.

463
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,136
    -It's The Little Mermaid.   
            -Exactly.

464
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,537
  - Except she was a big dude.

465
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,704
           [all laugh]

466
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:25,006
      - See, that was good.     
         That was shade.

467
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:28,109
             - Okay.            
           [all laugh]

468
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,477
          - So you got          
        your foot pedal.

469
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,612
        - But this needs        
          to come down.

470
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:35,081
         - That's, uh...        
          I don't know.

471
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,249
       Does the foot pedal      
      bring it down or no?

472
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,317
   - Yeah, this thing is like   
      jammed or something.

473
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,686
     -Do you wanna ask the--    
      -I can't ask anybody.

474
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:45,489
  It's like everybody's so into 
   their own thing right now.

475
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,058
   - I don't know what to say,  
          to be honest.

476
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,893
             We used            
     all our lifelines here.

477
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:50,827
            - Right.            
           - For help.

478
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,129
    - Now it's kind of like,    
   bitch, you're on your own.

479
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,964
  Aaron didn't feel confident,

480
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,999
         and it finally         
         got to a point

481
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,066
        where I was like,       
         you know what?

482
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,534
     This ain't gonna work.     
     It's not going to work.

483
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,302
      So we need to change      
          our outfits.

484
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:05,072
       It's sad. I thought      
 I was finally sewing something.

485
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,774
     - This is gonna be fun     
            for you.

486
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,376
       - Yeah, The reason       
  I particularly was doing this

487
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,578
           was because          
    I've never really agreed

488
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,846
     with how we've divided     
          men and women

489
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,814
          when it comes         
        to what's strong.

490
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,149
         So to me, like,        
    this is very encouraging

491
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:21,985
    to anyone who doesn't fit   
     in that specific mold.

492
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,419
             -Right.            
     -I know what it's like

493
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:26,922
   to kind of not particularly  
       fit the jock mold.

494
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:30,625
   That to me is not what I've  
  placed value of strength in.

495
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:33,260
  It's like beauty and strength 
     are kind of synonymous,

496
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,629
           and I think          
    you need to be surrounded

497
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,697
           by numerous          
    different walks of life.

498
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,066
       Otherwise you just       
      will never understand

499
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,500
         certain aspects        
         of this world.

500
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:42,100
           - Exactly.

501
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:45,770
    I'm definitely surprised    
     by talking with Rizzo.

502
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:46,437
      I feel the same way.

503
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,239
       Being a human being      
         is so much more

504
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,442
    than being put into a box   
           or a label.

   is what's keeping you down   
          is yourself.

00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:22,383
      - I love the dresses,

752
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:23,884
    like, kind of old school    
         Hollywood glam.

753
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,286
     - But there's something    
 about this attention to detail

754
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,856
   and about paying attention   
         to your sister.

755
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:33,259
  - Bae, when she turns around, 
   you could see her hairline.

756
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:35,661
         Her bra straps         
    are hanging out the back.

757
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:38,296
     It felt like, you know,    
     there's the star sister

758
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:39,864
        and then there's        
        the other sister.

759
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,565
          - Oh. I hate          
      that it came across,

760
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:44,200
         like, you know,        
    Bae was an afterthought.

761
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,402
         - I think Shea         
        did a great job.

762
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:47,770
   I'm proud to be her sister.

763
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:48,370
              -Aw.              
              -Aw.

764
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:53,908
   - Up next, Alexis Michelle   
     and Rye Anne Stardust.

765
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,944
    - Your brows are glitter.   
     That's fucking awesome.

766
00:28:56,946 --> 00:29:01,415
       - The nails scream       
          I am a slut.

767
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,283
     - Big voluptuous slut.

768
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:07,086
        - But the outfits       
     are kind of real basic.

769
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,353
     - It feels a little bit

770
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:11,155
         like a Ricky's         
   Halloween costume in a bag.

771
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,490
          - Look, we're         
      intergalactic whores.

772
00:29:13,492 --> 00:29:15,191
     Can we have some candy,    
            you know?

773
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:17,893
      Look how close we are     
        to the end here.

774
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:20,462
   It's time to really dig in.

775
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:25,633
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown 
           Faye Bakker

776
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:28,235
    and Ariana Bo'nina Brown.

777
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:31,071
     - Well, I love animals,    
  so I think it's really cute.

778
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:33,506
           [all laugh]          
          I really do.

779
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:36,742
    - Now, was it challenging   
 doing this drag transformation

780
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:38,076
           in front of          
        your co-workers?

781
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,811
         - No. In fact,         
    the teams were so sweet,

782
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,546
     and the art department,    
      they made little tags

783
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:44,282
      that said Team Aaron,     
   you know what I mean? So...

784
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,116
              -Aw.              
              -Aw.

785
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:45,950
      - Well, we always say

786
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,218
  a family that drags together, 
         slays together.

787
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,255
     - But this is kind of,     
   you know, a letdown for me.

788
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:55,659
 It's you out here in a leotard 
      with thigh-high boots

789
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,028
      and not really doing      
      anything innovative.

790
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,230
         I was screaming        
     for a little cottontail

791
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,898
    or a little colored glove   
          or something

792
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,065
   just to bring this to this

793
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,233
         so there wasn't        
     such a disconnect here.

794
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,901
        - And then, with        
      the performance, too,

795
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,836
   I thought was a little bit   
         underwhelming.

796
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:10,838
  - I'm so excited by what you  
bring to this competition, Nina,

797
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,507
         but I need you         
      to bring it at a 10.

798
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:19,446
     - Up next, Sasha Velour    
      and Dunatella Velour.

799
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,614
          - This looks          
        so high fashion.

800
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:23,415
          It looks like         
        Miu Miu on acid.

801
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,583
  - The proportion of the dress 
          and the coat

802
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,419
  and all these pops of color,  
   I really, really loved it.

803
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:32,256
   - Now, Dunatella, there is   
   something that you're doing

804
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:35,826
        that's strangely        
         turning me on.

805
00:30:35,828 --> 00:30:38,195
         - I learned it         
    from watching you, dear.

806
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:39,162
           [all laugh]

807
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:43,432
      - Up next, Peppermint     
        and Winter Green.

808
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:44,900
            Gorgeous.

809
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:46,735
            - I know.

810
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,236
           [all laugh]

811
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:50,605
    - Winter Green, your face

812
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:51,739
       is just really fun       
           to look at.

813
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:54,341
      You're just so funny.     
        I don't know why.

814
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:57,644
  But you're, like, beautiful,  
    but, like, you make me--

815
00:30:57,646 --> 00:31:01,414
 but, like, you're beautiful... 
           [all laugh]

816
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,449
       - What is it, dear?

817
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:06,084
           [all laugh]

818
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:07,885
       - Let me roll back.

819
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:09,586
        You just look...        
            - Go on.

820
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:13,723
           [all laugh]

821
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,292
         - I just can't.

822
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:19,295
        - But the outfits       
       clash so horribly,

823
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:22,331
    I don't even want to look   
   at them in the same frame.

824
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,699
        - But guess what?

825
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:26,034
      I don't care because      
    you were so fun to watch.

826
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:27,935
        - And Peppermint,       
 you should thank Winter Green,

827
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:30,270
     because she was the one    
     who pulled you through.

828
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:34,073
   - Now, Winter Green, do you  
think you'll ever do drag again?

829
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:36,708
          - Who knows?          
           Season 10?

830
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,809
           [all laugh]

831
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,677
         - "All Stars."

832
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,312
       Thank you, ladies.

833
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,547
         And to my crew         
       standing on stage,

834
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,516
     to see you men do this,

835
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:51,486
   it says that we as a people  
       are moving forward,

836
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:52,553
       and it's beautiful.

837
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:56,557
         Thank you from         
     the bottom of my heart.

838
00:31:56,992 --> 00:32:01,361
      Now, while you ladies     
        untuck backstage,

839
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:02,995
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

840
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:04,563
       [car engine starts]      
           All right.

841
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:08,733
   So just between us squirrel  
   friends, what do you think?

842
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:11,602
         Trinity Taylor         
       and Glittafa Dayz.

843
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:14,838
       - They had the most      
    incredible choreography.

844
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,406
         The whole look,        
         the attitudes,

845
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:19,275
         like, I bought         
  everything they had to sell.

846
00:32:19,277 --> 00:32:21,610
    - It was just so apparent   
      that their connection

847
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:23,979
   was, like, on another level  
      than anybody else's.

848
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:27,215
  - Yeah, and you know, Zaldy,  
   Trinity is a real showgirl,

849
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:30,284
     so to teach her sister     
          that routine

850
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:33,153
 and for her to hit it so hard, 
        very impressive.

851
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:34,754
      - In those heels, Ru.

852
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,322
        - In those heels.

853
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:38,290
      Shea and Bae Coulee.

854
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,325
      - Shea kind of failed     
         for me tonight.

855
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:42,560
    She let her sister down.

856
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:43,327
      - In Shea's defense,

857
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,062
    I felt like she did come    
       to her sister's aid

858
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,564
    when she saw the problems   
            going on.

859
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,631
          And I thought         
      she looked beautiful.

860
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,233
      - Shea has wowed us.      
   Tonight, that was not wow.

861
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,503
  - But is what Shea did reason 
enough to put her in the bottom?

862
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:56,770
          -Not for me.          
       -To me, yes, 100%.

863
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:57,537
          -Not for you?         
              -No.

864
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,238
   - Not to me. I didn't think  
     her look was the worst.

865
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,007
I didn't think their performance
         was the worst.

866
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:04,309
       I would put Alexis.

867
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:04,909
            - Not me.

868
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,976
    - That's who I would put    
         in the bottom.

869
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:07,277
          - All right.          
     Let's talk about Alexis

870
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,013
     and Rye Anne Stardust.

871
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:12,448
        - Something about       
      how unfresh this was.

872
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,017
     It was hard for me to,     
     like, really enjoy it.

873
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:17,452
       - Though it was not      
        my favorite look,

874
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,054
       it was meticulously

    a little more interested

      brought to the table

877
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:24,958
     than I was with Alexis.

878
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,559
            - Really?           
       Shea's was sloppy.

879
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:28,327
    This one was not sloppy.

880

882
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:33,097
      - I feel like Alexis      
          and Rye Anne,

883
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,399
     even if you don't like     
         the aesthetic,

884
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:39,069
but I do find them more original
     than just frumpy gowns.

885
00:33:39,071 --> 00:33:43,139
      - Thank you. Tonight,     
   toilet paper, paper towel.

886
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:44,039
      - [laughs] All right.

887
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:49,844
So let's move on to Nina Bo'nina
  Brown Tyler Moore and Ariana.

888
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:53,881
   - That bunny had absolutely  
  no connection with the rest.

889
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,383
     And we've been getting     
       the same silhouette

890
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:58,752
         with a bodysuit        
      and thigh-high boots.

891
00:33:58,754 --> 00:33:59,853
        I'm done with it.       
             - Yeah.

892
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:03,323
       Even the bunny part      
   was just sort of half done.

893
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:04,590
     - And, like, the ears,

894
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,358
         it looked like         
     they'd been rained on.

895
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,327
   - It's more arts and crafts  
      than it is Comic-Con.

         - Sasha Velour         
      and Dunatella Velour.

897
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,764
       - I really enjoyed       
         the connection

898
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:14,664
    between the two of them.

899
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:18,734
        And are her looks       
    always so modern-feeling?

900
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:19,534
      - She's very fashion.

901
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:21,769
            - Because           
    it really worked for me.

902
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,370
    - She's been so serious,    
       but she looked like

903
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:26,106
         she was really         
   enjoying herself this week.

             -Yeah.

905
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,074
        - I'm super proud       
        of Sasha tonight.

906
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:31,676
          - Peppermint          
        and Winter Green.

907
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:33,411
   - I think we can all agree   
             tonight

908
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:36,313
        that Winter Green       
          gets the MVP.

       She's a superstar.

00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:39,749
         From the minute        
       she came out here,

912
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:40,416
          I bought it.

913
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,786
  The only think I did not buy  
       was those outfits.

914
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:44,787
      - So hard to look at.

915
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,357
 Just the choice in the fabrics,
     they felt so disparate.

916
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,727
 - Peppermint better be kissing 
      Winter Green's feet.

917
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:54,262
             Because            
     if it weren't for her,

918
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,364
     I could see Peppermint     
    in the bottom this week.

00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:58,699
