        I scarcely know         
         what happened.

   why is she fucking green?

     She's somewhere else.

       You've been quiet.

00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,196
  - Honestly, I did feel like

56
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:10,398
          some people           
 were coming for me, you know.

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,566
 - Did someone say that to you  
    or is this stuff that--

58
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,769
    - No, I can hear stuff.

59
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:19,372
  I could've swore I've heard   
certain girls kind of talking--

60
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,540
  not saying my name, per se,

61
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,875
   but I feel like they were    
   kind of talking about me.

00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,876
         I'm not trying         
         to make it up.

63
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,043
  - So you're saying you know

64
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,377
    that people are talking     
    about you to each other.

65
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,246
     - A little bit, yeah.      
             Yeah.

66
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,015
 - Nina thinks that everyone's  
        out to get her.

67
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,617
  I think she thinks it's some  
   kind of a drag conspiracy,

68
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,585
    and it's just not true.

  - I'm just taking things in.

     starting to withdraw.

        I don't want you        
      to go back to that.

72
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,826
      - Nina needs to call      
         Patti LaBelle,

00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:49,627
        'cause she needs

       I was going to go

133
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,603
   and make a bee line toward   
  the other side of the room,

134
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,870
       but turned around

135
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:14,805
and there was two lovely ladies 
      walking towards me,

136
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:18,475
     so I couldn't really,      
           like, run.

137
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:21,478
        - Y'all love me         
  and you think I'm creative,

138
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,013
      but you ran past me       
 to the next person. All right.

139
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,214
            - Yeah?

140
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:26,448
          Okay, yeah.

141
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,484
    - They were like, okay,     
    I guess we're teammates.

142
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:33,921
    - Now, whatever you do,     
      make your charisma,

143
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:37,491
  uniqueness, nerve and talent  
         binge-worthy.

144
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:40,560
          So good luck          
     and don't fuck it up.

145
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:43,763
           [applause]

146
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,464
    - So cops is an option.

147
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,399
      What are some other,      
       like, situations?

148
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,700
            - Spies.

149
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:50,368
       - Is now the time        
    for the Russian accent?

150
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,371
          [both laugh]          
        - That's right.

151
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:56,640
     - I finally get to do      
      a Russian character.

152
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,141
        I'm so excited.

153
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,408
     [Russian accent] Like,     
    I hacked into the villa.

154
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,309
          [both laugh]

155
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:03,678
    I hacked into Versace's     
       spring collection.

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,347
 - Does anybody have any ideas  
       right off the bat?

157
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,748
         - I have one.

158
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,618
  So my idea is, I think there  
  should be two church ladies.

159
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,119
       Each of your sons        
     just came out as gay.

160
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,520
        And then a nun.

161
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:16,921
         I think a nun          
     would be really funny.

162
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,389
         - I like that.

163
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,091
       - We're aiming for       
   something very religious,

164
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:22,225
     but with a gay twist.

165
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:25,061
         - This summer,         
     two mothers, two sons,

166
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,762
        one holy secret.

167
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:27,963
        - That's great.

168
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:29,331
  Look, girls, you know what?

169
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,999
   This is going to be easier   
  to spread out on the table.

170
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:32,200
             -Okay.             
     -Let's do it up here.

171
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:34,669
     - I really would like      
     to do the voiceovers.

172
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,637
             -Okay.             
   -Um, I know that normally

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
        there's only one        
        voiceover voice.

174
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,707
   I would love if there was    
     a way to split it up,

175
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,143
just because I feel like I have 
a lot to prove after last week.

176
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,044
 - I think it needs to be clear 
        who's speaking.

177
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:47,712
     It would be confusing      
            to them.

178
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,383
        - I would rather        
   one of you two just do it.

179
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,753
 So flip a coin or one of y'all 
   just, you know, step back

180
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,054
  and let the other one do it.

181
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,890
     - I know for sure that     
    I really want to do it,

182
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,058
    but I don't want to have    
    a fight with Peppermint.

183
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,993
 - Can we just read through it  
        a couple times?

184
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,194
            - Yeah,             
    we need a read-through.

185
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,397
        - So now Alexis         
   wants to do the voiceover.

186
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,866
       Mm-mm. She's gonna       
     have to pry this part

187
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:15,170
      from my cold, dead,       
        manicured hands.

188
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:17,671
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

189
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:19,305
  - Where are the Espadrilles?

190
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,939
          -[chuckles]           
           -Children!

191
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,941
       - Beat me, bitch.

192
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,475
          [both laugh]

193
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,477
           - [coughs]

194
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,179
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

195
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,886
- "If you could create your own 
hit TV show, what would it be?"

196
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,420
        For this week's         
        maxi challenge,

197
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,655
          we're making          
       our own TV shows.

198
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:44,191
       I'm not not happy        
that I have to write something.

199
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:47,294
     It's just I feel like      
        I have to prove

200
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,428
      that I have a talent

201
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,863
     that I might not know      
       that I might have,

202
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,965
        but I hope I do.

203
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,834
   - Okay, so what can we do?   
             Okay.

204
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,537
    - Maybe we work together    
         in an office.

205
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:07,341
    - Okay. It could be like    
some kind of like "Maury" show,

206
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:09,710
     like who's baby is it      
         or something.

207
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,244
         I don't know.

208
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:13,879
      - Nina and Valentina      
    have ended up together,

209
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,816
           and I say            
      recipe for disaster.

210
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:20,885
  - We have to know our lines.

211
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:22,119
     - That's gonna be easy     
       because we can go

212
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,687
      based off of improv       
    in the moment, you know.

213
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:24,854
        - We can adlib,         
       yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,689
       - I think we have        
       a great chemistry,

215
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,191
     and I know the judges      
      personally love us.

216
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,726
   So I think that's gonna be   
        to our benefit.

217
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,196
   - So you come and join me    
  over here on the dark side.

218
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,965
 Is it just to work next to me  
  'cause you love me so much?

219
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,534
   - That's about half of it.

220
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,602
          I'm just not          
        feeling too good

221
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:47,072
  about, like, my relationship  
      with Nina right now.

222
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,973
   - You two were very tense    
           last week.

223
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,276
      - Yeah. My feelings       
     were just really hurt.

224
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,778
    - Some girls here think,    
    oh, she's not original.

225
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,213
   Oh, she's not being funny,   
            she's--

226
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:58,948
   -Who is saying that, Nina?   
             -You.

227
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,516
         - What, bitch?         
     No, I never said that.

228
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:01,683
         -Yes, you did.         
     -When did I say that?

229
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,084
        - You've said it        
        more than once.

230
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,052
   - I wasn't even trying to    
   throw any of that your way

231
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:06,086
      'cause I don't play       
     those games with you.

232
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,821
         I have always          
      looked out for you.

233
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,256
  I have always built you up.   
      I have defended you.

234
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,824
         So it actually         
   really hurts my feelings,

235
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:12,925
             'cause             
      that's not who I am,

236
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,526
   and I've never done that.

237
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:19,063
   This morning, I felt like

238
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:22,132
  she was even more cold to me  
      and, like, distant.

239
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,901
     And I was just, like,      
      I think I just need

240
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:26,135
     to just kind of, like,     
  distance myself a little bit

241
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:28,937
   so I can concentrate more    
      on the competition.

242
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,206
The energy that she's giving me 
     is just really whack,

243
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,309
     and I've just kind of      
       reached my limit.

244
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,476
           I'm done.

245
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,413
         - Why, hello.

246
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,747
              -Hi.              
         -Well, hello.

247
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,348
           - Welcome,           
       ladies and sister.

248
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,317
    - It's time for my team     
     to shoot our TV pilot.

249
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,752
  I actually feel pretty good   
       about our chances.

250
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:52,287
          We're pros,           
         we look great,

251
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,257
     and Alexis looks like      
Kathleen mother fucking Turner.

252
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,125
   - You've got the pit crew    
            to use,

253
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,693
 and you can use whatever props 
     and furniture you need

254
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:02,127
        from 204 Events.

255
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,928
         - Let's start          
       with the voiceover

256
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,062
      so we can get those       
        out of the way.

257
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,396
    Does that work for you?     
       - Great. Perfect.

258
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,499
         Trinity Taylor         
     as Sister Mary Koont,

259
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,901
     "Mary, Mother Of Gay."

260
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,237
        - Cut. How about        
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay?"

261
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:19,973
        - Trinity Taylor        
      as Sister Mary Koont

262
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:23,142
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay."

263
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,043
    -That was pretty great.     
          -Thank you.

264
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,477
    - Did you all get the T     
           on Koont?

265
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,681
   - We did the time before.

266
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:33,382
          -Okay, cool.          
             -Yeah.

267
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,783
         - You probably         
        want to move on.

268
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,518
        - Next scene is

269
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,188
 we are in the sister's office  
         in the church.

270
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,556
     - Do it in the rectory     
          real quick?

271
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,624
           - [laughs]           
           The what?

272
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,226
      - If I had a nickel.      
          And action.

273
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,162
 - Your son is always listening 
    to Broadway show tunes.

274
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,130
        - Well, your son        
    is always baking cakes.

275
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:54,466
    - Alexis, your accent's     
 just a little bit too twangy.

276
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,668
    Where we're "bay a cay."

277
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,336
      You don't have to go      
         too hillbilly.

278
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,870
     - Yeah. A little more      
       Julia Sugarbaker?

279
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,572
          - Alexis has          
    a real opportunity here

280
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:06,709
         to go extreme          
   with this crazy character,

281
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,677
       and she's playing        
    this conservative lady.

282
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,979
     Really conservatively.

283
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,647
    - Your son bakes cakes.

284
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,916
    - Well, your son always     
  has something in his mouth.

285
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:18,418
      - Children, it's not      
     the end of the world.

286
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,419
  - Trinity, just bring it up.

287
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,087
  These are two loud bitches,

288
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,621
  so you gotta overpower them.

289
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,389
             -Okay.             
       -That is not my--

290
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,590
         -Mercy, Lord.          
           -Children!

291
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,991
           - [laughs]

292
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:31,060
   - Father Ross, his breath    
 always smells like dick, too.

293
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,361
           - [laughs]

294
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,895
            [coughs]

295
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:35,796
   - Can we say "dick" on TV?

296
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:38,165
     - Of course, you can.      
   "The Dick Van Dyke Show."

297
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,599
  - He said "dick" and "dyke."

298
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,800
            - Well.

299
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:41,801
- That's good family television 
          right there.

300
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,036
      - It is. Thank you.

301
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,537
        Welcome, ladies.

302
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,138
             -Hey.              
   -Tell us what's going on.

303
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,341
        - We're gonna do        
      a funky spy dramedy.

304
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,843
   - [Russian accent] And I'm   
  an ex-Commie Russian mommy.

305
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,046
   - I'm gonna be a Kung Fu,    
        fighting crime.

306
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,680
      - Are we doing like       
 a blaxploitation feeling here

307
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:01,282
     where things are like,     
           pow, boom?

308
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:02,616
       -Yes. Absolutely.        
             -Yeah.

309
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:04,784
      - Okay, let's start       
  with your voiceover. Action.

310
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,553
      - This unlikely duo       
   will have to work together

311
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:11,322
  to defeat the greatest evil   
          of all time.

312
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,291
         - Bad fashion.

313
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,559
      - Okay. I would love      
     for you to go for it.

314
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,994
        Be those voices.

315
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,296
          - It's like           
    the Moviefone recording.

316
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:22,297
             -Yeah.             
     -Welcome to Moviefone.

317
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,798
         - Yeah, yeah.

318
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,400
     - If you know the name     
of the movie you'd like to see,

319
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,034
         press one now.

320
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:30,002
           -Perfect.            
          -And action.

321
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,870
       - "Teets & Asky."

322
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,504
    - See you next Tuesday.

323
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,440
         - At midnight,         
         mother fucker.

324
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,707
           -[laughs]            
        -That was great.

325
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,209
  - Where are the Espadrilles?

326
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,512
        I said where are        
        the Espadrilles?

327
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,247
   Bitch, I'm talking to you!

328
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:48,183
       I said, where are        
        the Espadrilles?

329
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,617
     - [laughs and coughs]

330
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,418
          - Look good?          
          [all laugh]

331
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,552
      -That's perfection.       
    -That works. That works.

332
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,320
   - Good, good, good, good,    
           let's go.

333
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,488
     Tick-tock, tick-tock.      
        You don't stop.

334
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,656
    - Um, next up is Sunset?

335
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,157
             -Yes.              
            -Action.

336
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,958
     Friends forever, BFFs.

337
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,459
   Looks like Ernie and Bert.

338
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:04,726
              Oh.               
             - Oh.

339
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:07,028
       -This feels wrong.       
        -Really awkward.

340
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,864
         That's a wrap          
       on "Teets & Asky."

341
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,532
   Thanks for being prepared.

342
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,200
             -Whoo!             
             -Aah!

343
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:17,870
  - Valentina and Nina Bo'Nina  
      Brown Jessy Raphael.

344
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,137
       - What's the name        
          of the show?

345
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,404
        -"Nina & Tina."         
             -Okay.

346
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:21,772
  Do we have voiceovers to do?

347
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:23,640
        - We didn't get         
      to really finish it.

348
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,309
      But I can try to go       
          off my head.

349
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,877
    - Just go for it, okay?     
             Ready?

350
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,912
          And action.

351
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:35,249
      - Nina and Valentina      
       move to Hollywood.

352
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,184
         I mean, okay,          
     Nina and Tina, sorry.

353
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:38,952
-So is it Valentina or is it... 
        -No, it's Tina.

354
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:39,953
        Yeah, I'm sorry.        
    - Okay, okay, all right.

355
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,321
   You can do it again, baby.   
            - Sorry.

356
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:44,490
       Nina and Valentina       
      moved to Hollywood.

357
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,458
   - Is it Valentina or Tina?

358
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,692
            - Tina.

359
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,428
         - Soon after,          
       Nina and Valentina

360
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,397
     were finally released      
           from jail.

361
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,199
           - [snorts]

362
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,800
    What's your next scene,     
             girls?

363
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,468
       So talk us through       
  what you're doing right now.

364
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,236
          - All right.          
  So right now, she's in jail.

365
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,037
      We're gonna play off      
 of each other, just adlibbing.

366
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,639
    -Oh, you're gonna adlib?    
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:06,941
  - There's zero preparation.

368
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:09,176
       Ready and action.

369
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:12,279
             - Oh!

370
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,414
      - Girl, let's just--      
 we have so much time in here.

371
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:20,917
       We need to become        
          drag queens.

372
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,985
           - [laughs]

373
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,152
          Okay, okay.

374
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,887
     - We need to become...

375
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,689
         -Drag queens.          
         -Drag queens.

376
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,391
      - Do you think maybe      
  a script would have helped?

377
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:33,159
            - Yeah.

378
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,960
        - Okay. I think         
     we better keep moving.

379
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:36,061
       - Yeah, let's go.

380
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,796
   All right, talk us through   
        this next scene,

     it looks really messy.

it shouldn't be hard to do this.

    with the--this is her--

389

   - No, I think we should do   
        our own makeup.

390
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,778
  Should we do our own makeup   
 or should we do each other's?

391
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,912
   - What do you want to do?

392
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,480
     - I think each other,      
        but it's on you.

393
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,914
         - Should we do         
      each other's makeup?

394
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,448
     - Yeah, it'll be fine,     
            I think.

395
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,449

           you ready?

396
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,317

         really quick.

       to take them off?

399
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:10,788

     we're doing a makeup.

         -Interesting.

         - Shady bitch.

443
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,360

     the back of your head?

00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:50,494
            - Yeah.

445
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:51,928

        her whole head.

446
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,296
   - I contour my head, too,

        when I'm doing,

   - What does it do, though?

449

 You're like, my head's so big, 
     I need to contour it.

450
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,201
     - Ooh! Good one, girl.

451
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,436
         - I don't have         
      that much experience

452
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,037

453
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,272
         but I will say         
       I'm super excited.

454
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:08,906
- Have you done a Club Kid look 
        before, Trinity?

455
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,374
  - I've never really done it

  because I don't want people   
  to, like, laugh at me for--

00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:15,077
    Oh, well, that was cute.

458
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,380
  Club Kid drag is completely   
    outside my comfort zone,

459
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:21,683
          so I wanted           
    to just be over the top.

460
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:25,520
- In the nineties, the Club Kids
     changed drag forever.

461
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,322
   They had an influence on,    
   like, every type of drag.

462
00:17:28,324 --> 00:17:29,690
   Beauty drag, pageant drag,

463
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,160
   it all has, I think, felt    
  the legacy of the Club Kids.

464
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,928
       - Yeah, for sure.

465
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,096
    - It was an underground     
         party culture

466
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,799
     that really pushed the     
boundaries of queer aesthetics.

467
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:43,668
   It didn't just shift drag.   
      It shifted fashion.

468
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,269
      - I remember seeing       
         the Club Kids

469
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,137

      daytime talk shows,

470
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,472
          like Geraldo          
     and Sally Jessy, yeah.

471
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:52,975
- All of them, James St. James, 
         Amanda Lepore.

472
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,476
     - And Susanne Bartsch.

473
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:56,878
     He wasn't exactly part     
  of the core New York scene,

474
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,147
 but Leigh Bowery is very much  
  the spirit of the Club Kids.

475
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:03,250
          - Club Kids           
   have influenced drag today

476
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:06,419
        in going beyond         
      female impersonation

becoming a piece of moving art.

   -Oh, my God, on your face?

00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,462
          [all laugh]

766
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,164
- Everything about it rings true
      to Club Kid for me.

767
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,065
           I love it.           
        It's super fun.

768
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,167
        Let's talk about        
         Sister Koont.

769
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:49,168
        You went for it.

770
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,936
          - Children!

771
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:53,004
       - And you ended up       
    being the scene stealer.

772
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,538
     - You took directions      
        so beautifully,

773
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,439
     and the moment we said     
       go bigger with it,

774
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:59,542
        you embraced it         
  and you were the comedy gold

775
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:01,110
   of "Mary, Mother of Gay."

776
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:02,177
       Really well done.

777
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:03,378
      - Thank you so much.

778
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,347
           - Up next,           
     hard candy Peppermint.

779
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:09,916
- I'll never forget who you are 
    because of your outfit.

780
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,150
       It's so on brand.

781
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,951
        - This is really        
      bringing back, like,

782
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:14,652
    The Tunnel and Club USA     
  and all those great places.

783
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:15,753
          - Thank you.

784
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:17,454
            - I like            
    that it's over the top.

785
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:19,989
  - She could also leave here   
 and go to "Let's Make A Deal."

786
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:23,158
       What I loved about       
     "Mary, Mother of Gay"

787
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,261
    was that it was totally     
      actual sitcom beats.

788
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,295
             Like,              
    when they said the name

789
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:28,362
         and you looked         
      at the camera like.

790
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,529
    You did the voiceovers.

791
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,097
    You committed completely    
         to your role.

792
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,165
       I thought you did        
       a really good job.

793
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,234
          -Thank you.           
   -Up next, Alexis Michelle.

794
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,635
             - Hi.

795
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,503
    - Tonight on the runway,    
     not my favorite look.

796
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:42,572
     It is a body stocking      
       with a corset on.

797
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:44,907
       This is beautiful,       
     your hair and makeup.

798
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,275
          -Thank you.           
     -It's just almost like

799
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:48,443
     it doesn't make sense      
  with the rest of the outfit.

800
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:49,877
  They're two different looks.

801
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:51,678
    - In terms of the pilot,

802
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,947
 your performance, for me, did  
sort of get lost in the shuffle.

803
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:56,648
     - Maybe your character     
       didn't pop as much

804
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,684
      because you took on       
  a lot of the producer role.

805
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,854
   - I want to say something,   
and I don't intend by any means

806
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:06,990
     to throw my beautiful      
   teammates under for this.

807
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:11,260
      But I do think that       
   a lot of the organization

808
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,696
    and, frankly, the clever    
    wordplay and the writing

809
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,464
    I do think came from me.

810
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:19,934
    In trying to keep things    
     running and organized,

811
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:23,803
  I may have taken a back seat  
 in the size of my performance.

812
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:25,604
      - I have to speak up      
           right now.

813
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,872
  The way that this discussion  
         is going down,

814
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:31,942
     it sounds like Alexis      
 was the producer of our pilot.

815
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,510
     That is not the case.

816
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:34,944
          You were not          
       the only person--

817
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:36,312
  - I didn't mean to say that.

818
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,646
           - That was           
      writing things down.

819
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:40,515
   The three of us did put in   
   a balanced amount of work.

820
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:43,417
  - I also felt that there was  
  a little bit of me, me, me.

821
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,319
 Peppermint felt very strongly  
   about doing the voiceover.

822
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:50,422
     - Okay. I did say that     
 I wanted to do the voiceover,

823
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:53,458
    but you could have said,    
     before we go to shoot,

824
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,592
  let's talk about this again.

825
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:57,227
        - It wasn't much        
        of a discussion.

826
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,062
  It felt like it was claimed.

827
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,264
        - I want to say         
       one thing as well.

828
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:04,933
   As a team, all three of us   
put in the same amount of work.

829
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:06,267
    It was all of our ideas.

830
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:07,601
  - And please let me repeat,

831
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:10,604
 I was not trying to throw you  
     under, either of you.

832
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:13,206
        But in focusing         
       on administration,

833
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:18,444
     my performance was not     
 the same size as my co-stars.

834
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:20,745
      - Thank you, ladies.

835
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,747
      We've heard enough.

836
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:25,549
  While you untuck backstage,

837
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:28,652
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

838
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:32,855
  All right, now, just between  
       us network execs,

839
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:35,424
          let's start           
      with "Nina & Tina."

840
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:39,127
- This was a difficult challenge
     for Nina and Valentina

841
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:40,962
            because             
    it was very structured,

842
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:43,397
     and I don't feel like      
they're very structured people.

843
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,631
      - They were spinning      
    their wheels in the mud.

844
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:45,999
    They were going nowhere,

845
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,400
         and they were          
      going nowhere fast.

846
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,869
   However, could I sit there   
 and watch them do it forever?

847
00:33:49,871 --> 00:33:51,170
             - Aah!

848
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:53,372
          -Absolutely.          
             -Sure.

849
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:55,374
       - I mean, this is        
     a Night at the Improv

850
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:57,342
    you don't want to miss.

851
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,344
 - I'm just really disappointed 
         with these two

852
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:02,080
        because there's         
      so much comedy gold

853
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,650
that could be made into a sitcom
   with these two characters.

854
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,785
  This week on "Nina & Tina,"

855
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:10,821
       the old prostitute       
        from Chattanooga

856
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:13,890
   teaches the girls a lesson   
   about hot water cornbread.

857
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:14,924
   Michelle, write this down.

858
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:15,925
          I think this          
     is a really good idea.

859
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:17,393
      -I got it, I got it.      
          -Yeah, good.

860
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,261
        Trinity Taylor.

861
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,829
          - As far as           
       Sister Mary Koont,

862
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:24,632
    she went for it balls to    
  the wall and she delivered.

863
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:26,333
   Tonight was a great night    
          for Trinity.

864
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,368
     - Although I do think

865
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,336
        that she really         
     committed to the part,

866
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,104
    the pilot that they did     
     is my least favorite.

867
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:35,340
    - Listen, it was cliché     
     and not that original.

868
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:37,041
       I think the show's       
      gonna be a big hit.

869
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,275
          [all laugh]

870
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,442
          Peppermint.

871
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,378
     - Everything that you      
    need to do in a sitcom,

872
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,113
       I think Peppermint       
           delivered.

873
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,814
   - And she really nailed it   
       in the voiceover.

874
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:45,815
         -That's true.          
     -Because that's really

875
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,551
          set the tone          
      for the whole piece.

876
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,486
             -Yeah.             
       -Alexis Michelle.

877
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,022
    - She was very prepared,    
        knew her lines.

878
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:59,093
 - I don't like that she turned 
  on her teammates like that.

879
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:00,894
       - I just feel like       
     she was making excuses

880
00:35:00,896 --> 00:35:03,062
    for why her performance     
       didn't pop for us.

881
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:04,363
     At the end of the day,

882
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:05,964
 you just have to be memorable  
      in the presentation,

883
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,198
        and she wasn't.

884
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,166
          [clap, clap]          
           - Silence.

885
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:12,068
     I've made my decision.

886
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,837
      Bring back my girls.

887
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,905
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

888
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:22,908
    - Welcome back, ladies.

889
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,044
   I've made some decisions.

890
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:29,614
  Peppermint, Trinity Taylor,

891
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:34,185
 your performances were crass,  
       crude and clichéd.

892
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,021
       You're both safe.

893
