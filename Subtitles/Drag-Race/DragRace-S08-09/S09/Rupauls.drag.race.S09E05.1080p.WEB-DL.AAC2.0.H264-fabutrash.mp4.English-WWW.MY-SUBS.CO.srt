00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,475
- Whoo, that was intense.

2
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:10,676
- That was something.

3
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,244
- Oh, look.
- [laughs]

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,746
- Damn, she didn't waste
no time.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,349
- I'm relieved I have
survived this lip sync.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,116
The only thing is,

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,285
I wonder why Charlie
didn't really put up a fight.

8
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:23,819
- She threw the towel in.

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,720
She just gave up.

10
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,488
- Yeah, she gave the fuck up.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,856
- There was no effort.

12
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:30,123
- Part of this competition

13
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,824
is knowing that
there's potential

14
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,293
that you're gonna lip sync,
and that is part of it.

15
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,561
- We all learn those songs
every single time.

16
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:37,762
- Right.
- How did it feel

17
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,431
to have everyone
throw you under the bus?

18
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:43,700
- I just don't agree

19
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,468
with everything
that everybody said.

20
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,602
I was the team captain,

21
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:50,005
and that should be the reason
why I was in the bottom,

22
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:50,772
not for other reasons.

23
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:53,441
- Well, I'm sure that was why
you were in the bottom.

24
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,877
- So moving on.
I call shade.

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,579
Eureka is sabotaging me

26
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,880
because
I think she's threatened.

27
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,348
And so now, I'm wishing

28
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,116
I would've thrown her
under the bus

29
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,585
and said
for her to be sent home.

30
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:08,453
- Shea!
- Congratulations.

31

- Nice try, lady.
[laughs]

34
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:19,461
- Shea and Sasha
have definitely bonded,

35
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:21,596
and they really slayed the game.

36
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,697
Good for them.

37
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,932
But it's now time
for me turn up the volume.

38
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,967
I have to rise to the top.

39
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:33,273
- There's some girls who
are so cocky and confident.

40
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,508
I wouldn't mind
seeing certain people

41
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,611
struggle a little bit
and be in the bottom.

42

each of you needs to shoot
a sexy selfie

with Jason, Jared, and Yadir,

All right, let's do it.

I'm gonna get right here.

- This is complicated.

78
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:12,082
This looks like the cover

79
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,983

Oh! All hands on deck.

kind of get on my knees.

- How many times
have you said that, Aja?

89
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,233

00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:48,346
Is this gonna involve
your cucu at all?

- Aiy,
how you got it? Yes.

There's cucu for everybody,
guys.

Do not have to fight, okay?

a lovely bunch of cucu nuts.

Valentina, come on round.

In Kardashian: The Musical,

my black ass is playing
Britney motherfucking Spears.

Ms. Shea Coulee.

- Playing the part of Khloe,
Nina Bo'nina Brown.

- I love Khloe.

but okay.

175

- Tough crowd.

176
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,081
- I'm not too happy with
the role that I'm given.

177

She knew I was whispering to her
that I wanted Blac Chyna,

178
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,718
and so that kind of
puts me in a place

192
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,742
I'm obsessed
with the Kardashians,

193
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,978
and I can't wait to get in
my Kylie Jenner fantasy

and hopefully slay
this challenge.

He got Blac Chyna pregnant,

199

then started dating
Kylie Jenner,

200

marrying Blac Chyna.

- Come on, Blac Chyna.
[laughs]

204
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,529

My knee's a little swollen.

209
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,069
I have to use crutches,

210
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,403
but I'm not
gonna let it stop me.

211
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,505
When I was doing
the cheerleading challenge,

I landed wrong
and my knee just popped.

I've been able to push through,

but now it's hurting,
so I have to use crutches.

But I have a positive attitude.

216
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,847
I'm going to do
whatever they throw my way.

217
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,249
You give me a role, honey,
and I'll make it work.

218
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:47,152
- Where's the outfit
you're gonna wear to do Khloe?

219
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,955
Oh, girl, you never unpacked?

- You know.

221
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,193
- I mean, don't be so
discouraged about your part.

Like, I think you'll do fine.

223
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:58,862
- I should have been Blac Chyna.

224
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:00,997
I'm not being funny,
but, I mean, I love Shea,

225
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,365
but, like, she has a weird body,

226
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,667
and Blac Chyna
is known for her body.

227
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,502
She's not shoo.

228
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,070
Blac Chyna was my role.

229
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:09,604
That's what I wanted.

230
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:13,074
I had no other character
in mind except Blac Chyna,

231
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:15,109
and I'm very upset.

232
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:19,780
Now I know there's gonna be
a lot of favoritism. Shoo.

233
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:22,215

say things like that.

234

I think you're great.
- Oh, it is what it is.

236
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:27,686
but there's only one Blac Chyna,

237
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,254
and there's three black people.

238
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:31,122
You're gonna play a white girl.

239

Todrick Hall.

- Yeah, girl, nothing

you represent the future
of North West.

255

How do you perceive playing her?

256
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:12,186
- Well, first of all,
she's 403 pounds and 6-foot-4.

257
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,855
She's crippled, obviously.

00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,515
- Got you, I got you.
- Can we stop the music?

318
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:20,048
You...

319
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,683
Nina, you got to make sure
that even if you mess up,

320
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:24,718
that you don't show that
on your face.

321
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,020
Because if you do that face
tomorrow...

322
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:27,987
Nina?
- Hmm?

323
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:29,054
- How do you feel about today?

324
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:31,689
- Um, I was kind of down
about my character.

325
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:33,991
- Why would you be down
about being Khloe?

326
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,993
- Because I wanted
Blac Chyna, so...

327
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,362
- Tomorrow, we got to have
all that gone.

328
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:40,197
I could sense that energy
right now.

329
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,631
It's a little sketchy boots.

330
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:45,167
- Nina just can't seem
to let it go.

331
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,801
- You are
the three main sisters.

332
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,069
Right now, it looks
a little bit all over the place.

333
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,971
- Nina's in a bad mood,
Aja doesn't know the moves,

334
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,906
and I don't know
what Cynthia's doing.

335
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,741
And they are the main characters
of the piece.

336
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,609
They are the Kardashians.

337
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,277
This is a problem.

338
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,444
- Let's move forward.

339
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,846
Can you all give a hand thing?

340
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,380
One, two, three, four,

341
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:07,282
five, six, seven, eight,
like that.

342
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,149

when you hit your hands

346
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:15,955
that they actually hit

347

00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:26,063
- Yes.
- Okay.

353
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:26,863
- We can do it.

357
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,803
- You also
have to stay in character,

358
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,671
because right now
I'm seeing you two,

359
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,406
but I'm not seeing
Kylie and Kendall.

360
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,741
You've got a lot of work to do.

361
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,542
Like, a lot.

362
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:45,377
- We're fucked.

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,211
-<i> Coming up...</i>

364
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,645
- Did my nose get thinner?

365
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,980
Oh, my God, I think I've
lost weight in my nose.

366
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:53,849
- It's a Hanukkah miracle.
Aja's nose got smaller.

367
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:54,583
- Ha!

368
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,953
[RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

369
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,355
[RuPaul laughs

370
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,891
- Yay, yay, it's today!

371
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:07,459
- Come on, cripple.

372
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:08,927
- Come on, hobble, hobble.

373
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,028
- Today's performance day.

374
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,397
It's really important for me
to do well in this challenge

375
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,097
because my knee is hurt

376
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,566
and if I happen to have
to lip sync for my life,

377
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,135
I'm gonna be at a disadvantage.

378
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:20,270
- Look at these little
petite ballet shoes.

379
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:22,705
Who do these belong to?

380
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:24,406
- How you feeling today,
Miss Thang?

381
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:25,907
How's your knee?
- I feel good.

382
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:28,442
I'm trying to rhinestone
my little ballet slippers

383
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,277
'cause I have to wear flats.

384
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,845
There's just something
about flats

385
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,947
that make me not feel
like a drag queen.

386
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,581
- When life gives you lemons...

387
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,150
- You take rhinestones
and cover up that lemon.

388
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,417
- Absolutely.

389
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,553
- I am not a huge fan of Eureka,

390
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:45,455
but seeing
what she's going through,

391
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:46,989
I feel really bad for Eureka.

392
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,056
If you can get through
the things

393
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,624
that you've been through in
your life, this is a cakewalk.

394
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:52,126
- Trust, girl.
- Even if you're hobbling.

395
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,228
[laughter]

396
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:56,997
- Did my nose get thinner?

397
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,099
Did I have a nose job
while I was here?

398
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:00,600
It does look thinner.
- Oh, my God,

399
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:02,902
I think I lose weight
in my nose.

400
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:03,736
Am I bugging?

401
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:04,903
- It's a Hanukkah miracle.

402
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,437
Aja's nose got smaller.

403
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,604
- Ha!

404
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,240
- I'm having a day today

405
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,108
where I just really
want to clear the air

406
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,009
and approach Sasha and Valentina

407
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,745
and apologize
for being disrespectful.

408
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:20,482
- Can I tell you guys about one
of the disorders that I have?

409
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,950
- Eating.

410
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,584
- Don't joke about that.

411
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,651
- Sasha?
- Yes.

412
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:26,619
- Can I talk to you
and Valentina really quick?

413
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,486
- Yeah, of course.

414
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:28,553
- I never really got a chance

415
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,788
to apologize
specifically to you all

416
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,024
over the joke that I cracked
about eating disorders.

417
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,558
You were having
a vulnerable moment,

418
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,095
and it's not respectful of me
to diminish anyone else's.

419
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:40,728
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,296
- And I'm really sorry for that.

421
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,597
- I also apologize to you.

422
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,832
It's a sensitive issue for me

423
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:48,100
because I was severely anorexic

424
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,469
for my entire early twenties.

425
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,438
I was so, like,
unhealthy looking.

426
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,273
People would, like,
call me E.T. and stuff

427
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,641
'cause of the way that
I looked on the street.

428
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:59,143
It was like I have...
I still have a lot...

429
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,478
I have a lot of hurt
from it still.

430
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,078
- Are you okay?

431
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,147
- This is just such
a touchy subject for me

432
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,285
because I do probably still
have an eating disorder.

433
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:10,985
- Oh, sweetheart.

434
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,921
- And before I left,
I promised my mom

435
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:16,356
that I would eat
every single day.

436
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,624
It's so hard because sometimes

437
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,727
I feel like
I'm force feeding myself.

438
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:26,331
- I applaud you guys
for opening up

439
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,198
because in the past,

440
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,269
I've had a deep, deep battle
with bulimia.

441
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,937
About three years ago,

442
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,471
I was feeling
all these pressures

443
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:36,939
by just the beauty standards

444
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,774
that exist
within the gay community,

445
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:42,077
and it's something that I've
had a lot of shame about.

446
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,578
Sometimes
people don't understand

447
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,745
that though we come across

448
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,480
as these really strong,
beautiful creatures,

449
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,882
that sometimes we're really
struggling on the inside.

450
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:49,582
- Underneath.

451
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,650
- I honestly never thought
I'd be able to talk

452
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:55,520
to other drag queens this openly
about these issues.

453
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:58,456
- Yeah, 'cause it's not
just a thing with women,

454
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,423
I'll tell you that.

455
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:01,491
It's very prevalent
in the gay community

456
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:02,758
to have an eating disorder.

457
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,861
- I'm surprised
about how many girls

458
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,495
have struggled with this.

459
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:12,399
There's power in being able
to confide in your sisters

460
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,067
and have them support you.

nominate her

655

at least for a Tony Award.

656

and here's she's
childlike savage beauty.

flashed us some beaver.

Oh, a touch of mink.

just winked at me.

You may leave the stage.

Now it's time
for the judges critiques,

721
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:53,145
starting with Peppermint.

722
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:55,447
- Let's talk about
your Britney Spears.

723
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:56,614
You had the body language

724
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:58,782
and you were committed
to the character.

725
00:27:58,784 --> 00:27:59,415
Totally nailed it.

726
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,583
- And I think you looked
beautiful on the runway tonight,

727
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,051
but there's something
about the skirt.

728
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,654
It almost feels like
an afterthought to the top half.

729
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:09,957
- Up next, Alexis Michelle.

730
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:12,459
- I know Kris Jenner
and I think you embodied her.

731
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:14,093
- I just want to be
your best friend

732
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:15,227
because of that performance.

733
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:17,128
- Bitch, you turned it out.

734
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,365
But on this main stage,
it could not be more basic.

735
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,033
- I was thinking, like,

736
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,136
this is a Studio 54 night out
on a winter night.

737
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,937
- This is literally
something that you can buy

738
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,674
at any store in the mall,
shoes included.

739
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,875
Just step it up,

740
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,611
because that Kris Jenner
was the business.

741
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:39,982
- Up next, Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

742
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,550
- This kind of fur,
like, maxi gown,

743
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:44,586
I do think it swallows you
a little bit,

744
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:46,788
which is not always a bad thing,

745
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,289
but it is in this case.

746
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,457
- We need to talk about Kim.

747
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,558
What upset me the most

748
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,260
was that
you didn't know the words.

749
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:57,329
- And it's tough,
because you were Kim.

750
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,530
Everyone was looking at you.

751
00:28:58,532 --> 00:28:59,464
- When it's a lip sync number,

752
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:02,300
you kind of
have to know the words.

753
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,638
- Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
Champagne King.

754
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,141
- This runway look,
it's a very, like, Mary J. Blige

755
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,475
nineties, going to get milk

756
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:14,777
in the middle of winter
in Chicago.

757
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,079
I get what you're selling.

758
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:19,014
I'm not sure I want to buy it.

759
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,883
- You got the role
of Khloe Kardashian.

760
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,084
You knew your words,
you were on it,

761
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,820
you had the choreography,
but I didn't get much Khloe.

762
00:29:25,822 --> 00:29:27,054
- You were a little bit
difficult

763
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,388
to work with yesterday.

764
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,491
Can you please tell me
what was going on?

765
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:34,460
- My mind was very set
on Blac Chyna,

766
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:36,428
and when it was given to Shea,

767
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,933
I thought it was like a setup
in a way for me to, like, fail.

768
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:42,767
- What we just heard

769
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:45,102
was that there was
a conspiracy theory

770
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,604
that sounded more like paranoia.

771
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,540
Is this an ongoing theme
throughout your life?

772
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:54,043
- I've always mentioned how
the Atlanta scene has treated me

773
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:56,845
and I felt like
they never embraced me,

774
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:00,215
and so I just feel like people
just have something against me.

775
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,450
- I've seen so many people

776
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,686
wear their victimhood
as a badge of honor.

777
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:10,624
Don't let that sabotage
your opportunity here.

778
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,425
- Sorry.

779
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:13,993
Thank you.

780
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,427
- Up next, Farrah Moan.

781
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:16,461
- Your makeup's always flawless.

782
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:17,862
I just think you're
a little heavy-handed

783
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:18,796
on your highlighter.

784
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:19,997
So every time you turn,

785
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,398
all I see is, like,
metal, metal.

786
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,167
- I felt like there was no
personality in the performance

787
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:25,635
and it did take me a minute,

788
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,769
even with the turquoise hair,

which one was Kylie.

792
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:34,441
that was signature Kylie.

793
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:36,176
It was just very underwhelming.

794
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:39,979
- Up next, Shea Coulee.

795
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:41,580
- This look, I love it,
and I felt like

796
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,248
I was at
a Jeremy Scott runway show.

797
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,583
And you were a dream
to work with.

798
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,085
I just love everything
about your energy,

799
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,486
and you came out here
and nailed it.

800
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,354
- You stole the entire show.

801
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:52,421
That's all
I was talking about, too,

802
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:55,157
that dance break and how
I want to be you so bad.

803
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,992
- Yeah, girl,
we'll go to the club.

804
00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:58,026
- Yes, girl.

805
00:30:58,028 --> 00:30:59,794
- All right, thank you, ladies.

806
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,295
I think we've heard enough.

807
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:03,764
While you untuck backstage,

808
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,166
the judges and I
will deliberate.

809
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,066
[car engine starts]

810
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,568
Just between us mama-gers,

811
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,636
let's talk about Peppermint.

812
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,070
- I though she did great.

813
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,037
She was channeling Britney.

814
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,438
She was thinking
of Britney poses

815
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,140
that were signature,
and it was a slam-dunk.

816
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,242
- She didn't really
look like Britney at all,

817
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,878
but she embodied the carefree
feeling of Britney.

818
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,647
- On the runway tonight,
I just didn't like that skirt.

819
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,115
And it happened last week, too.

820
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,650
These plain pink bottoms
are getting boring.

821
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:32,519
- Like, I'm right here.
- I'm sorry, Carson.

822
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:34,320
- Alexis Michelle.

823
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:36,755
- The runway look
was a really boring effort.

824
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:38,723
- But Alexis
was a dream to work with.

825
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:39,457
She was great on stage.

826
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,626
I would definitely nominate her
at least for a Tony Award.

827
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:45,261
- Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

828
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:46,028
She's so charming,

829
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,797
but she wasn't able
to apply that to Kim.

830
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,232
- Not knowing the lyrics
was inexcusable.

831
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,033
- I'd be willing
to give her a pass

832
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:55,201
if she knew a certain chunk
of the lyrics.

833
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:58,037
And also,
her faking was terrible.

834
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,305
- Nina Bo'nina Brown.

835
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:01,072
- I'm a fan of Nina,

836
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:02,840
but I feel like
she was a little pouty

837
00:32:02,842 --> 00:32:03,941
and kind of just said, like,

838
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:05,275
oh, this wasn't the role
that I wanted,

839
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:07,877
so I'm really not
gonna try very hard.

840
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:08,878
- It was very difficult for me

841
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,312
to find the energy
to work with her.

842
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:11,413
She would not give eye contact.

843
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,914
When you gave her a correction,

844
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,248
she would be like, I heard you.

845
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,282
That would be her response.

846
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:17,717
- This happened last week.
We started to get into it.

847
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,419
But tonight it was like,
oh, uh-oh,

848
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,387
this is actually
a really big red flag.

849
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:24,088
- Mm-hmm.
Farrah Moan.

850
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,156
- She couldn't maintain
simple choreography.

851
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:29,225
- I didn't get anything from her
during the musical number.

852
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:31,760
- She could have done
so many things with her lips.

853
00:32:31,762 --> 00:32:32,827
She could have done
the bottle...

854
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,829
That looked really obscene.
I didn't mean that.

855
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:36,664
- It looked very natural
for you, actually.

856
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:40,100
- I know, I definitely
would've sucked on a cup.

857
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:43,903
- She totally blew
an opportunity right there.

858
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:44,637
- Shea Coulee.

859
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,607
I was so impressed with her
dropping it on that stage.

860
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:49,741
- Shea killed it as Blac Chyna,

861
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:51,976
and then she came out here
on the runway

862
00:32:51,978 --> 00:32:53,010
with her faux fur challenge.

863
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,113
It's super fun.
She presented it great.

Tonight is a stellar night

[cheers and applause]

953
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:53,335
- Ladies...

954
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,373
I need a moment.

955
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:04,978
Would you please excuse me?

956
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,347
- Ru walks off the set.

957
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:11,315
What's going on?

958
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:15,818
- I am so confused.

00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:21,689
- I'm nervous.
Like, shit is going down.

960
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:28,127
- Thank you for waiting, ladies.

961
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:31,363
I have made my decision.

962
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:34,999
Eureka.

963
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:40,070
Would you please step forward?

964
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:53,449
We've been in touch
with the doctor.

965
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:56,351
You need time to heal,

966
00:37:56,353 --> 00:37:58,686
and in good conscience,

967
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:04,058
I cannot allow you
to continue in the competition.

974
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:27,543
- But for now, I'm so sad to say

975
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,912
sashay away.

976
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:32,080

[applause]

984
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:49,060
- I'm starting to crutch off

985
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:52,830
and I hear
the whole crew behind me...

986
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,734
Just applauding.

987
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:01,370
Well, you found it once
and you'll find it again.

[laughter]
- Yes, bitch.

989
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,579
- I just feel sad that...
I understand doctor's orders.

990
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,681
All I can do
is move forward, you know.

991
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,951
The love that I've been given
during this entire situation,

992
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:17,851
I finally feel like

993
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:20,587
I'm a part of something
that's bigger than me,

994
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:25,024
you know, and I don't know
how the hell that's possible.

995
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:27,359
'Cause y'all know mama
is big as hell.

996

I have an open invitation

00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:33,698
so y'all watch out.

998
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:42,139
- Ladies, there has been
too much loss here tonight.

999
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:44,307
Shantay, you both stay.

love yourself,

00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,481
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1003
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:54,382
Can I get an amen up in here?

1004
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:55,049
- Amen!
