    Aja was my Brooklyn boo,

   The truth is, I'm thrilled   
  to see the room thinning out

33
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:33,639
because I know I'm the contender
      in this competition.

       - Aren't y'all two       
       neck and neck now?

35
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,575
     - Well, I have two wins    
        and she has a win

36
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,076
    and then a partnered win.

              -Ooh!

       in the bottom two?

39
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,346
     And I never even landed    
   in the bottom three, bitch.

           What's up?

    where if you haven't won    
 at least one challenge, then...

46
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,759
        why are you here?

00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,928
  - Well, how do you feel being 
    told that you're perfect?

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,762
             Again.

49
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:05,863
         - They told you        
         you're perfect?

50
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,732
    - One day, she'll run out   
         of perfection.

51
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:11,468
      - Yeah, we'd all like     
        to be in the top,

52
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,237
     but the cookie doesn't     
    always crumble that way.

    That ain't a good thing.

00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:24,223
       - So I have my pen       
           in one hand

254
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:28,126
       and I have my hand       
      on a piece of paper,

255
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,362
        and I just think.

256
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,865
         And... nothing.

257
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,833
              Oh...

258
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:40,603
<i>Virgen de Gaudalupe, por favor,</i> 
    <i> ayúdame en este momento</i>

259
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,537
      <i> porque no digo nada.</i>

260
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,339
  - Girl, Guadalupe ain't gonna 
   write these jokes for you.

261
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,841
         You gotta do it        
    for your own self, girl.

262
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,342
         So get to work.

263
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,910
          - [whimpers]

264
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,111
            - Hello.

265
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,046
              -Hi!              
             -Hello.

266
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:53,646
              - Hi.

267
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,848
  - I brought Ross to help you  
       with your material.

268
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,683
  - This is my first time ever  
        in the workroom.

269
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,084
        Do you know that?       
        - You're kidding.

270
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,453
        Oh, my goodness,        
         well, welcome.

271
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:03,721
        - It's just like        
         I pictured it.

272
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,489
           [all laugh]

273
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,090
       - Alexis Michelle.

274
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,558
         -Hi, gentlemen.        
              -Hi.

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,926
     - Now, a little birdie     
        told me that you

276
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:14,063
    were a little miffed off    
    by the reading challenge.

277
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,731
        - I just thought        
       some of my sisters

278
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,633
     could have come up with    
     more original material.

279
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:19,834
              - Oh.

280
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:23,204
   You were more disappointed   
          than miffed.

281
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,338
     - No, the truth is, Ru,

282
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,007
       body image has been      
  something I've struggled with

283
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,208
      for a lot of my life.

284
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,410
        And I have talked       
         with my sisters

285
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:33,579
          and they know         
    what I've struggled with.

286
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:37,716
        That's why it was       
   a little bit, um, hurtful.

287
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:40,885
- So you feel like it's okay for
you to make fun of someone else,

288
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,621
      but not someone else      
       to make fun of you.

289
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:47,825
     - Um, look, I will try,    
            you know,

290
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,993
   whenever I come for anybody  
         on that runway,

291
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,261
        to make sure that       
  we're all laughing together.

292
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:55,063
       - Right. But that's      
     the thing about comedy.

293
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:55,930
    You know, a lot of times,

294
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,899
  especially people who've been 
   through hell and high water

295
00:11:58,901 --> 00:11:59,666
         with an issue,

296
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,534
          the only way          
        to get through it

297
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:02,501
   is to friggin' laugh at it.

298
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:03,502
         - Laugh at it,         
          that's true.

299
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,004
     - Mm-hmm. 'Cause look,     
          you survived.

300
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:06,637
             - Yeah.

301
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,005
   - Have you ever done comedy  
             before?

302
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,107
            - I have.           
  Actually, at my weekly show,

303
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,842
      I spend a lot of time     
           on the mic.

304
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:14,477
      - And you're actually     
    going last in the lineup.

305
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,578
   How do you feel about that?

306
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,313
          - I honestly          
      was ready to open her

307
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:19,682
        and set the tone        
        or close her out

308
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:22,551
   and, uh, let them eat cake.

309
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:23,218
       - Okay. All right.

310
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,486
    - Well, listen, you have    
       experience in this.

311
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:26,687
              A lot             
    of the other girls don't.

312
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,923
 And because you do, we're going
 to need you to bring it extra.

313
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:32,625
          - All right.          
    We'll see you out there.

314
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,592
         Make us laugh.

315
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,260
            See you.            
             - Bye.

316
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,528
       -Hey, Farrah Moan.       
            -Oh, hi.

317
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,530
         - Now, you did         
      the reading earlier.

318
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,364
     How'd that go for you?

319
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,367
      - Honestly, I really      
      didn't like doing it.

320
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:47,437
     You know, I did go for     
 a low blow with Alexis Michelle

321
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,972
    and it did not feel good.

322
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:51,373
   - Now, are you more worried

323
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,209
     about what other people    
       will think of you?

324
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,377
    - I just am more worried

325
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,246
       about staying true       
         to my integrity

326
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,313
     and not hurting anyone.

327
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,948
     - You're 12. What kind     
    of integrity do you have?

328
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,182
           - [laughs]           
            I get it.

329
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,816
          I would go on         
  <i> Chelsea Lately</i> all the time,

330
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,985
    and that show was really    
  about tearing down Hollywood.

331
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,152
  And my nature is to be nice,

332
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,586
            so I'd be           
      the one in the corner

333
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:14,088
        going, but I like       
        Jessica Simpson,

334
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,656
     you know, trying to...     
             - Oh...

335
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,657
      - But it can be done.

336
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,591
    Lube her up a little bit.   
             - Yeah.

337
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:20,994
     - You know what I mean?    
  I love you, Michelle, but...

338
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:21,728
        - Uh-huh, uh-huh.

339
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,297
      - I'm the biggest fan     
   of Michelle Visage, but...

340
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,798
        - Yeah, exactly.

341
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,965
    - Then it's not as mean.

342
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,766
            -Totally.           
   -Except it's totally mean.

343
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:29,433
         - Yeah, right.

344
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,968
      Now, you haven't won      
         any challenges.

345
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,435
            - I know.

346
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,769
     - Because at this point    
       in the competition,

347
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,170
       if you haven't won       
         any challenges,

348
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,272
         you may wind up        
         in the bottom.

349
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,274
    - Oh, don't say that, Ru.

350
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,442
     -You gotta come for it.    
             -Okay?

351
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,243
   - All right, make us laugh.

352
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:44,277
             - Yeah.

353
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,478
            -By-eee.            
            -By-eee.

354
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,679
            [laughs]

355
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:47,746
    Hey, Pep-Pep-Peppermint.

356
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:48,780
       - Hey, yo, yo, Ru.

357
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:50,782
        -Hi. How are you?       
        -Ross, hey, baby.

358
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:52,083
        -Good to see you.       
        -Now, obviously,

359
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,851
     Michelle is the target     
         of this roast.

360
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,353
      Does this scare you?      
      Does this excite you?

361
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:58,855
      - It scares the shit      
           out of me.

362
00:13:58,857 --> 00:13:59,655
       - Tell me about it.

363
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:01,657
      - I've never roasted      
         anyone before.

364
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:03,492
    - Are you a funny queen?

365
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:04,092
          - I think so.

366
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,126
         I mean, I think        
       people will laugh.

367
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,329
       - I think you are,       
 but so far in this competition,

368
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:09,997
     you've had some trouble

369
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,999
    getting out of the gate,    
          so to speak.

370
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,835
  - I feel like it's more like  
    crossing the finish line.

371
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:15,802
       - Okay, all right.

372
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,336
       - Ding, ding, dong.

373
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:18,770
    Are you hungry for a win?

374
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,905
         - I'm starving,        
      and this is the time.

375
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:21,772
    - Well, that's up to you.

376
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,775
           All right,           
       thanks, Peppermint.

377
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,045
          Sasha Velour.         
           - Hi, guys.

      You're intellectual.

         a gutter roast?

380

      I make people laugh,      
        but in my shows,

385
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,460
         my edge is that        
   it's serious and analytical

    and my ID does not match.

  she didn't speak any English,

   at my ID and looking at me.

461
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,555
        And it was clear        
    that she was disagreeing

462
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,824
       with the fact that       
        my ID looked male

          to the point

     my own wig off my head

     with all these people.

470

          - Oh, my God.

471
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,703

           that I'm...

00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:31,383
         Tamar Braxton.         
           Hey, girl.

505
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:32,650
         - Hi, darling.

506
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:35,819
      - [laughs] This week,     
    we challenged our queens

507
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:39,455
  to perform in the second ever 
         <i> RuPaul Roast.</i>

508
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:44,193
   But this time, our guest of  
   honor isn't going to be me.

509
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,930
   I've challenged our queens   
           to roast...

510
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:49,698
        Michelle Visage.

511
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,667
              -Oh.              
             -What?

512
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,502
           - Surprise!

513
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:55,970
              - No.

514
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:58,205
             Bitch.             
   - It takes one to know one.

  With cool cocktails provided  
   by Micky's West Hollywood,

517
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,280
         let's get this         
     Michelle roast started.

518
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:09,782
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines,

519
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,284
   and may the best woman win.

520
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,285
          <i> Coming up...</i>

521
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,320
           - It's me,           
        Mother Maybelline

522
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:17,288
   Nina Bo'nina Banana Fofana

523
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,324
     Osama bin Laden Brown's    
           great aunt.

      [cheers and applause]

527
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:36,436
 - Welcome to the second annual 
        <i> RuPaul's Roast.</i>

528
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:40,406
    This year, we are really    
      switching things up.

529
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:44,109
       Instead of RuPaul,       
      we are going to roast

530
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:47,045
     a man of true charisma,

531
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,848
           uniqueness,          
        nerve and talent.

532
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,382
        [Michelle laughs]

533
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,950
         Unfortunately,         
       he was unavailable,

534
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,052
       so it's going to be      
        Michelle Visage.

535
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:01,891
 Michelle, we know you for being
     a kind, patient she-ro.

536
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:06,095
      And gonorrhea clinics     
    know you as Patient Zero.

537
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,529
           [all laugh]

538
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,631
       Girl, you have had       
        more shit in you

539
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,333
          than a urinal         
       at Dodger Stadium.

540
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,967
     The only difference is

541
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:17,403
       they get cleaned up      
       after a grand slam.

542
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:18,537
   Well, ladies and gentlemen,

543
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,439
         just remember,         
  if you liked my performance,

544
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:22,706
     my name is Shea Coulee.

545
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,642
      And if you hated it,      
    it's Nina Bo'nina Brown.

546
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,510
           [all laugh]

00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:30,279
      [cheers and applause]

548
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,247
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.

549
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,017
       That was extremely       
         edifying humor.

550
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,785
      Uh, sorry, am I using     
      that word correctly?

551
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,520
          Not edifying.         
        I know that one.

552
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:44,590
 It was humor that I wasn't sure
     worked in this context.

553
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:47,593
   Tonight, we really do have   
         an opportunity

554
00:21:47,595 --> 00:21:50,495
      to salute empowering      
  representation in the media.

555
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:53,664
    We have an out and proud    
        lesbian comedian.

556
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,832
       Thank you so much,       
          Ross Mathews.

557
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,266
           [all laugh]

558
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:01,236
    Ross Mathews has the face   
       of a young gay man

559
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,338
          and the voice         
       of an adult woman.

560
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,941
         So the opposite        
        of Tamar Braxton.

561
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,310
           [all laugh]

562
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:11,845
            - Bitch.

563
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:15,081
      I'm gonna get yo ass.

564
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,418
  - It's now come time to talk  
 about Michelle Visage herself.

565
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,553
     Michelle is so Jersey,

566
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:25,023
   her idea of classical music  
          is Lisa Lisa.

567
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,424
             - Hey!

568
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,691
        - Michelle Visage       
          is so Jersey,

569
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:31,828
    she calls her pubic hair    
  the Garden State Expressway.

570
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,698
 And let's not even get started 
     on the Holland Tunnel.

571
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,932
             - Whoo.

572
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:39,367
      Michelle Visage is--      
      I have more of these.

573
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:41,602
         Michelle Visage        
          is so Jersey,

574
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:45,205
     she wanted to call her     
   second child White Flight.

575
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,042
    Oh, well. That one worked   
           in my mind.

576
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:54,280
  And now, a queen who combines 
  all the excitement of smiling

577
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:57,449
         with the thrill        
     of just standing there.

578
00:22:57,451 --> 00:23:00,018
           [all laugh]

579
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,420
    Give it up for Valentina.

      [cheers and applause]

581
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,692
         - Mama RuPaul,         
   you are the shadiest queen

582
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:15,231
 because you let Michelle Visage
   look so busted on Season 3

583
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,700
            and 4...

584
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:19,501
    and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8.

585
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,369
           [all laugh]

586
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:22,803
            And girl,           
       that's your friend.

587
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:24,871
        That's fucked up.

588
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:26,706
   Michelle is such a<i> cochina</i>

589
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:30,710
       that she knows how       
    to say and spell "harder"

590
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:33,412
   in six different languages.

591
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:37,048
            Michelle,           
   you is such a tired-ass ho

592
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,986
 that when you got carpal tunnel
 from giving out free hand job,

593
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,788
  she just became left-handed.

594
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,792
       - I'm so confused.

595
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,961
   - Ross, you're just so cute  
          and so sweet.

596
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,763
       You just remind me       
       of a cute hamster.

597
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:59,134
    I just want to shove you    
           up my butt.

598
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,603
              Boo!

599
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:03,937
      - [exaggerated drawl]     
       Thank you, Paydro,

600
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:07,240
         mo-wee bee-in.         
           <i> (muy bien)</i>

601
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:09,842
          Please excuse         
      the way I'm dressed.

602
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,778
 I have to go feed the chickens 
           after this,

603
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,846
    and I didn't want to wear   
         my good things.

604
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,049
      I sometimes even have     
    to wrestle a few of them.

605
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:22,887
  Michelle, you know all about  
   wrestling cocks, don't you?

606
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,822
             I think            
    we have a lot in common,

607
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,925
      from the same tastes      
          in hairspray

608
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,928
        to the same units       
        of Botox fillers,

609
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,731
   lips, tucks, nips and hips.

610
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:37,100
      Michelle, every time      
       I walk the runway,

611
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,502
   you have this pungent look   
          on your face,

612
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:42,071
          kind of like          
        you got to shit.

613
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:45,974
       I reckon they have       
    some laxatives for that.

614
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:51,913
         Just a secret.         
          We all poop.

615
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,753
           [applause]

616
00:24:58,755 --> 00:25:01,555

           a-cookin'.

618
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:05,024
          Can we please         
     put our hands together

619
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:12,464
      for the one, the only     
  Michelle Visage...'s breasts?

620
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,499
      They're the real star     
          of the show.

621
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,101
         Sorry, RuPaul.

622
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:20,002
    Hmm. I find it hilarious

623
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:23,605
      that Michelle Visage      
  judges a talent competition.

624
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,739
     I don't know about you,

625
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:28,876
   but don't you actually have  
   to have talent to do that?

626
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,480
     Ha. And I'm pretty sure    
 having one song in the nineties

627
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,215
   that no one even remembers

628
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,883
       doesn't qualify you

629
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:39,585
          to be a judge         
     on such a big TV show.

630
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:42,988
  Good thing she's been sucking 
   RuPaul's dick for so long.

631
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,723
              -Oh.              
             -Whoo!

632
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:48,893
       - Oh, and we've got      
   Tamar Braxton in the house.

633
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,695
        Tay-mar Braxton.        
       However you say it.

634
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:57,834
    She's Toni Braxton's less   
 talented, more annoying sister.

635
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:03,205
    [clears throat] Anyways,    
 now that Michelle's dick breath

636
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,239
          has stunk up          
       this entire stage,

637
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:10,345
 I'd like to introduce our next 
  minty contestant, Peppermint.

638
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:13,614
      [cheers and applause]

639
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:16,483
          - Hey, y'all.

640
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:19,552
     Thank you, Farrah Moan.

641
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,253
           [all laugh]

642
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:23,455
       Ross, everyone says

643
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,557
   that your voice is annoying  
        and high-pitched,

644
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,527
       but I actually love      
   the sound of your voice...

645
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,828
           right now.

646
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,162
           - [laughs]

647
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,563
             - Shh!             
     Don't talk, don't talk.

648
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:37,133
        Michelle Visage,        
       Michelle, Michelle.

649
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:41,504
    Not since Destiny's Child   
 has a Michelle become so famous

650
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:44,373
           for riding           
   somebody else's coattails.

651
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:48,377
           [all laugh]

652
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:53,415
       RuPaul, all smiles,      
        Ross, all smiles,

653
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,917
      Michelle, poker face.

654
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,652
         No, seriously.         
     Someone poke her face.

655
00:26:58,654 --> 00:27:00,387
      It doesn't even move.

656
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:04,758
        Michelle says no        
         to everything.

657
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,860
            Michelle,           
     you like my dress? No.

658
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:09,429
     You like my makeup? No.

659
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:10,396
             Bitch,             
     where the hell were you

660
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:13,565
   when somebody asked you if   
 you wanted to write that book?

661
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,266
           [all laugh]

662
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,401
  It's a great book, Michelle.

663
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,269
          Said no one.

664
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,536
           [all laugh]

665
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,238
    Honestly, I fell in love    
       with you, Michelle,

666
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,373
     watching you and RuPaul    
             on VH1,

667
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,441
   and I'm so honored to share  
      this moment with you,

668
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,175
          so thank you.

669
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:30,710
      Happy 90th birthday,      
            Michelle.

670
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:34,280
      [cheers and applause]

671
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,015
         - Hey, babies.

672
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,784
   It's me, Mother Maybelline

673
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,786
   Nina Bo'nina Banana Fofana

674

     Osama bin Laden Brown's    
           great aunt.

675
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:48,325
     Coming all the way from    
  the lions, tigers and bears,

676
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:51,227
      and sheep of the Lord     
   Missionary Baptist Church.

677
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:52,928
        Praise the Lord.

678
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,064
            Moving on           
     to the man of the hour,

679
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:59,467
       RuPaul's secretary       
        Michelle Visayge.

680
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:04,472
       You know, Michelle,      
 your face reminds me of my hip.

681
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,908
             Stiff.

682
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,709
           Oh, Jesus.

683
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:12,945
     What's your name, baby?

684
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:16,315
      [laughter and groans]

685
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:20,652
             You are            
      a whole lotta woman.

686
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,087
             Mm-hmm.

687
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:26,323
     Well, we normally save     
       the best for last,

688
00:28:26,325 --> 00:28:30,527
    but in this case, we had    
 to settle for Alexis Michelle.

689
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,562
           [applause]

690
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:35,431
         - Oh, Michelle,        
       Michelle, Michelle.

691
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:36,965
   In honor of your big night,

692
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,435
   I wore your favorite color,  
         girl. [laughs]

693
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:42,136
              Um...

694
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:47,241
   We have so much in common,   
            Michelle.

695
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:49,810
   We have the theater running  
     in our veins, Michelle.

696
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,146
 You also have several venereal 
 diseases running through yours,

697
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:57,049
           but that's           
   besides the point. [laughs]

698
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:01,453
   But, you know, you're also   
 an inspiration to me, Michelle.

699
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,621
   As thin as you have become,

700
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,789
       one area has stayed      
      the same, unchanged.

701
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,192
    It's a Hanukkah miracle,    
         <i> Baruch HaShem.</i>

702
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,762
    Oh, my goodness, Fortune.

703
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,797
       You also know about      
     playing second fiddle.

704
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,031
       You've been playing      
            bullshit

705
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:21,002
      to Chelsea Handler's      
  alcoholic WASP for ages now.

706
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:25,206
         Now, Michelle,         
   I have to congratulate you

707
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,075
      on really being able      
        to take the piss.

708
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:32,913
         Just ask the UK        
     men's water polo team.

709
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,548
             - Okay.

710
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,317
    - She loves water sports.   
        She loves the UK.

711
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,218
     And we love you, mama.

712
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,520
           Thank you,           
      ladies and gentlemen.

713
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:45,155
         It's been real.        
     Good night, everybody.

714
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,524
      [scattered applause]

715
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:48,658
          - This is not         
         a happy ending.

716
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,561
    - And it don't help that    
     you look like She Hulk.

717
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:53,228
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

718
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,630
    - The jokes, they seemed    
     more like observations.

719
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,065
     - You just looked like     
   you were going to throw up.

720
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,566
       - This is a roast.

721
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:00,667
     You go hard or go home.

722
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:03,703
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

         [RuPaul laughs]

724
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,406
       - Welcome, ladies.

725
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,242
    I've made some decisions.

726
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:15,578
       Nina Bo'nina Brown       
           Earl Jones.

727
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,479
           Valentina.

728
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,980
      You ladies are safe.

729
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,549
    You may leave the stage.

730
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:28,455
          Now it's time         
   for the judges' critiques.

731
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:29,889
           Let's start          
        with Shea Coulee.

732
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:34,193
  - I know a thing or two about 
  being somebody's opening act.

733
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:35,294
             - Yeah.

734
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:36,995
    - And, you know, you just   
     set the tone, you know,

735
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,596
  to be funny, to be original.

736
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:40,331
        - And your jokes        
       were really funny.

737
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,934
  I'm probably gonna steal them 
and put them in my next special.

738
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,535
          - Have them.          
          - Thank you.

739
00:30:45,537 --> 00:30:47,570
      You did a great job.      
          - Thank you.

740
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:48,404
    - Next up, Sasha Velour.

741
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:49,905
       - When you started       
           the roast,

742
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:51,940
        I think you were        
   way too smart for the room.

743
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,375
         But the minute         
   you started laying into me,

744
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,844
     it was friggin' genius.

745
00:30:56,846 --> 00:30:58,378
           - You have           
      a very specific POV.

746
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,782
   You know, what does a roast  
 look like through Sasha's eyes?

747
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,683
           And I think          
    you gave us that tonight.

748
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:06,985
        - Trinity Taylor.

749
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:10,321
     - What I liked was that    
      you had a character.

750
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:12,156
        - Mo-wee bee-in.

751
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,725
      - But everything else     
       didn't work for me.

752
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:16,959
  - You didn't have the jokes.

753
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,794
      - I think even before     
        you got up there,

754
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:21,563
      you just looked like      
    you were gonna throw up,

755
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:23,731
          and you still         
     kind of have that look.

756
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,632
  - It's the Botox, I promise.

757
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,700
           - Oh, okay.          
       See, that's funny.

758
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,501
     And, like, I would have    
     liked to have seen you

759
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:31,569
  sort of trust yourself more.

760
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,971
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.

761
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:37,341
            - Farrah,           
     nothing landed, honey.

762
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,576
    If you're gonna be harsh,   
         it has to land.

763
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:43,880
And I think everything that came
  out of your mouth was harsh.

764
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,548
     That's not a bad thing.    
          It's a roast.

765
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,350
   But you gotta follow it up   
       with a punch line.

766
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:49,818
      People have to laugh.

767
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,718
      - Yeah, I fucked up.

768
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,686
      - I wouldn't call it      
        fucked up, but--

769
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,921
  - I would call it fucked up.

770
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:55,388
             - Okay.

771
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,990
     - Because we identified    
  the problem in the workroom.

772
00:31:57,992 --> 00:31:59,591
       You said being mean      
        is not my nature.

773
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:02,260
  But if you don't like to say  
       that person sucks,

774
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:04,428
          you can say,          
    I love Michelle so much,

775
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,195
    I was dying to meet her.

776
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:07,864
    And she was exactly like    
       I'd hoped she'd be,

777
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,266
     horrible in every way.

778
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:11,934
    It would have been a POV

779
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:13,101
            that none           
     of the other girls had.

780
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,504
      - All right, up next,     
       Pep-Pep-Peppermint.

781
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,739
        - So by the time        
          you came up,

782
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:22,275
      I was hungry for just     
     a good piece of roast,

783
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,676
       and you served it.

784
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:26,145
       - I was like Ross,       
    just waiting for somebody

785
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,747
     to just come out there     
      and bring the energy.

786
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,316
     And you just killed it.

787
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,217
    - And you look beautiful.

788
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,452
        It just all works       
         for me tonight.

789
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,454
        - I would totally       
        take you to prom.

790
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,289
           [all laugh]

791
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,056
       - Alexis Michelle.

792
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:44,060
 - My question the whole entire 
    time is why is she green?

793
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,596
  - Well, Tamar, have you ever  
        watched the show?

794
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,965
        - But going green       
          like you did,

795
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,599
           I expected           
      like a Broadway thing

796
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,900
         'cause you look        
          like Elphaba.

797
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,836
      And then, like, this      
    Jersey accent comes out.

798
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:57,937
    - She likes water sports.

799
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:58,837
   - I was like, I don't know

800
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,838
           what to do           
     with these two things.

801
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,440
      - I literally forgot      
   there was an audience here.

802
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:03,407
  That's how silent they were.

803
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:06,243
  - And the jokes, they seemed  
     more like observations.

804
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,544
   -You were almost too soft.   
             -Yeah.

805
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,479
     - It was like you were     
      afraid of hurting us.

806
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:12,949
        This is a roast.        
     You go hard or go home.

807
00:33:13,651 --> 00:33:15,150
      - Thank you, ladies.

808
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:16,618
   While you untuck backstage,

809
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,320
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

810
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:20,054
       [car engine starts]

811
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:23,357
   All right, now just between  
      us squirrel friends,

812
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,225
       what do you think?

813
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:25,892
          Shea Coulee.

814
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:28,661
           - I thought          
      she set a great tone.

815
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:31,397
       She didn't shy away      
         from her jokes.

816
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:32,264
          I was a fan.

817
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:33,064
      - But on the runway,

818
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:35,633
  is it the most creative look  
        we've ever seen?

819
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:37,334
         - Sasha Velour.

820
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,002
    - I was panicked for her.

821
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:39,802
    Then she got this formula

822
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:43,906
     that she just inserted     
   the jokes in and it worked.

823
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:45,774
     - The way she was like     
       analytical at first

824
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:48,943
    didn't bother me because    
   it worked with her outfit,

825
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:49,944
        and she was funny       
         on top of that.

826
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,879
 You know, she was really smart 
       about being smart.

827
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:54,948
      - Yeah, it was a real     
  breakthrough moment for her.

828
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,982
         Trinity Taylor.

829
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:58,050
      - The father, the son     
       and the holy ghost.

830
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,851
             -Yeah.             
    -We're not with Trinity.

831
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:01,219
              -No.              
           -Not today.

832
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,020
           - The jokes          
   just weren't strong enough.

833
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:04,855
             -Yeah.             
       -It was road kill.

834
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:06,923
           - [laughs]           
       That's good eatin'.

835
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:10,092
        - But the outfit        
          was on point.

836
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:10,826
       It was super cute.

837
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:12,894
    I'm from North Carolina,    
         so I felt like

838
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:17,064
        she fit right in        
   with my white trash people.

839
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,365
         - Farrah Moan.

840
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,133
   - I thought she reminded me  
        of Marilyn Monroe

841
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,168
     when she did the whole     
     birthday thing for JFK.

842
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,235
          And I thought         
      she was gonna come up

843
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:26,037
   and do her whole character   
       [breathy] like this

844
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:26,837
   and it would've been funny.

845
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,706
     But what it came across    
     as a really nervous kid

846
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,375
   who came to tell people off  
         in a harsh way.

847
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:33,809
     - You know, it hit me.

848
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:36,578
      She would be perfect      
        at doing Elvira.

849
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,148
       She's got the same       
     sort of vocal cadence.

850
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,516
      - You know, the fact      
     that everybody's like,

851
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,084
     oh, you look like this,    
       you look like this

852
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:46,821
means probably who she really is
      isn't coming through.

853
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:49,390
  - I think Fortune brought up  
       such a good point.

854
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,791
  She doesn't know who she is.  
            - At all.

855
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:53,727
  - She knows she's a cute girl 
  and can wear pretty clothes.

856
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:54,327
             - Yeah.

857
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,062
   - But there's nothing more   
         than that yet.

858
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,264
      - All right. So let's     
     move on to Peppermint.

859
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:00,899
             Tonight            
      she was really funny.

860
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:01,733
    - Not only was she funny,

861
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:05,570
     but she looked probably    
  the best we've ever seen her.

862
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:08,806
        She was literally       
       a smiling assassin.

863
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:09,506
      - Really, seriously.

864
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:14,544
   From the hair, the makeup,   
  the gown, to the funny jokes,

865
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,578
        I really, really        
          enjoyed her.

866
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,514
    Like, she was really the    
 highlight of the evening to me.

867
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:22,251
       - Alexis Michelle,       
         the Green Mile.

868
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:22,851
           [all laugh]

869
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,954
     - For to come out here     
   with her whole body green,

870
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,789
        I was just trying       
      to figure out, what?

871
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,257
         Who in the hell        
       left the gate open?

872
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:32,693
    You know what I'm saying?   
    Like, what we gonna get?

873
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,595
    - It was a long way to go   
      for a one-word joke.

874
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:36,529
  Michelle doesn't like green,

875
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:39,365
     so I painted my body--     
       except for my feet.

876
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,299
           [all laugh]

877
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,234
     It just was misguided.

878
00:35:42,236 --> 00:35:43,168
             -Yeah.             
           -Confused.

879
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,505
   I actually drew a picture,   
  look, on my notes, of a bomb.

880
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:48,806
       - Oh, my goodness.

881
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,007
          - But we know         
       what Alexis can do

882
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:52,743
    because she has delivered   
       in the<i> Snatch Game,</i>

883
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:53,877
         as Kris Jenner.

884
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:57,080
         - But she chose        
    this position to go last.

885
00:35:57,082 --> 00:36:00,416
       That's a big swing,      
     and it was a big miss.

886
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:01,817
