  lip sync for your life, baby?

       I walked into here

00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,464

       not becoming bitter

    of an ego check for her.

00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,614
          - So Trinity,         
     last week when you said

34
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,749
      that you were coming      
      for Valentina's spot,

35
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,385
  how does it feel to be coming

            - Shade.

38
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:50,021
         - Well, as long        
      as we're being real,

39
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,490
     I don't think Valentina    
    should've been top three.

40
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:55,226
          - Valentina,          
    you know I live for you,

41
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:58,829
       but I think it was       
   a little misjudged tonight.

        to talk about me.

   - Bitch, I wore four items.

48
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,774
         I wore a panty,        
       a chap and a coat.

     came down the runway--

     I just don't understand    
    the hype about Valentina.

53
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:28,752
     Listening to the judges    
     critiques, I felt ugly.

 To hear someone constantly get 
  praised for just being pretty

55
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,957
         when I'm trying        
          to compensate

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,592
  with everything else I have,  
            it sucks.

57

     People always undermine    
            my drag.

00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:42,897
    But you know what, girl?    
    I think that I'm amazing.

59
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:44,531
       That there's people      
     who think I'm amazing.

as this person that's confident,

63
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,973
        but there's a lot       
      of insecurity there.

    And Team Trinity, you're    
   the host of "Not On Today."

130
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:43,639
             - Yeah!

131
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,707
         - Oh, and just         
         one more thing.

132
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,777
    Your show is going to be    
         broadcast live.

133
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,112
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines

134
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:56,014
   and may the best woman win.

135
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,483
       - #TeamNotOnToday.

136
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,818
   - Nina, do not let the fact

137
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,320
    that you were picked last   
          in your head

138
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,288
        because I'm glad        
    that you're on our team.

139
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,155
             - Okay.

140
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:07,955
      But at the same time,

141
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,957
        if you're, like,        
    saying that we love you,

142
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,558
          when we have          
        to choose groups,

143
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,559
   why would you run past me?

144
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,129
    I think the other queens    
   see me as a Debbie Downer,

145
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,497
            the girl            
      who gets in her head.

146
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,932
    But I can't just pretend    
        when I'm over it.

147
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:22,401
   I kind of wear my emotions   
          on my sleeve.

148
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:23,435
       - So Team Captain,

149
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:25,570
    is our television station   
        set in the South?

150
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,439
         - There's three        
      Southern Belles here.

151
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,442
   - But "Not On Today" I feel  
     like is kind of ghetto.

152
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,010
    Do you think we should do   
         ghetto accent?

153
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:33,543
            - No, no.

154
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:35,378
      - I think the biggest     
      challenge for Trinity

155
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,646
     is going to be keeping     
        everybody in line

156
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,482
        'cause she's got        
     some big personalities.

157
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:44,752
          Let's just--          
  She's got Eureka on the team.

158
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,755
            [laughs]            
  And it may be kind of tough.

159
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,324
         - Ghetto fierce        
       like, not on today.

160
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,460
     - This--okay, so first     
    of all, as Team Captain,

161
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,762
      I don't want anybody      
    to talk over each other.

162
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,096
       So raise your hand

163
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,997
       and let the person       
         that's talking

164
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,365
   finish what they're saying.

165
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,733
            - Ha-ha.

166
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,134
      Here it comes, girl.

167
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,469
            Step one            
     of competitive Trinity.

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,306
    - Also, I think we would    
   have really good chemistry

169
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,508
        so we're gonna be       
        the news anchors.

170
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,108
             - Okay.

171
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,977
     - Then, because you're     
 really good at building stuff,

172
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,645
       you're really gonna      
       be good at the DIY.

173
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:19,180
       And then, y'all are      
    definitely entertainment.

174
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:22,349
      - We don't talk about     
  who wants to play what role.

175
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,117
        Trinity is, like,       
     you're doing this role,

176
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,017
     you're doing this role.

177
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,253
 So, to me, it wasn't a leader, 
       it was a dictator.

178
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,655
       - When Ru was like       
         "Not On Today,"

179
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,557
        it did give that,       
      like, tinge of shade.

180
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,925
      - Okay, I'm so sorry.

181
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,126
         - God, please.

182
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,961
     This is typical Eureka.

183
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,063
  - You know, something shady.  
     - Maybe we each could--

184
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:41,731
           - Maybe not          
       towards each other.

185
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,865
          - This is me          
       holding my hand up

186
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,499
     and following the rules    
      that we set in place.

187
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,401
 If you're gonna set the rules, 
        follow the rules.

188
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,369
   - Eureka needs to shut up.

189
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,271
        I'm trying to be        
      a good Southern Belle

190
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,607
    and not punch this bitch    
          in the face.

191
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,876
      - So all three of us      
 just need to have our own vibe.

192
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,711
         You all need...

193
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,179
      - If y'all want to be     
       that ghetto--yeah.

194
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,415
      - We're over-talking      
      each other, remember?

        we should do now

197
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,584
            is break            
      in our smaller groups

198
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,653
    and then we'll reconvene    
  after we go over everything.

199
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:11,587
          - Yes, Miss.

        the Eureka Show,

    but that's not happening.

           - First up,          
     we have Raja and Raven.

205
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:25,798

      to the next one--oh.

206
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,001

       Coco Montrese and--

            the scoop

     with Dame Maggie Smith.

     The challenge this week

215
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,920
     is to cohost two rival     
       morning chat shows.

216
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,856
   With my experience working   
    with "Live," I'm excited.

217
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,524
     But also, I don't want     
        to be just known

00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:00,860
 as that guy that does Madonna, 
       Cher and Lady Gaga.

   I'd like to be known for me

    because there's only one    
   Charlie Hides in the world.

           Google it.

222
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,032
    - Trust me, you are going   
         to watch this.

223
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,367
         - You're going

      a haphazard approach.

    if you add an extra word,

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,012
     you can blow the joke.

231
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,813
           If you drop          
       a couple of words,

232
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:27,713
     you can blow the joke.

      to want to see this.

234
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,716
      - And just say want.

235
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:32,316
             - Want.

236
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:33,483
     - You're going to want     
          to see this.

   going to want to see this.

      to want to see this.

239
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,455
    - Want to see this, okay.   
             - Yeah.

240
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,457
             - Okay.            
  - Yeah. But with a big smile.

241
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,492
    - Charlie's very strict.

242
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:46,228
    She's trying to correct,    
  like, all the pronunciation,

243
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,095
     and I appreciate that.

244
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,930
      But that's what made      
       my character funny,

   when I just pronounce words  
     that are mispronounced.

    I'm Cynthia Lee Martinez

      - [chuckles] Charlie.

250
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:04,209
         - I wouldn't--         
   I don't know if I'd laugh.

251
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,443
         - Aye dios mio.

252
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,611
    - Trust me, the laughing    
    is going to be dead air.

253
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:10,447
     - Part of the challenge    
     is to show personality,

254
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,781
    like how to be yourself.

255
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:15,351
  And Charlie, in certain way,

     something that I'm not

259
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:25,325
     because that's gonna be

    another thought, Farrah.

    a RuPaul's chocolate bar

   who's trying to stick out.

357
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,575
     - When I first started     
           on "Glee,"

358
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:19,576
         I didn't have,         
        like, any lines,

359
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:22,712
       so I would just sit      
  in the back of that classroom

360
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,280
     and, like, roll my neck

361
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:28,050
     and do anything I could    
    to get that camera on me.

362
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:28,850
         And it worked.

363
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,152
        - Congratulations       
        on your new book.

364
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:34,321

      is an amazing title.

365
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,155
    Where did that come from?

366
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,489
    - The book is all about,    
            you know,

367

   learning from your mistakes

368
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,124
         and being sorry        
        about some things

369
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,259
          and not sorry         
    about some other things.

370
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,960
           -Same here.          
             -Right?

371
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:46,430
     - So, Naya, what advice    
           do you have

          in show biz.

374

384
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,852
         - I don't want         
        any extra breast

385
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:17,020
       other than--unless       
    they come with, uh, two--

386
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:21,057
    two biscuits--two breasts   
        and two biscuits.

387
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:24,025
         - I'm confused.        
     Peppermint's confused.

388
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,993
   We're all fucking confused.

   "Not On Today" to go live.

392
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,173

   Five, four, three, two, go!

393
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,376
         - Good morning.

    It's time for the biggest   
       stories of the day.

396
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,415
 has announced there's something
       in your makeup bag

397
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,184
    that could be killing you   
           right now.

398
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,852
  - I wonder what it could be?

399
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,954
 - I don't know, but whatever's 
       in your makeup bag,

400
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,889
    you should throw it away.

401
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,393
 - That's okay, because I'm sure
whatever I have in my makeup bag

402
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,794
    would certainly kill you.

403
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:11,064
     Uh, like your husband's    
         business card.

  all of Michelle Visage's fans 
       have come together

407
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,573
            to create           
     a crowdfunding campaign

408
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,008
         to pay for her         
    breast reduction surgery.

409
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,976
     You know, I don't want     
        any extra breast

    two biscuits--two breasts

         - Good morning.

416
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,991
      Today, we're talking      
          social media.

417
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:48,426
  There's a fun new game people 
   are playing on the internet

418
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,694
     called #SophiesChoices.

419
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:51,628
    I give you two scenarios.

420
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,030
      You tell me which one     
    of the two you'd choose.

421
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,466
   You have to lick ice cream   
       off Nick Jonas' abs

422
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:00,735
        or eat fudge off        
    Chris Hemsworth's chest.

423
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,169
  - Let me tell you something.

424
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,837
     I'm intolerant lactose.

425
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,607
       I don't mind to go       
   all the way to the hospital

426
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,477
        just only to eat        
       that banana split.

427
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,711
           - [laughs]

428
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,645
          - Do you have         
       a question for me?

429
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:15,746
   -I got a question for you.   
             -Good.

430
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:19,116
    - You get one night with    
   Justin Bieber totally naked

431
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,718
        or one night with       
     Justin Bieber's money.

432
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,686
      - So I would probably     
       have sex with him,

433
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:26,522
      have a hidden camera,     
    send the pictures to TMZ

434
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,724
    and then keep the money.

435
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:29,958
   - I'm gonna keep the money

436
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,959
             because            
     I don't know if Justin

437
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:34,862
       had the opportunity      
      to deal with my cucu.

438
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,898
        It's time for...

439
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,734
    -Who Done Wore It Better.   
    -Who Done Wore It Better.

440
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:45,037
     - Detox, the drag queen    
     or Detox, the pussycat?

441
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,706
   - The cat looks incredible.

442
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,573
           - [laughs]

443
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,809
        - I'm looking at        
    Detox the pussycat's hair

444
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,876
    and it looks a little bit

445
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:56,646
       like Winifred from       
      "Hocus Post--Pocus"?

446
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:59,115
   - Charlie, what's going on?

447
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,383
   He is cold as a dead body.

448
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,818
   He's so tense, so nervous.

449
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,253
            - I think           
     we're gonna earn favor

450
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,288
         of our--one of         
    our favorite drag queens,

451
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,556
  Bob--uh, sorry, Thorgy Thor.

           -You stay!

454
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,960
         - And finally--        
    well, that's about all--

455
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,330
    that's about all the time   
     we have for right now.

456
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,731
     - Don't touch the dial!

457
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,765
        - Don't touch me.

458
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,233
       - And we're clear.

459
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,601
        Commercial, guys.

460

    It's eight past the hour.

463
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,444
 - Eureka and Nina Bo-nina Brown
            are here

464
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,579
        to give us some--       
        give us some tips

465
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:41,282
  on how to do drag on a dime.

466
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,951
       - All right, Nina.       
   Now, this lace right here,

467
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:48,555
     it is 100% human hair,     
      but it costs $7,300.

468
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,490
      - Girl, what you need     
        to do is, honey,

469
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,492
   get your platinum EBT card,  
              girl.

470
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:52,992
             - Okay.

471
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,994
        - And go on down        
   to the Dollar Store, girl,

472
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:58,330
      and get you a lavish      
     ramen noodle wig, girl.

473
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,331
    - Oh. Is it beef flavor?

474
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,398
     - Ooh, chicken, bitch.

475
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,769
      Goes for a mere price     
            of $6.00.

476
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:08,038
       - Oh, it looks good      
     and tastes good, girl.

477
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,506
              -Hey.             
             -Okay.

478
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,240
       Now, let's move on.

479
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,842
         We've got these        
     ass cheek pads, honey.

480
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:15,144
      Gel. Per cheek, $200.

481
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,245
        - Girl, a cheek.

482
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:17,579
         You're doing it        
        all wrong, mama.

483
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,846
       Get this ham, girl.

484
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:22,115
       For the mere price       
        of $8.00, honey.

485
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,549
         - $8.00, bitch.

486
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,650
       - And stuff her up.

487
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,184
             Oh, oh!            
       - Well, all right.

488
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,086
     Oh, she's edible, too.     
    She look good and she...

489
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,287
       -Tastes good, girl.      
       -Tastes good, girl.

490
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,288
       - Great, and we're       
         in commercial.

491
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,790
         We're moving on        
   to the celebrity interview.

492
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:37,059
          - Me and Nina         
       fucking killed it.

493
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,293
         The ham's good.

494
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,328
    Can I have another piece?

495
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,099
       - We're coming back      
        in three, two...

496
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,101
        - Please welcome        
     our very special guest,

497
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:52,237
       actress and singer       
          Naya Rivera.

498
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:53,538
    Are you happy to be here?

499
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,939
      - Hi. "Not On Today."

500
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,440
           [all laugh]

501
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,876
    - Now, I heard somewhere    
     that when you were 19,

502
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:01,177
     you lied on your resume

503
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,078
          to get a job          
     at Abercrombie & Fitch?

504
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
           -I did. I--          
 -Did you fudge the truth at all

505
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,248
       to get onto "Glee"?

506
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,182
    - No. I had to actually--

507
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:09,850
      I had to sing and act     
          for that one.

508
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:12,452
 - What's the name of your book 
   and when is it coming out?

509
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,953
          - It's called         
        "Sorry Not Sorry:

510
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,621
        Dreams, Mistakes        
         and Growing Up"

511
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,889
        and it comes out        
         September 13th.

512
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:21,392
         - I'm thinking         
   that Trinity and Peppermint

513
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:25,629
      are not noticing that     
    it's time to wrap it up.

514
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,198
     - My publishers and I,     
 we just kind of really loved it

515
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,866
   and thought it was clever.

516
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:31,000
       - It's not my job.       
       I'm not the anchor,

517
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:33,302
but I'm just thinking Joy Behar,
       what would she do?

518
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,469
   - I can't wait to read it.

519
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:35,670
       - Thanks very much       
         for joining us.

520
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,705
            It's time           
      to go to commercial.

521
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:44,110
       - Do I get up now?

522
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,478
         - I'm confused.

523
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,612
     Peppermint's confused.

524
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,281
   We're all fucking confused.

525
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,285
         - Am I leaving?

526
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:56,852
             - Okay.

527
00:20:56,854 --> 00:21:00,121
       All right, ladies,       
       we're off the air,

528
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,856
    but nobody said goodbye.

529
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:05,959
    - This is definitely bad.   
         Bad, bad, bad.

530
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,760
    That's all I'm thinking,    
              bad.

531
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:09,194
         -<i> Coming up...</i>

532
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,262
  - You're making a really bad  
    first impression with me.

533
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,896
          - Why are you         
     talking over me, girl?

534
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,365
        - I can hear you        
        talking about me.

535
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,999
      - Because I'm upset.

536
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:20,335
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

537
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,704
         [RuPaul laughs]

538
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:27,707
     -Good morning bitches.     
     -Good morning bitches.

539
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:28,641
     - It's elimination day

540
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:33,078
      and our runway today      
      is naughty nighties.

541
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,447
   - How are you doing, girl?

542
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,649
           - I'm okay.          
  I just don't want to go home.

543
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:39,883
             -Right.            
        -Me and Valentina

544
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,918
      didn't have chemistry     
        in the challenge,

545
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,387
      and it makes me feel      
         really nervous

546
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:46,021
     because I just came off    
           the bottom.

547
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,890
  I think it's going to affect  
     how the judges see me.

548
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,625
      You know me, Alexis.      
             - Yeah.

549
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,026
           - You know           
      what I'm capable of.

550
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,161
     Like, it's not my 100%.

551
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:57,197
     - It's really hard when    
  you're in a pressure cooker.

552
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,932
       - But I don't feel       
    like I'm under pressure.

553
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:02,268
          I feel maybe          
       I'm overconfident.

554
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,936
    - Aja, I'm not gonna lie.

555
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,171
          You're, like,         
      oftentimes negative.

556
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,274
   You're making a really bad   
    first impression with me

557
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:12,844
     because I can hear you     
in the corners talking about me.

558
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:16,047
   Maybe some advice is that,   
    like, don't focus on me.

559
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:18,249
   Don't focus on other girls.

560
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,883
        Focus in on you.

561
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:21,817
       - I just feel like

562
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,886
 I've been such a disappointment
      while I've been here,

563
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:28,990
        and I took it out       
     in all the wrong ways.

564
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,324
         - All we can do        
         moving forward

565
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:33,026
         is to be kinder        
    to each other, you know?

566
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:33,726
        - Yeah, I agree.

567
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,095
       I really genuinely       
         like Valentina.

568
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,930
   I'm just really frustrated

569
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:40,866
        because I really        
        want this so bad,

570
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:42,267
         and I feel like        
         I'm fucked up.

571
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,535
  You're a really good person.  
        I'm really sorry.

572
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,503
           - I accept           
       your apology, babe.

573
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,037
       Just let me finish       
         doing my makeup

574
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,505
   'cause it's more important.

575
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,373
              -Aah!             
            -[laughs]

576
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,141
    - Tell me about the work    
         you were doing

577
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,008
      from HIV prevention.

578
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,409
  - I do referrals for clients

579
00:22:56,411 --> 00:23:00,112
         who--they were         
    newly diagnosed with HIV.

580
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,847
     - And it's so important    
        that people know.

581
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,150
   I'm of the era when people   
  would be spreading the virus

582
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,386
       before we even knew      
         it had a name.

583
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:12,923
     I came out just before     
       AIDS became known.

584
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,191
      So none of my friends     
       were playing safe.

585
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,828
  I buried all my best friends, 
    most of my best friends,

586
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,767
      and...that's probably     
       the hardest thing.

587
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,302
            Sometimes           
    I have survivor's guilt.

588
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,536
     Like why did I survive?

589
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:29,503
    It was a death sentence.

590
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:32,239
    I've seen so many smart,    
   beautiful, talented people

591
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,075
   go the route of the pills,   
       drugs, the bottle.

592
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,877
    Society was telling them    
    they are not good enough.

593
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,012
         The one message        
       I try to get across

594
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,547
   is you're worth it, you're   
   special, you're beautiful.

595
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,916
        And you're worth        
    taking care of yourself.

596
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,118
            [sobbing]           
    So you gotta stay strong,

597
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,287
       and you gotta rely       
        on your friends.

598
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,857
     - Thank you for sharing    
           that story.

599
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,126
   Because of your generation,  
   we appreciate what we have.

600
00:23:58,128 --> 00:23:59,393
        - It's important        
          to not forget

601
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,696
          what happened         
  in the eighties and nineties

602
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,097
     during the AIDS crisis

603
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,499
          and how many          
        brilliant voices

604
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,534
  in the world of art and drag

605
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:11,136
          we could have         
      without those losses.

606
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:14,506
   - My makeup is going to be   
  fucking ruined on the runway.

607
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:15,840
     - Do a smoky eye, girl.

608
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:17,408
           - [laughs]

609
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,877
     - Does anyone here have    
      psoriasis or just me?

610
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,411
       - I have bad acne.

611
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,312
   - I have really bad breath   
         in the morning.

612
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:24,779
             - Eew.

613
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:27,581
   - Can I tell you guys about  
one of the disorders that I have

614
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,516
    that I'm struggling with?

615
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:30,917
            - Eating.

616
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,319
    - Don't joke about that.

617
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,487
             Eureka,            
    it's really inappropriate

618
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,021
       to joke about that.      
    - Sasha, okay, I realize,

619
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,223
         but why push it        
     straight to negativity?

620
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:41,191
- I don't think she's pushing it
     straight to negativity.

621
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:45,328
  I think that she's trying to  
   keep the levels respectful.

622
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,064
     - By trying to make me     
     look like a bad person?

623
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,765
        - I have nothing        
          against you,

624
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,900
    but I have a long history   
     with eating disorders.

625
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:52,967
       You don't know now       
       by looking at me--

626
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,535
   - There are other types of   
   eating disorders besides--

627
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,669
       - But so many times      
          in my life--

628
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,038
       Why are you talking      
         over me, girl?

629
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,406
      - Because I'm upset.

630
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:02,108
     I make the joke to try     
     to make the air light.

631
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,342
         I'm not trying         
         to be malicious

632
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,877
     and I'm all of a sudden    
       not a good person.

633

       I was being nasty.

    But you had a nasty tone,

00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:33,964
   - I love the look tonight.

764
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,231
          I was worried         
    you were gonna fall over.

765
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,166
   Those are some high heels.

766
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,200
      -They are very high.      
           -Very high.

767
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,869
      - But what I noticed      
     about your performance

768
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,904
         is that you are        
        a control freak.

769
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,073
       You were so married      
         to those cards.

770
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,340
   Cynthia didn't even finish   
            her line

771
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:48,342
     and you already, like,     
        look, look, look.

772
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:50,577
        And when you were       
       interviewing Naya,

773
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,413
      when you ask somebody     
           a question,

774
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:54,947
            you need            
     to let them answer it.

775
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,549
     - It felt like you were    
      stepping on her lines

776
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:01,252
     and the timing was off.

777
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:04,722
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

778
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,423
   - To me, this does not read  
           as nightie,

779
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:09,025
   but what I loved about you   
        in the challenge

780
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,126
   was that even when Charlie

781
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:13,062
    was trying to direct you    
     in her controlling way,

782
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,532
         you were funny         
  and you messed the words up.

783
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:17,966
            You were            
    intolerant lactose and...

784
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:20,068
            -[laughs]           
        -You are a star.

785
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,537
   I really think that you've,  
    like, come into your own.

786
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,604
        Really well done.

787
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,105
          - Thank you.

788
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:25,705
            - Eureka.

789
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:27,373
   - Again, this doesn't read   
         nightie to me.

790
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,941
     This reads dominatrix.

791
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:31,543
   It's so funny how this end   
        is really nightie

792
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,511
  and that end is just whores.  
           - [laughs]

793
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:36,180
   - Well, surprise, surprise,  
    I disagree with Michelle.

794
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,881
  You're clearly going to bed.

795
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:38,982
        You're just doing       
        different things

796
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,083
   on that side of the runway.

797
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:41,784
            - You two           
   were my favorite to watch.

798
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:43,719
   Chemistry is not something   
          you can buy.

799
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,854
       That's why this one      
      has me around still.

800
00:31:45,856 --> 00:31:46,421
           - [laughs]

801
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:51,559
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown 
         Rodham Clinton.

802
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:53,160
           [all laugh]

803
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,129
          - [sniffling]

804
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:59,832
   I'm gonna probably be like   
   the cry baby of the season.

805
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,404
        -It's okay, mama.       
           -I'm sorry.

806
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,739
      I'm just so grateful      
           to be here.

807
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:09,140
        [sobs] I'm happy.

808
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:12,009
          - Well, Nina,         
   if those are tears of joy,

809
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,711
       I'd hate to see you      
       when you're upset.

810
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,913
           [all laugh]

811
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:17,880
       We love you, girl.

812
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:19,248
   Let's go to the critiques.

813
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,316
   - Again, it doesn't scream   
         nightie to me.

814
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,318
           It screams           
      streetwalking whore.

815
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,119
         And I love it!

816
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,653
       - In the talk show,

817
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,856
       you were serving me      
   the Lady Chablis realness.

818
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:30,857
    The painted on spit curl

819
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,391
          was just like         
       the cherry on top.

820
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,359
     - But you're gonna need    
         a thicker skin

821
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,727
         to get through         
        this competition.

822
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:39,664
         I so appreciate        
     what this means to you.

823
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,799
   I just want you to be ready

824
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,134
          for how tough         
       this is gonna get.

825
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,171
    - You all worked so hard    
       on this challenge,

826
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:50,573
        but I have to ask       
          one question.

827
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:55,945
     Who deserves to go home    
        tonight and why?

828
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:57,312
         Trinity Taylor.

829
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:59,580
   - Just from your critique,   
      it would be Charlie.

830
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,281
          - Peppermint,         
         same question.

831
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,716
    - Based on the critiques,   
            Charlie.

832
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:04,817
        - Charlie Hides.

833
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:09,288
  - Peppermint's look is a bit  
   more basic, so Peppermint.

834
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,555
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

835
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:14,825
    - Because I believe she's   
   a strong competition for me

836
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,395
       and her total look,      
           Peppermint.

837
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,663
      - All right, Eureka,      
           you're up.

838
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,463
     - I would say Trinity.

839
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,832
           I feel like          
       the ending wrap-up

840
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,201
         might have been        
    a little more controlled

841
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,035
    if we worked as a group.

842
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:30,538
      And I also felt like      
   she was focused on herself

843
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,607
     and not really so much     
        of everyone else.

844
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:34,574
         - I call shade.

845
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:37,543
    I take responsibility for   
   the things that I did wrong

846
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:40,746
    and if that's the reason    
      why I should go home,

847
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:41,513
       then I understand.

848
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:44,449
     But don't tell me that     
 I didn't do my job as a leader,

849
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:45,116
         because I did.

850
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:48,419
    And I included everybody,   
     including you, Eureka.

851
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,687
       - Well, I was asked      
       my honest opinion,

852
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,690
  and that's my honest opinion  
     and I stand beside it.

853
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:56,025
       - All right. Nina.

854
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:57,693
       - Trinity, because       
      she was the captain.

855
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:58,560
      But she did her job.

856
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:02,030
 It's just that we didn't really
  feel a part of it sometimes.

857
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,732
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   Thank you for your honesty.

858
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,900
   While you untuck backstage,

859
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,768
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

860
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,302
       [car engine starts]      
           All right.

861
00:34:11,304 --> 00:34:14,605
 Well, just between us squirrel 
   friends, what do you think?

862
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,740
         Let's start off        
      with Trinity Taylor.

863
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:19,442
  - Her morning talk show host, 
      I just didn't get it.

864
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:21,143
        - I think Trinity       
        really tripped up

865
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,178
          with that gag         
         they were doing

866
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,682
   because it didn't allow her  
    to be her charming self.

867
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,650
           Peppermint.          
       - My first thought

868
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,085
            was that            
   it seemed like a rehearsal.

869
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,887
   - For me, it was more about  
       her outfit tonight.

870
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,790
     - The black lace shirt     
  with a pink wrinkled nightie,

871
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,291
    it just was a whole bunch   
           of a mess.

872
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:45,329
    But I liked her better of   
 the two in the anchor position.

873
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:46,229
        - Charlie Hides.

874
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,563
           - The walk           
     on the runway tonight,

875
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,731
   she seemed tired or bored.

876
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:50,531
    She just wasn't shining.

877
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,566
   - She was my least favorite  
        in the challenge.

878
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,002
   - My notes next to her name  
    say dead behind the eyes.

879
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,737
            Gave up.            
           - [laughs]

880
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:01,407
     - I'm just disappointed    
  that a seasoned vet like that

881
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:03,075
       doesn't understand       
          how TV works.

882
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,342
        She didn't allow        
      the moment to happen.

883
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:09,013
   In fact, it almost impeded   
  on Cynthia Lee's performance.

884
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,614
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

885
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:11,781
  - She was so fierce tonight.

886
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:15,851
   She was giving, like, X-Men  
   weird angel/devil realness.

887
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:17,519
       - In her challenge,      
      she was so much fun.

888
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,686
           I couldn't           
       stop watching her.

889
