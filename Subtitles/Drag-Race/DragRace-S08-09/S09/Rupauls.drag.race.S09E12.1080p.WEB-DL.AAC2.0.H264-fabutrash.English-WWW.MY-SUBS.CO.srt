        We're throwing          
    the gayest ball ever!

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,543
          - I think             
    that the dance element

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,677
   is not your comfort zone.

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
       - To be honest,          
 I was not being listened to.

6
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:20,181
 - I don't think you stood up   
     as a leader, though.

7
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:23,484
         You sort of            
    explicitly trust Shea.

8
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:24,618
       - Actually, no.          
       I felt like Shea

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,219
   was stepping on my toes      
        a little bit.

  -Your unicorn, it was fun,

12
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,225
        but there was           
      a little bagginess

13
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,793
           going on             
    in the crotch-al area.

14
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:36,961
       - Alexis Michelle.

15
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:39,396

  the bow out of your head,

16
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,297
    I can get that outfit       
         at Ricky's.

17
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,333
         - Shea Coulee.

18
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,668
         - It's like            
a street style model off duty

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,236

       Alexis Michelle,         
         sashay away.

25
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,789
             - Ooh.

00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,157
             -Oh.               
             -Oh.

27
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,325
    - Our heart is broken       
       for our sister.

28
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:19,062
Alexis really wanted to make it 
to the top of this competition.

29
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:23,165
  Unfortunately, I feel like    
      this was her time.

30
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,234
     - "Wishes come true,

      Alexis, we love you.

33
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,439
 -We love you so much, girl.    
      -We love you, sis.

34
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:34,707
        - It feels bad          
    coming in the top four

35
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,042
   just having lip synched      
         for my life.

36
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:39,411
         So whatever            
    the next challenge is,

37
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:43,281
        I need to rock          
     the shit out of it.

38
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:48,285
       Congratulations          
     to Ms. Shea Coulee!

39
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,953
  - I won four challenges now,

40
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:51,888
      so come on, Mama Ru.

41

           Tch-tch.             
       Hand it on over.

42
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:58,494
    - I will say I thought      
  this was gonna be my week

43
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:00,629
  'cause I actually did have    
       a rainbow look.

44
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,831

     Shea might have won        
       this challenge,

47
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,136
  but I will get that crown.    
          [chuckles]

48
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:11,372
     - We are the top four.

49
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,173
            -Four!              
         -All right!

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,441
       - Can I just say         
     this is the top four

51
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,408
   that I really wished for?

52
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:21,411
        - Bitch, please.

53
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:22,712
      Don't get me wrong.

54

   I love these other girls,

55
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:26,915
    but I want to make it       
      in the top three.

00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:29,217
    Somebody needs to go.       
         It ain't me.

    Let's get done, honey.

        and all of us           
  are hungry for that crown,

60
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,960
   so I may have to resort      
       to other means.

I don't know what that means.

    or, like, spoken word?

127
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:24,581
    - I think I'm gonna rap.

128
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,149
     - Mine is definitely       
         spoken word.

129
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,216
    I don't know how to rap.

130
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,417
           - [laughs]

131
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,918
     - Well, I can't sing,

132
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,388
    so I don't really know      
 what you're gonna call this.

133
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,922
       - Barnyard noises?

134
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:37,190
             - Oh!

135
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,292
         - No, ma'am.           
     Don't try it, bitch.

136
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:40,326
            - Whoo.

137
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,695
       We have to rap,          
        dance, write.

138
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:45,464
       Trinity can't do         
     any of those things.

139
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,333
          - Trinity,            
     you in danger, girl.

140
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,070
  Well, ladies, wish me luck.

141
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:54,438
         -Good luck.            
     -Good luck, darling.

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,172
       - Good luck, girl.

143
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:00,442
          -Hi, Shea.            
        -Hey, Todrick.

144
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,110
     So it's time for me        
      to record my verse

145
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,879
 to Ru's single <i> Category Is </i>   
      with Todrick Hall.

146
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,146
    - This is Vjuan Allure.

147
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,014
      -Vjuan Allure, hi.        
    -He is Ru's producer.

148
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,117
He actually produced the track  
       to <i> Category Is.</i>

149
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,551
            - Okay.

150
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:14,152
     This is the real deal.

151
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,187
    People will be hearing      
          this shit.

152
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,922
      I have to nail this.

153
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:20,190
      - Okay, let's hear

        - One more time.

158
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:26,795
   - Just take a deep breath

159

    and make sure you get       
    every single word in.

160
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,098

         I got chills.

  You're just a bad ass bitch.

177
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,123
             - Hi.

178
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,691
       -Hello, ladies.          
       -Hi, Peppermint.

179
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,860
      - I used to watch         
       <i> The RuPaul Show</i>

180
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,494
     with Michelle and Ru,

181
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,064
    and here I am a guest       
      on their podcast.

182
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,732
    It's a dream come true.

183
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,500
  - You made it all the way     
         to top four?

184
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,801
            - Girl.

185
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,370
   - But, you know, for us,     
we see the girls year after year

186
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,638
         and I think            
    the biggest challenge

187
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,774
   is for them to get past      
their conception of themselves.

188
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,176
           -Mm-hmm.             
-Have you been able to do that?

189
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,611
            - Yes.              
   Before the competition,

190
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:34,045
   I really had a hard time     
          balancing

191
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:38,149
     kind of my day life        
      and my night life.

192
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:41,285
- Because I know that you have  
 revealed that you are trans.

193
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:42,386
     You're a trans woman.

194
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:43,754
         Is that what           
     we're talking about?

195
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,422
        Is that what--          
            - Yes.

196
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:49,092
 I mean, a really well known    
     and respected queen

197
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,861
    back in New York said,      
        oh, you know,

198
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,229
     are you transitioning?

199
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,897
      'Cause if you are,        
      I'll support you.

200
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,465
           But then             
    she immediately said,

201
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,566
         but you know           
      you'll never work

202
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,200
  in the gay community again    
       as a drag queen.

203
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:00,668
     - But that's not true.

204
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,370
  - I see that now, but that    
  scared the shit out of me.

205
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,138
        -For how long?          
           -Years.

206
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,639
           -Years?              
  -Until a couple weeks ago.

207
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,942
  I still worked and I still    
   continued my transition,

208
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:13,078
but it made me kind of push them
to opposite ends of the room.

209
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,580
 - You don't ever need to be    
       one or another.

210
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,682
  Nobody has to put anybody     
    in any kind of a box.

211
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:20,418
 - I definitely didn't think    
      being a drag queen

212
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,788
       and a transwoman         
       would ever mix.

213
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,691
           And now,             
    after this experience,

214
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:31,694
 I know that those two things   
         can coexist

215
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,163
     if that's who you are,

216
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,965
      and that's who I am.

217
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:40,467
- Thank you so much, Peppermint,
     for being so honest.

218
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,135
        You is a marvel.

219
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,836
           - [laughs]

220
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,337
     - I'm ready to hear

221
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,305

   about why I was doing drag

 a mostly white neighborhood,

      and so I was teased

     black kid, you know.

    They'd call me Blackie.

     I would go to church

        make fun of me

354

      I spoke too white.

 I belonged much of anywhere.

00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:58,002
         we actually            
 have a parting gift for you.

377
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,003
      - It's going to be        
       your very own--

378
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,838
     - Oh, my God, shut up!

379
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,940
            - Yes.              
       - The Squatty--

380
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,741
            -Yes!               
            -Yes!

381
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,942
      -Oh, my goodness.         
       -That's for you.

382
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,710
     Poop in good health.       
      - Thank you, guys.

383
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,711
           - Bye-ee.

384
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,145
            -Bye.               
            -Bye.

385
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,147
      - That bitch knew         
   what Squatty Potty was.

386
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,681
         - Hell, yes.           
 Squatty Potty ain't no joke.

387
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,115
          - I love it.

  How'd you feel about that?

416
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,764
          - Better.             
       You were right.

417
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,365
           - [laughs]

418
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,368
      - Now, you're from        
     Birmingham, Alabama,

419
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,069
     and you were raised        
    by your grandparents.

420
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,437
            - I was.

421
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,373
     - What do they think       
   about you as a showgirl?

422
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,609
        - I never told          
       my grandfather,

423
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:33,178
 although I think he probably   
    found a couple of wigs

424
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,613
      under a towel once        
   and didn't say nothing.

425
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:36,680
          -[laughs]             
       -Uh-huh, uh-huh.

426
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,148
     - Now, my grandmother,

427
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,317
  she had a really hard time    
      with me being gay.

428
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,220
     And towards the end        
  we had a big falling out,

429
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,921
         even though            
  I was taking care of her.

430
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:50,791
    - Was the falling out       
   over your homosexuality?

431
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:51,792
           -It was.             
        -Or the drag?

432
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:53,994
  - It was over me being gay.

433
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,996
We got into a really big fight  
      before she passed,

434
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,564
        and I told her          
      that I hated her.

435
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,032
      I didn't mean that,

436
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,067
   but it's something that      
haunts me, like, still today.

437
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,401
    Like, I just wish that      
  wouldn't have been, like,

438
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:03,535
    one of the last things      
         I told her.

439
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:04,869
            - Right.

440
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:09,506
       - I don't know.          
          I just...

441
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:13,509
     There's a lot about        
the last few months of her life

442
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:17,445
      that I just don't         
      have closure with.

443
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:18,646
         Like, I just--

444
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,214
   I wish there would have      
   been more conversations.

445
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,182
         I wish there           
  would have been more time.

446
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,816
       I can't go back          
        and be, like,

447
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:26,151
  I'm sorry that I said that    
    'cause she's not here.

448
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,020
       - Yeah. My guess         
  is that if she were here,

449
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,488
     she would forgive you.

450
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,089
          - I hope so.

451
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,524
       - No, she would          
   definitely forgive you.

452
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,125
        She would say,          
  I am so proud of my baby.

453
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,926
        - She sounded           
       just like that.

454
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,260
           - [laughs]

455
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,262
     - I didn't want her        
        to ever think

456
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,865
that I really didn't love her,  
        because I do.

457
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:49,302
   She was the best parent      
    I could have ever had.

458
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:53,172
     - There are my queens.

459
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,240
       How y'all doin'?         
            - Hey.

460
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,175
  - Good work earlier today,    
      but the challenge

461
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:59,477
   is just about to really      
    get started right now.

462
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,146
      It's time to learn        
      your choreography

463
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,280
     for the performance        
          tomorrow.

464
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:06,316
   My goal is to challenge      
     every single person

465
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,850
           based on             
     their own skill set.

466
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,318
   I really want to push them

467
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,553
     because that's what        
  this competition is about.

468
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:12,754
    Let's go, Peppermint.       
          You ready?

469
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:13,855
      - All right, baby,        
          I'm ready.

470
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:17,258
      - So I want to see        
   if you can sit like this

471
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,459
   so they can go like that.

472
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,961
      - This performance        
  determines the top three.

473
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:24,464
       I cannot afford          
to drop the ball on this one.

474
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,132
   -Bring it to the runway.     
         -Two, three.

475
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,299
        - Cut, cut, cut.

476
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,167
        - Let's do this.

477
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,368
       - Let's try that         
        from the top.

478
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,903
    Five, six, seven, walk.

479
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,072
          Bring Keith.

480
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,940
         Put her down.

481
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:42,943
      Left, right, left.        
         Right, left.

482
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,878
         Awesome. Cool.

483
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,047
        Next up, Sasha.

484
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,349
      Okay, can you just        
        do fast walks?

485
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,384
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,     
      gah-gah-gah, boom.

486
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,285
     And then, walk, walk,

487
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:57,321
    five, six, seven, fall.

488
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,022
          -[exhales]            
       -Can we try it?

489
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,289
            - Sure.

490
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,190
  - What is Todrick thinking?

491
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,724
       Sasha can't dance.

492
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,525
    - One, two, three, four.

493
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:10,028
      Down, down, turn,         
         six, seven.

494
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,163
         - Oh, my gosh.

495
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:15,699
 - Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun,    
      dun-dun-dun, boom.

496
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:16,900
      This should be fast.

497
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:18,434
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,     
      gah-gah-gah, boom.

498

       I want to nail it,

533
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,105
   is that her rhythm game      
     is a little delayed.

    have said that before.

541

  well, girl, I can't dance.

542
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,827

     be in the top three.

    five, six, seven, eight.

00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:56,959
        How'd you do?           
        - I did well.

00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:24,112
    everything you feel...      
            [sobs]

744
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:28,149
     everything you feel        
   on the inside is right.

745
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:34,821
      And please...[sobs]

746
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,789
          don't wait.

747
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,923
   Don't wait to express it.

748
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,959
   Don't wait to express it,

749
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:45,495
      because the moment        
      you realize that,

750
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:48,231
      everyone else will.

751
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,332
     - That's beautiful.        
          Thank you.

752
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:57,671
        Sasha Velour,           
this is you at five years old.

753
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:00,806
      Now, if you could         
       turn back time,

754
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:05,510
what words of wisdom would you  
 share with little Alexander?

755
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:07,311
       - Little Sashinka,

756
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:13,683
 you think a lot of negative    
    things about yourself:

757
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:18,788
that you are strange-looking,   
       too fem, weird.

758
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,756
     And I want to tell you

759
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,525
      that those things         
   are all completely true.

760
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,860
          [all laugh]

761
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:28,229
       And you need to          
    stop running from them

762
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:32,732
 because those are the things   
    that make you amazing.

763
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,433
      And one more thing.

764
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:37,135
    Be good to your mother,

765
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:41,271
  because there is less time    
     than you would want,

766
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:43,706
        and she deserves

767
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:46,442
  to see the beautiful queen    
        that you are.

768
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:50,212
  - I'd like to think she's     
   watching you right now.

769
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:51,346
       Thank you, Sasha.

770
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:54,215
          Shea Coulee.

771
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:55,316
           - [laughs]

772
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:58,252
        - This is you           
     at three years old.

773
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:02,122
  What words of wisdom would    
 you share with little Jaren?

774
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:04,591
- Get your head out of the TV   
         for a second

775
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:07,493
  'cause I want to tell you     
        you are loved.

776
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:12,364
  And there are some things     
that you are going to experience

777
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:15,200
       that I wish that         
  I could protect you from,

778
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:19,137
     but those hardships        
 make you into the individual

779
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:20,838
  that's standing here today.

780
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,308
    And I want to thank you.

781
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,845
   Even when I didn't think     
that we could do it, you did.

782
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:31,280
    And I'm so proud of us.

783
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:32,514
       - Thank you, Shea.

784
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,048
          - Thank you.

785
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,316
       - Trinity Taylor.

786
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:38,818
          [all laugh]

787
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,320
         This is you            
     at eight years old.

788
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:45,156
  What words of wisdom would    
 you share with little Ryan?

789
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:47,024
      - As you get older,

790
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,593
     things are gonna get       
     really bad for you.

791
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,329
           [sniffles]

792
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,434
You're gonna go through a lot   
of hardships with your family,

793
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:05,037
   and people are gonna die     
 and they're gonna get sick.

794
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,742
    But you're gonna find       
    something very special

795
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,744
   that changes your life,      
      and that is drag.

796
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,446
Know that all the things that   
 you've been through in life

797
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,782
      are gonna make you        
  into a very strong person.

798
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,350
          - Thank you.

799
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,886
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

800
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:25,120
     - One final question.

801
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:28,423
   Why should you, and not      
  one of your fellow queens,

802
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,458
     be crowned America's       
     next drag superstar?

803
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,727
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]

804
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:42,999
   - Ladies, it's time for      
  your Final Four critique,

805
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,867
   starting with Peppermint.

806
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,303
- When there are hot young guys 
    in harnesses dancing,

807
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,337
       I get distracted.

808
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,205
    Look, a bird, abs, yay.

809
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:54,508
    But you kept the focus      
       the entire time.

810
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,644
 - The lyrics were hilarious,   
      were uniquely you.

811
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:00,413
   You have all the goods,      
      and you delivered.

812
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:02,515
- And I think on this journey,  
 as the competition went on,

813
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:05,317
  I feel like you've become     
  more and more of yourself.

814
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,120
  - And thank you for always    
   coming out with charisma

815
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:11,355
    and making us all smile.

816
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:13,390
- What, she gets no uniqueness, 
      nerve and talent?

817
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,392
         - I might be           
    spelling a word here.

818
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,360
          [all laugh]

819
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:20,863
    - Up next, Sasha Velour.

820
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:22,965
    - We're gonna give you      
          uniqueness

821
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,633
           because              
    that is what you are.

822
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:26,201
         And tonight,           
   from the start of, like,

823
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,835
      the Vincent Price         
      "Thriller" moment

824
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:30,037
      to your lip synch         
      and choreography,

825
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,104
        it was so Sasha.

826
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,171
   - Throughout your journey,

827
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,473
      your runway looks         
      have been genius,

828
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,041
   artistic fashion moments.

829
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,342
   You're always innovative.

830
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:40,011
      - And you managed         
    to be consistently you

831
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:43,414
     and flexible enough        
to succeed in this competition.

832
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,182
     I've been impressed        
       the entire time.

833
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:47,484
    - Up next, Shea Coulee.

834
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:50,753
           - Shea,              
   it do take nerve, honey.

835
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:54,623
    Whether it's Grandrea       
  Zuckerwoman or Blac Chyna,

836
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,625
       you always went          
     all the way with it,

837
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,660
         and tonight            
      was no exception.

838
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,862
      - Your performance        
     felt the most cool.

839
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:03,464
  You really captured what's    
happening in music right now.

840
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:05,866
       - And this look,         
   you're kind of giving us

841
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,200
  that, like, Beyonce glamour.

842
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,434
         And you have           
      a sense of humor.

843
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:09,768
           I think              
   that's a great package,

844
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,603
      one that's really         
        hard to beat.

845
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:13,838
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.

846
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,440
      - My good, gay gods.

847
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,341
       Trinity, this is         
       my favorite look

848
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:19,975
  you've ever turned tonight.

849
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,142
          - Thank you.

850
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:23,711
        - And who knew          
   that Trinity was funny?

851
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:27,380
   - The mom in "9021-Ho,"      
        it was genius.

852
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,647
   The nun was unbelievable.

853
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:31,716
      Sister Mary Koont,        
         I loved it.

854
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,250
        - Talent, the T,

855
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:34,985
         that's what            
   I'm giving you, Trinity,

856
00:33:34,987 --> 00:33:38,655
 because you have done things   
in this competition talent wise

857
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:40,356
       you didn't know          
       you had in you.

858
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:41,890
        - I'm finally           
      figuring this out.

859
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:43,892
         C-U-N-Trinity.

860
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:45,493
       - Yes! Thank you.

861
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:47,761
  - I'd like to buy a vowel,    
       Michelle Visage.

862
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:49,696
   - I told you I had a plan.

863
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:52,665
          [all laugh]

864
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,099
     - One final question.

865
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:57,469
    Why should you and not      
  one of your fellow queens

866
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:00,738
     be crowned America's       
     next drag superstar?

867
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,407
   Starting with Peppermint.

868
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,443
  - I'd like to take a page     
  from our drag foremothers

869
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,911
     way back at Stonewall

870
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:11,281
     and spread a message       
      of love and light.

871
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:15,051
  I think we have to connect    
      with our community

872
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,686
  and people outside of what    
we would consider our community.

873
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,954
         As America's           
     next drag superstar,

874
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:23,157
     it will be important       
      for me to do that.

875
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,525
          - Thank you.

00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:39,104
       a little strange         
     and a little weird,

   She's got the likeability,

    she's just been up here.

      every single time.

937
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,005
     You should call her

   Stanky the Starfish was.

00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:38,138
          - Ladies,             
    I've made my decision.

1004
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:45,677
    Tonight, I've decided...

1005
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:50,714
        To eliminate...

1006
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:53,282
            No one.

1007
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:00,622
       All four of you          
      are moving forward

1008
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:04,158
     to the grand finale        
   of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

   has never been so close.

1013
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:19,471
    And now I want to hear      
     from our super fans.

1014
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:21,473

      should be crowned
