         For this week's        
         maxi challenge,

125
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:56,201
       you'll be acting in      
   a classic high school drama

126
00:04:56,203 --> 00:05:00,305
       that we're calling       
            <i> 9021-Ho.</i>

127
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,507
           [all laugh]

128
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,742
    And you can hashtag that.

129
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:05,876
             #9021HO

130
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:09,546
          Later today,          
   you'll head over to the set

131
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:10,747
   to meet your co-directors,

132
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:14,717
        from the original       
      <i> Beverly Hills 90210,</i>

133
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:19,154
   the legendary Jennie Garth   
       and Tori Spelling.

134
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:22,357
           [cheering]

135
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,892
       - My mind is blown.

136
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:28,495
   - Peppermint, you survived   
      last week's lip sync,

137
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:31,764
      so you get to assign      
           the roles.

138
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,499
   It's back to class, ladies,

139
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,301
      but this time, you're     
    going to rule the school.

140
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:41,372
          So good luck,         
      and don't fuck it up.

141
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,842
  - Oh, my God, this is great.

142
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,542
             - Wow.

143
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,743
      -<i> 90210</i> was the show

144
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,712
    that I would, like, sneak   
into my brother's room to watch.

145
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,847
      This is my childhood      
           right here.

146
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,249
     I'm an expert on<i> 90210,</i>

147
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,751
     so I feel really ready     
       for this challenge.

148
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,252
          - All right,          
      let's go through it.

149
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:01,822
     Blenda Schmaltz, she's     
 the original high school bitch.

150
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:04,424
    Monna Dartin, good girl.    
         She's a virgin.

151
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,526
          Then there's          
      Grandrea Zuckerwoman,

152
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:09,028
     the high school senior     
     who looks 50 years old.

153
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,230
       Ooh, she's pregnant      
    and doesn't know it. Wow.

154
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:13,432
          - Do you have         
        any inclinations?

155
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,934
          - My approach         
       is to ask the girls

156
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,068
   what roles they want to do,

157
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,335
             because            
    I don't want to be blamed

158
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,503
   if somebody doesn't do well  
       in this challenge.

159
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,638
    I want to know if there's   
anything that speaks to anybody.

160
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,907
     - My first two choices     
     are Mirror Monna Dartin

161
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,074
  or Bethani Glamber Gliessen.

162
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:29,609
      - I was kind of into,     
          like, Blenda.

163
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:30,876
        - I kind of like        
          all of them,

164
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:36,047
   but, like, my favorites are  
  Mirror Monna Dartin or Blenda

165
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,949
      because they're both      
        bitchy and nasty.

166
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,484
             - Okay.

167
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:45,888
     So, ladies, I have cast    
         the production.

168
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,756
   The role of Blenda Schmaltz

169
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:51,025
         will be played         
     by Nina Bo'nina Brown.

170
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,993
             - Word.            
       Thank you, Pepper.

171
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,895
            - Bethani           
     will be played by Shea.

172
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:56,762
             - Yes.

173
00:06:56,764 --> 00:07:01,933
     - Grandrea Zuckerwoman     
     will be played by Aja.

174
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:05,269
  - That was none of my picks.

175
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,404
         - I know that.

176
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:08,738
          [sighs] God.

177
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,605
     - Don't roll your eyes.

178
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:11,406
 - Don't get in your head, girl.
      - It's gonna be good.

179
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:13,708
     - It's just frustrating    
        because I always

180
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,811
           land a role          
       that I don't want.

181
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,846
  - Let's just make this work.

182
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:21,682
           - Can I go           
        on a smoke break?

183
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,116
  - Are you that stressed out?

184
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,817
      - Yeah, I don't want      
         to be Grandrea.

185
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,086
    - Girl, you gotta grow up   
    and accept the challenge.

186
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:30,088
       - I don't have to.

187
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,089
            - [sighs]

188
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,490
          If it's going         
        to be that tense,

189
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:34,791
       I'll take Grandrea       
          and she can--

190
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:37,760
     - No, you don't have to    
because it's not your detriment.

191
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,361
      - What I'm saying is,     
           I can do--

192
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:41,296
        - You know what?        
     I'm making a decision.

193
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,230
   You two are swapping roles.

194
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,298
    - I don't want to be a--    
    - You're swapping roles.

195
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,365
            - I know,           
     but I'm not trying to--

196
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,666
       - You already said       
        you're stressed.

197
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:47,800
      I know how you feel.

198
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,935
        But now what role       
          do you have?

199
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,636
            -Bethani.           
    -Are you cool with that?

200
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,304
     - Yeah, I'm cool with--    
   like, I don't mean trouble.

201
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,639
  - It's just we got a lot to-- 
        - Let's rehearse.

202
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,708
      - I think Aja doesn't     
     want to play a grandma.

203
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,043
  It's one of the biggest parts 
          in the show,

204
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:00,843
      and you traded it in

205
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,712
     for a bitch who's only     
       in the last scene.

206
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:04,612
  So now you look like a bitch

207
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,780
         playing a bitch        
       in the last scene.

208
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,448
      - I feel so childish      
           right now.

209
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,817
  - Well, you probably should,  
              girl.

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,718
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,619

            -Action.

         [RuPaul laughs]

214
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:29,965
       - I'm the new bitch      
         in this school.

215
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,634
    - Who wants my virginity?

216
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,969
       - Mom, what are you      
           doing here?

217
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,236
   This week's maxi challenge

218
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:39,872
      is to act in the new      
       TV classic<i> 9021-Ho.</i>

219
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:42,007
      - We need to, like--      
    we need to run off like--

220
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,142
         like run, like,        
       flipping our hair.

221
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:47,378
   - Me and Trinity are going   
     to add a little quirks

222
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,681
   and kirks--is that a word?

223
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,115
           Qui--quirk.

224
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,517
  We're adding little quirks--

225
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,752
   Are you sure that's a word?

226
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:57,853
             Quirks.

227
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,721
   Anyways, we're doing these   
     little things together,

228
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,623
 and I think it's going to read 
     really well on camera.

229
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,126
     - She didn't wear it up    
     on her head like that.

230
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,528
        - But that's very       
         nineties to me.

231
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,064
 - Um, can I make a suggestion? 
       - Yeah, what's up?

232
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,165
   - 'Cause you say your name,  
             right?

233
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,834
        - Yeah, Grandrea.       
    - Say it--yeah, Grandrea,

234
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:17,035
        so that it sounds       
          like Andrea.

235
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,504
    - Okay, girl, we get it.

236
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:21,572
   You watched the show a lot.

237
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,873
  - They definitely had, like,

238
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,108
      more natural eyebrows     
        in the nineties.

239
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,779
     So, like, not too thin     
     or not too sculptural.

240
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,413
          - Girl, bye.

        to shoot<i> 9021-Ho.</i>

     I'm looking to toe up,

       but I'm loving it,       
      and I'm ready to go.

    I'm Jennie and I will be    
      your director today.

247
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,461
        - Excuse me, hi.        
            I'm Tori.

248
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,329
  Actually, I'm your director.

249
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:53,763
      - You know what, Tor?

250
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,431
   It's not always about you,   
              okay?

251
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,765
    - Well, of course, it is.

252
00:09:56,767 --> 00:10:00,769
    - Hmm. I've been wanting    
     to do this a long time.

253
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:02,771
            - [gasps]

254
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:04,739
              - Oh!

255
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,040
           And scene.

256
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,541
           [all laugh]

257
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:10,210
         - Now, ladies,         
  that's what you call acting.

258
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:13,246
         - Let's see it.        
       Places, everybody.

259
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:14,080
            - And...

260
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:15,681
            -Action.            
            -Action.

261
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,116
            - Uh, uh,           
    I'm Grandrea Zuckerwoman

262
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,785
      and I'm a... [coughs]

263
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,753
        I'm a... [coughs]

264
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,888
          I'm a senior.

265
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,989
        - A senior what?

266
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:28,057
      - [laughs and snorts]

267
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:28,657
           - And cut.

268
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,992
       - Shea, your cough       
        and snort combo--

269
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:33,594
    really, really something.   
       - Well, thank you.

270
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:35,929
    I'm a terrible asthmatic.   
            [laughs]

271
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:36,763
        - Let's move on.

272
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:40,399
   - Maybe at this new school,  
 you shouldn't be such a bitch.

273
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:43,402
   - Where are the cool people  
        at in the school?

274
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:46,371
              -Cut.             
       -Nina, maybe try it

275
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,438
           with, like,          
        a different tone.

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,207
 - Where are the cool people at?
          This school.

277
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,075
              - No.

278
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,110
      Maybe lose the pause      
          before "at."

279
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,345
   - Where are the cool people  
         at this school?

280
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,779
           - Where are          
       the cool people at?

281
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:01,716
   - Where are the cool people  
         in this school?

282
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,351
  - Our milkshakes are melting

283
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,020
       because Nina keeps       
      messing up her lines,

284
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,956
     and it's taking forever    
     for them to get to us.

285
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,858
     - The girl-to-boy ratio    
           here blows.

286
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,426
    - Nina, I would recommend

287
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:17,195
       maybe articulating       
 a little bit more on that line.

288
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:19,397
     - The girl-to-boy ratio    
             blows.

289
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,467
    - Nina speaks super fast.   
       La-la-la-la-la-la.

290
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,601
          - Hey, Nina.

291
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:25,435
    - The girl-to-boy ratio.

292
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:29,005
   Just make sure that we can   
  really understand your words.

293
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,817
        -Time to move on.       
            -Action.

294
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,985
            - [gasps]           
       Oh, my God, Marta--

295
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,920
            [laughs]

296
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,021
        - Did you forget        
          who you were?

297
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,989
      -Yeah. I got it now.      
             -Okay.

298
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,891
         - Marna Donny--

299
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,592
  Sorry. Can I start that over? 
             - Cut.

300
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,995
         -Monna Dartin.         
         -Okay, got it.

301
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,097
       -You okay, Farrah?       
          -Yeah, sorry.

302
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,498
            - Got it?           
          Okay. Action.

303
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,502
   - Oh, my God, Monna Dartin,  
         we're seniors.

304
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:11,072
    - There's enough calories   
      in that to kill you.

305
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:14,575
      But we all gotta die      
          of something.

306
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,312
             - Cut.             
      Uh, Sasha, ham it up.

307
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:19,513
   Don't be afraid to go big.

308
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,847
          - And I think         
     your whole performance,

309
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:21,948
  you could be just a little--

310
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,783
           -Notch up.           
            -Boozier.

311
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,751
             -Okay.             
          -And action.

312
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,285
     - Mom, stop copying me.

313
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:30,554
            No wonder           
     I'm addicted to speed.

314
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:32,722
         - I'm addicted         
         to speed, too.

315
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,091
        -No, you're not!        
        -No, you're not!

316
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,926
              -Mom!             
              -Mom!

317
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,994
            -[laughs]           
            -And cut.

318
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,295
    Trinity, you were great.

319
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:42,497
      You were like bang on     
    through the whole scene.

320
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,865
          So good job.

321
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,765
      This is a big scene.

322
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,633
  - This is my favorite scene.

323
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,101
       There's two Donnas.      
          - Two Donnas.

324
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,368
      -And no Kelly. Yeah.      
     -Of course you love it.

325
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,236
      - You're going to be      
     talking into a mirror,

326
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,771
 and your actor is not going to 
  be there talking back to you,

327
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,005
         so that can get        
        really confusing.

328
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,139
     - Kind of like<i> Avatar.</i>

329
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,974
         - It's nothing         
          like<i> Avatar.</i>

330
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,209
            -[laughs]           
          -And action.

331
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:04,746
 - Dear darling Monna, of course
     you're still a virgin.

332
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:07,815
  You're scared of everything.

333
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,183
           - And cut.

334
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,717
     You are like the devil,

335
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,151
   so I would say amp that up.

336
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,318
             -Okay.             
          -Like, a lot.

337
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,820
        - Okay, energy up       
           and action.

338
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:19,656
      - But I've never had      
         a drink before.

339
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:22,625
       - Listen, chickie,       
     it's plain and simple.

340
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:26,829
      Get drunk at the prom     
     and get yourself laid!

341
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:29,131
        - But I'm scared.

342
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,031
           - And cut.

343
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:30,998
     - You did a great job.

344
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,801
  I really believe that you're  
     so sweet and innocent.

345
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:36,035
           -But I am.           
            -[laughs]

346
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:39,571
       - This is the prom,      
         you guys, so...

347
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,539
        - Didn't you love       
       those dance scenes?

348
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,073
       - No, I hated them.

349
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,175
   They take forever, all day.  
             - Yeah.

350
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,876
     - Remember, everybody,     
       stay in character.

351
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:48,911
       If you're a bitch,       
   be a bitch the whole time.

352
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,380
      - If you're a whore,      
           be a whore.

353
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,081
             - Yeah.            
           [all laugh]

354
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,382
    Are you talking about me?

355
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:56,150
    - No, did I look at you?

356
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,284
           - You did.

357
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,653
    - Places, please, ladies.

358
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,687
             Action.

359
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,489
     - I want to sex you up.

360
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,190
             - Okay.

361
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,031
        - Cut, cut, cut.        
          Sorry, guys.

362
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,832
         Kissing scenes         
       are always awkward.

363
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,967
       - Mm-hmm. You have       
     to touch lips. I mean--

364
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,868
      - You have to make it     
           look real.

365
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,135
        - We don't care.        
          We'll do it.

366
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,537
    - We'll kiss. We'll kiss.

367
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:30,478
       - Here comes all of      
    Aja's tongue in my mouth.

368
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,913
           - [laughs]

369
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,016
         - We might have        
   to get married after this.

370
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,085
             - Cut.             
        That is a print.

371
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,586
         Let's move on.

372
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,620
            -Action.            
            -Action.

373
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,823
       - We're never going      
    to see each other again.

374
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,558
         - Yes, we are.

375
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,893
  We're gall going to the sa--

376
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,261
     I'll start over again.

377
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,996
          Yes, we are.

378
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,798
           We're going          
      to the same college.

379
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
   We're gonna work together.

380
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:58,167
             - Cut.

381
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,402
   - Aja, she is a real bitch.

382
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:03,204
         Let's see that.        
           And action.

383
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,738
         - Yes, we are.

384
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,307
         We're all going        
      to the same college.

385
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,809
           We're gonna          
      work together again.

386
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:13,579
     - I just have one thing    
      to say, and that's--

387
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:17,115
           Oh, oh, oh!

388
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,750
     I'm not even pregnant.

389
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,452
            -And cut.           
            -And cut.

390
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,388
         - Well, I think        
      our job here is done.

391
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,190
              -Yep.             
   -Aja's performance is meh.

392
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,593
        Shea took a role        
      that she didn't want

393
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,994
    and made it really funny.

394
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,963
          You know Aja          
     has got to be cracked.

395
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,597
         <i> - Coming up...</i>

396
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,800
           Category is          
      big hair everywhere.

397
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,536
     Take that, Chaka Khan.     
        [Michelle laughs]

398
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:45,272
         [RuPaul laughs,        
           bell rings]

399
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,641
         [RuPaul laughs]

400
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:50,442
              - Ha!

401
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,844
          - Oh, my hair         
        looks sickening.

402
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,245
      - We're getting ready     
           for runway,

403
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,046
   and I genuinely feel stupid

404
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:59,082
   for reacting the way I did   
           yesterday.

405
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,049
        I'm embarrassed.

406
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,217
   I'm looking back at, like,   
    my little stupid tantrum

407
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,886
    and I'm just laughing now   
     because it was so dumb.

408
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:06,354
        - Well, I'm glad        
        you can see that.

409
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,824
      - I definitely, like,     
   feel like I made a mistake.

410
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:13,627
  The only thing you can do now 
   is just focus on my runway,

411
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,796
         because I need         
        to ace this shit.

412
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:21,132
 - So I know both of you wanted 
     to be my date to prom,

413
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:23,901
          but I finally         
         made my choice.

414
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,003
          I choose me.

415
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:26,536
           - [laughs]

416
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,138
    - I went to so many proms   
         in high school.

417
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,406
        - My junior year,       
   I went with a boy to prom.

418
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,342
  We went to our winter formal  
            in drag.

419
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:35,209
              -Yes.             
          -Oh, my God.

420
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,044
     - This is my good girl     
            Kristin.

421
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:41,982
        - I went to prom,       
      and I won Prom King.

422
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,783
              -Yay!             
       -Of course you did.

423
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,485
   - My high school experience  
            was bad.

424
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,120
         In high school,        
    my grandmother got sick.

425
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:49,720
         She had cancer.

426
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,188
      So the last two years     
         of high school,

427
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,690
   I quit school to take care   
        of my grandmother

428
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,291
     and just home schooled     
             myself.

429
00:16:55,293 --> 00:17:00,162
 My mother died when I was eight
   from complications of HIV.

430
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,030
             She was            
     in the wrong business.

431
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:05,066
    She was an exotic dancer.   
         She did drugs.

432
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,469
         So I was raised        
       by my grandparents,

433
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:12,673
       and my grandmother       
       got terminally ill

434
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:17,044
          when I was 16         
     and died when I was 18.

435
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,678
        I never got to do       
          like a prom.

436
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,812
        I never got to do       
          a senior trip

437
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:22,514
         or a graduation        
     or anything like that.

438
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:25,049
          I missed out          
       on a lot of things

439
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,284
       that kids get to do      
         in high school,

440
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:28,451
     but that was my choice.

441
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:31,587
      I did that on my own      
      because I loved her.

442
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,857
           - I've lost          
  so many relatives to cancer.

443
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:38,659
              -Oh.              
  -My dad has multiple myeloma,

444
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,793
  which is in the bone marrow.

445
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:43,530
   I kind of put up a barrier   
      between my dad and I

446
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,631
   when I started doing drag.

447
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,032
   He's just never been a man

448
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,868
 that really expressed his love 
    through words or actions

449
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,072
   because he's a military man  
  and, you know, conservative.

450
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:56,742
    And then I think because    
    of his cancer diagnosis,

451
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,444
      it's put some things      
    into perspective for him.

452
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,380
   One day he gave me a call,

453
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,582
         and he's, like,        
   I just want to let you know

454
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,784
   that I love you regardless.

455
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,486
           I know that          
     you're just an artist,

456
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,387
            that this           
       is your expression.

457
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:15,257
 And it was the most validating 
    experience I've ever had.

458
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,727
     And I just realize that    
   my time with him is limited

459
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:21,296
   and he's actually way more   
      accepting and loving

460
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,864
   than I gave him credit for.

461
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,966
         - I know it was        
   a real struggle for my mom.

462
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,535
     She actually was, like,    
    really not comfortable...

463
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,271
            -Onboard?           
         -with the drag.

464
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,038
       - Is that something

465
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
     that you struggle with     
    feeling unresolved about?

466
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,809
       - Yeah. That's why       
        I'm a bald queen.

467
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,811
     When she lost her hair,

468
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,913
            she felt            
   she couldn't be beautiful.

469
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:40,780
              -Oh.              
              -Oh.

470
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:42,515
    - Right after I graduated   
          from college,

471
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:44,984
      my mom was diagnosed      
          with cancer.

472
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:48,287
       Chemo made her lose      
        all of her hair.

473
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,356
        I am a bald queen       
   to represent for my mother.

474
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:54,826
 Taking all of that and turning 
  that into drag in my own way

475
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:59,831
  was the most important thing  
   I've ever done in my life.

476
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,299
         And I feel like        
     the drag queen I am now

477
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,934
      is not the drag queen     
  that she got to see, either.

478
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,037
   - I really do believe that   
    the people that leave us

479
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,938
         are watching us        
         and can see us.

480
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,471
             - Yeah.

481
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:10,605
           - And I bet          
     that she's really proud

482
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,939
          of the queen          
       that you've become.

483
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:12,506
          - Thank you.

484
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:13,707
        - You should try        
       to get up a meeting

485
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,708
   with the Hollywood Medium.

486
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,176
  - You know I offer readings,  
             right?

487
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,877
             - Girl,            
   you know I'm into Santería

488
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:19,111
  and all that spiritual stuff.

489
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:20,245
      - I would like that.

490
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,680
          - Aja Queen,          
      the Bed-Stuy medium.

491
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,681
      - We'll get together      
            one day.

492
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:25,616
       - We will do that.       
    I'll bring you a chicken.

493
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:28,251
       - [laughs] Shut up!

494
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:29,652

00:30:58,082 --> 00:31:00,449
      First up, Valentina.

747
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:02,184
           - I happen           
       to love this look.

748
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:05,353
   I like the way you've also   
accessorized it with the gloves,

749
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:06,320
            which is            
    a really beautiful touch.

750
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,189
    - And as Monna Dartin...    
        - [clears throat]

751
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,456
            - I mean,           
       that's my namesake.

752
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,357
        I thought you had       
      a lot of great levels

753
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,624
       and you nailed it.

754
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:14,825
    - One of the great things   
           about Tori

755
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:16,626
     was that she always did    
    a lot of physical comedy,

756
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:19,962
        and I think that        
    you did the role justice.

757
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:22,664
         You're perfect.        
      - Thank you so much.

758
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:23,798
         -Sasha Velour.         
              -Hi.

759
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,199
      - You look different      
    from everybody out here.

760
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:28,835
  And you're on-brand and your  
look always has a point of view.

761
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:31,938
       - It's so on point.      
          So on point.

762
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,973
           Literally.           
           [all laugh]

763
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,773
     - And your lunch lady.

764
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:36,975
        I just wanted you       
     to go further with it.

765
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,743
     You weren't letting go     
           completely.

766
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:43,013
   - There were a few zingers   
in there that quite didn't land.

767
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,582
         - I wish I had         
     just played the comedy

768
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:46,950
        a little bit more       
        straightforward.

769
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:49,052
    And maybe it didn't need    
   the Meryl Streep treatment.

770
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:52,488
         - Yeah, well...        
           [all laugh]

771
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,456
        -Trinity Taylor.        
       -You look gorgeous.

772
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,991
       You're a follicular      
         tour de force.

773
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,392
    - What did you call her?

774
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:03,196
 - I gotta jump to Nelly's mom, 
    because that was amazing.

775
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,764
            I thought           
       you were hilarious.

776
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,499
   Your comedy is impeccable.

777
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:08,534
            - I want            
   an ABC Family sitcom, too!

778
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:11,236
   - You were stealing scenes,  
      and it was so right.

779
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:12,737
     Like, I could lick you     
           right now.

780
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:17,808
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown 
        Carrington Colby.

781
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,242
       - I love all this.

782
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:20,343
         The only thing         
    that's become predictable

783
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:22,645
         is that legging        
    with a boot and a corset.

784
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:25,180
  So I want to challenge you to 
think of a different silhouette.

785
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:29,517
    - In<i> 9021-Ho,</i> you weren't   
    really selling the lines.

786
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,751
          - I feel like         
         directing-wise,

787
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:34,454
  we did work with you the most 
      and we felt nervous.

788
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,456
    We felt nervous you were    
     going to be mad at us.

789
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,323
    - You know, it was times

790
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:40,392
        where I was like,       
  they really aren't buying it.

791
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,160
       And then, I started      
      getting into my head,

792
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:45,563
      like, I didn't really     
     have fun delivering it.

793
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:47,231
       - Thank you, Nina.

794
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,632
    Shake a leg, Shea Coulee.

795
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,368
     - So normally when you     
     come out on this runway

796
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,136
        in a bathing suit       
          and a jacket,

797
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,036
      I'm going to read you     
            to filth.

798
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,939
           But you put          
     so much character in it

799
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,073
        that I bought it.

800
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:58,773
        I know that girl.

801
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,541
      She's a working girl      
        in New York City

802
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,109
   by the Greyhound terminal.

803
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:05,612
- In your portrayal as Grandrea,
     you were so confident.

804
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,647
         - Your makeup,         
       your body language,

805
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,048
    all of it was perfection.

806
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,949
       - What a brilliant       
           character.

807
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,984
           I loved it.          
       - Thank you, Tori.

808
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,585
         - Up next, Aja.

809
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:16,520
    - Your makeup is blended,

810
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:18,555
        and it just looks       
     really, really pretty,

811
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:19,923
  and I love this hair on you.

812
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:23,726
    Tonight is quite possibly   
  the best you've ever looked.

813
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:26,195
            - As Ti--           
       How do you say it?

814
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:29,431
       - Bethani. Just say      
  that which we don't speak of.

815
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,167
   - Yes. We know her as that   
    which we don't speak of.

816
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,703
    You didn't feel grounded    
            in that.

817
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,171
       - You were playing       
           the bitch.

818
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:40,040
       She's a mean girl,       
and it felt kind of flat for me.

819
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,809
    - Now, Aja, you switched    
        with Shea Coulee.

820
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:46,679
    What frightened you about   
     playing the older role?

821
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:52,217
         - To be honest,        
    I just kind of...freaked.

822
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:55,153
           -Thank you.          
           -Thank you.

823
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:56,587
      - Thank you, ladies.

824
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:57,854
   While you untuck backstage,

825
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:00,489
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

826
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:05,494
   All right, now just between  
        us popular kids,

827
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:06,962
       what do you think?

828
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:07,729
           Valentina.

829
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:08,996
       - I thought she did      
        a really good job

830
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:11,865
       just as an actress       
    and embodying that part.

831
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,833
        - She was funny,        
    she was stumbling around,

832
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,167
          getting into          
      her drunk character.

833
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:18,837
 She was in character the whole 
 time until she came off camera

834
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,574
 to tell us that she used watch 
   <i> 90210</i> with her babysitter.

835
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:25,510
  Which made us feel real old.

836
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:26,177
         - Sasha Velour.

837
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,847
      - Her performance was     
 a little underwhelming for me,

838
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:31,582
    like she could have gone    
    so much further with it.

839
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:35,686
   - She could have sassed the  
 character up a little bit more.

840
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,354
        - Trinity Taylor.

841
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:39,489
      - She played the hell     
       out of Nelly's mom.

842
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:43,526
 She was fully Jennifer Coolidge
     and it was so, so good.

843
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:44,960
      - She's the ultimate      
         scene stealer.

844
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:47,195
          - Right down          
     to her messy lipstick,

845
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,095
   she had the character down.

846
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:50,764
     - Tonight was a really     
    strong night for Trinity.

847
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:53,633
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown      
           Ellis Ross.

848
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,769
      - Her acting, for me,     
     was a little bit lost.

849
00:34:56,771 --> 00:35:00,939
  - She alluded to there being  
    some friction on the set.

850
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,240
         What happened?

851
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:03,608
     - She was a little bit     
           defensive.

852
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,343
    - That's been an ongoing    
       storyline with her.

853
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:07,945
       - We couldn't tell       
        if she was angry

854
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:09,813
     that we were giving her    
           direction.

855
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,381
   - Trust me, she was angry.

856
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:13,516
          - Oh, really?         
        See, I told you.

857
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:15,618
    - She's out there keying    
       your car right now.

858
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,019
         - Yes, exactly.

859
00:35:17,021 --> 00:35:17,786
          Shea Coulee.

860
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:20,255
  - I thought she was fantastic 
    in the acting challenge.

861
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:22,724
       - Shea went for it       
         and then some.

862
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,759
   You couldn't help but fall   
  in love with this character.

863
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:26,994
    - But I was so surprised    
       when she walked out

864
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,428
         and she looked         
      completely different

865
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,862
     than she did yesterday.

866
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:32,397
  - She slayed the house down.

867
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,231
             - Aja.

868
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,999
          - The acting          
         gave me Aja-ta.

869
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,233
           -Oh, dear.           
    -I think it's interesting
