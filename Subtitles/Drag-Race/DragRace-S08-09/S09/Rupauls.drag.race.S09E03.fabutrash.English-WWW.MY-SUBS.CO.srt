﻿1
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,443
         - Aw, Jaymes.

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,879
           - Oh, no,            
  the first lipstick message.

3
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:17,714
        - I mean, Jaymes        
       was very insecure,

4
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:18,848
    and she just wasn't sure    
          of herself.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,217
        And this is such        
  a high pressure competition,

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,152
      you have to be sure       
          of yourself.

7
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:24,453
          - You know,           
   the second she walked in,

8
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:25,387
  I saw the fear in the eyes.

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,222
       And I just saw her       
         get defeated.

10
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:31,659
    - I honestly was really     
 surprised I was on the bottom.

11
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:33,327
             Like,              
    I was really surprised.

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,833
   I'm feeling so underdogged   
  because compared to Jaymes,

13
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,168
   I was like a 10 to a one.

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,137
  - How about you, Ms. Winner?  
      How are you feeling?

15
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,104
           (cheering)

16
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:46,904
    - I think you admittedly

17
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:49,840
    have the least amount of    
  experience of all the queens

18
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,174
        and you slayed.

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,177
      - I'm very grateful,      
  but it's a lot of pressure.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,811
      So I'm very focused

21
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:59,815
  to deliver to the next level  
       every single time.

22
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,050
  - I'm really looking forward  
      to knocking you out

23
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:03,951
   of your winner spot, okay?

24
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:04,985
          (all laugh)

25
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,988
        - Yes, she's won        
     a challenge. Whatever.

26
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,124
         Her confidence         
      is definitely ballsy

27
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,726
    for her only doing drag     
         for 10 months.

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,259
            - Whoo!

29
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:16,928
       - Is the bride sad       
 to take off her wedding dress?

30
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,628
         - I really am.

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,496
 - I'm not mad at you for that. 
         I understand.

32
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:22,832
  - I've been praying so hard   
   to<i> La Virgen de Guadalupe</i>

33
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,501
   and I feel like she's been   
     guiding me through it.

34
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,871
         - It's not fun         
     being the bridesmaid.

35
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:30,305
    I want to be the bride.

36
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,739
  I'm not here to play games.

37
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,775
  The next challenge is mine.

38
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,812
          - The winner          
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

39
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:41,013
   receives a one-year supply

        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.

00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,924
   - ♪ "RuPaul's Drag Race" ♪

45
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,158

47
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:02,530
     - Here were are again.

48
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,999
         - It's today.          
         - It's today.

49
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,900
          (all laugh)

50
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,134
          - ♪ Ah... ♪

51
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:10,803
    I'm coming off this high    
         of having won.

52
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:14,573
 The first queen has gone home, 
      and it feels great.

53
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,575
        It feels exactly        
    like I thought it would.

54
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:21,112
    Okay, guys, after, like,    
    the gymnastic challenge,

55
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:22,012
        what to expect?

56
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:24,247
        - I'm still sore        
       from cheerleading.

57
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:24,814
            - Girl.

58
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:27,149
        - So I'm hoping         
  it's not anything physical.

59
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,818
    - A knitting challenge.     
          (all laugh)

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,419
            (siren)

61
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:32,586
         - Whoo, girl!

62
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:35,388
     She done already done      
          had herses.

63
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,123
   - Oh, my God, oh, my God,    
          oh, my God.

64
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,292
     - To become America's      
      next drag superstar,

65
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,094
       you have to try on       
    a lot of glass slippers,

66
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:48,532
     kiss a bunch of frogs,     
  but don't be an evil queen.

67
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,201
           That role            
    has already been taken.

68
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,737
          (evil laugh)

69
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,343
      Hello, hello, hello.

70
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,877
     (cheers and applause)

71
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,112
          - Hello, Ru.          
         - Yes, ma'am.

72
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,313
        - Just a little         
         leopard print.

73
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:08,181
          - Now, what           
       do you guys think

74
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:12,652
    of the wax figure of me     
 on loan from Madame Tussauds?

75
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:13,319
          - Gorgeous.

76
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,321
        - I pray to her         
      before a challenge.

77
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,388
           - Really?            
            - Yeah.

78
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,157
        - Don't you love        
        the way her eyes

79
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,292
  follow you around the room?

80
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:24,895
    It's almost like there's    
   a hidden camera in there.

81
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:25,595
           - (gasps)

82
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:28,831
  - Watching your every move.

83
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,333
        Maybe there is.

84
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:33,001
             - Oh!

85
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:38,039
    - Ladies, don't let this    
 devastatingly beautiful queen

86
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,807
       cast an evil spell

87
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:43,277
       on your charisma,        
 uniqueness, nerve and talent.

88
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,012
    Because for this week's     
        maxi challenge,

89
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:51,451
  you need to create a totally  
  original fairytale princess.

90
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:55,154
      - I have no problem

91
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,855
        picturing myself        
         as a princess.

92
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,957
        I'm a jappy girl        
     who likes nice things.

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,894
    - First, you'll come up     
     with a memorable name

94
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:04,262
        and a mythology.

95
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:08,532
   Then you'll need to design   
        a fantasy frock

96
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:11,101
  to debut on the main stage.

97
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,536
         #DragPrincess

98
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,438
     And to help you bring      
  your princess story to life,

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,342
    you'll also be creating     
       a sassy sidekick.

100
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,042
            - Rawr.

101
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,577
    - And you'll be playing     
          both parts.

102
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:30,348
     - What? We have create     
       a little sidekick

103
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,850
       to have our heads        
   floating by our character.

104
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,552
         This is nuts.          
      Who thinks of this?

105
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:40,623
 - So, Cinderfellas, feel free  
  to use the magical materials

106
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,691
  from the Fabric Planet wall.

107
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:47,128
 Gentlemen, start your engines  
  and may the best woman win.

108
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,131
     (cheers and applause)      
            - Whoo!

109
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:55,402
   - Ooh. How are you feeling   
  about this challenge, girl?

110
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:59,072
      - I feel like I have      
      the new age mindset

111
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:00,206
   to kind of like make this

112
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,008
     extremely avant-garde      
       and high fashion.

113
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,775
           - Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:07,578
    - So I feel like I might    
   have this one in the bag.

115
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,345
    It's a design challenge,

116
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:12,816
        and I sew 80%--         
 no, 95% of everything I wear,

117
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:15,418
        so I'm known for        
   creating different looks,

118
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,055
  and I feel really confident   
that this might be my challenge.

119
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:25,326
        - What the fuck         
          am I doing?

120
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,127
         I do not sew.

121
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,931
    I've only made tote bags    
          and pillows.

122
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,098
              No.

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,765
        - Are you okay?

124
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,467
      - I'm gonna just try      
 and make something mermaid-y,

125
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,901
    something under-watery.

126
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,236
          - I'm doing           
     under the water, too.

127
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:41,937
    - Are you doing a fish?

128
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,871
  - I was gonna do a mermaid,

129
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,672
  but then, like, I was like,   
    there's too many people

130
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:46,707
  doing under the water stuff.

131
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,241
            - Great.            
            - Yeah.

132
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,876
           I don't--            
      Yeah, I'm terrified.

133
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:55,179
       - Ooh. What's this       
   that you got here, Kimora?

134
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:58,415
 - I'm going to be, obviously,  
      Tarzan's other wife.

135
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,884
  - How are you feeling about   
   going into this challenge?

136
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:03,586
   You were in the bottom two   
           last week.

137
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:04,954
      - And you don't sew.

138
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,722
           - I know.            
          I don't sew.

139
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,356
    I like to pay designers     
       to make my stuff.

140
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:12,460
     I'm your very spoiled      
          drag queen.

141
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:16,230
          Would Kim K.          
    sew her own outfits? No.

142
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:18,532
  - Well, if you pay designers  
       to do your stuff,

143
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,600
    how much will you pay me    
    to make your challenge?

144
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:23,135
           - I mean,            
     I have $400 right now.

145
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,937
           - I'll see           
      if I have some time.

146
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:26,971
         - I don't work         
        in a sweatshop.

147
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,105
           That's not           
     what I signed up for.

148
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:31,141
     This is not America's      
      Next Top Sweatshop.

149
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:33,976
  - Where you gonna put this?   
    Like, on your shoulder?

150
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,077
      - I just got the rat      
           for show.

151
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,012
        - Just because.         
 - I don't even really want it.

152
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:38,546
        - Can I have it?        
     - Yeah, take it, girl.

153
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,614
          - Thank you.          
  I think with this challenge,

154
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,149
      I'm wanting to show       
      that I'm not afraid

155
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,117
  to go in a risky direction.

156
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,319
      - What is all these       
       cockroaches, girl?

157
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,653
     - That's for my look.

158
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:49,854
     - What are you doing?

159
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:52,189
         - Like, sewer          
     underground princess.

160
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,357
       Like, very grungy        
       and gross kind of.

161
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:57,093
 Have, like, some kind of shit  
     growing off of my face

162
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,329
   and, like, very sewer rat.

163
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:03,631
      - I have never heard      
      of a sewage princess

164
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,199
       in my entire life.

165
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,934
     What kind of princess      
            is that?

166
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:07,701
          Here we go.

167
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:11,771
   Better watch out, because    
 the judges don't play around.

168
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:12,538
       She could go home.

169
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,339
    - Thank you for the rat.    
       - You're welcome.

170
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:16,774
     - Come on, Templeton.      
             - Aah!

171
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,441
         - Coming up...

172
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,843
      You came very close       
     to winning last week.

173
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,512
     - Ms. Thang, she won.      
     She better watch out.

174
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,813
        Fuck that bitch!

175
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,549
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

176
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:31,052
        (RuPaul laughs)

177
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,154
      - What's the story?

178
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:35,755
     - Once upon a time....     
           - ♪ Ahh ♪

179
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,623
          - There was           
     a beautiful princess.

180
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,324
     - For this challenge,      
       we have to create

181
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:44,162
  a fantasy fairytale princess  
     and a sassy sidekick.

182
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,062
      Oh, my God, Trinity,

183
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,564
      you've never looked       
         more beautiful

184
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,932
     than you do right now.     
       - You're a bitch.

185
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,134
      You're such a bitch.      
           - (laughs)

186
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,535
  - So what are you going for?

187
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,270
    You're going for, like,     
         sea princess?

188
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,272
           - My whole           
       Instagram branding

189
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,209
   is based on the fact that    
  I ride the subway to my gig.

190
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,377
          - Okay, yes.          
 - So I'm Princess Subway Fish.

191
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,246
   - We were given the brief    
        to come up with

192
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:08,016
a mythological background story 
      for our princesses.

193
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:12,020
         - Introducing          
       Princess Forella.

194
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,756
           - Someday,           
     she'll be the most...

195
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,824
      What's an adjective?

196
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,793
     What is an adjective?

197
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:23,463
       Isn't an adjective       
       where you, like...

198
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,031
         That's a noun.

199
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,199
         - It's a word          
   that describes something.

200
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,833
   - Like, what do you mean?

201
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,301
      - You're beautiful.       
  "Beautiful" is an adjective.

202
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,435
         - So beautiful         
       is the adjective.

203
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,670
           - Mm-hmm.            
 - I'm going to put delicious.

204
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,504
     Is that an adjective?

205
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,305
          Yeah, that's          
       a super adjective.

206
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,140
  - Come on, English lessons.

207
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:42,009
  - Ah, thank God I'm pretty.

208
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,245
      - Hey, kitty girls.

209
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,512
             - Hey.             
            - Hello.

210
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:49,915
   - So how are things going    
     in the magic queendom?

211
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,249
            - Great.            
            - Good.

212
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,784
        Hi, Farrah Moan.        
             - Ru!

213
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,318
             - Ru!              
            - Rrrru!

214
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,988
    - What kind of princess     
 will you be in this challenge?

215
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,290
        - She's gonna be        
    an underwater socialite.

216
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:05,927
     She's gonna be, like,      
on all the underwater tabloids.

217
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,128
          - Oh, okay.

218
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,896
        Now, do you sew?

219
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,530
          - I'm smart           
    in a lot of other ways,

220
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:15,801
  but when it comes to fabrics  
     and needles and stuff,

221
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:17,536
     I'm just not as, uh...

222
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:21,106
      uh, what's the word?

223
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,640
         - Proficient.

224
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,308
      - Proficient, yeah.

225
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,842
        - It's Season 9.

226
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:28,311
        How do you walk         
       into the workroom

227
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,846
  without knowing how to sew?

228
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:31,513
        That's just sad.

229
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,849
    - How will you make sure    
    that you shine through?

230
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:40,054
  - Um...I'm just going to be   
      my cute little self

231
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:43,357
        and pray to your        
    wax figurine over there

232
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,727
      that y'all like it.

233
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,829
            - Okay.             
     Can't wait to see her.

234
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:51,865
        Thanks, Farrah.         
      - Thank you so much.

235
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,934
       - Aja from the BK.

236
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:55,601
          - Ah, Ru-Ru.

237
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,770
  - Now, you know how to sew,   
   so you got lots of skills.

238
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,337
             - Yes.

239
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,939
          - So tell me          
      about your princess.

240
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,874
    - Her name is Disastah.

241
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:06,109
  She is a volcanic eruption,   
           basically.

242
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,077
     She's kind of inspired     
           by my mom.

243
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,112
      She's like an angry       
      Puerto Rican woman.

244
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:11,947
           - Really.            
   - I have a tattoo of her.

245
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:12,614
        It's right here.

246
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:13,681
     - That's your mother.      
             - Yes.

247
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,716
       When she got mad,        
    you see the red come up

248
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:18,285
       and her baby hairs       
    will start crimpling up.

249
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,386
  It's like an eruption, girl.

250
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:21,421
       - Now, how are you       
          gonna shine?

251
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:23,189
         - I just feel          
     so confident about it.

252
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,425
I'm just like, I'm gonna do this
    and it's gonna be cute.

253
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,760
           - You know           
    I've heard that before.

254
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,562
       Well, I can't wait       
        to see Disastah.

255
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,664
    I'll let you get to it.

256
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,932
           Valentina.

257
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,401
  - I'm ready for my close-up,  
          Mr. DeMille.

258
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:41,137
       - Oh, my goodness.       
      Can I see your eyes?

259
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,873
          - Um, well,           
     you see, the thing is,

260
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,675
    it's my very first time     
       shaving my brows,

261
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,677
  and I'm kind of like nervous  
      because I don't have

262
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,446
       my Brooke Shields        
    "Blue Lagoon" eyebrows.

263
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,481
     - Oh! Oh, my goodness,     
         look at there.

264
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,316
       Why don't you just       
      shave them all off?

265
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:59,887
- Well, because I want to still 
have a bit of boy brow to draw.

266
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:00,520
           - Uh-huh.

267
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:03,155
     - So that I don't look     
       completely crazy.

268
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,524
   - Why are we looking at me   
      when you said that?

269
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:06,525
            (laughs)

270
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:10,462
    Okay, so I want to hear     
      about your princess.

271
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:11,830
    - She's an ice princess.

272
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,165
  She comes from planet Azula.

273
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,667
   - And that's nowhere near    
         Azusa, is it?

274
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,636
      - Not anywhere near       
       Azusa, California.

275
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,370
        - Yeah. (laughs)

276
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,038
  - I have a big imagination,

277
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,739
     and I'm really excited     
        to get started.

278
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,441
      - See you out there.      
         - Thanks, Ru.

279
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,009
       - Trinity Taylor.

280
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,511
          Now tell me           
      about your princess.

281
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:31,378
        What's her name?

282
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,345
      - Farella Aquapussy.

283
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,714
      - She sounds juicy.       
           And salty.

284
00:11:34,716 --> 00:11:37,183
      - I kind of like it.      
          - I do, too.

285
00:11:37,185 --> 00:11:40,352
          - So tell me          
      about her sidekick.

286
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,221
      - Well, her sidekick      
    is Stanky the Starfish.

287
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:46,924
  And I was going to go with,   
you know, a chocolate starfish.

288
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,625
           - Uh-huh.            
   - But I decided, you know,

289
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,593
           kids want            
      bright colors, so...

290
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:53,329
       - Kids don't know        
 they want a chocolate starfish

291
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:55,431
       until they've had        
     a chocolate starfish.

292
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,498
          - Oh, right.          
          - You know?

293
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,432
  - I love chocolate starfish.

294
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,567
   - Are you kidding? I live    
   for chocolate starfishes.

295
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,002
        But this is not         
     a chocolate starfish.

296
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,870
    What kind of a starfish     
            is this?

297
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:06,272
    - Well, he's going to be    
      a country starfish.

298
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:07,906
  - Like from Cracker Barrel?

299
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:08,673
          (both laugh)

300
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:12,243
    Now, you came very close    
     to winning last week.

301
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,244
     Any bitterness there?

302
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,746
      - No. I came close,       
       but you know what?

303
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,914
   I do know that Ms. Thang,    
            she won.

304
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,115
          Even though           
     she's been doing drag

305
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:23,285
   a whole lot less than me,    
     she's younger than me,

306
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,787
        Fuck that bitch.        
           - (laughs)

307
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,755
    - She better watch out.     
            - Okay.

308
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,591
       - 'Cause Aquapussy       
           is coming.

309
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:33,427
      - Well, I can't wait      
        to see Aquapussy

310
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:35,195
   out there on that runway.

311
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,496
           - Me, too.

312
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:38,397
           - (laughs)

313
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,066
       All right, ladies.       
  Tomorrow on the main stage,

314
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:44,536
       you'll be debuting       
   your fairytale princesses.

315
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:49,007
          So good luck          
     and don't fuck it up!

316
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,377
   - I don't want to do this.

317
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,046
         I don't know.          
         This is hard.

318
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,580
  I don't know what I'm doing.

319
00:12:57,582 --> 00:13:01,183
       I just really want       
        whatever I make

320
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,285
      to look good enough       
          to be safe,

321
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:05,420
         because I know         
   I'm not going to pump out

322
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,488
        no award-winning        
      mermaid gown, honey.

323
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,490
     I just don't even know     
        where to begin.

324
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:12,926
- Why don't you find a glue gun 
 and your bra and work on that?

325
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:18,431
 - You know, I kind of pictured 
     gluing fabric on a bra

326
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,565
      being a lot easier.

327
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,234
         This is, like,         
      complicated as fuck.

328
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,970
   Like, I don't want to have   
   to cut any piece of fabric

329
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,538
     and put it over this.

330
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,639
       - No, you're not.

331
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,473
     - This one won't fit.

332
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,842
  I can't get it to fit over.   
             Look.

333
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,709
       - It's okay. Move.

334
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,812
       Sometimes you just       
      gotta jump in, girl.

335
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,180
       - Oh, I love you.

336
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,749
        - I love Farrah         
      and she's my bestie,

337
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,718
    but she literally sounds    
   like a child all the time.

338
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,653
         It would make          
    the world of difference

339
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,355
       if she would just        
    stop bitching and do it.

340
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,222
       Just do it, girl.

341
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,890
        Don't be afraid         
      of hot glue, bitch.

342
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:49,790
       You a drag queen.

343
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,291
    So what I would suggest     
             you do

344
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,360
    is, like, glue shit all     
   the way up this one side.

345
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:56,095
     I'm going to give you      
    this base to work with,

346
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:58,330
       and then I'm gonna       
  let you go shell from there.

347
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:01,499
          Find, like,           
  your shiny stuff, seashells.

348
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,268
     - Oh, I broke a piece      
       of this starfish.

349
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,371
            - Farrah            
   is one of those princesses

350
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,906
   that whines all the time.

351
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:12,174
          Suck it up.           
     This is a competition.

352
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:13,975
     We're here to compete      
         for $100,000.

353
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:18,112
  One minute you're in and the  
next minute, you're gone, honey.

354
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:20,013
         - Coming up...

355
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:23,416
    - Are you afraid of what    
   America is going to think

356
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:24,950
         of your makeup         
       without face tone?

357
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,520
     - Nope, 'cause I think     
    I look almost the same.

358
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,723
       - Awkward silence.

359
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,892
  (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)

360
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,294
        (RuPaul laughs)

361
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,762
         - Oh, my God.

362
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,497
         - Get to work.         
         - Here we go.

363
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:44,898
       - Back here again.

364
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,066
  - Good morning, cucu world.

365
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,801
           - (laughs)

366
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,402
    - It's elimination day.

367
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,737
          I'm nervous,          
      but I'm also excited

368
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,339
  about my fairytale princess   
            outfit.

369
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:59,743
     I'm about to give them     
        Sewer Princess.

370
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,677
    - So when you say cucu,

371
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,446
        is like the hole        
    or is it like the butt?

372
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,080
             'Cause             
     I'm a little confused.

373
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,048
     - You know, it can be,     
      like, the butthole,

374
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,383
       but let me explain       
     the story real quick.

375
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:11,183
      When I was a child,

376
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,152
      mom doesn't want us       
   to say bad words at home.

377
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,587
          So one day,           
     I was three years old,

378
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,522
    trying to tell her that     
  I need to go to the bathroom

379
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:22,893
        'cause I need to        
   from my culo to go ca-ca.

380
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,527
         She slapped me         
       with a chancleta.

381
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,996
   She said, like, mira mijo,   
   let me tell you something.

382
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:29,331
 You're not gonna say bad word  
      here in this house!

383
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,766
    So I was, like, scared.     
    I was, like, what to do?

384
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:34,869
 I mean, what do you call this  
         in your back?

385
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:39,506
       So scared one day        
     after that situation,

386
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:42,809
      I said, cucu, mama,       
     ca-ca, pee-pee. Okay.

387
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,377
        And since that,         
          I say cucu.

388
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,712
         - So do I have         
        a big cucu, too?

389
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:47,379
        - Girl, you do.

390
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,148
      Well, I have a cucu,      
   but you have a CuCu, girl!

391
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,152
     - Oh, it feels so good     
   to have these brows back.

392
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,787
        - I see you had         
        an eyebrow lift.

393
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,622
        - Just a little.

394
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,258
    - Are you afraid of what    
   America is going to think

395
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,792
         of your makeup         
       without face tone?

396
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:07,129
     - Nope, 'cause I think     
    I look almost the same.

397
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,032
       - Awkward silence.

398
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,968
- Everybody can get quiet, but I
think I look the same in photos.

399
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,137
       - Sometimes girls        
 that come up via social media

400
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,705
    can get a lot of praise

401
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:22,475
        for the way they        
   present themselves online.

402
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:23,742
     You got your filters.

403
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,844
     You got your Facetune.     
        You got all that.

404
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:29,714
       However, it's how        
     you apply that makeup,

405
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:33,517
     because sometimes when     
   people see you in person,

406
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,753
   they can get a little bit    
         disappointed.

407
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,924
         - So, Trinity,         
    when you were in Orlando

408
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:45,794
 when that situation happened,  
  like, were you freaked out?

409
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,962
            I mean,             
   I know you're from there.

410
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,330
             Yeah.

411
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:56,103
    - Um, I actually wasn't     
in Orlando at that very moment,

412
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,271
     but I'm a very former      
          Miss Pulse.

413
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:59,138
           - (gasps)

414
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,241
   - And I entertained there    
   literally the week before

415
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:03,208
     on their Latin night,

416
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,876
      'cause that happened      
      on their Latin night.

417
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:06,410
         So it's scary          
        to think, like,

418
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,545
         that literally         
      could have been me.

419
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:11,447
       And so immediately       
        my thought is...

420
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,981
      - Call your friends,      
           I'm sure.

421
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,015
  - Oh, my God, who do I know?

422
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:16,017
         - Did you lose         
   a lot of people, Trinity?

423
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,985
     - Well, I didn't know      
       any of the people

424
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,119
         that actually          
       lost their lives.

425
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,753
         I knew several         
      of the entertainers

426
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:24,490
      that were trapped in      
the dressing room that escaped.

427
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:25,858
   A lady that I worked with    
         in my day job,

428
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:32,197
 one of her daughters had just  
   graduated nursing school.

429
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,731
            And then            
   her life was taken over...

430
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:37,601
         - Oh, my God.          
     - Like, for no reason.

431
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,270
     - I'm so sorry, girl.

432
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:43,006
    - Well, let me tell you     
   a story about the tragedy.

433
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,507
      - I know you know--       
       you probably knew

434
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:45,674
         a lot of them          
      because they were...

435
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:48,043
   - June 11, I was supposed    
     to perform that night,

436
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:49,511
   but I have to reschedule.

437
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:53,214
   So Kenya Michaels, that is   
 the cast director that night,

438
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:54,848
        she said, like,         
        it's okay, mija.

439
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,749
         We can, like,          
        reschedule you.

440
00:17:56,751 --> 00:18:00,185
    And then, like, we were     
     performing in Houston

441
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,120
       and we get, like,        
       the text message.

442
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,355
       Like, oh, my God,        
  we are here in the bathroom.

443
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:05,222
     We can't do anything.

444
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,757
   There's a guy with a gun,    
   like, shooting everybody.

445
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,826
   And I'm like, oh, my God,    
        are you serious?

446
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:13,295
      And, unfortunately,       
       one of my friends

447
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:16,197
     died in that incident,     
            Martin.

448
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,331
       And he was, like--

449
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,800
            I'm like            
   two or three hours before,

450
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:20,834
         like, Cynthia,         
        you're not here.

451
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:21,935
        You're supposed         
        to have a show.

452
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,736
           That's why           
      I came here tonight.

453
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,404
      And I'm like, baby.       
         - Oh, Cynthia.

454
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,839
         - No, no, no.          
      I just rescheduled.

455
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,740
  Oh. Do you want to go home?

456
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,841
        And he was like,        
       no, you know what?

457
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,609
       I'm going to stay.       
 I'm going to have a cute time.

458
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,576
      I miss you so much.

459
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,677
           And he was           
    one of my first dancers,

460
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,179
       like, 10 years ago       
   when I started doing drag.

461
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:41,216
   So it was a very traumatic   
    situation for everybody.

462
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,518
      We never expect that      
      a tragedy like this

463
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,953
    happen in our community     
     or happen in our clubs

464
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,555
       because we thought       
     that we finally built

465
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:51,124
          a safe place          
       for our community.

466
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,526
       - We are not safe        
        completely yet,

467
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,195
         and we're not          
       accepted 100% yet.

468
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:59,064
    But we have to continue     
       to live our lives.

469
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:05,703
We can't be stuck in our houses 
 and afraid to go out and live.

470
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:06,970
    - Preach, girl. Preach!

471
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:09,539
   - What happened in Orlando   
       at Pulse Nightclub

472
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:15,778
  was a defining and shocking   
     moment for gay people.

473
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
       And the fact that        
   it was an act of violence

474
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:23,118
  against LGBT people of color  
   is not insignificant here.

475
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,752
        - Family, famo.

476
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:26,220
       - Love you, girls.       
           - Family.

477
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:29,489
  - It's so important as queer  
 entertainers to lead the way.

478
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:34,827
    We need to come together    
 and be proudly visibly queer.

479
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:35,627
      - And you know what?

480
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:36,928
           Also, drag           
      is a brilliant place

481
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,130
        to work through         
       feelings of pain.

482
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,831
    - Girl, drag is therapy.

483
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,898
            - It is.

484
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,332
   - We can't move backwards.

485
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,100
    We need to stay strong.

486
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:58,112

  stepsister Michelle Visage.

        It's off to work

  glass slipper in my bedroom.

499
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,081
    - It's a size 12, right?    
           - Exactly.

00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:51,590
          (all laugh)

503
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:53,291
     - So glad you're here.

504
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,959
           This week,           
    we challenged our queens

505
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:58,295
    to bring their princess     
       fantasies to life,

506
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:01,364
          and tonight,          
they're bringing it to the ball.

507
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:04,500
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines

508
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:06,969
  and may the best woman win.

509
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:07,602
          Coming up...

510
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:11,038
         - I literally          
       had no clue at all

511
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,507
   what was going on tonight.

512
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,144
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

513
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,513
        (RuPaul laughs)

514
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,648
        - Category is...        
           First up,

515
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,119
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,      
       Princess Cuculina.

516
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,855
    - Hi, my name is Brulee.

517
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,892
      I'm here to protect       
       Princess Cuculina

518
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,727
      from any booty slap

519
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:43,132
  and to show her that she can  
   bring peace, love and sex

520
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,967
  to all the entire universe.

521
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:51,306
   My advice is a happy cucu    
is one that is clean for others.

522
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,941
       - One in the pink?

523
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,809
          (all laugh)

524
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:59,179
          Peppermint,           
    Princess Carcinogenetta.

525
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,815
           - My name            
    is Petey the Pilot Light

526
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:04,883
        and I'm flaming.

527
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:12,724
 I live to help make her dream  
  of fire unsafety come true.

528
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:15,560
  My advice to her is simple.

529
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:19,897
       Burn, baby, burn.

530
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:20,497
             Rawr.

531
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,432
 - Oh, it's not just her pussy  
        that's on fire.

532
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,434
       (Michelle laughs)

533
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:26,836
         - Farrah Moan,         
       Princess Pacifica.

534
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,904
    - Well, it's the snatch     
          of the day.

535
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:31,640
           - My name            
    is Fablina the blowfish.

536
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,343
    I'm Princess Pacifica's     
        royal publicist.

537
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,578
        When I first met        
       Princess Pacifica,

538
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,513
        she was abusing         
      her royal privileges

539
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:41,915
 by partying from the Atlantic  
        to the Pacific.

540
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,385
    I'm here to protect her     
 from the grueling sharkarazzi

541
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:49,088
  and transform her reputation  
     from swampy socialite

542
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,491
    to responsible princess     
        of the Pacific.

543
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:56,294
        - Charlie Hides,        
      Princess Climaxica.

544
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:58,429
           - My name            
   is Isabella Snatchpacker,

545
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:01,365
  and I'm Princess Climaxica's  
        lady in waiting.

546
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,866
          I first met           
       Princess Climaxica

547
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:06,970
when she was studying languages 
     at Galaxy University.

548
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:09,205
       Oh, she just loves       
        foreign tongue.

549
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,106
   She's a cunning linguist,    
           you know.

550
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:16,211
  I'm here to protect her from  
 bad puns and double entendres.

551
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,245
        How am I doing?

552
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:20,014
  - Copper? I hardly know her.  
          (all laugh)

553
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:24,051
           - Eureka,            
  Princess You-Reek-of-Daria.

554
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,687
          - Here comes          
   Princess You-Reek-of-Daria

555
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:30,056
    from the sewer kingdom.

556
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:34,693
   I am her faithful servant    
          Woof-train.

557
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:36,961
          The princess          
   was kicked out of topland.

558
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:40,564
      The army banned her       
  to reign only in the sewers.

559
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:48,638
 I live to help make her dreams 
 of being on the top a reality.

560
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:55,344
       - Alexis Michelle,       
     Princess #SubwayFish.

561
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,780
  - My name is #SubwayTadpole,

562
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:02,216
     Princess SubwayFish's      
         chief swimmer.

563
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:03,550
   We met for the first time

564
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:07,186
    when Princess SubwayFish    
was taking the train to her gig.

565
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:11,890
  Whenever she bugging, I just  
  tell her, just keep fishing.

566
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,324
   - Aw, don't be so crabby.

567
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,492
  - There's a cream for that.

568
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:19,829
         - Kimora Blac,         
     Princess Banana Lady.

569
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,797
   - My name is Funky Monkey,

570
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:27,769
  Banana Lady's cute bodyguard  
      from Banana Kingdom.

571
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,270
    I am here to protect her

572
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:34,074
from all the big bad jungle men 
      with small bananas.

573
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:34,841
       I love to help her

574
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:39,345
         make her dream         
  of banana digging come true.

575
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,846
        She is so rich,

576
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:44,616
    she got all the bananas     
       she's ever wanted.

577
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:48,119
         - Nina Bo'nina         
      Brown-Pinkett-Smith,

578
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:51,122
       Princess Zathena.

579
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,857
       - My name is Ink.

580
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,024
    I knew Princess Zathena

581
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:57,494
       back when she was        
 a little hard-headed Martian.

582
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,397
  She was always the wild one   
         of the bunch,

583
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,399
        wanting to breed        
      with the human race.

584
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:06,269
     I'm here to teach her      
      to love who she is.

585
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,538
    You are from the planet     
       Bad Bitch Uranium,

586
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,374
    so you have to represent    
      for the bad bitches.

587
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:15,410
  - I actually had a bad batch  
        of Uranium once.

588
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:16,177
       (Michelle laughs)

589
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,146
   I sold it to the Russians.   
     - I remember that day.

590
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:22,149
        - Sasha Velour,         
        Princess Uglina.

591
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,784
      - Where my birds at?      
        (RuPaul laughs)

592
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:28,154
       - My name is Lunk        
       from Self Doubtia.

593
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:32,558
     I'm Princess Uglina's      
       imaginary friend.

594
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,727
            It was I            
   who trapped her in a cage,

595
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:40,231
     filling her mind with      
    self doubt and weakness.

596
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:43,701
      But Princess Uglina       
      wasn't scared of me.

597
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:47,604
    She embraced my darkness    
      and showed me love,

598
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:52,642
      so I opened the cage      
      and I set her free.

599
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:56,445
         - Shea Coulee,         
       Princess Aquaria.

600
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,513
    - My name is Moon Pearl,

601
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:03,050
       Princess Aquaria's       
     ice fairy from Uranus.

602
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:07,320
  Princess Aquaria was born in  
the battle for love and freedom

603
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:11,857
   when her star mother fused   
  with the Queen Moon Diamond.

604
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,326
  Whenever she's feeling lost,  
          I remind her

605
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:17,095
     that her guiding star      
          lives within

606
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:19,664
   and that she holds the key   
         to unlock it.

607
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,501
  She'll be the most sickening  
   princess in the universe.

608
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:27,705
    - Why don't you come up     
    and seaweed me sometime?

609
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:29,006
            No? No?

610
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:31,942
   Valentina, Princess Vira.

611
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,944
    - Where is Vira's wang?

612
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:39,482
      - My name is Netty,       
Princess Vira's shady godmother.

613
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:40,783
             I live             
     to help make her dream

614
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:45,988
 of freezing over the universe  
      via shade come true.

615
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,990
      My advice is simple:

616
00:26:47,992 --> 00:26:49,591
         hate everyone.

617
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:52,994
            Someday             
    she'll be the shadiest,

618
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:56,197
   most evilest queen of all

619
00:26:56,199 --> 00:27:00,267
            and live            
     hatefully ever after.

620
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:03,236
   - Aja, Princess Disastah.

621
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,404
        - I almost wore         
 that same outfit today, so...

622
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:06,938
           - Did you?           
             - Yep.

623
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,906
     - My name is Dasistah,

624
00:27:08,908 --> 00:27:14,511
  and I am Princess Disastah's  
          smoke cloud.

625
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,479
         I live to make         
      her dreams come true

626
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:21,584
         of coal mining         
  and becoming a gold digger.

627
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,887
       Someday she'll be        
     the most ashy princess

628
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:28,957
        and she'll live         
     flamingly ever after.

629
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:32,527
       - Orange you glad        
    you got fire insurance?

630
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:33,327
      (Michelle chuckles)

631
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:38,031
       - Trinity Taylor,        
    Princess Aquapussy. Oh.

632
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,199
      - Oh, surf and turf.

633
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,168
           - My name            
    is Stanky the Starfish,

634
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,104
  the royal redneck counselor.

635
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:46,838
          We first met

636
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,474
       when the princess        
  was in the waterland clinic

637
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,442
    hitting her itch cream.

638
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:56,145
    It was for her outbreak,    
           clam-idia.

639
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,212
      I hope that someday

640
00:27:57,214 --> 00:28:00,815
     she can find the cure      
         for this WTD.

641
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:05,019
        That stands for         
   water transmitted disease.

642
00:28:05,021 --> 00:28:08,489
           - (laughs)           
  Ooh, pass the tartar sauce.

643
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:10,424
          (all laugh)

644
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,091
         - Coming up...

645
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:12,959
      - I'm no seamstress,      
      but that looks like

646
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,094
       a piece of fabric        
       around your waist.

647
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,930
        - Your sidekick         
      had no personality.

648
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:19,564
      - Fucking go for it.

649
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:22,333
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

650
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,636
        (RuPaul laughs)

651
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:26,536
       - Welcome, ladies.

652
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,806
     When I call you name,      
      please step forward.

653
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:35,576
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,      
         Charlie Hides,

654
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:37,878
            Eureka,

655
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,382
        Alexis Michelle,        
         Sasha Velour,

656
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:45,985
      Nina Bo-nina Brown,

657
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:47,753
          Shea Coulee.

658
00:28:47,755 --> 00:28:51,857
      Ladies, you're safe.

659
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,994
    You may leave the stage.

660
00:28:58,064 --> 00:28:59,997
     Ladies, you represent

661
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:03,333
          this week's           
    beauties and the beasts.

662
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:03,933
             - Oh.

663
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:05,601
          - Let's hear          
        from the judges,

664
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,636
   starting with Peppermint.

665
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:10,905
   - I just liked the way you   
created this kind of fire idea.

666
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,474
      I think the details       
  on the dress are impressive.

667
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,709
           - I loved            
     Petey the Pilot Light.

668
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:16,376
          - Thank you.

669
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:20,012
     When I was a teenager,     
  I was cooking at home alone

670
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,180
     and the entire kitchen     
        caught on fire,

671
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:24,482
  and I've been deathly afraid  
         of fire since.

672
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:26,684
           So I said,           
      let me do something

673
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:28,552
     that's going to tackle     
            my fear.

674
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:31,721
           - Only you           
   can prevent grease fires.

675
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:32,788
           - (laughs)

676
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,156
    - Next up, Farrah Moan.

677
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:37,125
         - Every year,          
  Ru and Michelle tell people

678
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:37,925
    you cannot come out here

679
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,826
     with a piece of fabric     
   wrapped around your waist.

680
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:41,928
     And I'm no seamstress,     
      but that looks like

681
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,931
       a piece of fabric        
   wrapped around your waist.

682
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:48,034
- The sidekick, the eye make-up 
     thing was distracting

683
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,968
  'cause to me, it looked like

684
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,671
 you were reading a script that 
 was maybe down in your hands.

685
00:29:52,673 --> 00:29:53,972
            - I was.            
           - Oh, see?

686
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:56,708
 - I was just kind of let down  
      with the character.

687
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,511
   Like, this is your chance,   
     so fucking go for it.

688
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:03,714
    - Up next, Kimora Blac.

689
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:04,314
            - Hello.

690
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,183
  - You didn't really sell me   
   on what your princess is.

691
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,051
            For me,             
   that was a little lacking.

692
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:11,987
           - And then           
   your sidekick was robotic

693
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:14,322
           and really           
      had no personality.

694
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,122
       - You seemed like

695
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,958
     you just couldn't wait     
      for it to get over.

696
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,725
         - For so long,

697
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:22,061
    I've been hiding behind     
   a breastplate and padding.

698
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,262
        I'm pretty known        
          for my butt,

699
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:25,197
     and I've been padding      
          for so long

700
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,699
        that I'm kind of        
      uncomfortable again.

701
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,601
      And it's been hard.

702
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:33,636
   - Thank you, Kimora Blac.

703
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:34,470
          - Thank you.

704
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:36,972
     - Up next, Valentina.

705
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,306
         - I wrote down         
       Linda Evangelista.

706
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:41,642
         The smoky eye          
  and the nude lip, I like it.

707
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:43,543
        (RuPaul laughs)

708
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,611
         - This outfit          
      is really gorgeous,

709
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:46,912
       and your sidekick,

710
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:49,681
   I loved that it was about    
         shade and ice.

711
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,983
     - Because oftentimes,      
          evil people

712
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,685
  come in beautiful packages,   
      as we see every day.

713
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,554
         - Oh, my God.          
           - (laughs)

714
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,088
    - Thank you, Valentina.

715
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,389
           - Gracias.

716
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,656
        - Next up, Aja.

717
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:05,693
         - I literally          
       had no clue at all

718
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:07,161
   what was going on tonight

719
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:10,297
        with your story         
       as your princess.

720
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,365
       - She's a volcano,       
      she's from Brooklyn,

721
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:13,966
      she's from bad side,      
          she's banji.

722
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:14,900
  She's just going to the club

723
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:17,769
      to go hang out with       
  her little clouds and stuff.

724
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,103
    - Did anybody get that?

725
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:19,903
             - No.              
             - No.

726
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:23,306
      I think that even if      
    you wanted to be banji,

727
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:24,240
    there was a way to do it

728
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:26,075
      and have it just be       
    slightly more polished.

729
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:30,012
      - I also think that       
   your makeup is very dark.

730
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,214
    - Yeah, we can't really     
         see your eyes.

731
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:36,051
  - And it's been kind of dark  
      this whole journey.

732
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:39,120
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.

733
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,455
      Princess Aquapussy.

734
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:42,622
         - When I first         
        heard your name,

735
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,590
      I just kept thinking      
        of James Bond...

736
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:47,059
    (imitating Sean Connery)    
    like Princess Aquapussy.

737
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:47,959
          (all laugh)

738
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,593
          - You know,           
       I loved this look.

739
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:51,628
         I thought that         
   from a fashion standpoint,

740
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,996
    that this is really fun.

741
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,131
     And then you showed us     
         your starfish.

742
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,132
         - Itch cream.

743
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:57,266
    - You come across to me     
        as pageant girl,

744
00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,635
        so seeing you do        
     something like Stanky

745
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:02,504
     is just going to bode      
      really well for you.

746
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,304
    Keeping with that comedy

747
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:05,472
         is a good road         
      for you to go down.

748
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:06,606
          - Thank you.

749
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,975
   - Thank you, my pretties.

750
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,276
  I think we've heard enough.

751
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,544
  While you untuck backstage,

752
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:14,846
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

753
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,983
  All right. Now, just between  
     us wicked stepmothers,

754
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:22,419
       what do you think,       
   starting with Peppermint?

755
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,354
      - Peppermint made me      
   very, very happy tonight.

756
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,623
The minute she stepped onstage, 
 you knew what she was selling.

757
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,658
     - I love when someone      
   takes an inanimate object

758
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,126
     and makes a character      
           out of it.

759
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:34,562
   - She used something that    
  wasn't a really good memory

760
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:36,830
   and turned it into a plus.

761
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,331
           I thought            
       it was very smart.

762
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,131
          Farrah Moan.

763
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,267
  - Obviously, she's gorgeous,  
   but there was no presence.

764
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:44,202
          It was just           
      a huge, giant mess.

765
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,837
        - Her blowfish,         
      it was a great idea,

766
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,905
           but I left           
     a little unsatisfied.

767
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:51,107
 It just--that closed eye thing 
          didn't work.

768
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:54,176
  I was more distracted by it   
    than I was entertained.

769
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,378
 - I have a secret to tell you. 
            - What?

770
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,646
   - My eyes have been closed   
        the whole show.

771
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:00,714
       (Michelle laughs)        
            - What?

772
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:02,482
         - Kimora Blac.

773
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:03,149
        - Funky Monkey.

774
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:06,252
        It was like that        
     Teen Miss USA pageant

775
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:08,254
  who said, most US Americans

776
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,923
          of the Korea          
     or the South Africa...

777
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,791
    - It was hard to watch,     
         I have to say.

778
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:13,992
     - I think we all need      
        to take a moment

779
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,361
         to talk about          
  the bravest struggle of all,

780
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:21,265
 coming out here and telling us 
     about her struggle...

781
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,232
        - Her struggle.

782
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,199
  - With not wearing hip pads.

783
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,968
    - Not wearing hip pads?     
            My God!

784
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,704
        Can you be alive        
   and still be made a saint?

785
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,440
       - No, but I think        
   we can make arrangements.

786
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,841
           - (laughs)

787
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,942
           Valentina.

788
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,311
       - Three for three.       
 Each episode, you look at her

789
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,345
        and we've gotten        
         to this point

790
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,146
   where we can't wait to see   
      what she looks like

791
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,347
         because she's          
     so frigging beautiful,

792
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,582
   we all just want to go up    
       and lick her face.

793
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,917
    - Both of her characters    
         were stunning

794
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,451
    as far as presentation.

795
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:46,251
      - And I have to say,

796
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,752
     I was really surprised     
        with her comedy.

797
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,987
           I thought            
     she really went there.

798
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:50,654
             - Aja.

799
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,256
     - Aja definitely chose     
        the right name:

800
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,324
       Princess Disastah.

801
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:55,957
           - (laughs)

802
00:33:55,959 --> 00:34:00,494
   - Because that was an epic   
     proportion earthquake.

803
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:04,531
    - I don't understand why    
  the chaps with the volcano.

804
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:08,134
      - Well, the costume       
      didn't say volcano.

805
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:10,669
      It said Heat Miser.

806
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,170
           - (laughs)

807
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:16,407
       - She's charming,        
  but it was a hot lava mess.

808
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,374
       - Trinity Taylor.

809
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:18,742
   - I liked the whole look.    
      It's very Kooky Sue.

810
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:23,580
 - And then Stanky the Starfish 
    was a great counterpart.

811
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:24,480
          - Clam-idia.

812
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:26,348
          - It made me          
       so frigging happy.

813
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,349
   I couldn't stop laughing.

814
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:30,719
   - And I also feel that she   
 interacted with her character

815
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:32,253
            more so             
   than all the other girls.

816
00:34:32,255 --> 00:34:34,822
    - Really, it can just be    
     summed up by one word.

817
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:35,522
         - What's that?

818
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:37,957
   - (imitating Sean Connery)   
           Aquapussy.

819
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,694
           - Silence.           
     I've made my decision.

820
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:45,864
      Bring back my girls.

821
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:48,533
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)

822
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,502
        (RuPaul laughs)

823
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:54,104
    - Welcome back, ladies.

824
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:57,440
   I've made some decisions.

825
00:34:58,075 --> 00:34:59,974
         Peppermint...

826
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:02,977
          You're safe.          
          - Thank you.

827
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:05,012
         - Kimora Blac.

828
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:08,548
  The judges were not a fan of  
          your banana.

829
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,486
  I'm sorry, my dear, but you   
    are up for elimination.

830
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,089
  - This is the worst feeling   
         in the world.

831
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,691
   It sucks to be here again.

832
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:21,192
       - Trinity Taylor.

833
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:24,495
   You wished upon a starfish

834
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,997
   and your dreams came true.

835
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,131
       Con-drag-ulations.

836
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,766
       You're the winner        
   of this week's challenge.

837
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:31,767
             - Aah!             
           (applause)

838
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:36,671
- You've won a $2,000 gift card 
          from Casper.

839
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:37,571
          - Thank you.

840
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:38,605
         - You may join         
        the other girls.

841
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:41,808
     - Girl, I finally won      
      my first challenge.

842
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,475
        I have arrived,

843
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,277
     and these other girls      
       need to watch out.

844
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:52,650
 - Valentina, your ice princess 
        was totally hot.

845
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:56,119
          You're safe.          
          - Thank you.

846
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,054
         - Farrah Moan.

847
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,956
        I hate to burst         
         your bublina,

848
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,691
    but your blowfish blew.

849
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:10,031
  Aja, the judges did not lava  
    your princess storyline.

850
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:14,735
    Aja, I'm sorry, my dear,    
 but you're up for elimination.

851
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,938
       - I feel confused.

852
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,072
   I definitely think Farrah

853
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,441
  should be in the bottom two,  
            not me.

854
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:26,077
  - Farrah Moan, you may join   
        the other girls.

855
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,847
       - Thank you, guys.       
             (sobs)

856
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:33,984
          - Two queens          
        stand before me.

857
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:38,555
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me

858
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:43,059
       and save yourself        
       from elimination.

859
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,395
       The time has come

860
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:48,430
          to lip sync

861
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:52,600
    (echoing) for your life!

862
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:57,404
           Good luck,           
     and don't fuck it up.

863
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:00,206

901
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:04,978
         - You may join         
        the other girls.

902
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
      - Thank you so much.

903
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,047
     - You did that, bitch.

904
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:14,452
         - Kimora Blac,         
  you bravely bared your soul

905
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:16,153
         and your ass.

906
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:17,854
          - (chuckles)

907
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,022
     - Stay strong, sister.

908
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,492
        Now sashay away.

909
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,827
        - Love you guys.

910
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,028
         - We love you.

912
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:32,966
         - I'm pretty.          
            (laughs)

913
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:34,901
    I'm a little surprised.

914
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,435
     It's too early for me.

915
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:39,938
  The judges hated my monkey.   
   I hated that monkey, too.

916
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,639
            I think             
  what I would do differently

917
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:44,808
         is to research         
     on how to be a monkey,

918
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,608
    'cause that is something

919
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,577
    that I would never think    
 I would do in my entire life.

920
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:52,847
       But I did my best,       
     and I looked gorgeous.

921
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,784
     And I want to be known     
   as one of the pretty ones.

922
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,355
      - Con-drag-ulations,      
           my queens.

923
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,324
         Now, remember,         
  if you can't love yourself,

924
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,893
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?

925
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,561
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?

926
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:09,662
            - Amen.             
            - Amen.

927
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,897
          - All right.          
    Now, let the music play.
