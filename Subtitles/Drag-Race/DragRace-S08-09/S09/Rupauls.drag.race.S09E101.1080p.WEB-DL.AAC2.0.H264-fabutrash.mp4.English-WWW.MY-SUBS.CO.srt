1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:02,701
         My name is Aja.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:03,735
       I'm 22 years old.

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:04,635
   I had to think about that.

4
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,903
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

5
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,371
        [music playing]

6
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:11,374
       I got my drag name       
    from a Bollywood movie.

7
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,942
       I don't know what        
      it's called, but it

8
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,977
      had that little song      
    that was like, (SINGING)

9
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,545
       Jamie, Jamie, Aja.

10
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,713
  And I was like, I like that.

11
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:22,249
     And I absolutely have      
     no idea what it means.

12
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:22,849
         But I like it.

13
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:26,619
   I'm known for doing things   
  that other people don't do.

14
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,522
    Not in terms of my drag,    
     but just in terms of I

15
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:34,325
   will call everyone out and   
    always speak the truth.

16
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,025
          That's good.

17
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:35,692
       I went to church.

18
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,294
      They always tell you      
     God don't like liars.

19
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,495
And I will not lie to your face.

20
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,130
     So don't ask me if you     
     look bad because I'll

21
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:43,331
     tell you you look bad.

22
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,867
    I'm just a crazy person.

23
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,435
 I'm crying now on the inside.

24
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:50,737
   I'm not really competitive   
     at all, to be honest.

25
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,507
   I just really like to have   
  fun and I'm kind of a joker

26
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:55,908
and I like to joke with people.

27
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,976
   And sometimes, at people.

28
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,410
So I hope nobody gets mad at me.

29
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:04,114
   My drag aesthetic is very    
 much like slutty, anime girl,

30
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:05,281
   but also kind of ratchet.

31
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:09,285
 She's from Brooklyn so she has 
  to uphold that hood status.

32
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:12,521
        My look is very         
      Judy Jetson hooker.

33
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:18,193
   And I'm just very inspired   
 by Gautier meets Mugler meets

34
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,795
  furry monsters, but pastel.

35
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:29,470
      Season 9 is going to      
     be, I don't even know.

36
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,839
    These bitches are crazy.

37
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,073
   My name is Alexis Michelle.

38
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:40,213
I am 33 years old and I was born
  and raised in New York City.

39
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:44,350
   When I'm not dressed like    
this, my name is Alex Michaels.

40
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:49,088
    So I decided to feminize    
      my name since Alexis

41
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,456
   is really my female half.

42
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:54,092
    Alexis Michelle is known    
     for her theatricality,

43
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:58,129
     her lip sync talents,      
        her live vocals,

44
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,464
   and being pretty thirsty.

45
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:05,368
 I am a fierce competitor, but  
  I also know that my biggest

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,136
     competition is myself.

47
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,571
       So I don't need to       
       tear anybody down.

48
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:10,772
   I can lend you something.

49
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:11,506
      I can help you out.

50
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:15,309
   And still be able to beat    
     you, like a good girl.

51
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:16,910
     I'm a good girl, I am.

52
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:21,214
         I am all about         
      body, curve, swerve,

53
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:25,985
    glamour, class, a little    
      touch of prostitute,

54
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,553
    and of course, this mug.

55
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,725
 When I decided to go with this 
  bright vibrant neon yellow,

56
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,495
       I said, I want to        
        feel structure.

57
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,363
    I want to feel my shape.

58
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,833
    Alexis is known for her     
  cinched waist and her hips.

59
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:44,534
     So I wanted to really      
        bring that out,

60
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:47,637
     but elevate it to more     
       of a high fashion,

61
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,972
  almost McQueen-esque place.

62
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:53,709
 I can sit down at that makeup  
   table and think, oh, god,

63
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,778
here we go again, another face.

64
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,212
  And then something happens.

65
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,681
     As the shapes start to     
   come out, as the contours

66
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:04,151
     pop, as the lashes go      
     on, as I pout my lips.

67
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,554
      Something comes over      
    me and all of a sudden,

68
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:10,089
      Alexis has arrived.

69
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,823
     Hi, I'm Charlie Hides.

70
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:15,394
  I'm from Boston and London,   
  and I'm [coughs] years old.

71
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,063
         I'm bicoastal.

72
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,431
   I'm a transatlantic dame.

73
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,635
  My side hustle is I'm a butt  
   double for Britney Spears.

74
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,736
  How did I get my drag name?

75
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,604
 It's the name on my passport.

76
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,205
         So inventive.

77
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:30,506
           Creative.

78
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,274
Pushed the boat out on that one.

79
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:34,776
   I'm known for, apparently,   
        being the oldest

80
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:37,345
   drag race contestant ever.

81
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,213
Why did I audition for the show?

82
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:39,980
      Because I'm so old.

83
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:42,615
    If I don't do it now, by    
  next year, I could be dead.

84
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,484
 I'm so old, my ears are still  
   ringing from the Big Bang.

85
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:48,220
     What I do to transform     
    is I take lots of makeup

86
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:49,821
       and I throw it up        
     into the ceiling fan.

87
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:52,290
       I get under it and       
       hope for the best.

88
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,724
         My drag look?

89
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:57,094
       Eclectic, lots of        
       different things.

90
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:58,662
       It's high fashion.

91
00:03:58,664 --> 00:03:59,429
      I'm a crafty queen.

92
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,098
     What inspired my look      
     today was Julie Newmar

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,898
      meets Philip Treacy.

94
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,668
   An inspiration for me is,    
  if I wake up in the morning,

95
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,469
  I think this is a good day.

96
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,737
   Let's make the most of it.

97
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:11,637
        Let's have fun.

98
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,270
        Let's look good.

99
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:13,471
 Let's make a few people laugh.

100
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:16,106
     And if I can get paid      
    for it, all the better.

101
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,575
       I want to be known       
         for the person

102
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:23,513
 that when someone was feeling  
    bad or had a rough day,

103
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,516
  they saw one of my shows and  
   it made them feel better.

104
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,417
     I'm a team player, so      
      I work with my team.

105
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,788
And when it's my time to shine, 
   I sparkle, Neely, sparkle.

106
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,326
    Season 9 is going to be     
     the best season ever.

107
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,660
     You heard it from me.

108
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:43,630
      Don't quote me, but       
        I'm pretty sure.

109
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:44,330
       My name is Eureka.

110
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:45,931
      I come from Johnson       
        City, Tennessee.

111
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:50,302
     I am 25 years old and      
    I am big, ready to jig,

112
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:53,204
   and ready to win this gig.

113
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,540
  I actually got my drag name,  
  my mother's name is Eureka,

114
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,407
but it's spelt the German form.

115
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,543
 She's from Germany and I just  
  looked at my vacuum cleaner

116
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,945
    and was like, Americans,    
     will be able to spell

117
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,213
   that out and sound it out.

118
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:05,913
      So I became Eureka.

119
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,548
     Eureka's really known      
       in her profession

120
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,184
 as someone who is high energy, 
  very smiley, very positive,

121
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,286
  but also is a dancing queen.

122
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,488
       I like to push the       
    boundaries and the molds

123
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,223
        that the bigger         
   community has been given.

124
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,425
   I like to wear things that   
  we're not supposed to wear.

125
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:22,894
 I like to have the shape that  
  we're not supposed to have.

126
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,263
    And I like to dance hard    
    and do things that they

127
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:26,731
 don't expect a big girl to do.

128
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,367
    She's just big and loud     
      and crazy, but fun.

129
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:34,137
She's going to entertain you on 
 and off the stage, regardless.

130
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:34,737
        It's who she is.

131
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,171
      I'm a perfectionist,      
         so everything

132
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:40,141
has to be perfect at all times, 
   especially aesthetically.

133
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:43,611
  And it can cause me to be a   
  little introverted at times,

134
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,612
 and sometimes a little snippy.

135
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,348
     So the bitches better      
      watch out, because I

136
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,916
 might cuss, cut, or eat them.

137
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,651
       If I was going to        
     describe my aesthetic,

138
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:56,323
  I would say the Kool-Aid man  
  meets Eureka's castle meets

139
00:05:56,325 --> 00:06:04,064
  Hobby Lobby meets the Grand   
    Duchess meets Mary Queen

140
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:07,400
  of Scots meets fabulousness.

141
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:11,637
    Today, I am inspired by     
     fire and the color red

142
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,340
      because it dedicates      
    my passion and my drive

143
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,710
   and the flame that I have    
  under my ass for a fat girl

144
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,480
      to finally win this       
      [beep] competition.

145
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,848
     My name is Farrah Moan.

146
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,349
       I'm 23 years old.

147
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:30,387
    Born and raised in Texas    
  and now living in Las Vegas.

148
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,223
 My drag name Farrah comes from 
 my '70s idol, Farrah Fawcett.

149
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:38,795
      And Moan comes from,      
    well, me being a whore.

150
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:44,734
  When it comes to competing,   
   I am not that competitive.

151
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:48,337
    I mostly just make sure     
    that whatever I'm doing

152
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:54,242
   is true to what I like and   
    what I want to showcase.

153
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,244
     I'm definitely not one     
      of those girls that

154
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,679
       compares myself to       
     other people or wants

155
00:06:58,681 --> 00:06:59,613
   to be better than anyone.

156
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:01,414
     I just want to be the      
      best me that I can.

157
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,315
       My drag aesthetic        
        is on a spectrum

158
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,818
  between fetish and showgirl.

159
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,788
     I think I get a lot of     
     my fetishy inspiration

160
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,459
        just from my own        
     fantasies and desires.

161
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:21,431
     And then my old school     
  Vegas showgirl feel is just

162
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:25,735
     from being so inspired     
    by feathers and sparkles

163
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,036
  and rhinestones and glamour.

164
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,575
  And just that whole iconic,   
  larger than life silhouette.

165
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:36,144
        My look today is        
   inspired by old Hollywood

166
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:40,815
  meets retro glam, mixed with  
  a little bit of the fetishy

167
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:42,483
    aspect of my aesthetic.

168
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:48,555
      Season 9 is going to      
     be absolutely insane.

169
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,624
         Hi, my name is         
       Jaymes Mansfield.

170
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:55,393
    I'm 26 years old and I'm    
   from the Antarctic prison

171
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,194
 known as Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

172
00:07:57,196 --> 00:08:01,932
     [squeals] My drag name     
    comes from my birth name

173
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:05,001
      being James and the       
    actress Jayne Mansfield.

174
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,837
   I think I'm best known for   
   my YouTube channel, Jaymes

175
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,372
    Mansfield, where I talk     
      about hair styling,

176
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:13,375
        makeup, and even        
      drag queen history,

177
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,542
   like I'm making right now.

178
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,076
    I'm a drag foster child.

179
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,178
        I have two drag         
     mothers, the first one

180
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,513
      a legendary pageant       
      queen of Milwaukee,

181
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:21,580
   Wisconsin, Rudy D'angelo.

182
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:25,483
 And the third one, a legendary 
 trash queen of West Hollywood,

183
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,717
    the Amazing Ruby Claire.

184
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,754
       My side hustle is        
   hairstyling, babysitting,

185
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:33,323
     and selling cookies at     
     the church bake sale.

186
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,191
     I am very competitive.

187
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,959
  I don't take things lightly.

188
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,427
      I will hurt people.

189
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,929
     But I think I'm going      
     to play nice this time

190
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,765
  and give the girls a little   
    bit before I, you know,

191
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:44,565
     slash their eyes out.

192
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,800
     I transfer into Jaymes     
  Mansfield in one simple way.

193
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:50,003
 I stand still and spin myself  
 around in a circle like Wonder

194
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,371
  Woman and, poof, I'm there.

195
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:57,377
 My entire look is inspired by  
  small children, big dreams,

196
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,214
        and I'd say, my         
    puppetry and creativity.

197
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,415
        I'm walking art.

198
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,849
       But not vivacious.

199
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:04,416
          I'm pretty.

200
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,152
  My outfit was created by my   
   wonderful, long suffering

201
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,353
       maid, Mr. Jaymes.

202
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,821
       He stayed up many        
      long nights creating

203
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:13,291
 this look last minute for me,  
  and I appreciate him for it.

204
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:16,060
      My look is inspired       
       by, well, I wanted

205
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:19,830
   to be big in the shoulders   
 without having to gain weight.

206
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:20,630
         So, [squeals].

207
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:23,933
 Season 9 is going to be mine.

208
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,167
     My name is Kimora Blac.

209
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:30,872
      I'm 28 and I'm from       
      Sin City, Las Vegas.

210
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:35,276
   I picked Kimora because I    
    love Kimora Lee Simmons,

211
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:36,277
   but she's irrelevant now.

212
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,214
    So obviously, there has     
     to be someone younger.

213
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:41,582
         And that's me.

214
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,550
   But Kimora, no one has it.

215
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,251
    It can't be duplicated.

216
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,118
    Kimora just sounds hot.

217
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,620
   When you hear Kimora, it's   
   like, damn, who's Kimora?

218
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:52,657
      I am your life size       
       Barbie, you know?

219
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,291
  Like out of the Barbie box.

220
00:09:54,293 --> 00:10:00,931
   Like I am your rich, hot,    
    platinum blonde Barbie.

221
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:05,201
       Super bronzy, like       
     straight guys love me.

222
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:06,936
       Gay guys love me.

223
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,570
      Drag queens love me.

224
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,971
     I'm a really hot guy.

225
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:11,806
         Like, I would          
      totally date myself.

226
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:16,443
     Like, this full blown,     
  like, beard and, like, hot.

227
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,744
        But then, when I        
        get into Kimora,

228
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:21,647
    it's such a long process    
   because I am so perfected.

229
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,751
   Because I cannot go out of   
 the house looking like busted.

230
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:27,719
     And some of the queens     
    are kind of like busted.

231
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:30,621
      So that is like the       
    top of my list is like,

232
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,122
   one, you cannot be busted.

233
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:35,358
      My drag aesthetic is      
    just sexy and show girl.

234
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,226
       I've come from the       
       city of showgirls.

235
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:41,396
   My look today was actually   
really inspired by this fashion

236
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,197
     designer Marco Marco.

237
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,031
       I love his stuff.

238
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,566
   It's not Marco Marco, but    
   it's just inspired by him.

239
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:51,804
 I had to tint my hair hot pink 
 because I bleached it too much

240
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:53,639
       and the split ends       
     were kind of showing.

241
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,775
      So I had to kind of       
      go in so real girls

242
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,576
  don't get too jealous of me.

243
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:01,311
              Hey.

244
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:05,748
 Well, I am Nina Bo'Nina Banana 
Fofana Osama on season 9 Brown.

245
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,716
        And honey, I am         
      from South Carolina,

246
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:11,653
       but I do reside in       
      Riverdale, Georgia.

247
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:14,722
       My first drag name       
      was Beata Bitchass.

248
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:19,226
And then it was Lady Guinevere, 
but people couldn't spell that.

249
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:20,460
       They would call me       
        Lady Guinea Pig.

250
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,062
       I was sleeping one       
    night and I had a dream.

251
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:26,698
     And somehow, the word      
   Nina was just in my dream.

252
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,433
        I would use that        
     name, go to the club.

253
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:30,535
      Somebody would say,       
    come out, Nina Bo'Nina.

254
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,602
       And I'm like, OK.

255
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:36,073
     If 2 plus 2 equals 4,      
    that makes sense to me.

256
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,075
    So that was Nina Bo'Nina    
       and I said Brown.

257
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:39,643
        My aesthetic is         
       hard to describe.

258
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:43,546
   Like really, I don't know    
    how to describe myself.

259
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:46,215
  I don't know where I belong.

260
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:48,150
       I don't want to be       
       in a box, either.

261
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:49,417
        And I feel like         
       I'm a black queen

262
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,353
      who does things that      
     a lot of black queens

263
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,587
      haven't really done.

264
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,688
  Even a lot of white queens.

265
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,689
      I can give you glam.

266
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:56,790
      I can give you sexy.

267
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,858
     I can give you crazy.

268
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,026
  I can give you a character.

269
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:01,760
    It's whatever I choose.

270
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,862
    I just don't want to be,    
    like, a one-note queen.

271
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:07,532
     What inspired today's      
    look was grape Kool-Aid.

272
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:08,132
         No, seriously.

273
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,567
      What does-- a video       
        game, actually.

274
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:11,401
         A video game.

275
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,936
        I'm a big video         
      player, I'm a nerd.

276
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:14,469
           I'm a guy.

277
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:17,238
    So anybody out there who    
 plays some PlayStation, honey,

278
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,805
          bring it on.

279
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,940
      And in the game, you      
       get to make your--

280
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:20,874
   build your own characters.

281
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:24,677
   And there was this badass    
      purple alien bitch.

282
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,582
  And I was like, cheekbones,   
     lips, eyes, that's me.

283
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:35,019
Kiddies, tune in because season 
  9 is going to be surprising

284
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,089
    and you are not going to    
   know what to expect, baby.

285
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,690
         So get ready.

286
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,492
           My name is           
     Peppermint and I'm 37

287
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:46,294
 years old from New York City.

288
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:53,200
  I got my drag name because I  
  was sitting in a parking lot

289
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:55,435
        with this guy I         
    totally had a crush on.

290
00:12:55,437 --> 00:13:00,206
  And I was eating my favorite  
candies, which are peppermints.

291
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,441
       And he just said,        
      you know, you should

292
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:03,642
   call yourself Peppermint.

293
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:07,712
   I honestly would have done   
anything he said, and so I did.

294
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:08,713
     Peppermint's my name.

295
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:09,580
           It stuck.

296
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,415
        I've been doing         
       drag for so long.

297
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,850
 And I have done lots in drag.

298
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:15,418
    I've done lots of shows.

299
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,353
   I've done lots of people.

300
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,020
       I've done it all.

301
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:20,789
      And I really wanted       
    something new, something

302
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,523
    that challenged myself.

303
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:25,527
And I think this is the perfect,
   perfect place to do that.

304
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:33,067
    My aesthetic is classy,     
      chic, uptown flair,

305
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,670
   very urban, with a little    
   bit of sex pot thrown in.

306
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:38,104
        Today's look, my        
        hair is inspired

307
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:42,274
   by RuPaul herself from her   
 "Ho, Ho, Ho" Christmas album.

308
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,542
       I think this is ho       
     number two, this hair.

309
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:48,245
    And I just wanted to do     
 something fabulous and flowy.

310
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:52,949
  And I'm giving a little bit   
  of Endora from "Bewitched."

311
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:57,286
       I want to be known       
       for the confidence

312
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:59,755
        that I have with        
        my drag being as

313
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:04,192
  equal to the confidence that  
  I bring to my everyday life

314
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:06,260
   as a trans woman and win.

315
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,528
 The first transgender winner.

316
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,195
       That sounds great.

317
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,697
    Season 9 is going to be     
     epic because I'm here.

318
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:12,364
         I'm a legend.

319
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:17,202
        I'm fierce, I'm         
    fabulous, and I'm ready.

320
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,303
    My name is Sasha Velour.

321
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:23,775
     I'm 29 years old and I     
  live in Brooklyn, New York.

322
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:27,211
       My drag name is my       
      actual name, Sasha.

323
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:28,245
       That was the name        
        I was born with.

324
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,981
       And my whole life,       
    I've had people tell me

325
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:31,715
    that it's a girl's name.

326
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,684
   So the logical conclusion    
   is just to become a girl.

327
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:38,754
       Velour is a cheap        
       imitation fabric.

328
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,857
   It's more useful and more    
    affordable than velvet.

329
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:45,861
      So I think it's the       
   perfect metaphor for drag.

330
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,429
   I'm an intense competitor.

331
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,364
         I love to win.

332
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,567
        I love to take a        
    challenge and transform

333
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:54,001
   it to really work for me.

334
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:56,336
      And I'm excited for       
       this competition.

335
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,371
      To transform into my      
     fabulous drag persona

336
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:01,173
     is about the physical      
   ritual of painting my face

337
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:04,075
   and costuming my body and    
    shaving off all the hair

338
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,176
 and strapping everything down.

339
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,977
       That ritual really       
     does help me transform

340
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:11,781
into this fabulous being that's 
so much more than just my body.

341
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:13,482
       It's my ideas and        
        my imagination.

342
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:18,653
  I think that drag is the art  
 form of the queer imagination.

343
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,856
    So it's all about beauty    
    that goes beyond gender.

344
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:27,962
   It's about experimentation   
          and remixing

345
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:30,264
    and combining different     
elements from different places.

346
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,600
  So it's just a hodgepodge of  
  different fabulous and queer

347
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:34,400
      things that I love.

348
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:37,903
        Today's look is,        
     like, '60s meets '20s.

349
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,804
         It's a bit of          
      Philip Treacy, it's

350
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,807
 a bit of crazy, bald club kid.

351
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,210
      And it's my absolute      
 favorite colors, red and pink

352
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,511
   and everything in between.

353
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,648
       Season 9 is going        
      to be revolutionary.

354
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,251
    Hi, my name is Shea, Miss   
    Coulee if you're nasty.

355
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:59,255
     I'm 27 years young and     
    I'm from the Windy City.

356
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,359
     I got Shea because my      
      middle name is Shea

357
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:07,095
       and in Swahili, it       
      means beautiful boy.

358
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,529
       And I thought that       
      that was appropriate

359
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:13,000
     and so I picked Coulee     
   because I wanted to sound

360
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:14,101
   like a French supermodel.

361
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:18,638
  I'm gorgeous, I'm talented,   
    I can sew, I can dance,

362
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,939
     I can act, I can sing.

363
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,308
       I can put my legs        
        behind my head.

364
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,409
      I can speak French.

365
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:25,544
       You know, the list       
        goes on and on.

366
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:30,415
     I'm known for being a      
    really strong performer.

367
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:34,986
  I'm known for having a very   
    editorial image online.

368
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,120
        I love fashion.

369
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,121
        I love clothing.

370
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:37,754
        I love modeling.

371
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:41,190
      And yeah, girl, I'm       
    just sickening the house

372
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:42,958
    down, boots, Gaga, yes.

373
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,661
     My aesthetic is equal      
    parts bougie and bangi.

374
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,763
      I woke up like this.

375
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,565
       So I mean, I just        
  literally rolled out of bed

376
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,167
  and then walked my beautiful  
   little black ass over here

377
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,768
     and sat in this chair.

378
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,902
         What is drag?

379
00:16:56,904 --> 00:17:01,473
     I just wanted to give      
      you African goddess

380
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,541
   realness, Queen Nefertiti.

381
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:09,513
Yeah, I just wanted to give you 
  a really good visual of what

382
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:10,714
    a true queen looks like.

383
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:13,183
         Up until this          
     competition, I always

384
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:17,420
 downplayed myself in order to  
  make people feel comfortable

385
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:18,120
      and less threatened.

386
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:21,423
But now that I'm here, frankly, 
 my dear, I don't give a damn.

387
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,957
So these girls better watch out.

388
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,162
       Season 9 is going        
      to be unforgettable.

389
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,830
     Hi, I'm Trinity Taylor.

390
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:30,730
       I'm 31 years old.

391
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:33,332
      I'm originally from       
      Birmingham, Alabama.

392
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:38,070
       And now, I reside        
      in Orlando, Florida.

393
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,839
     I really liked Trinity     
       from "The Matrix."

394
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,073
        She was a bitch.

395
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,874
 She had a strong personality.

396
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,774
       She a strong look.

397
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:47,009
     And at the time, I was     
    like, I want to be her.

398
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:51,713
    And so I would wear jet     
 black hair with no hair line,

399
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,181
         just horrible.

400
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:54,649
      Looked like a brick.

401
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:58,119
But that's who I thought I was.

402
00:17:58,121 --> 00:17:58,586
             Yeah.

403
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:03,991
     I come from pageants,      
    so I'm very competitive.

404
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,326
      I came here to win.

405
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,227
So that's what I'm going to do.

406
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,595
       I'm going to claw        
       my way to the top.

407
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:13,699
 Putting makeup on other people 
  other than myself for my day

408
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:16,668
     job is kind of boring      
  because it's all like, nude,

409
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,403
     beige, and more nude.

410
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:19,137
     You know, I like this.

411
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,007
 I like the glam, the glitter,  
    rhinestones, big lashes.

412
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,375
  They don't let you do that.

413
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,710
    My aesthetic is fierce.

414
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,578
        I love fashion.

415
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,712
          I love body.

416
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:31,580
         I love beauty.

417
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:32,881
          I love hair.

418
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:33,481
         I love makeup.

419
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:34,615
 I love to be a transformation.

420
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:39,086
 I was inspired for this look,  
just this is my favorite color.

421
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:40,387
         I love blues.

422
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,888
  I love teals and turquoise.

423
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:48,895
 And I was thinking, I want to  
be a ferocious futuristic bitch.

424
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:51,664
I want to be known for the fact 
  that I'm very well-rounded.

425
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,034
     That I can sew, that I     
   can do my makeup and hair,

426
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,836
       and still be nice        
      to these other girls

427
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,238
       and help them out        
      and still slay them.

428
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,573
     Because I'm that good.

429
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,275
  Hello, my name is Valentina.

430
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,644
         I live in Los          
      Angeles, California,

431
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,646
     and I'm a little girl.

432
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:16,252
    My drag name came about     
   it, it just like, snapped.

433
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:16,852
         It came to me.

434
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:20,188
  It sounded like a character   
 out of a Pedro Almodovar film.

435
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,124
      It sounded like the       
 protagonist from a telenovela.

436
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,493
       There's actually a       
    salsa called Valentina.

437
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:29,563
   And also, I love Valentino   
  and the color Valentino red.

438
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,165
    So I felt like Valentina    
     was the perfect name.

439
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:38,938
 I'm glamorous, I'm Latina, I'm 
 tall, I'm skinny, and luxury.

440
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,538
         I love luxury.

441
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,941
  And I'm a perfectionist and   
    I strive for perfection.

442
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,442
         It's something         
       that's impossible,

443
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,710
but why not shoot for the stars?

444
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,645
       Getting into drag,       
        I have a ritual.

445
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,582
 Getting in drag, the process,  
     it's my favorite part.

446
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,384
    So I turn on my candles,    
       I put on my music.

447
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:59,054
      I sip on a glass of       
     wine and I just paint.

448
00:19:59,056 --> 00:19:59,654
        And I enjoy it.

449
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,323
      And I take a really       
    long time getting ready.

450
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,258
      I love to luxuriate       
         in the moment

451
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,194
     and really get excited     
   when it comes time to put

452
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:09,963
   my blush or my lip gloss.

453
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:10,563
        And now lashes.

454
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,798
      And girl, put those       
     contacts on and, boom,

455
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,299
  the transformation is ready.

456
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,266
      I love to get ready.

457
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:16,500
 It's my favorite part of drag.

458
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:19,903
        Today's look is         
      referencing Prada's

459
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,504
last season, the spring/summer.

460
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:25,107
   I wanted to do a neoprene    
  and I wanted the color to be

461
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,675
  mint and a [inaudible] coat.

462
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:29,144
  I'm really going for, like,   
   this fantasy of just kind

463
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:34,315
 of doing a modern take on '60s 
 glamour with the spiky lashes

464
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,849
      and the teased hair.

465
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:36,482
          Get into it.

466
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:40,652
 Season 9 is going to be drama.
