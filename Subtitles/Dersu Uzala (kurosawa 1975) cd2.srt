{2066}{2129}For three months, we have been|walking in the forest.
{2132}{2212}Spring in the forest|quickly gave way to summer.
{2215}{2295}We’ve explored a large area.
{2297}{2419}But if we had Dersu,|we; have accomplished more.
{2454}{2524}All this time,|I was thinking with anticipation...
{2526}{2606}that maybe I would meet him again.
{2608}{2654}Where are you, Dersu?
{3084}{3188}Up the spring, go!
{3647}{3696}Faster, guys.|Bring the water.
{3768}{3838}Andriucha!|Throw up more branches!
{3965}{4011}What is taking so long?
{4037}{4083}Faster, faster! Don't smile!
{4085}{4143}And you said you would bring a boar!
{4453}{4549}Vladimir Pavlovich.|I met a hunter two miles from here.
{4552}{4647}He was asking about our unit--|who we are, who's the captain.
{4686}{4716}Did you tell him?
{4719}{4793}How could I, sir?|I know how to keep a military secret.
{4796}{4864}Eh, Turtygin, Turtygin.|Did he remain there?
{4867}{4963}No, sir. He started|to collect his backpack.
{5056}{5102}Vladimir Pavlovich!|Your rifle!
{7499}{7582}- Hello, Captain!|- Hello, Dersu!
{7648}{7693}You are my dear man.
{7841}{7912}You haven't changed at all, Dersu.
{7914}{7984}Haven't changed.|Haven't grown older.
{8275}{8473}You, my eagle with blue-black wings
{8506}{8720}Where have you been flying|for so Long
{9042}{9112}How have you been these years?
{9192}{9242}Shot lots of sables?
{9244}{9282}Plenty.
{9284}{9347}- Get much money.|- Oh! That's good!

{9504}{9611}Rich trader me invite.|Much vodka.
{9613}{9672}Me give him money to keep for me.
{9675}{9740}After that, his men nowhere.
{9743}{9788}Why so?
{9791}{9824}Me don't understand.
{10168}{10389}You, my eagle with blue-black wings
{10417}{10621}Where have you been flying|for so Long
{10648}{10877}I was flying there over the mountains
{10908}{11132}Where it all was silence
{11240}{11315}Next morning,|the forest was shrouded in thick fog.
{11351}{11412}We were Leading the way.
{11415}{11505}I was confident|because Dersu was now with me.
{11695}{11764}Dersu, what do you think?
{11767}{11833}Will the weather clear up?
{11836}{11884}Yes.
{11887}{11983}Earth and hill all sweating now.
{11985}{12031}Soon they'll get completely well.
{12059}{12109}Why are they lagging behind?
{12112}{12173}It's high time|they catch up with us.
{12176}{12213}Let us wait.
{12338}{12375}Me lost pipe.
{12428}{12522}Me think pipe be near.|Must go back.
{12603}{12651}How I lose pipe?
{12682}{12745}Either got old...
{12748}{12811}or my head got bad.
{13569}{13648}Look, Captain.|This is track tiger.
{13651}{13698}Him behind us go.
{13701}{13775}When us come here,|was not track on road.

{13847}{13906}When us stopped over there,|he was right here!
{13909}{13996}Me go back, tiger run away.
{14403}{14513}That is nothing, Captain.|Tiger never make big noise.
{14604}{14677}Excuse us, Captain, for lingering.
{14680}{14735}Two horses got stuck in the bog.
{14737}{14807}Is this your pipe, Dersu?
{14945}{15015}- What is it with you?|- There's a tiger nearby.
{15057}{15132}Hey, guys, careful!
{15135}{15168}A tiger's nearby!
{15195}{15228}Calm down!
{15293}{15339}Calm down, I say!
{15371}{15416}Come on, come on!
{15853}{15912}Again tiger go our track!
{16010}{16123}Why go behind?|What do you need, tiger?
{16125}{16156}What do you want?
{16159}{16268}Us go road, not bother you,|and you go behind!
{16271}{16346}Is there not enough space|in forest, tiger?
{17151}{17196}Let's go!
{17588}{17634}Why have you halted?
{17724}{17773}Looks like fallen trees there.
{18584}{18658}- Dersu, what's that?|- Ludiovo.
{18660}{18702}Ludiovo? And what's that?
{18704}{18760}Animals go to river, drink water.
{18763}{18846}Want to go round trunks and branches|and fall into pit.
{18849}{18919}They catch animals, sell the skins.
{18998}{19056}Detail several men to follow me.
{19059}{19156}Belonozhkin, Zagourskii, Zakharov,|Bochkariov, follow me.
{20427}{20460}Careful.

{21729}{21791}Pasha, what do you have there?
{21794}{21852}I found two pits.
{21855}{21908}Only carrion in there.

{21996}{22041}I fell in myself!
{22076}{22146}Vasia! Vasia!
{22148}{22242}- What's there?|- I found a whole flaying house!
{22284}{22360}- Who did it?|- Bad Chinese did this.
{22363}{22437}Why leave ludiovo, but not fill holes?
{22468}{22526}Bad to kill animals for nothing.
{22616}{22678}Bring axes and hoes here!
{23755}{23788}What happened, Dersu?
{23791}{23828}Hounhous! Chinese bandits!
{23927}{24020}They make holes in my shirt,|and I make holes in theirs!
{24023}{24065}- How many are there?|- Eight.
{24068}{24141}Turtygin, two remain here.|The rest of you follow me.

{25000}{25051}Steal wife, kill men.
{25339}{25377}Sir, here.
{25902}{25991}Hounhous steal three women.
{25993}{26087}Me not understand|what they do with men.
{26292}{26325}Turtygin!
{27240}{27303}Hey, guys, come here quick!
{28078}{28163}Much mosquito, horsefly there.

{28212}{28248}Then much pain.
{28250}{28287}Then die.
{28290}{28354}Good us found at daytime.
{28356}{28418}Very, very good.
{28420}{28456}All alive.
{28458}{28537}I'll kill those Hounhous!
{28564}{28597}Hounhous!
{28784}{28848}That Chang Pao, not Hounhous!
{29095}{29158}My name's Chang Pao.|We fight Hounhous.
{29160}{29221}I'm Arseniev.|We're exploring this area.
{29224}{29257}- Hello.|- Hello.
{29454}{29526}They took the women with them,|as always.
{29529}{29609}Hounhous go there.|Move, hurry!
{29612}{29683}Dersu, calm down.|They won't get far away.
{29686}{29735}Will you take care of these men?
{29796}{29841}Detachment, fall in.
{30160}{30193}In those places|where they robbed and killed...
{30196}{30250}people told us that the bandits|are not more than ten.
{30252}{30288}We'll handle them ourselves.
{30291}{30328}Well, good luck then.
{30331}{30376}- Good-bye.|- Good-bye.
{30790}{30867}Danger no.|Hounhous end.
{30981}{31099}At first sight, this river|seemed quiet and peaceful.
{31134}{31271}I sent some men with horses|to look for a place to ford it.
{31274}{31383}I myself with the others|tried to cross the river on a raft.
{31604}{31650}Stand here.
{31652}{31686}Let me.
{31982}{32015}Pull it!
{32340}{32385}Give me the weapons.
{32940}{32985}The pole! Where's the pole?
{33068}{33126}The pole! Throw it!

{36818}{36903}- If we only had a rope!|- We used all the rope for the raft!
{36978}{37037}Cut down tree! Cut down!
{37131}{37186}- This one?|- No!
{37261}{37325}- This one?|- No!
{37442}{37513}- This one?|- Uh-huh!
{37516}{37553}Get the axes!
{37636}{37702}Tie the tree! Quick!
{37704}{37750}Tie the tree!
{37773}{37807}Take off your belts!
{37934}{37971}These will do too.
{38512}{38557}- We'll need levers.|- Cut them!
{39175}{39207}Hold on! Hold on!
{39233}{39315}Come on, guys, faster, faster!
{39412}{39449}How are you there?
{40299}{40342}Hold it!
{40344}{40395}Let it go little by little!
{40398}{40426}Go, go, go!
{40428}{40500}Hold it! Let go!
{41214}{41259}Dersu, give me your hand!
{41311}{41344}Grab me!
{41651}{41696}You were like a bear!
{42576}{42645}Summer end, Captain.
{42648}{42693}Autumn come.
{42758}{42810}That's good.|A bit to the left.
{42812}{42887}A bit to the left.|Good.
{43084}{43118}Okay, get ready.
{43144}{43191}Attention.
{43193}{43223}Hold it.
{43254}{43283}Good.
{43310}{43393}Turtygin, come here.|Now you take a picture of us.
{43656}{43693}Press here, okay?
{43850}{43931}My fondest memories of Dersu...
{43934}{44039}are connected with|the beginning of that autumn.
{45617}{45672}- What's wrong with that horse?|- Tiger.
{46372}{46406}Listen, tiger!
{46440}{46491}Soldiers fire rifle!
{46493}{46560}You go away. Go away!
{48844}{48879}What me do?
{48913}{48947}Kill tiger.
{49004}{49052}The tiger ran away.|He's unharmed.
{49055}{49148}No, tiger always run until die.
{153580}{153649}Now me much frightened.
{49284}{49318}Don't be afraid, Dersu.
{49320}{49374}A dead tiger can't harm you.
{49376}{49422}Kanga will!
{49424}{49470}He send another tiger!
{49519}{49638}Kanga is a forest spirit|whom the Goldi worship.
{49677}{49756}From that day Dersu changed.
{49759}{49820}He became morose and irritable.
{49874}{49911}What you do?
{49943}{50012}That sign say no ginseng here.
{50148}{50183}You break.
{50186}{50263}People search for ginseng,|all for nothing.
{50332}{50377}Bad man are you.
{51128}{51221}So he just jumped in the river|in all his clothes. He was drunk.
{51264}{51298}In all his clothes!
{51353}{51407}And I had an adventure--
{51410}{51467}Why throw meat into fire?
{51497}{51555}Meat throw into fire, lose.
{51558}{51635}Tomorrow we go,|other people here come...
{51637}{51679}see meat, eat.
{51705}{51739}Who would come here?
{51742}{51793}How's that? Who come?
{51796}{51866}Badger come, marten come.
{51868}{51950}Crow come, mouse come.
{51952}{52007}All kinds of men in forest.
{53809}{53858}Good evening, Dersu.
{53860}{53890}I say, salute!
{54794}{54855}The Ussuri autumn is brief.
{54858}{54923}Winter colds come fast.
{54926}{54983}I started getting ready for winter...
{54985}{55108}and sent some of the men|with all our horses to Olga Bay.
{55171}{55235}Smells! Men here!
{55238}{55283}- What men?|- Boars!
{55388}{55426}I don't smell anything.
{55787}{55856}- Dersu, why didn't you shoot?|- I not see.
{55943}{55988}Why not me see boar?
{56078}{56187}My nose see better than eyes.
{56300}{56373}I did not know then...
{56376}{56457}that this small incident|was a forerunner of tragic events.
{56548}{56581}A stag!
{56660}{56693}Where, Captain?
{57262}{57295}Where?
{57395}{57472}There, under the half-fallen tree.
{57981}{58027}- Did I hit it?|- No.
{58068}{58114}Didn't you see it?
{60048}{60126}Everyone misses sometimes, Dersu.
{60152}{60206}Why me not hit it?
{62943}{63026}Captain! Before,|I always first see an animal!
{63029}{63091}Shoot, always hit target.
{63094}{63158}Now not hit.|Bad are my eyes.
{63160}{63230}How I live in forest now?
{64300}{64363}Come to Khabarovsk with me.
{64365}{64411}My home is your home.
{64935}{65004}New Year's Eve came.
{65464}{65522}It was a strange night.
{68215}{68288}The tiger come to kill me.
{68576}{68625}Thank you, Captain!|Thank you!
{68628}{68659}What happened, Dersu?
{68661}{68758}Captain, you say your home my home.|Thank you, Captain!
{68760}{68803}Will you come with me to my place?
{68805}{68855}My eyes get bad.
{68858}{68922}Kanga not want me to live in forest.
{68924}{68962}He send the tiger.
{69360}{69459}Probably what Dersu|called the tiger...
{69461}{69539}was the specter of|his fear of the forest...
{69542}{69650}conjured by the imagination...
{69652}{69706}of a man grown old.
{70324}{70408}Listen here.|Vova recorded Dersu.
{70411}{70444}Well, well.
{70699}{70795}The Captaingo hills, work.
{70830}{70873}Go back to city...
{70876}{70972}sit at a table, write, work.
{70975}{71062}Me no work in the city.
{71090}{71141}Stare into fire.
{71144}{71208}Look at hills faraway.
{71211}{71258}And that's it.
{71261}{71295}It's true.
{71298}{71356}He doesn't like the city.
{71359}{71412}Never mind.|He'll get used to it.
{71463}{71543}Vova, did Dersu hear it?
{71545}{71587}Yes.
{71589}{71683}- What did he say?|- He said, ''Right, not word miss.''
{71800}{71850}Does he often talk to you|about the forest?
{71852}{71911}Yes. Dersu is not|afraid of anything.
{71914}{71998}Neither of wolves,|nor of boars, or of bears.
{72000}{72070}Snowstorms and floods|are nothing for him.
{72108}{72168}You know, Dersu is Vova's hero.
{72171}{72216}He is crazy about him.
{72253}{72319}And I owed him my life|on several occasions.
{72322}{72391}He never mentioned it.
{72393}{72476}Well, he thinks it is quite|a regular thing to do.
{72479}{72632}about such things and exaggerate.
{73951}{74070}This men always with me|roam the forest...
{74072}{74130}many, many years.
{74554}{74654}This is a bear tooth...
{74786}{74823}and claws.
{74968}{75050}And these are claws of lynx.
{75130}{75183}For you. Take.
{75185}{75231}You give it to me?
{75233}{75312}Yes, Little Captain.
{75315}{75340}Really?
{75343}{75411}I am so happy.|It will be my talisman.
{75413}{75508}Don't you have tiger claws?|Didn't you hunt a tiger?
{75544}{75601}I shoot at tiger but--
{75639}{75733}It bad to kill tiger.
{75736}{75787}Why?
{75790}{75823}Very...
{75860}{75895}very bad.
{76621}{76675}Take this. Thank you.
{76740}{76796}Why give money for water?
{76799}{76844}Much water is in river.
{76898}{76970}- Why you take money for water?|- What?
{76972}{77018}You don't understand anything.
{77057}{77131}You are bad man!
{77341}{77411}- Where are you going?|- Shoot.
{77413}{77501}Don't even think of it! It's not|allowed to shoot guns in a city.
{77503}{77556}In barrel much dirt.
{77559}{77626}Me shoot a bullet, clean barrel.
{77628}{77695}Then wipe with cloth, shoot well.
{77697}{77761}There are many people here.|It's dangerous.
{77763}{77842}Me fire not people.|Me fire at air.
{77844}{77926}All the same, you cannot.|The city isn't the same as the hills.
{77928}{77962}Do you understand?
{78022}{78055}Do you?
{78605}{78663}Well, how are you, Dersu?
{78740}{78837}Sit I here, just like duck.
{78876}{78993}How can men sit in box?
{79024}{79070}You are right.
{79072}{79126}It isn't a very nice room.
{79388}{79466}We'll have to change the wallpaper...
{79468}{79523}make everything more cozy.
{79563}{79673}Meanwhile,|what if you live in my study.
{79720}{79775}Don't bother, Captain.
{79778}{79859}I pitch tent outdoors.
{79891}{79924}Sleep.
{79951}{79993}I don't disturb anyone.
{80020}{80078}See, Dersu...
{80080}{80150}it's not allowed in a city.
{80187}{80220}Why not?
{80248}{80279}Bad!
{80307}{80369}How should I explain?
{80372}{80431}That's a rule.
{80433}{80467}A rule.
{80530}{80579}Shoot a gun I can't.
{80582}{80627}Sleep outdoors I can't.
{80667}{80737}I not get enough air at all.
{81239}{81304}Pa, what happened?|Dersu's been arrested!
{81307}{81351}The police just called.
{81353}{81387}What is it again?
{81389}{81472}You know, he saw me buying firewood|yesterday and grew very angry...
{81475}{81544}and went to the city park|to chop down a tree.
{84316}{84356}Please...
{84359}{84423}let me go back to hills.
{84425}{84500}Live in city I cannot.
{84547}{84596}Where will you go?
{84599}{84652}To the hills.
{84701}{84735}Captain.
{84824}{84858}Missus.
{84980}{85025}Little Captain.
{85069}{85123}All fine people.
{85126}{85175}Me go-- bad!
{85213}{85298}But I cannot live in a city.
{86788}{86854}Here, take this rifle as a gift.
{86880}{86926}New model.
{86954}{87014}It's easy to aim.
{87047}{87117}Even with bad eyesight|you won't miss.
{87153}{87187}Here.
{87288}{87334}Thank you, Captain.
{87583}{87613}to Mr. Arseniev.
{87615}{87662}Your visiting card|found on dead Goldi.
{87664}{87712}Request your presence|to identify body.
{89232}{89278}Mr. Arseniev?
{89895}{89940}Did you know him?
{89984}{90030}We were friends.
{90223}{90269}And his name was...
{90299}{90336}Dersu Uzala.
{90403}{90436}His occupation?
{90495}{90529}A hunter.
{90564}{90610}How strange.
{90612}{90662}He didn't have a rifle.
{90712}{90758}There must have been.
{90760}{90813}A rifle of the latest model.
{90815}{90903}No, nothing was found...
{90906}{90975}except your visiting card.
{91061}{91115}It's clear now.
{91118}{91235}The criminal wanted to get the rifle,|so he killed the man.
{91323}{91358}Ready, sir.
{91360}{91422}The ground's frozen.|It was hard digging the grave.
{91425}{91459}Bury him.
{92085}{92115}So...
{92142}{92220}now I'll ask you to sign.
{92263}{92297}Here.
{92892}{92966}Beg your pardon.|I'm a busy man.
{93248}{93282}Thank you.
{93336}{93382}So...
{93384}{93430}may I leave?
{96256}{96302}Dersu.
