1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,959
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,959
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,543
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,669
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:39,419
You get scared...They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,420
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,546
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:52,838
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,964
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:03,215
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, hundsome.

11
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,799
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

12
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,133
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,967
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:27,593
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:30,469
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,386
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:38,887
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,804
... and start dancing.

19
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,392
-She has her period.
-It's early.

20
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,403
Good evening.

21
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,321
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:36,072
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,281
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:43,031
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:47,323
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,282
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,825
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:55,825 --> 00:07:00,284
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:03,909
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,952
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:12,827
Thanks a lot.

32
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:17,578
-You cut off the intestinal food.
-She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:21,120
-We will try again tomorrow.
-Yes, go now.

34
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,454
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,664
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:41,665
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,333
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,125
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,917
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,917
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,668
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,543
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,919
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,087
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,796
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:20,129
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:23,838
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,464
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,173
-Nino Valencia...
-Enough!

50
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:33,673
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:37,049
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:41,591
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,800
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,759
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,051
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:55,385
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:55,802 --> 00:09:00,469
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:04,053
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,637
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,512
I want to ask you something.

61
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,805
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:19,055
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,681
I would like to do something
deep.

64
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,974
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:30,233
-The woman has gone crazy!
-She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,484
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,151
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:32,243
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:36,785
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,202
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,578
-Or tell me where to send them.
-Send them at my place.

72
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:49,704
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,746
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,955
-Good evening.
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:01,330
-What glass do you prefer?
-A tall one.

76
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:09,248
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,291
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:19,667
-What are you saying?
-Can I talk to you?

79
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:26,209
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,418
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,004
-Who named you Lydia;
-My father.

82
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:48,504
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,088
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,672
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:00,506
But he died last year.

86
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,882
I am sorry.

87
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:08,049
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:11,841
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,384
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:20,468
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,302
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:28,219
-This is the impression I have.
-Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:31,386
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,845
Tell EI Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:16,893
-Take me from here!
-What's going on?

96
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:20,769
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:24,269
-Give me the keys.
-The door is open.

98
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,853
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:02,868
My purse.

100
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:07,327
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:10,494
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:15,036
-To which hotel?
-To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,167
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,834
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,334
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,002
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:04,919
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:08,128
Thanks for everything.

109
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:35,257
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,758
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,348
Do you wash her?

112
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,598
What do you think?

113
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:29,057
-How was the night?
-normal.

114
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:33,183
-Give it to me. I will do it.
-I am going now.

115
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,767
-Good bye.
-Bye, Matilde.

116
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:41,351
It's so hot!

117
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,518
-Lets cut her hair.
-short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:49,644
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,936
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:56,061
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:58,728
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:01,854
-Why me?
-Because you need them.

123
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:06,313
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,188
So hot!

125
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:11,605
I took something from the
drugstore...

126
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,731
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:18,732
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:21,190
-What's it called?
-Perspirex.

129
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,525
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:35,859
-How are you?
-Naked.

131
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,319
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,403
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,987
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,529
-Where are we going?
-To Sybilla.

135
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,321
-You think I am crazy.
-Why?

136
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,238
-Because I don't want to go home.
-No, I understand.

137
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:04,989
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:08,531
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:13,115
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,740
So, you are separated.

141
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,491
I am alone.

142
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:23,200
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,911
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:47,829
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

145
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,871
Indeed.

146
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:24,168
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

147
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:29,752
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:33,294
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,878
First they raped the locals.

150
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,753
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

151
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:43,462
And I admired them so much!

152
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,588
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:49,755
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

154
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,922
-What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
-Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,881
-How do the bulls look?
-Good, but fat.

156
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:02,590
-How much do you think?
-Over 500 kilos.

157
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:07,258
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:11,008
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,248
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,167
-How is it?
-Very bad.

161
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,042
It tore her apart.

162
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,751
The father will be happy now!

163
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:56,127
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,586
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:03,919
Don't be upset.

166
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:07,087
What time is it?

167
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:09,504
It has been four hours.

168
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:13,838
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,421
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,214
Yes...I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:24,881
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:27,506
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:31,090
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,924
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:39,550
-Rest assured for that.
-We have to have faith.

176
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:44,426
I light some candles...

177
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:47,468
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:51,427
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:54,427
Not yet.

180
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:58,720
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:04,054
She never took them off.

182
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:20,390
I will get a vase.

183
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:43,435
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:47,144
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:51,519
And yet...the way things
stand here...

186
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:56,979
...I don't want to go.

187
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,314
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:25,941
No smoking here.

189
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,859
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:36,110
-Or rather, I talked.
-And what did you say?

191
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,652
Things that concern me.

192
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,486
Did she tell you anything
about me?

193
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:47,611
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

194
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:53,029
-It's my fault for what happened.
-No, it's my fault.

195
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:03,276
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,319
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:14,403
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,695
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:24,071
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,655
We were in Africa.

201
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:30,239
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:35,489
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,198
...and totally naked...

204
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:44,324
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,991
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,867
I hate that woman.

207
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:56,993
-I haven't seen her for years.
-Even worse.

208
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,118
What can I do to make you
forget her?

209
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,785
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:37,499
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,208
-Is Dr Vega here?
-He is in his office.

212
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,465
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,508
-She opened her eyes.
-That gives me the creeps!

214
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,966
-And when she yawns?
-I shit myself!

215
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:41,134
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:44,093
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,676
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:51,761
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,886
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:59,345
There is no hope?

221
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:04,387
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,721
RESUSCITATION

223
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:10,638
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:14,222
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

225
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:18,681
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:22,849
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,849
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,766
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:31,017
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

230
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,809
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,393
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:36:39,935 --> 00:36:43,977
Her brain cell has been
completely destroyed.

233
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,311
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:54,312
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,229
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:00,605
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:18,024
Come in, please.

238
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:32,901
-My name is Benigno.
-Marco Zuloaga

239
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:35,235
This is Alicia.

240
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,694
Was it your first night here?

241
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,778
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:47,904
Why these boots?

243
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,446
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:56,196
-They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
-I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:59,989
-I know you.
-From my books?

246
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:05,781
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:12,366
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:19,117
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Caf?Muller".

249
00:38:20,784 --> 00:38:22,867
I have to go.

250
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,410
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:30,785
-Maybe another time.
-Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,827
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:38,328
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:39:02,582 --> 00:39:06,624
-Should I call Dr Vega;
-Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:24,710
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,669
...I found some
from your visit.

257
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,670
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:38,379
...that never took place.

259
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:42,296
-What about?
-Your sexual orientation.

260
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:48,756
-My sexual orientation?
-yes, your sexuality.

261
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:53,215
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:59,507
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:39:59,882 --> 00:40:03,841
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,592
... I think I look for men,
mostly.

265
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:15,218
-Is this why you came to see me?
-I can't remember now.

266
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:20,719
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:22,928
Do you have a partner?

268
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:28,720
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:32,387
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,430
Was her father here?

271
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:44,014
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:47,806
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,057
-What is my orientation?
-And what did you say?

274
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,766
-That I like men.
-Really?

275
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:56,933
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:40:57,225 --> 00:41:00,683
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:04,059
-What does he care?
-I am glad I found out.

278
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:09,393
Did he ask the head nurseor you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

279
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:13,519
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,937
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

281
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:30,646
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

282
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:33,855
...a chorography
that thrills me.

283
00:41:33,855 --> 00:41:37,731
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:41,023
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:44,023
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:48,191
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:53,233
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

288
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:58,359
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,360
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:06,485
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,694
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,612
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,070
Very good!

294
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,195
Alicia loved it.

295
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:22,404
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:26,488
the female emerges from
the male.

297
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,947
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:35,990
The beach?

299
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,616
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,241
The water?

301
00:42:44,074 --> 00:42:46,075
The ethereal.

302
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,367
The ethereal...
the impreceptible, the ghost.

303
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:55,535
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:59,952
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,286
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:07,953
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:12,162
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:15,746
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,788
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:29,790
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:32,790
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,292
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,793
-You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
-I will.

314
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,879
Look...We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:11,755
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:19,548
I love this room.

317
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:22,965
I will order everything.

318
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:32,091
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,884
How are you?...Shit down.

320
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:43,968
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:44:43,968 --> 00:44:46,927
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

322
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:52,094
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:44:52,094 --> 00:44:54,928
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:58,595
Dancing teacher.

325
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:01,221
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:04,846
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:08,305
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:19,557
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:45:52,604 --> 00:45:55,938
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:58,188
I am coming, mum.

331
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:49,404
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

332
00:46:53,738 --> 00:46:57,864
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,865
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,574
-Where are you going?
-Home.

335
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:12,074
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:16,325
-Yes, but I am going home.
-Of course...It will do me good.

337
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:20,492
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:23,159
-Do you like dancing?
-Yes, of course

339
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:25,576
But I don't follow it.

340
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,327
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:32,286
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:36,620
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:41,454
-Where do you go when you go out?
-I don't.

344
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:43,704
You should go out.

345
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:47,121
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:51,080
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

347
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,289
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:28,086
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:33,379
Twenty three.

350
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:39,129
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,005
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:54,590
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,424
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:02,550
-Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
-Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:05,133
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:07,426
Your name?

357
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:28,512
-What do you want?
-I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:40,264
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:49:46,765 --> 00:49:50,557
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:56,850
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:49:57,183 --> 00:50:00,225
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:06,060
I started when I was little.

363
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:10,935
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:16,520
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:20,353
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:24,771
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,313
But those by post.

368
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:31,355
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:35,439
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:38,606
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

371
00:50:39,023 --> 00:50:42,274
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,982
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:49,900
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:54,150
-What did your father say?
-Nothing. What could he?

375
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,401
-Is he dead?
-God, no.

376
00:50:57,818 --> 00:51:02,693
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:05,569
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:11,111
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,487
We are not in touch.

380
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:19,946
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

381
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:24,405
-What's your problem?
-Me? Nothing.

382
00:51:24,405 --> 00:51:28,697
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:34,073
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:40,158
Did you have a sexual
relationship with a woman?

385
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,992
-With a man?
-No, neither.

386
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:50,284
I will see you in a week.

387
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:53,826
-Am I not well doctor?
-That's not it...

388
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:58,035
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:01,744
-It wasn't special.
-It was. Very special.

390
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,120
And we must analyse it in depth.

391
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,329
Yes, lets analyse it.

392
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:16,496
-Should I come in a week?
-Very well.

393
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,414
I am glad.

394
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:55,720
-What are you doing here?
-I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,429
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:21,266
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:25,642
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:16,524
Can you be in charge?

399
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:36,944
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,112
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

401
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:44,820
It was raining during that
whole week.

402
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:54,405
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:56,197
What happened to her?

404
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:59,489
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:56:00,865 --> 00:56:05,032
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,741
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:12,700
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:56:13,117 --> 00:56:18,242
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:22,368
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,577
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,577
Right, Alicia?

412
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,620
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

413
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,371
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:56:40,537 --> 00:56:43,996
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:47,455
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:52,248
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:54,540
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,457
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,832
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:06,333
I can't touch her.

421
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,751
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:16,001
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,877
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:57:19,877 --> 00:57:22,961
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,378
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:28,337
How are you so certain
about this?

427
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,670
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:36,046
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:40,422
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:57:40,547 --> 00:57:44,631
...don't foget that she's alive
and that you love her.

431
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:48,923
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:57:50,507 --> 00:57:53,590
And what do you know
about women?

433
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:58,091
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,801
What do you know about women?

435
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:10,510
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

436
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,677
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

437
00:58:16,677 --> 00:58:19,761
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:24,053
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,471
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:33,222
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

441
00:58:35,055 --> 00:58:39,848
-Is he gay too?
-No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:44,182
-Is Benigno, you think?
-Rumours say so!

443
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:47,849
-You are wrong.
-Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:51,808
-And where did he find out?
-From Alicia's father.

445
00:58:51,808 --> 00:58:55,225
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:58:55,225 --> 00:58:58,976
...but Vega told me not to
worry, becayse he is gay.

447
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:03,601
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:11,561
-She likes Benigno.
-She is not with her senses.

449
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:20,937
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:24,188
-Are you coming?
-I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:27,147
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,814
This woman is not well.

453
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:36,606
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:40,149
lets see... Here...

455
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:47,566
-Did you talk to her?
-No, and don't insist.

456
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:56,860
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:02,527
Have a good time at work.

458
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,530
'Shrinked lover'.

459
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:36,241
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:43,158
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:46,367
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:13,330
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:20,081
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:25,748
It was the love story...

465
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:30,291
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

466
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:34,958
...kai Amparo's friend
who is a scientist.

467
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,917
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,376
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:46,418
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:15,423
I found it!

471
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:27,383
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:38,385
You still think I act
with selfishness?

473
01:03:10,848 --> 01:03:13,223
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:28,767
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:39,061
Time was passing by...

476
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:42,144
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:46,020
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:53,396
I will always love you.

479
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:57,272
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:03:57,272 --> 01:04:01,147
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:04,565
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

482
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:08,815
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

483
01:04:09,107 --> 01:04:12,649
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

484
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:15,983
But the most important
thing is...

485
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:21,109
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

486
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:26,735
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:31,569
And goes there.

488
01:05:17,743 --> 01:05:21,035
Hotel Iukali.
Room 15.

489
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:52,248
-Sleep, my darling.
-And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:26,188
And Alfredo...

491
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,648
...stays inside her...

492
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,898
...for ever.

493
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:02,319
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:09:03,403 --> 01:09:07,570
Come on, put your hands
correctly ... This way...

495
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:16,613
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:20,155
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

497
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:23,614
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:27,031
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:32,032
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

500
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:36,616
What do you think they say?

501
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:40,033
They have no shame.

502
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:43,534
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:48,993
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:10:25,915 --> 01:10:28,332
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:32,625
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:39,668
Join your hands together...

507
01:10:40,043 --> 01:10:44,335
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:51,878
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:55,670
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:59,837
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:11:00,337 --> 01:11:04,588
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,214
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:13,881
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:11:14,298 --> 01:11:18,132
May your love last eternally.

515
01:11:18,715 --> 01:11:22,091
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:11:22,174 --> 01:11:26,383
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:11:26,675 --> 01:11:30,092
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:33,426
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:36,760
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,760
As you wish.

521
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:47,636
-Nice ceremony, right?
-Excellent.

522
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:55,013
-I didn't expect her so young.
-You don't trust me right?

523
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:59,472
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:04,139
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

525
01:12:04,722 --> 01:12:08,765
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:11,723
-Right.
-And you shouldn't have.

527
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,015
Don't you believe me?

528
01:12:14,307 --> 01:12:18,641
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:12:20,892 --> 01:12:24,017
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:27,309
I travelled with Angela.

531
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:30,976
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:35,894
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:40,728
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,270
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,521
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:52,271
Did you still love her?

537
01:12:53,938 --> 01:12:58,106
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:12:59,147 --> 01:13:03,273
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:13:03,982 --> 01:13:06,274
What a sad story!

540
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:10,524
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

541
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:13,066
...as the song says.

542
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:16,192
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:13:16,483 --> 01:13:20,526
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

544
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:23,318
You're right.

545
01:13:49,822 --> 01:13:53,156
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

546
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:56,573
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

547
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:00,407
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:02,949
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:14:04,658 --> 01:14:08,033
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:13,367
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:19,035
It was you she cried for.

552
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:25,869
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:14:27,328 --> 01:14:30,203
Last time we spoke.

554
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:33,704
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:36,996
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:39,371
Like at your place.

557
01:15:17,169 --> 01:15:19,669
I am alone again.

558
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,587
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:29,796
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:15:30,129 --> 01:15:34,797
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:37,380
And Lydia?

562
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:40,422
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:15:42,423 --> 01:15:44,506
Did you break up?

564
01:15:45,465 --> 01:15:48,507
You can call it that way.

565
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:52,633
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:58,925
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:01,384
When are you going?

568
01:16:01,384 --> 01:16:04,385
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:07,135
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:15,178
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:16:17,553 --> 01:16:21,262
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:16:22,762 --> 01:16:26,888
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:16:28,263 --> 01:16:30,722
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:47,016
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:51,975
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:16:53,184 --> 01:16:55,559
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:58,518
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:16:58,518 --> 01:17:01,935
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:17:02,435 --> 01:17:06,186
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:28,523
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:17:30,273 --> 01:17:32,690
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:17:34,273 --> 01:17:38,649
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:42,900
Is there something wrong?

584
01:17:43,317 --> 01:17:46,400
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:49,693
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:17:49,693 --> 01:17:52,901
-It's not serious, I hope.
-I don't know.

587
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:56,985
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:17:58,027 --> 01:18:01,194
Brazil...

589
01:18:01,194 --> 01:18:03,528
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:18:04,403 --> 01:18:07,612
-I will read them to Alicia.
-They are guides.

591
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,029
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:13,655
-Are you travelling alone?
-Yes.

593
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:17,113
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,739
-About what?
-loneliness.

595
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,281
I want to get married.

596
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:29,074
-Alicia, of course!
-Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:18:29,074 --> 01:18:32,241
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,616
-Why shouldn't I marry her?
-Because she is in a coma!

599
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:41,075
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:45,201
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,118
Get in the car!

602
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:49,660
-What are you talking about?
-Get in the car!

603
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:59,495
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:03,454
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:19:04,037 --> 01:19:08,038
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:11,997
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:17,373
Promise!...If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,624
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:19:22,874 --> 01:19:26,041
-Regardless of how much you like her...
-You like her too, right?

610
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,208
Of course I like her.

611
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:32,625
-She likes you too.
-She is virtually dead!

612
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:36,667
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:39,293
Understand that!

614
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:48,461
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:19:48,461 --> 01:19:51,878
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:19:51,878 --> 01:19:55,045
...which bastard did it!

617
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:57,504
Everyone is upset.

618
01:19:57,504 --> 01:20:01,338
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,922
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:07,839
Rosa, please.

621
01:20:09,047 --> 01:20:12,965
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:17,507
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:20,883
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:24,216
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:27,800
I was down with flu
during that week.

626
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:31,884
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:35,302
-It is your typewriting.
-Yes, it was me.

628
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:38,469
Why did you lie?

629
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:41,552
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:20:41,552 --> 01:20:45,136
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

631
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:50,554
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:54,096
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:56,430
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,805
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,723
And who replaces her?

636
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:10,557
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,849
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:21:13,932 --> 01:21:16,183
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:23,142
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:27,268
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:21:27,268 --> 01:21:31,644
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:33,852
Definitely not!

643
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,354
Last night I was
at the parkin lot...

644
01:21:42,354 --> 01:21:46,313
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:21:46,438 --> 01:21:49,938
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:54,314
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:21:57,231 --> 01:21:59,690
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:03,148
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:22:05,315 --> 01:22:08,941
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,403
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:36,070
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:42,280
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,447
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:22:45,572 --> 01:22:47,905
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

655
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,864
-And sister Rosa Lazaga;
-Who are you?

656
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:53,531
-Marco Zuloaga.
-I will put you through.

657
01:22:58,032 --> 01:23:01,116
-Who is it?
-Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:23:02,033 --> 01:23:05,200
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,742
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:10,867
You should have called me.

661
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,826
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:23:15,076 --> 01:23:18,327
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:21,952
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:28,703
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:34,413
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

666
01:23:34,413 --> 01:23:36,538
Did you go see him?

667
01:23:36,538 --> 01:23:39,455
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:42,997
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:23:43,206 --> 01:23:46,706
-What prison is he in?
-In Zegovia.

670
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:40,214
Wait for me here.

671
01:24:55,634 --> 01:24:59,134
-I want to see a prisoner.
-In the visting section.

672
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:01,676
Through this door,on the left.

673
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:16,095
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:25:16,095 --> 01:25:19,221
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:25:19,221 --> 01:25:21,429
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:25:22,638 --> 01:25:25,096
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:25:25,096 --> 01:25:29,055
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

678
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:32,806
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

679
01:25:33,223 --> 01:25:36,598
-Are you a relative?
-A friend.

680
01:25:36,723 --> 01:25:40,557
-Marco Zuloaga is my name.
-Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:25:43,433 --> 01:25:47,392
-Can I call him?
-He will call you.

682
01:25:47,683 --> 01:25:51,309
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:02,727
And remember.

684
01:26:02,727 --> 01:26:06,144
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:26:06,478 --> 01:26:10,437
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:13,979
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:19,647
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:26:20,688 --> 01:26:25,147
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:04,445
Marco, is that you?

690
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:09,738
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:27:12,196 --> 01:27:14,530
-Where are you?
-Outside the clinique.

692
01:27:16,697 --> 01:27:20,781
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:27:21,448 --> 01:27:24,698
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:29,116
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,866
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:27:32,866 --> 01:27:35,200
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:37,742
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:27:37,867 --> 01:27:40,742
-I don't believe this.
-Neither do I.

699
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,660
But I am not surpised they
won't tell us.

700
01:27:43,951 --> 01:27:47,535
-Are you still my friend?
-Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:27:47,744 --> 01:27:50,036
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:27:50,452 --> 01:27:53,869
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:27:54,078 --> 01:27:57,912
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:28:00,454 --> 01:28:05,080
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:28:07,163 --> 01:28:10,830
-Did you find out anything?
-I will. Be patient.

706
01:28:11,164 --> 01:28:16,498
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:28:17,206 --> 01:28:19,582
You must wait.

708
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:30,167
-What do you do during the day here?
-I work in the recovery room.

709
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:35,543
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

710
01:28:36,168 --> 01:28:39,668
-It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
-The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:28:40,127 --> 01:28:43,127
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:28:43,836 --> 01:28:47,961
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

713
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:55,379
This is good for the trail, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:28:55,796 --> 01:28:59,838
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:29:00,505 --> 01:29:04,714
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:29:04,964 --> 01:29:07,214
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:29:07,214 --> 01:29:09,215
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:29:10,423 --> 01:29:14,799
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:21,633
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:29:22,092 --> 01:29:25,259
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:28,634
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:29:29,426 --> 01:29:33,510
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

723
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:37,802
-Why during the nights?
-Because I study during the nights.

724
01:29:38,052 --> 01:29:40,844
I read all your guides.

725
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:44,720
Like travelling with you
next to me...

726
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,220
...telling me things.

727
01:29:47,512 --> 01:29:50,679
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:53,263
I became one with those people...

729
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:56,514
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:29:57,514 --> 01:30:00,806
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:30:00,806 --> 01:30:03,848
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:30:03,848 --> 01:30:05,973
...waiting in vain...

733
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:09,682
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:30:10,307 --> 01:30:13,391
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:30:32,144 --> 01:30:35,436
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:38,812
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:30:39,187 --> 01:30:44,021
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

738
01:30:44,854 --> 01:30:49,272
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:30:50,772 --> 01:30:54,898
-And I didn't want any money...
-It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:58,982
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:07,816
Did you see him?

742
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:11,817
-How is he?
-Well.

743
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:17,151
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:31:17,151 --> 01:31:19,443
No publicity!

745
01:31:19,443 --> 01:31:23,735
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:31:24,235 --> 01:31:27,528
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:31:27,528 --> 01:31:29,695
I would give them an interview!

748
01:31:29,945 --> 01:31:32,570
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,737
You are right.

750
01:31:35,237 --> 01:31:37,362
The keys...

751
01:31:37,946 --> 01:31:42,530
Anyway...Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:31:42,988 --> 01:31:47,281
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:31:47,864 --> 01:31:50,948
-Benigno is innocent.
-Yes, I know.

754
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,240
-Innocent about what?
-I don't know.

755
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:57,866
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:32:03,033 --> 01:32:06,575
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:08,886
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:34:11,428 --> 01:34:14,303
-How did the exercise go today?
-Very well.

759
01:34:14,303 --> 01:34:16,554
-Were you tired?
-A lot.

760
01:34:16,554 --> 01:34:20,179
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:34:21,471 --> 01:34:24,263
We will do some stretches.

762
01:34:24,597 --> 01:34:28,431
-But I already did 100.
-We'll do a few more.

763
01:35:05,478 --> 01:35:08,270
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:15,730
The boy was born dead.

765
01:35:15,855 --> 01:35:19,064
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:35:19,064 --> 01:35:22,397
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:35:22,856 --> 01:35:26,690
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:30,774
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:35:30,774 --> 01:35:34,441
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:37,608
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:42,400
-Can he bail out?
-Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:36:11,072 --> 01:36:13,864
-You are wet.
-A little.

773
01:36:13,864 --> 01:36:18,698
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:36:30,366 --> 01:36:34,284
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:36:36,909 --> 01:36:39,576
DId you see the new lawyer?

776
01:36:42,451 --> 01:36:46,577
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:36:48,994 --> 01:36:52,786
-I will loose, right?
-Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:36:52,786 --> 01:36:56,329
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:36:56,787 --> 01:37:01,079
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:05,163
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:37:09,081 --> 01:37:12,706
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

782
01:37:14,206 --> 01:37:17,915
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:20,041
I tried.

784
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:24,666
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:29,042
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:33,793
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:37:34,126 --> 01:37:37,752
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:38:33,052 --> 01:38:34,969
Message!

789
01:38:39,095 --> 01:38:43,012
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:38:43,887 --> 01:38:46,554
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:38:46,554 --> 01:38:49,596
...or they will put me
somewhere else

792
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:52,638
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

793
01:38:52,638 --> 01:38:56,431
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:59,473
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:38:59,764 --> 01:39:03,640
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:39:03,807 --> 01:39:06,432
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:39:24,268 --> 01:39:27,310
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:50,856
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:39:51,147 --> 01:39:54,231
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:39:54,523 --> 01:39:57,690
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:00,399
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:40:00,857 --> 01:40:03,483
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:13,526
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:40:27,153 --> 01:40:29,570
Wait, don't run.

805
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:37,738
In there at the end.

806
01:40:39,238 --> 01:40:42,447
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:40:43,114 --> 01:40:46,531
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:40:54,032 --> 01:40:56,324
Dear Marco...

809
01:40:56,324 --> 01:41:00,450
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:41:01,825 --> 01:41:05,534
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:41:06,034 --> 01:41:09,868
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

812
01:41:09,868 --> 01:41:13,535
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:15,827
...and to be near her.

814
01:41:16,577 --> 01:41:19,161
You are my only friend.

815
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:23,578
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:41:25,495 --> 01:41:29,996
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:41:30,579 --> 01:41:34,455
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:37,581
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,417
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:42:08,335 --> 01:42:10,711
You must sign here.

821
01:42:20,129 --> 01:42:22,337
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,422
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:42:33,172 --> 01:42:37,506
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:42:37,757 --> 01:42:40,299
...but it was too late.

825
01:42:40,424 --> 01:42:44,007
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

826
01:42:46,049 --> 01:42:48,717
And a photo of hers.

827
01:42:49,508 --> 01:42:52,634
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:56,926
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

829
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:25,732
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:44:26,065 --> 01:44:27,774
I will bring some water.

831
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:59,070
Are you ok?

832
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:04,071
I don't know...

833
01:45:06,571 --> 01:45:09,030
I am much better now.

834
01:45:22,324 --> 01:45:24,866
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:32,159
You tremble.

836
01:45:33,825 --> 01:45:35,367
Why?

837
01:45:46,744 --> 01:45:49,203
-What did you tell her?
-Noting.

838
01:45:49,203 --> 01:45:51,287
I saw you talking.

839
01:45:51,287 --> 01:45:54,787
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

840
01:45:56,704 --> 01:46:01,330
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,039
In Benigno's place?

842
01:46:05,664 --> 01:46:09,206
-Why do you stay there?
-Benigno is dead.

843
01:46:14,457 --> 01:46:17,749
One day, we should talk.

844
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:21,666
Yes, and it will be simpler
than you thought.

845
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,083
Nothing is simple.

846
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:27,709
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple.
and nothing is simple.
