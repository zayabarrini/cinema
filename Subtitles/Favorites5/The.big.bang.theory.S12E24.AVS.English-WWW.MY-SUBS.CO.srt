00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,879

You're talking to me.

I am.
(gasps)

33
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,891
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

34
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,961
We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

35
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,229
Amy?

Angry Amy?

38
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,500
I don't want you to say it

39
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:16,513
just because social convention
dictates that you...

40
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:17,470
I love you, too.

41
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,871
Will you marry me?

42
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,172
(softly): Yes.
(chuckles)

43
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:21,340
We did it!

44
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,743
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

45
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,712
I wonder which one's Halley.

WOLOWITZ:
<i>That...</i>

00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:35,454
means... positive?

50
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,190

Super asymmetry, that's it!

PENNY:
Really hope

61
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:58,340
you're almost to zero.

62
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,846
No, see,
that's the beauty of half-lives:

63
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:03,182
it's impossible to determine
when you'll arrive at zero.

64
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,583
It's like
"Wheels on the Bus"

65
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,987
if the bus had
an unknowable number of parts.

66
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,434
Yeah, we're gonna need
more coffee.

67
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,225
Yep. I'm with you.
Leonard, coffee?

68
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:15,928
Black and strong,
like Luke Cage.

69
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:18,998
I'm too tired
to even be disturbed by that.

70
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,166
Sheldon?

71
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,567
Mm, absolutely not, no.

72
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,403
The Nobel committee will be
making the calls to inform

73
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,939
the winners at any minute,
so the only drug I need

74
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,674
is the endorphins pumping
through my brain

75
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,509
in anticipation of our victory.

76
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:32,256
Well, technically, anticipation
wouldn't be mediated

77
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,847
by endorphins as much
as dopamine, but, you know,

78
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,550
you've been up all night,
so I'll give you that one.

79
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:44,089
Really? The second
he stops talking?

80
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:46,525
Well... should we wake him up?

81
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,661
Well, he did say
if he fell asleep,

82
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,197
we were allowed
to slap him awake.

83
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,866
Oh, boy.

84
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,936
Wait a minute.
Why do you get to do it?

85
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:57,692
'Cause I called it.

86
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,716
Well, you can't just call it.
You have to earn it.

87
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,373
Oh, and you've earned it?

88
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,777
No one has earned it
more than me.

89
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,679
(Amy clearing throat)

90
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,717
You have your whole life
to smack him around.

91
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,118
This is my time.

92
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,021
Fine. Don't miss.

93
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,325
It's not a volleyball.
I can handle it.

94
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,693
Oh, wait. Hang on.

95
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,262
When you're old, you are
gonna want a record of this.

96
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,396
Oh, oh, yeah.

97
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:27,466
Do it in slo-mo.
I want to see his cheeks ripple.

98
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,503
Ready... go.

99
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:32,738
(ringtone playing)
(gasps) It's happening!

100
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,773
Unknown caller.
It's got to be them.

101
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,775
Okay, put it on speaker.

102
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,210
- Hello?
- Hi.

103
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,746
MAN:
Hello. This is Sweden calling.

104
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,284
Is this Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler?

105
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,519
- Yes.
- Yeah.

106
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,354
Congratulations.

107
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:51,757
It is my pleasure to inform you
that you've won the Nobel Prize

108
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:53,993
in being suckers...!

109
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,266
His Swedish accent
was very convincing.

110
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,270
(ringtone playing)
(gasps) This is it!

111
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,438
What do you want, Howard?

112
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,440
We were just calling to see
if you'd heard yet.

113
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,608
We haven't.

114
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,797
But thank you for getting up

115
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,777
so early to call.

116
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:12,945
That was very thoughtful.

117
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:14,414
Oh, please. We have
two little kids.

118
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:16,549
We've been up for an hour.

119
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,684
WOLOWITZ:
Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?

120
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,452
No.

121
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,054
Okay, well, call us
when you hear.

122
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:24,523
All right,
now what?

123
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,192
Oh, why don't we play a game
to pass the time?

124
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,528
Here. Uh, I am thinking
of a number.

125
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:33,098
Hint: it's a cube of a cube
of a prime.

126
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,067
There's an infinite number
of possibilities.

127
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,569
What, you got somewhere to be?

128
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,203
(ringtone playing)

129
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,806
Oh. That's me.

130
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,241
Hello?

131
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,843
Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.

132
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,279
I see.

133
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,482
Okay, thank you.

134
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,487
We won.

135
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,956

136
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,830
Congratulations!

137
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,365
Oh, my God!

138
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,667
- We did it.
-I know.

139
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,169
Can you believe it?
(gasps)

140
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,671
That's a good point.
What if I'm dreaming?

one from my mom.

162
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,482
(phone vibrates)
And my sister.

163
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,951
(phone vibrates)
Oh, and my brother.

164
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,718
(phone vibrates)
And my brother's ex-wife.

165
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:16,465
(phone vibrates)
My brother's other ex-wife.

166
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:19,156
Boy, they don't tell you
when you win a Nobel

167
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,292
it chews up
your phone battery.

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,394
(phone vibrates)
AMY: Oh, that's me.

169
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,199
It's CVS.
My prescription's ready.

170
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:30,401
(phone vibrates)
Oh, and also my dad.

171
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,037
He says congratulations
and he loves me.

172
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,238
Nothing about me?

173
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,372
(phone vibrates)
Oh.

174
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,675
Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.

175
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:39,710
You know, when you
think about it,

176
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,478
now that we're Nobel
Prize winners,

177
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,303
our names will be linked
together forever.

178
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:44,282
We're married.

179
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,928
Our names are already
linked together forever.

180
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,952
Oh, please. That's
just a piece of paper.

181
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,454
This is a piece of paper
and a medal.

182
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,423
AMY:
It's weird.

183
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,225
I don't really
feel different,

184
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,060
but I guess our lives
will never be the same.

185
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,597
Oh, I don't know. We're
going to work like always.

186
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,333
I still put my pants on
both legs at a time.

187
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,769
One day that's
gonna end very badly.

188
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,073
(reporters shouting)

189
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,611
Congratulations.
How does it feel?

190
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,146
Okay, w-we're happy
to answer your questions,

191
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,815
Just, um,
one at a time, please?

192
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,250
REPORTER:
Dr. Cooper!

193
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:22,786
Is Dr. Cooper coming back?

194
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:25,055
No. Next question.

195
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:26,657
(reporters shouting)

196
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,928
Was it your left hand
or your right hand?

197
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,464
Right.

198
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:36,300
Spit actually flew
out of his mouth.

199
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,369
SIEBERT:
Hey, fellas.

200
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,372
Can you do me a favor?

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,539
Do we have a choice?

202
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:43,608
Ha-ha!

203
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:44,708
No.

204
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,443
Sheldon and Amy

205
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,223
are now officially superstars,
and the press

206
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:50,914
will be reaching out to their
family and friends for comment.

207
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,183
So that we're all
on the same page,

208
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,453
the word we're gonna use
to describe them is "quirky."

209
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:58,922
And not <i>quirky.</i>
More like <i>quirky.</i>

210
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,924
So not Mr. and Mrs.
Wackadoodle?

211
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,092
SIEBERT:
Ho-ho-ho!

212
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:06,163
You bitter, envious little man.

213
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,803
Thank you so much.

214
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:18,876
And what do we call that?

215
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,678
- Quirky. - Quirky.
- Quirky.

216
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,150
Dr. Cooper, can I get
a minute of your time?

217
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,952
Hello?

218
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:30,087
Hey.

219
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:31,400
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah, actually.

220
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,990
Um, I had an appointment

221
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,225
to interview Dr. Cooper
about the Nobel.

222
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,560
Hang on a second.

223
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,629
Sheldon?

224
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,237
Sorry, he's not here.

225
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,440
Damn. I've got a deadline.

226
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,009
I don't know
if it helps you at all,

227
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:55,546
but I'm his best friend
in the whole world.

228
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:56,914
Really?

229
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:58,827
And an astronaut. Come on,
you can buy me a cup of coffee,

230
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,318
and I'll tell
you about both.

231
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,655
(Amy sobbing)

232
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,562
Everyone okay in there?

233
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,996
Go away!

234
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,798
Amy?

235
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,401
Raj, please, not now.

236
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,003
Hey, what's wrong?

237
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,505
My picture's
all over the Internet,

238
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,240
and I look terrible.

239
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,908
No. Let me see.

240
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:28,045
Well, that is
an unfortunate angle.

241
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,147
But who cares?

242
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,448
You just won the Nobel.

243
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,550
You should be proud
of this moment.

244
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,319
I know I shouldn't care
about how I look,

245
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,820
and I never thought I did.

246
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,190
It-It's stupid and shallow,
but I just can't help it.

247
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,693
Am I really this frumpy?

248
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,963
No. No, you are
a beautiful woman.

249
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,831
By the way,
if you're not happy

250
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,967
with those pictures,
then make some changes.

251
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,436
Get a haircut, new clothes,

252
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,438
new glasses, big glasses...

253
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,107
No glasses-- then you won't
be able to see those pictures.

254
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,043
Sounds expensive.

255
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,613
Excuse me,
i-if I'm not mistaken,

256
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,416
the Nobel comes with
a substantial cash prize.

257
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,117
What were you gonna
spend it on?

258
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,453
Hadn't really
thought about it.

259
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,290
Sheldon's got his eyes
on some new Dockers.

260
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,627
Come on.
Do something for yourself.

261
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,296
Well, I suppose
I could get a haircut.

262
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,900
And some makeup
and a new wardrobe

263
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:25,035
and a little thank you gift
for your shopping buddy

264
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,804
if we see something
he likes. Come on.

265
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,372
Where are we going?

266
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,475
Beverly Hills,
where the things he likes are.

267
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,180
Dinner ready?

268
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:38,182
Not unless you cooked.

269
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:43,587
Why is this article
about Sheldon all about you?

270
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,323
Let me see.

271
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:49,626
Oh, good, they used
my NASA picture.

272
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,896
Why does it say that
you're his best friend?

273
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,164
Leonard's his best friend.

274
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,732
No. Leonard
has always been

275
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,868
kind of a monkey butler.

276
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,903
Whenever Sheldon
got into a scrape,

277
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,839
I was his go-to guy.

278
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:03,173
(chuckles)

279
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,541
When did he get
into a scrape?

280
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,410
You're kidding, right?

281
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,923
W-- Remember
when he had a panic attack

282
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,524
'cause his hand got stuck
in a jar of olives?

283
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:13,217
I was the one who told him
to let go of the olives.

284
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,688
Please, that doesn't
make you his best friend.

285
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:19,022
(chuckles)

286
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,091
You know,
that reporter asked me

287
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,427
if I could put him in touch
with...

288
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,995
Amy's best friend.

289
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,096
That's Penny.

290
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,332
(singsongy):
Doesn't have to be.

291
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,304
Hmm.

292
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,940
What kind of tea
is appropriate

293
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,843
for winning a Nobel Prize
and now everything is changing

294
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:43,413
and you feel unmoored
from reality?

295
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:46,116
I don't know. Earl Grey?

296
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,384
You know,

297
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,453
this is something
I've wanted my whole life.

298
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,921
But I guess I never considered

299
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,456
how everything
would be different.

300
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,058
Buddy, I-I know it all feels
overwhelming right now,

301
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,060
but I promise you,
things will settle down.

302
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,061
There's no Earl Grey!

303
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,730
You filthy liar!

304
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,632
(knocking at door)

305
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,634
Hey, is Penny here?

306
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,702
No. Why?

307
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,903
I wanted to show her

308
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,037
my latest creation.

309
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,572
I give you...

310
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,508
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

311
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,384
Wow. Amy, you
look amazing.

312
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:21,752
Thank you.

313
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,588
Sheldon, what do you think?

314
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,461
I like you better
the way you were.

315
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,665
But she looks
beautiful!

316
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,667
Classic lines,

317
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,046
colors that complement
her skin tone,

318
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,005
and hair that goes from "office"
to "on the town" in minutes.

319
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,577
I don't care.
Put it back.

320
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,679
I like the way I look.

321
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,081
Well, I don't!

322
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,416
(door opens)

323
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,084
My fault.
I was out of Earl Grey.

324
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,419
(clears throat)

325
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,323
Sheldon, that was really rude.

326
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:01,959
I'm sorry. Amy is
the one constant I can count on,

327
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,594
and now she's changing.

328
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,429
It's just a haircut
and some clothes.

329
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:06,697
No, it's
the last straw!

330
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,099
I can't take any more!

331
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,101
(elevator bell dings)

332
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,507
Can you believe it?

333
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:18,856
They finally fixed the elevator.

334
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,249
This is
a nightmare.

335
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:28,557
What's with him?

336
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,791
He won a Nobel Prize,
and his wife looks amazing.

337
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,360
Oh. Yeah, got it.

338
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,362
(panting)

339
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,377
(gasping, panting)

340
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,948
How did you get down here?

341
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,683
The elevator. It's really fast.

342
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,853
I-I need to be alone right now.

343
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,854
Don't try to follow me.

344
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,855
All right.
You need a ride?

345
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,491
That'd be great.
Thank you.

346
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,861
I should've seen this coming.

347
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,963
Oh, stop. You're allowed
to get a haircut.

348
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,032
I know.

349
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,000
But I should've done it
gradually.

350
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,603
You know, like...

351
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,774
maybe 300 tiny haircuts
over a ten-year period.

352
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,645
Okay, you need to
focus on the positive.

353
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,847
You won a Nobel Prize.

354
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,048
I slapped Sheldon.

355
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,851
A lot of dreams
came true today.

356
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,021
You know, you're right.

357
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,956
This is a huge day for me,

358
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,558
and I'm allowed to enjoy it

359
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,260
without worrying how
it's going to affect my husband.

360
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,862
Is it me

361
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,199
or did it just
get fierce in here?

362
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,505
All this change
is just too much.

363
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,607
The reporters,

364
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,875
the attention at work,

365
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,543
and now even Amy's changed.

366
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

367
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,913
- Slow down.
- I'm playing a drinking game.

368
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,448
Every time you say
the word "change,"

369
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,750
I take a slug.

370
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,286
Are you gonna be able
to drive me home?

371
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,288
Mm. Not unless you
change the subject.

372
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,624
Huh. Now I said it.

373
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,626
Meh. Hmm.

374
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,742
You know, you're the
only person who could win

375
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,567
the biggest prize in science
and still be upset about it.

376
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,735
It's just...

377
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,737
all the times
I thought about winning,

378
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,372
I never thought
about how it would ch--

379
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,208
affect my life.

380
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,878
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely
concerned about your liver.

381
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,080
(chuckles):
Okay.

382
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,882
Fine, I'll stop playing.

383
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,263
You know, you go on and on about
wanting things to stay the same,

384
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,487
but you've changed a
lot since I met you.

385
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:43,423
Oh, you are a mean drunk.

386
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,691
I'm serious.

387
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,426
You have a ton of friends,

388
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,096
you got married, moved
into a new apartment,

389
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,365
you wore a baseball
hat that one time.

390
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,969
Heck, you've had sex almost as
many times as I have fingers.

391
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,238
More.

392
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,239
W...

393
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,907
By this many.

394
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,576
You dog!

395
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,722
It was the <i>Avengers</i> trailer.

396
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,678
Oh.

397
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,079
Mm-hmm.

398
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,726
You know, I've grown, too.
I used to be the bartender

399
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,316
back there.
- That's true.

400
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,029
And now there is
a completely different woman

401
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,719
who botched my drink order.

402
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,589
How hard is 65% Coke,
35% Diet Coke?

403
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,458
Well, judging
by the look on her face,

404
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,794
it's at least
one percent saliva.

405
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,066
I do take your point.

406
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,467
You know,
you're also married,

407
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,203
you have a successful career,
you no longer dress

408
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:34,174
like you're trying
to attract sailors by the wharf.

409
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,644
So, I guess the only thing
that actually stays the same

410
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,780
is that things are
always changing.

411
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,949
Interesting.

412
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,553
So you're saying
the inevitability of change

413
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:49,022
might be
a universal constant.

414
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,859
Well, there's a little more to
it than that, but, yeah, sure.

415
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,696
Oh. Hey, look,
that's Bernadette.

416
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,900
I can't tell you how many times
Dr. Fowler was gonna give up

417
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:00,968
and I would say to her,

418
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,337
"Amy, as your best friend,

419
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,372
I'm not gonna let you quit."

420
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,841
Okay, I'm drinking again.

421
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,142
I'll join you.
Waitress,

422
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,912
uh, 95% Hawaiian Punch,
five percent vodka.

423
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,913
WOLOWITZ:
Let me tell you about the time

424
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,981
Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...

425
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,484
(laughs)
This is a good one.

426
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,353
You know what, 90/10!

427
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,359
You know, I like
the way my hair looks.

428
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,394
I'm done tiptoeing
around him.

429
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,729
We're all guilty of it.

430
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,530
But why?

431
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,998
'Cause we were afraid
to upset him.

432
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:32,999
Which happens anyway.

433
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,868
Well, that's over.

434
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,837
I'm-I'm done enabling him.
Like,

435
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:37,905
this is his spot

436
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,741
and-and the thermostat
has to be set

437
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,209
to <i>his</i> comfort level,

438
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,621
even though he doesn't
even live here anymore

439
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,513
and I'm always chilly.

440
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:51,184
Is that why you wear
a hoodie all the time?

441
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,788
Why would-- Yes!

442
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,391
To accommodate
Sheldon!

443
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,859
And what-what
about this-this thing?

444
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,094
Why is it here?
I'll tell you why.

445
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,474
Because it was here
when I moved in,

446
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,097
and, for no earthly reason,

447
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,566
he forbade me to touch it.

448
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,768
Well, if you don't like it,

449
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,269
get rid of it.

450
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,071
Put it in the closet.

451
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
You know what,

452
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,509
I will.

453
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,018
I bet that's the reason.

454
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,326
Hang on.

455
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,465
What do you think?

456
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,534
Want to give it a try?

457
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,501
(elevator bell dings)

458
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,748
Well, you know,

459
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,551
the elevator did work
when I moved into the building.

460
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,554
So going up and down the stairs
was a change,

461
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,957
which means this would actually
be a return to the status quo.

462
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,546
- But, conversely, I think...
- Get in!

463
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,768
SHELDON:
This is wild.

464
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:22,742
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

465
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,065
Carbon.

466
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:27,936
Hydrogen.

467
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,906
Carbon.

468
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,176
Carbon.

469
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,146
And last but not least,

470
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:39,414
carbon.

471
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:42,717
This might be the glue talking,

472
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,454
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

473
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:47,523
Agreed.

474
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,657
What kind of DNA
is this, anyway?

475
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,659
I was trying to design
the genetic code

476
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,661
of an advanced race
of human being.

477
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,414
One of my rare failures,
actually.

478
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:56,265
What went wrong?

479
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,067
The balls kept
sticking to my pants.

480
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,203
Let's just let it dry.

481
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,671
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hey, babe.

482
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,017
Oh, don't slam the...
Don't slam the...

483
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,074
(gasps)

484
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,546
That was exhilarating.

485
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,716
- You pick up your dresses?
AMY: Yep.

486
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:17,185
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

487
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:19,220
Best day of my life.

488
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,724
What about the day you met me?

489
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:25,627
I stand by my statement.

490
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,562
Well, thank you guys so much
for the clothes

491
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,997
and the shoes,
the plane tickets.

492
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,365
You've been so generous.

493
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,044
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

494
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,535
get to share
this moment with us.

495
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,470
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

496
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,883
you had a front-row
seat to history.

497
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:37,972
Although, technically,

498
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,075
I think your seats are
in the second row.

499
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,878
Do you want to go back to the apartment
and see me try on my dress?

500
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,192
Shouldn't I see it for the first
time at the Nobel ceremony?

501
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,615
It's not a wedding.

502
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:48,995
Okay. Well, give me
a minute to think

503
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,619
of another reason I
don't want to see it.

504
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,833
How about this-- you can
practice your acceptance speech

505
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,223
while I try on the dress.

506
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,793
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

507
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,201
Was Amy suspicious when
they had to let your dress out?

508
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,904
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

509
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,110
Someone's gonna figure it out.
Why don't we just tell people?

510
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,008
No, it's too early.

511
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,059
I haven't even wrapped
my head around it.

512
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,212
- I have. My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well...

513
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,782
if something else had been wrapped,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

514
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:24,686
Excuse me, but if I recall, you're the one
who went out drinking with Sheldon,

515
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:26,387
then came home and attacked me.

516
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,957
Attacked you? I said,
"Do you wanna?"

517
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,425
Yeah.

518
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,194
- I was helpless.
-Uh-huh.

519
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:34,963
So...

520
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:38,166
(laughs):
do you wanna?

521
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,568
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Mm-hmm.

522
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:41,204
We'll see about that.

Now, Michael, Mommy and Daddy

534
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,518
are going away
for a couple days,

535
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:12,131
so if you're gonna say
your first words,

536
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,689
you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

537
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:18,726
WOLOWITZ:
Somebody just peed

538
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,761
in the big girl potty.

539
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,763
BERNADETTE:
Oh, I'm so proud!

540
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:24,665
It was her, right?

541
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,867
Yes.

542
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:28,169
You still feel good
about leaving them

543
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,972
with Stuart and Denise
for a couple days?

544
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,342
I guess. I just hope we don't
miss Michael's first words.

545
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,410
Or Stuart's last words.

546
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,312
You realize it's been years

547
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,882
since we've got away
just the two of us.

548
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,151
I know. I can't wait.

549
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:46,154
Fancy hotel room.
The big bed.

550
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:49,824
Yeah. We're gonna
sleep our asses off.

551
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,729
You really think walking her

552
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:56,497
is gonna help me meet girls?

553
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,599
Cinnamon is chick bait.

554
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,501
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

555
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,903
Just remember,

556
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,771
you're in charge.

557
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,473
Don't let her pull <i>you.</i>

558
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,179
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

559
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,081
And please, if you have
any problems, any questions,

560
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,650
call me immediately, okay?

561
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,618
She's my baby.

562
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,687
It shouldn't come up,
but just in case:

563
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,890
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

564
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,261
Kidding. If she dies,
I'll just tell you.

565
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,898
Ready?

566
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,333
Oh. Hang on.

567
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,305
Go.

Sheldon, Sheldon.
Why are you talking so fast?

575
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,953
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

576
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,855
Nobody's gonna be able to
understand a word you're saying.

577
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:57,225
Welcome to my life.

578
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,694
I think you need
to do some editing,

579
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:02,330
like maybe cut out all
that stuff about your childhood.

580
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,266
Are you kidding? Growing up
in the backwoods of East Texas

581
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,836
is what makes me warm
and relatable.

582
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,238
Well, what about all these pages

583
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,406
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

584
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,542
I told them all
they would rue the day.

585
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:17,411
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

586
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,080
and they're not filled with rue?

587
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,816
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

588
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,551
This is about...

589
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
humbly accepting
a great honor.

590
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:28,556
Amy, we won the Nobel
Prize in Physics.

591
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,459
Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels

592
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,729
like Literature,
Economics and Peace.

593
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,331
Please tell me that's
not in your speech.

594
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,801
Oh. I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

595
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,907
All right, bagels down.
Before we head to the airport,

596
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,309
I'd like to go over
a few things.

597
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:50,011
(others groaning)

598
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,380
From the moment we
step off the plane,

599
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,849
each and every one of you
is an ambassador

600

for Amy and myself.

601
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,120
(quietly): I told you
these tickets weren't free.

602
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:02,690
As such, your behavior must
reflect the highest standards.

603
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,559
Uh, Raj. Bagel down.

604
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:09,397
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

605
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:11,299
Amy, why don't you
kick us off.

606
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,533
Thank you.

00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:28,849
well, we should head out now
if we're gonna get

638
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,611
to the airport
six hours before boarding.

639
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,381
Excuse me. Hello?
What did we

640
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:35,816
just learn about the end
of business meetings?

641
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,284
Oh, my God.
(others groaning)

642
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:42,056
(all grumbling)
Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.

643
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:44,992
Go on.

644
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,660
You first. Go.

645
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,764
AMY:
Wait.

646
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,031
BERNADETTE: Help me!
Oh.

647
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,401
Help me!
Oh, wait. Come here.

648
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:54,780
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

649
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:56,937
(yelling)

650
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,305
Hang on.

651
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:00,107
I've-I've got an idea.

652
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,542
(bell dings)

653
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,582
Well done. You know,
you're proving to be

654
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:11,385
an invaluable part
of my entourage.

655
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:12,653
Cool.

656
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,167
Yeah?

657
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,202
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

658
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,338
Well, this is the furthest we've
ever been away from the kids.

659
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:34,008
I was just checking to see
if you're okay.

660
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:37,344
I'm on my second Jack Reacher.
I'm doing great.

661
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,612
Good. Me, too.

662
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:40,014
I was just looking
at the map.

663
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,482
Couldn't help
thinking: we're here

664
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,185
and they're there, and
if anything happened,

665
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:47,888
we'd have to go here to get
all the way back there.

666
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,890
Why are you trying
to freak me out?

667
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,025
This is our vacation.

668
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:54,161
I thought we should
do things together.

669
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,197
Howard, the kids are okay.

670
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:57,198
How do you know that?

671
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,633
I just know.
A mother knows.

672
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:03,037
So what,
now the Force is with you?

673
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,438
Let's see.

674
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:07,608
This is not the woman
you want to annoy.

675
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,312
- Howard. Howard.
- What?

676
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,048
You see the woman
sitting next to me?

677
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:15,549
What about her?

678
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:17,151
Is this her?

679
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,288
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

680
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,957
Shh! Be cool.

681
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:27,194
- No, that's not her.
- Okay.

682
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,196
How about now?

683
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,535
Uh-oh.

684
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:42,109
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

685
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,744
in the last two hours.

686
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,579
So?

687
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,749
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

688
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:52,219
- So?
- So she clearly has

689
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:53,721
some sort of
stomach distress.

690
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,589
If it's viral, we're
all susceptible.

691
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,491
She's probably just airsick.

692
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Yeah, but what
if she's not?

693
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:00,828
What if we get
what she has?

694
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,830
What if we infect
the King of Sweden?

695
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,465
That's how wars start.

696
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:13,307
All right, that's it, this is <i>Outbreak</i>
and she's the monkey.

697
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,976
(quietly):
Wait. Stop.

698
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,712
Be reasonable.

699
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,247
Leonard...

700
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,616
we need to do something
about your wife.

701
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,229
- What's the matter?
- She is clearly sick,

702
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:25,388
and she's gonna take us
all down with her.

703
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:26,988
She's not sick, Sheldon.

704
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:28,355
She is, and I'm
gonna catch it,

705
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,457
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

706
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:33,360
I promise you're not going
to get what she has.

707
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:34,495
What's going on?

708
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,530
(gasps)
Unclean! Unclean!

709
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,065
What?

710
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:39,633
He thinks you're sick.

711
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,035
Oh.

712
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:42,836
Should we tell him?

713
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,371
Well, if we don't,
he might try

714
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,760
and jump out of the plane.
- Yeah.

715
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,308
Doesn't answer my question.

716
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,810
Tell me what?

717
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:52,413
(sighs)
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

718
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:54,782
You're right,
I can't catch that.

719
00:29:58,387 --> 00:29:59,653
(groans)

720
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:01,021
Good news, Amy.

721
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,556
She's just pregnant.

722
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,637
Are you kidding me?

723
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:13,606
You just found out that a woman
who has loved and cared for you

724
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:16,409
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

725
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,745
you're relieved that she's
not gonna get you sick?

726
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,814
There's no need
for a recap.

727
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:22,248
I was there.

728
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,686
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

729
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,621
I'm not anybody.
I'm your best friend.

730
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,824
- What's going on?
- She's pregnant.

731
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:32,125
That's fantastic!

732
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:34,594
Why didn't you tell me?

733
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:36,729
She didn't tell
me, either.

734
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,231
But I'm her best friend.

735
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,434
(chuckles) We'll get
into that later.

736
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:44,103
What happened to "I'm
never gonna have kids"?

737
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,506
It was an accident. I went out
drinking with Sheldon.

738
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,708
(gasps) Oh, my gosh.

739
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:51,077
We're sister wives?

740
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:53,580
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

741
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:55,448
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

742
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,684
And a little Idris Elba.

743
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,018
- I mean, ah...
- Oh, yeah.

744
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,589
What would you like me to say?

745
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,257
How about congratulating us?

746
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:06,259
Are congratulations
even in order?

747
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,228
I didn't think
Penny wanted children.

748
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:10,374
Well, she didn't, now she
does. And just so you know,

749
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:11,509
we weren't gonna tell anybody

750
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:13,399
so we wouldn't
upstage your big day.

751
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,535
Oh, please,
you couldn't upstage us.

752
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:16,836
We won a Nobel Prize.

753
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:18,605
Any idiot can have a baby.

754
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:20,139
Hey. What's going on?

755
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,708
Case in point.

756
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,745
You are a selfish jerk.

757
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:27,614
To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.

758
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,851
I found her boarding pass
in her purse.

759
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,119
It's totally her.

760
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:38,725
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.

761
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Seeing if everything's okay.

762
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,762
Oh, yeah, we're having fun.

763
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:46,633
Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.

764
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,801
- Oh, that's nice.
STUART: Yeah.

765
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,271
I found Denise right away.

766
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,574
Where was Halley hiding?

767
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:58,678
Uh, the important thing
is she's not there now.

768
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:01,114
Okay, so, everyone's
happy and healthy?

769
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:02,749
Well, that depends.

770
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:03,917
What's that mean?

771
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,885
Uh, how many teeth

772
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:08,121
did Halley have when you left?

773
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:09,956
All of them.

774
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:14,127
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
what I was afraid of.

775
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:15,528
What happened?

776
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,196
Um, well, all right.

777
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:20,300
Um, Michael had a little fever
last night.

778
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,768
Michael had a fever?

779
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:23,703
Do you want to hear about Halley
or not?

780
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:25,171
What happened, Stuart?

781
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,974
He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.

782
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:30,343
And Halley, bless her heart,

783
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:32,211
wanted to bring him
his boo-boo bear,

784
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,614
so she climbed
over the safety rail

785
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:38,217
and took a little tumble
down the stairs.

786
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,386
She fell down the stairs?!

787
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,222
(stammers)
She rolled down the stairs,

788
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,358
laughing the whole time.
(chuckles)

789
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,926
Anyway,
when she got to the bottom,

790
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:49,228
there was a tooth missing.

791
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:50,297
Oh, Stuart!

792
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:51,531
She's fine!

793
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,900
She thought it was funny.

794
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,502
Did you at least save
it for the tooth fairy?

795
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,504
No, we couldn't find it.

796
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:00,173
We have a theory

797
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,641
about where it is,
but it'll take

798
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,677
six to eight hours to confirm.

799
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:06,679
Speaking of which,

800
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:09,849
where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?

801
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,621
Come on, you didn't
seriously expect him to react

802
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,023
like a normal human being.

803
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,591
No, but still,

804
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,593
a-after all these years,

805
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,062
after all the crap
I've put up with,

806
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:23,563
you'd think just this once

807
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,665
he'd care
about someone else's feelings.

808
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,533
- Oh, my God!
- What?

809
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:29,936
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

810
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:31,537
Really?

811
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,873
Sounds gross.
Looks gross. Smells gross.

812
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,209
It's delicious!

813
00:33:36,277 --> 00:33:37,443
(knock on door)

814
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:40,913
Ooh, that might
be my salted cod!

815
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:44,450
What?

816
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,853
Sheldon has something
he'd like to say.

817
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,221
SHELDON:
I'm sorry I didn't

818
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:49,455
react appropriately.

819
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:51,524
You and Penny are bringing
new life into the world.

820
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,593
Congratulations. I
can't wait to meet it.

821
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,962
- "It"?
- That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

822
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,564
If you're offended, take it
up with the English language.

823
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,101
Oh, good, you're here.
Listen,

824
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,471
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

825
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,773
- Why?
- We just can't

826
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,081
be this far away from the kids.

827
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,109
Bernie's having a meltdown,

828
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,944
and, frankly, so am I.
SHELDON: Yeah, well,

829
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:14,013
pull it together. This
is a big day for me.

830
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:19,018
(scoffs) Yeah,
I wasn't sure what to do.

831
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:21,809
Now I am. We're going home.

832
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,820
- We'll join you.
PENNY: Oh, wait.

833
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:23,824
Do I get a vote in this?

834
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,579
They'll have pickled herring
on the plane.

835
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,712
Bye-bye.

836
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,217
Well, I hate to say it,

837
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:34,420
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

838
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,724
Well, you would be the authority
on the subject.

839
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,060
What does that mean?

840
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,064
Sheldon,
no one is happier than I am

841
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,732
to win the Nobel.

842
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,869
But it's not more important
than our friends.

843
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:53,940
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

844
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,575
They're abandoning us

845
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,877
because you broke
their hearts.

846
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:03,082
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

847
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,985
You never mean to.

848
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:08,254
That's the only reason

849
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,022
people tolerate you!

850
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,726
Does that include you?

851
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,231
Sometimes, yeah.

852
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,137
(Penny retching)

853
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,772
(toilet flushes)

854
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:27,907
(Penny groans)

855
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:30,977
Okay, that's it for the fish.

856
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,089
We'll be back with the meatballs

857
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:34,480
after a short word
from our sponsor.

858
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:37,083
Oh, thank you.

859
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:39,619
(groans)

860
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:42,355
Leonard, I can't go home.

861
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:44,924
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

862
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,826
I was thinking that, too.

863
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,494
As angry as I am at Sheldon,

864
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,830
I still want to see him win
that medal.

865
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,398
It's so strange.

866
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:55,835
No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,

867
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,237
I still love him.

868
00:35:58,306 --> 00:35:59,639
If you think about it,

869
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,108
he has kind of been
our practice kid.

870
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,077
Like when you make pancakes

871
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,247
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

872
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,484
The university prefers "quirky."

873
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:12,652
(chuckles)
(phone rings)

874
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,989
Hello.

875
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,257
Hey. It's Howard.

876
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,993
Oh, us, too.

877
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:23,095
- Wait, what?
- They're gonna stay.

878
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,631
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

879
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,366
Really?

880
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,468
Oh, poor little guy.

881
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:30,703
Is Michael okay?

882
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:31,871
Yeah, it's Stuart.

883
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,620
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

884
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:38,110
Yeah. Okay,
we'll meet you in the lobby.

885
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,228
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

886
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:46,852
Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.

887
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,855
- Really?
- No. What is wrong with you?!

888
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,961
ANNOUNCER:
And in the field of physics,

889
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,330
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler

890
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,565
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

891
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,601
for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.

892
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,704
(whistling)

893
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,973
(whoops)
(cheers)

894
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:14,146
(whooping)

895
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,749
Just to be clear,
this isn't a date.

896
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,184
Yeah, I know.

897
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,653
Then why are you
holding my hand?

898
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,690
Thank you, your majesties.

899
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:27,326
Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.

900
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,996
We are deeply honored.

901
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,165
I would just like
to take this moment

902
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:35,434
to say to all the young girls
out there

903
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,904
who dream about science
as a profession:

904
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,539
go for it.

905
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,242
It is the greatest job

906
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,878
in the world.

907
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:49,482
And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.

908
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,220
And now,

909
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:57,390
speaking of not listening,

910
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,859
my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

911
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,261
Sheldon.

912
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,765
What? Did you finish? Great job.

913
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,403
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

914
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,573
I have a very long

915
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:18,110
and somewhat self-centered
speech here.

916
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,313
But I'd like to set it aside.

917
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,526
PENNY: Yeah!
WOLOWITZ: Way to go!

918
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,350
(whoops)

919
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,390
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

920
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,760
I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't

921
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,230
for some very important people
in my life.

922
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:42,668
Beginning with my mother,
father, meemaw,

923
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,171
brother and sister.

924
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,575
And my other family,

925
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:52,044
who I'm so happy
to have here with us.

926
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,614
Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?

927
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,490
I was under a misapprehension

928
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,227
that my accomplishments
were mine alone.

929
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,264
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

930
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,534
I have been

931
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,204
encouraged, sustained,

932
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,841
inspired and tolerated

933
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:25,111
not only by my wife,

934
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:28,147
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

935
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,619
I'd like to ask them to stand.

936
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,456
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

937
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,096
Dr. Bernadette
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.

938
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,469
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

939
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:58,577
And my two dearest friends
in the world,

940
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,679
Penny Hofstadter...

941
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,354
...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

942
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,694
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

943
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:19,899
He said to me that their babies
would be smart <i>and</i> beautiful.

944
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,903
And now that they're expecting,

945
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:26,172
I have no doubt that
that will be the case.

946
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,241
Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.

947
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,746
Oh. I'm sorry.

948
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,315
Don't tell anyone
that last thing.

949
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:38,250
That's a secret.

950
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,021
Howard, Bernadette,

951
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:46,292
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

952
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,329
I apologize if I haven't
been the friend you deserve.

953
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,265
But I want you to know

954
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:56,869
in my way,

955
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,438
I love you all.

956
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,176
And I love you.

957
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,648
Thank you.

958
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,050
