3
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,774
<i>I don't know.</i>

4
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>Yeah, this is a hard one.</i>

5
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,682
<i>I think...</i>

6
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,219
<i>the white guy</i>
<i>and the Asian girl</i>
<i>are a couple,</i>

7
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,121
<i>and the Asian guy...</i>

8
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,056
<i>is her brother.</i>

9
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,994
<i>Or the Asian girl</i>
<i>and the Asian guy</i>
<i>are a couple,</i>

10
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:37,697
<i>and the white guy</i>
<i>is their American friend.</i>

11
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,901
<i>They are not even talking</i>
<i>to the white guy.</i>

12
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,238
<i>Maybe they</i>
<i>are tourists,</i>

13
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,307
<i>and the white guy</i>
<i>is their tour guide.</i>

14
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,176
<i>Drinking at 4:00 a.m.?</i>

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,212
<i>Yeah, you're right,</i>
<i>that makes no sense.</i>

16
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,016
<i>Hm. Maybe they're</i>

17
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,552
<i>I have no idea.</i>

18
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,778
Hm?

19
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,456
Ah,
I'm thinking two things...

20
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,790
I want you to draw a tree.

21
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,293
- Tree?
- Hm.

22
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,794
That's what
I'm good at.

23
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,099
A tree doesn't have feelers.

24
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,668
It looks all same to me.

25
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,237
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?

26
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,374
This is called "blue."

27
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,478
This is called "yellow".

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,002
My name is Michelle.

31
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,270
How are you,
Michelle?

32
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,838

This is our passport, and...

45
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,218
Whoa!

46
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,641
I mean,
there is so much in it
that I responded to.

47
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,277
But the one phrase that sticks
with me most...

48
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,780
Mm-hmm.
"The long journey...

49

I liked it too.

51
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,552

Have you
done your homework?

81
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,115
I haven't.

82
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:48,715
You have to do it
for graduation.

83
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,152
I got under
academic probation
last semester.

Hm-mm.
Class captain's

85

Let me see
your homework.

86
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:00,660
Maybe next time.

Oh. Huh?

88
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,332
What's your plan
for weekend?

89
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:07,734
Playing games.

90
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:10,624
Are you okay?
We walked around a lot.

91
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,726
My leg is
a bit hurt, but I'm okay.

92
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,932
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.

93
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,802
Rock, paper, scissor.
No, thanks.

98
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:11,871
This morning.

99
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:15,008
You got
the worst room.
Right?

100
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:16,876
I know.

101

<i>There is a word</i>

In-Yun.

103
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,310
<i>It means "providence."</i>

104
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,813
<i>Or... "fate".</i>

105
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:29,716

<i>about relationships</i>
<i>between people.</i>

107
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:37,324
<i>I think it comes from...</i>

00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:41,028

That...

124

00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,566
Uh, but you're studying,
right?

168
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,708
Me, too.

169
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,714
I don't know.

170
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,635
You know
what I want?
What?

171
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:21,241
Chicken wings.

172
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,578
Holy shit.

173
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:26,847
Mm-hm. Yeah.

174
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,248
Oh, genius.

175
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:29,883
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

176
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,486
Chicken wings!

177
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,855
Hm...

178
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:45,298
What're you
thinking about?

179
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:48,301
Remember I told you
about Hae Sung?

180
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:50,537
Oh, yeah.

181
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,339
Is that this week?

182
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:53,874
Yeah.

183
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,777
Why is he
coming here again?

184
00:47:57,677 --> 00:47:58,879
I think
vacation.

185
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,659
Uh, trunk? Trunk?

186
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,722
Hm.

187
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,161
Hmm?

188
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:46,607
Hmm.

189
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:07,514
Hi.
Hi, my love.

190
01:04:11,485 --> 01:04:13,286
How was it?

191
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,492
You were right.

192
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:21,828
I was?

193
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:24,364
Yeah.

194
01:04:26,767 --> 01:04:28,502
He came here to see me.

195
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,951
It's so crazy to see him
be this grown-up man

196
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:21,421
with a normal job
and a normal life.

197
01:05:21,555 --> 01:05:23,390
He's so Korean.

198
01:05:24,724 --> 01:05:26,393
He still lives
with his parents

199
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:28,762
which is really Korean.

200
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:31,132
And he has all these
really Korean views

201
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:33,301
about everything.

202
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:37,671
And I feel so not Korean
when I'm with him.

203
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:39,606
But also,

204
01:05:40,308 --> 01:05:42,509
in some way, more Korean?

205
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:45,980
It's so weird.

206
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,349
I mean, I have Korean friends,

207
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:52,452
but he's not, like,
Korean-American.

208
01:05:52,586 --> 01:05:54,554
He's Korean-Korean.

209
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:58,725
Is he attractive?

210
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,695
I think so.

211
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,032
He's really masculine
in this way

212
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,867
that I think is so Korean.

213
01:06:10,271 --> 01:06:11,939
Are you attracted to him?

214
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:17,945
I don't think so.

215
01:06:18,678 --> 01:06:20,047
I don't know, I mean...

216
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:21,581
I don't think so.

217
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:31,325
He was just this kid
in my head

218
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,660
for such a long time.

219
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:37,430
And then he was
just this image on my laptop.

220
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:41,235
And now he's
a physical person.

221
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:42,602
It's really intense,

222
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:44,338
but I don't think
that that's attraction,

223
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:46,606
I think I just
missed him a lot.

224
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:48,910
I think I miss Seoul.

225
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,146
Did he miss you?

226
01:06:54,015 --> 01:06:56,951
I think he missed
the 12-year-old crybaby

227
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,785
he knew a long time ago.

228
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,421
You were a crybaby?

229
01:07:01,989 --> 01:07:03,391
Yeah.

230
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:06,526
Most of the time, he'd have to
just stand there and watch me.

231
01:07:17,305 --> 01:07:18,805
When is he leaving, again?

232
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,775
The morning after tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.

233
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:49,703
Are you mad?

234
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:51,471
No.

235
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,707
It feels like you are.

236
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,011
I don't have
a right to be mad.

237
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:58,878
What do you mean?
Of course you do.

238
01:07:59,013 --> 01:07:59,981
No, I...

239
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:01,581
That guy flew
13 hours to be here.

240
01:08:01,715 --> 01:08:02,917
I'm not gonna tell you

241
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,718
that you can't see him
or something.

242
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:07,620
He's your childhood
sweetheart.

243
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:10,191
And it's not like you're gonna
run away with him.

244
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:14,929
Are you?

245
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:18,832
Definitely.

246
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:20,101
I'm gonna throw away
my life here and run away...

247
01:08:20,234 --> 01:08:21,701
...with him to Seoul.

248
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:26,140
Do you even know me?

249
01:08:27,308 --> 01:08:30,044
I'm not gonna miss
my rehearsals for some dude.

250
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:33,080
I know.

251
01:08:38,052 --> 01:08:39,253
I know you.

252
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,003
What?

253
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:34,308
I was just thinking about
what a good story this is.

254
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:39,213
The story of Hae Sung and me?
Yeah.

255
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,250
I just can't compete.

256
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,322
What do you mean?

257
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:55,329
Childhood sweethearts
who reconnect 20 years later

258
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:58,165
only to realize they were
meant for each other.

259
01:09:58,299 --> 01:09:59,567
We're not
meant for each other.

260
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:00,935
I know.

261
01:10:01,402 --> 01:10:02,602
I know.

262
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,038
In the story,

263
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:05,506
I would be the evil
white American husband

264
01:10:05,638 --> 01:10:07,874
standing in the way
of destiny.

265
01:10:11,778 --> 01:10:13,347
Shut up.

266
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:16,117
What do you not like about it?
Our story's just so boring.

267
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:20,287
We met at
an artists' residency.

268
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:24,525
Slept together because we both
happened to be single.

269
01:10:24,657 --> 01:10:26,026
We realize
we both live in New York,

270
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,829
so we move in together
to save money on rent.

271
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:32,899
We got married so you could
get a green card. So...

272
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:35,069
Oh, you make it sound
so romantic.

273
01:10:35,202 --> 01:10:36,769
Right, that's
what I'm saying.

274
01:10:39,839 --> 01:10:41,175
I'm the guy
you leave in the story

275
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:44,211
when your ex-lover
comes to take you away.

276
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:46,046
He's not my ex-lover.

277
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:56,090
What if you met somebody else
at that residency?

278
01:10:56,223 --> 01:10:58,926
What if there was
another writer from New York

279
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:01,262
who had also read
all the same books you had,

280
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:04,265
and watched
all the same movies,

281
01:11:04,398 --> 01:11:07,834
could give you
useful notes on your plays,

282
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:12,173
and listen to you complain
about your rehearsals?

283
01:11:12,306 --> 01:11:14,707
That's not how life works.
I know.

284
01:11:16,243 --> 01:11:17,411
Yeah.

285
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:20,747
But wouldn't you be
laying here with him?

286
01:11:22,882 --> 01:11:25,852
This is my life,
and I'm living it with you.

287
01:11:28,389 --> 01:11:29,990
Are you happy with it?

288
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,228
Is this what you
imagined for yourself

289
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:35,496
when you left Seoul?

290
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:36,997
When I was a 12-year-old?

291
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah. Is this what
you pictured for yourself?

292
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,070
Laying in bed in some...

293
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:46,273
tiny apartment
in the East Village

294
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:49,109
with some Jewish guy
who writes books?

295
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:51,245
Is that what your parents
wanted for you?

296
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:55,950
You're asking me if you,
Arthur Zaturansky,

297
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,953
are the answer to
my family's immigrant dream?

298
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,989
Yeah.
Wow.

299
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:11,764
This is where we ended up.

300
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:14,168
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

301
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:22,775
Okay.

302
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:26,779
What?

303
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:34,421
It's just that you make
my life so much bigger.

304
01:12:34,555 --> 01:12:37,958
And I'm wondering if I do
the same thing for you.

305
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:42,829
You do.

306
01:12:55,309 --> 01:12:58,178
I'm just a girl from Korea,
you know?

307
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:02,082
Okay.

308
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:05,319
And you're forgetting the part
where I love you.

309
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,955
I don't forget that.

310
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:10,958
I have trouble
believing it sometimes.

311
01:13:34,881 --> 01:13:37,184
Do you know
you only speak in Korean

312
01:13:37,318 --> 01:13:39,119
when you talk in your sleep?

313
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:41,821
I do?
Yeah.

314
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:47,394
You never
sleep talk in English.

315
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:50,130
You only dream in Korean.

316
01:13:54,034 --> 01:13:55,569
I didn't know that.

317
01:13:55,703 --> 01:13:56,804
Yeah.

318
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:58,205
You never told me that.

319
01:13:58,339 --> 01:14:00,908
Well, sometimes
I think it's cute.

320
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:07,548
Sometimes, I don't know,
I guess I get scared.

321
01:14:09,483 --> 01:14:10,517
Scared of what?

322
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:19,059
You dream in a language
that I can't understand.

323
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:24,398
It's like
there's this whole place

324
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:27,534
inside of you
where I can't go.

325
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,580
I think that's why I've been
trying to learn Korean,

326
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:42,616
even though I know
it's annoying for you.

327
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:46,353
You want to understand me
when I'm dreaming?

328
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:47,921
Yeah.

329
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:55,129
I'm sure I'm just
saying gibberish.

330
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,601
Hm?

331
01:20:18,953 --> 01:20:20,587
Um...

332
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:34,334
Uh, hi.
Nice to meet you, also.

333
01:20:45,913 --> 01:20:46,847
Uh...

334
01:20:48,582 --> 01:20:50,450
Are you hungry?

335
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:52,285
Hm?
Oh...

336
01:20:54,122 --> 01:20:55,789
Ah, oh. Yes.

337
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,427
Uh...

338
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:03,663
Pasta?

339
01:21:03,797 --> 01:21:06,433
Pasta? Yeah.
You like pasta?

340
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:08,335
Yes.

341
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:10,104
Okay.
Okay.

342
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:11,838
Let's get pasta.
Pasta.

343
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,380
What did you two do today?

344
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:21,882
Uh...

345
01:21:24,651 --> 01:21:26,720
The Statue of Liberty.

346
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:28,855
You took the ferry.

347
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,191
Yes.
Yeah.

348
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:31,858
It's, um, nice.

349
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,860
I've never been.

350
01:21:33,995 --> 01:21:34,962
What?
Really?

351
01:21:35,096 --> 01:21:37,397
Yeah, I've never
actually been there.

352
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:45,206
Have we seriously
never been there together?

353
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:46,941
No.

354
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:01,521
<i>When I was 24 year,</i>

355
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:05,325
I, uh... Um...

356
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:07,861
Oh.

357
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,463
Yes.

358
01:22:10,597 --> 01:22:12,632
Oh, military service.

359
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:14,101
Right.

360
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:16,070
You know how Korean men have
mandatory military service?

361
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:18,438
Yeah, your dad
talks about it.
How was it?

362
01:22:18,572 --> 01:22:19,506
You like it?

363
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:24,611
No.

364
01:22:24,744 --> 01:22:29,816
Uh, but military
and work, same.

365
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,418
Same?

366
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,989
Uh, you have, um...

367
01:22:36,224 --> 01:22:37,992
You have a boss.

368
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,293
Hm.

369
01:22:47,767 --> 01:22:50,470
There's no
overtime pay in Korea.

370
01:23:06,753 --> 01:23:09,623
It's, uh, very hard.

371
01:23:09,756 --> 01:23:14,061
Hmm. Uh, work. Work is hard.

372
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:16,863
Hard physically or mentally?

373
01:23:19,766 --> 01:23:21,936
Uh, yes.
Uh, both.

374
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:25,438
Physical, very hard.

375
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:29,076
Uh, and, um...
Hm. Mentally.

376
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:32,579
Mentally, I'm strong.

377
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:34,681
Mm!

378
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:57,972
Mm.

379
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:24,731
Hm.

380
01:24:43,616 --> 01:24:44,818
Hm.

381
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:28,976
He's talking about you.

382
01:29:58,898 --> 01:30:01,268
I'm sorry
we speak alone.

383
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:04,438
Uh, we will stop.

384
01:30:12,513 --> 01:30:14,081
It's okay.

385
01:30:14,214 --> 01:30:16,283
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

386
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:27,961
I never thought I'd be
a part of something like this.

387
01:30:29,463 --> 01:30:30,464
Hm?

388
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:32,533
Sitting here with you.

389
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:40,541
Do you know what <i>in-yun?</i>

390
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:44,445
Yeah. Nora told me about it
when we first met.

391
01:30:48,082 --> 01:30:49,316
You and me.

392
01:30:50,451 --> 01:30:54,121
Yeah. Yeah,
you and I are <i>in-yun</i> too.

393
01:30:54,254 --> 01:30:56,223
Right?

394
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:06,066
I'm really glad
you came here.

395
01:31:08,235 --> 01:31:10,170
It was
the right thing
to do.

396
01:31:33,727 --> 01:31:36,163
Mm. I'm gonna
walk him to his Uber.

397
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:38,198
Okay.

398
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:43,303
Uh, nice to meet you.

399
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:45,739
Nice to meet you, too.

400
01:31:46,407 --> 01:31:48,942
Uh, come visit me in Korea.

401
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,245
Definitely.

402
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:00,487
I'll be right back.

403
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:01,655
Okay.

404
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:32,145
Hm.

405
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,120
Hm?
