2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:23,817
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in 
China than there are people of any kind living in the US?

3
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,718
That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

4
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,036
What would account for that?

5
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:30,036
Well, first, an awful lot of people 
live in China, but here's my question:

6
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:33,909
How do you distinguish yourself in a population
of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,597
I didn't know they take SAT's in China.

8
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,927
They don't. I wasn't talking about China 
anymore, I was talking about me.

9
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:39,248
You got a 1600?

10
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:43,636
Yes. I could sing in an acapella group, but I can't sing.
- Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?

11
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,432
I could row crew, or invent a $25 PC.

12
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:46,683
Or you get into a final club.

13
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:47,934
Or I get into a final club.

14
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:51,876
You know, from a woman's perspective sometimes
not singing in an acapella group is a good thing.

15
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:55,048
This is serious.
- On the other hand I do like guys who row crew.

16
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:56,204
Well, I can't do that.

17
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:57,082
I was kidding.

18
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:58,724
Yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

19
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,451
Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

20
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,527
To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

21
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,593
To row crew? No.
Are you, whatever, delusional?

22
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:08,800
Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once
and I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at.

23
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,452
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

24
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:11,859
No.

25
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,512
OK, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world class athletes.

26
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,065
And a second ago you said you like guys who 
row crew, so I assumed you had met one.

27
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:20,769
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it
in the way a girl likes cowboys.

28
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,281
OK.

29
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:25,359
Shall we get something to eat?
- Would you like to talk about something else?

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,902
No, it's just since the beginning of the conversation about 
finals club, I think I may have missed a birthday.

31
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:34,932
There are really more people in China with 
genius IQ's than the entire population of -

32
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:37,995
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club...
Roosevelt punched the Porc.

33
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,010
Which one?

34
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,216
The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.

35
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,377
Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

36
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:48,633
Is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls
who want to party with the next Fed chairman?

37
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:49,868
So you can see why it's so important to get in.

38
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:52,774
OK, well, which is the easiest to get into?

39
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,359
Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

40
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,546
None of them, that's the point.

41
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,463
My friend Eduardo made $300,000 
betting oil futures one summer...

42
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:06,901
...and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability 
to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

43
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:08,084
Must be nice.

44
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:09,529
He made $300,000 in a summer?

45
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,228
He likes meteorology.

46
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,330
You said it was oil futures.

47
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,342
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

48
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:19,830
I think you asked me that because you think the final club
that's the easiest to get into, is the one where I'll have the best chance.

49
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:20,687
I... what?

50
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:25,232
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into
because you think that that's the one where I have the best chance.

51
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,962
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one
where anybody has the best chance.

52
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,756
You didn't ask which one was the best one,
you asked me which one was the easiest.

53
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,403
I was honestly just asking, OK?
I was just asking to ask.

54
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,567
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

55
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:39,027
Erica -

56
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:45,962
You're obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD.
You need to see someone about it who'll prescribe you medication.

57
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:48,512
You don't care if the side-effects may include blindness.

58
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,801
Final clubs.

59
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,046
Not finals clubs.

60
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:54,924
And there's a difference between being 
obsessed and being motivated.

61
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,254
Yes...

62
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,570
...there is.

63
00:02:57,597 --> 00:03:00,076
Well, you do. That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

64
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,866
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

65
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:04,352
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

66
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,016
Why?

67
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:06,630
Because they're exclusive.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,938
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

69
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:12,416
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected for president
because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.

70
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,266
He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did.

71
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:18,770
Well, why don't you concentrate on being 
the best you, you can be.

72
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,146
Did you really just say that?

73
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,058
I was kidding.

74
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,442
Although just being straight
doesn't make it any less true.

75
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:27,308
I want to be straightforward and tell you
that I think you might want to be a little bit more supportive.

76
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:32,898
If I get in, I'll be taking you to the events and the gatherings,
and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet.

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,961
You would do that for me?

78
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:38,368
We're dating.

79
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,973
OK.

80
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:44,973
Well, I'm gonna try and be straightforward with you
and let you know that we're not anymore.

81
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,052
What do you mean?

82
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,608
We're not dating anymore, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,098
Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

84
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,237
You're breaking up with me?

85
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:54,462
You were going to introduce me to people
I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

86
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,762
What the f...
What is it supposed to mean?

87
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:58,082
Wait, settle down.

88
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:01,426
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink
is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy.

89
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:07,682
"The door guy"...his name is Bobby. I have not slept with 
"the door guy", "the door guy" is a friend of mine.

90
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:13,330
And he is a perfectly good class of people.
And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon?

91
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:14,830
Wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm room.

92
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:15,850
Wait, wait, is this real?
- Yes.

93
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,309
OK, then wait. I apologize, OK?
- I have to go study.

94
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:19,914
Erica.
- Yes?

95
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

96
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:24,438
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

97
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,673
I can't.
- Why?

98
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,599
Because it's exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a stair master.

99
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,577
All I meant is that you're not likely to... currently.

100
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:35,377
I wasn't making a comment on your parents,
I was saying you go to BU. I was stating a fact, that's all...

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,863
...and if it seems rude, then of course I apologize.
- I have to go study.

102
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,804
You don't have to study.
- Why you keep saying I don't have to study?

103
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,234
Because you go to BU!

104
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,726
Want to get some food?

105
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:48,213
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.

106
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,559
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.
So we're even.

107
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,306
I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

108
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,523
I was just being polite,
I have no intention of being friends with you.

109
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,665
I'm under some pressure 
right now from my OS class...

110
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,249
...and if we could just order 
some food, I think we should -

111
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,575
OK, you're probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

112
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:09,875
But you're going to go through life thinking 
that girls don't like you because you're a nerd.

113
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,576
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart, that that won't be true.

114
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,176
It will be, because you're an asshole.

115
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:18,776


116
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:24,746
Erica Albright's a bitch. Do you think that's 
because her family changed their name from Albrecht?

117
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:27,246
Or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?

118
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:37,179
For the record, she may look like a 34C.
but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret.

119
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,970
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.

120
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:45,501
The truth is, she has a nice face.

121
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:47,501
I need to do something to 
take my mind off her.

122
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,012
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

123
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

124
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,485
So what if it's not even 10 P.M. and it's a Tuesday night?

125
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:06,927
The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop
and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,753
Billy Olson's sitting here had the idea of putting some of the pictures
next to pictures of farm animals, and have people vote on who's hotter.

127
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,492
Good call, Mr. Olson.

128
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,492


129
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,548
Yea, it's on.

130
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:26,648
I'm not gonna do the farm animals but 
I like the idea of comparing two people together.

131
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:33,348
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's ratings
of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number...

132
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:37,048
...to represent each person's hotness 
like they do on hotornot.com.

133
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,549
The first thing we're going to need 
is a lot of pictures.

134
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,187
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook, 
so I'm going to have to get all the images...

135
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,687
...from the individual houses that people are in.

136
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:44,687


137
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,400
Let the hacking begin.

138
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,400


139
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:07,900
First up is Kirkland. They keep everything open
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration...

140
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,713
...so a little WGET magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

141
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:12,311
Kid's stuff.

142
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:33,385
Next is Elliot. They're also open but
with no indexes on Apache.

143
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,985
I can run an empty search, and it returns
all of the images in the database in a single page.

144
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,269
Then I can save the page
and Mozilla will save all the images for me.

145
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,691
Excellent.

146
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,604
Moving right along.

147
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:42,204


148
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,004
Excuse me - everybody!

149
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:47,404
You're at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs...

150
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:50,904
...not just at Harvard,
but in the world.

151
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:55,004
Now I want to welcome you all at
Phoenix' first party of the fall semester.

152
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,004


153
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Lowell has some security.
They require a username/password combo...

154
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:11,554
...and I'm going going ahead and say they don't have access
to main FAS user database, so they have no way of detecting an intrusion.

155
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,084
Adams has no security, but limits 
the number of results to twenty a page.

156
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,855
All I need to do is breakout the same script
I used on Lowell, and we're set.

157
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:21,222
Quincy has no online facebook, what a sham.

158
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:24,111
Nothing I can do about that.

159
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:28,835
Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public 
directory, but there's no directory at all.

160
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:30,971
You have to do searches, and if your 
search returns more then twenty matches...

161
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:31,971
...nothing gets returned.

162
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,769
Once you do get results, they don't link directly to the 
images, they link to a php that redirects or something.

163
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,169
Weird. This may be difficult,
I'll come back later.

164
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,070
Hey, shark's week is on.
- What?

165
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,272
Great white, beautiful fish.

166
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,244
Leverett is a little better. They still use end search,
but you can do an empty search and get links to pages...

167
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,244
...with a every student's picture.

168
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:50,614
It's slightly obnoxious that they
let you view one picture at a time...

169
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:53,465
...and there's no way I'm going through five hundred pages,
to download pics one at a time.

170
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:56,178
So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs
and modify that perl script.

171
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:57,178


172
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:15,707
Done.

173
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, what's goin' on?

174
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:20,959
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here,
and he's going to have the key ingredient.

175
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:22,737
Hey Mark.
- Eduardo.

176
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,399
You and Erica split up.

177
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,315
How did you know that?

178
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,676
It's on your blog.

179
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,110
Yeah.

180
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,426
Are you alright?
- I need you.

181
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:32,646
I'm here for you.

182
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,648
No, I need the algorithm you 
used to rank chess players.

183
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,012
Are you okay?

184
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:37,397
We're ranking girls.

185
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,950
You mean other students.

186
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,743
Yeah.

187
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:43,410
You think this is such a good idea?

188
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,529
I need the algorithm.

189
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,529


190
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:52,348
<i>Give each girl a base rating of 1400.
At any given time Girl A has a rating Ra...</i>

191
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:55,007
<i>...and Girl B has a rating Rb.</i>

192
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:59,826
When any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation 
of which will win based on their current rating, right?

193
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,274
Yeah.
- And those expectations are expressed this way.

194
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:04,218
Let's write it.

195
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,218


196
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:20,017
The one on the left.

197
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,190
On the right.

198
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,147
The right.

199
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,153
Who should we send it to first?

200
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:26,773
Dwyer.

201
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:27,442
Neal.

202
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,588
Who are you gonna send it to?

203
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:33,558
Just a couple of people.
Question is, who are they gonna send it to?

204
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:34,558


205
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,370
Hey guys, check this out.

206
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,794
The one on the left.

207
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:09,744
These girls...

208
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:11,653
Right or left?

209
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:12,383
Left.

210
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:16,261
Right or left.

211
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:17,789
That's my roommate.

212
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,155
All on the left.

213
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,614
This is pathetic.

214
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:24,640
Right.

215
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:25,977
Left.

216
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:27,887
Left.

217
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,644
Albright, he blogged about you.

218
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,222
You don't want to read it.

219
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,891
Erica, is this yours?

220
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,469
I stole it from a trainee.

221
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,837
Get the hell out of here.

222
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,253
That's an awful lot of traffic.

223
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:09,479
You think maybe we shouldn't shut 
it down before we get into trouble?

224
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:09,479


225
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,496
Hello?

226
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:23,555
Wait, wait, wait. 
What?

227
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,004
At four in the morning?

228
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,522
Well, there is a very unusual amount 
of traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

229
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,954
You're saying it's unusual for four in the morning?

230
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:33,747
No, this would be unusual for halftime at the Super Bowl.

231
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:35,800
Alright.

232
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,456
I gotta go in.

233
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,628
What's going on?

234
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:44,944
Harvard's network is about to crash.

235
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:45,944


236
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,806
You don't think...

237
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:55,623
I do.

238
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,416
God save us every bodies.

239
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,578
Can't connect.

240
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:08,180
The network's down.

241
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,692
Unless it's a coincidence,
I'd think this is us.

242
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,767
It's not a coincidence.

243
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,011
Holy shit.

244
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,011


245
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,883
So you were called in front of the ad board.

246
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:21,934
That's not what happened.

247
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:24,250
You weren't called in front of 
the administrative board?

248
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,138
No, back at the bar with Erica Albright.

249
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:28,139
She said all that?

250
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,858
Mark.
- That I said that stuff to her?

251
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,006
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.

252
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,486
Why would you even need to depose her?

253
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:34,919
That's really for us to decide.

254
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,879
You think if I know she could make me look like a 
jerk I'll be more likely to settle.

255
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:38,524
Mark.

256
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,006
Why don't we stretch our legs for 
a minute, can we do that?

257
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:47,622
It's been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time
embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.

258
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:49,485
I am not embarrassed, she just made a lot of that up.

259
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:50,463
She was under oath.

260
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,422
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

261
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,931
The site got twenty-two hundred hits within two hours?

262
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,012
Thousand.

263
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,112
What?

264
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,043
Twenty-two thousand.

265
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,043


266
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,962
These guys are just freaking' fast.

267
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,475
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

268
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,651
Jump out and swim.

269
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,285
We'd have to jump out and drown.

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
You could row forward
and I could row backward.

271
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:54,273
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

272
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:55,619
Just row the damn boat.

273
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,619


274
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,267
You guys hear about this?
- What?

275
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:09,510
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network from a laptop of Kirkland.

276
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:10,822
At four A.M.

277
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,225
He set up a website where we vote
for the hotness of female undergrads.

278
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,861
What were we doing, that none of us heard about this.

279
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,999
I do not know, three hour low rate technical row before breakfast?

280
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,620
Full course load studying.

281
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,132
Another three hours in the tank, then studying.

282
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:25,820
I'm not sure how we missed it.

283
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:28,123
How much activity was on this thing.

284
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,752
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

285
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:31,508
Twenty-two thousand?

286
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,910
This stuff is half of facebook, seven houses.

287
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,066
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

288
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,020
Twenty-two thousand.

289
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,069
How you know he was drunk?

290
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,596
He was blogging, simultaneously.

291
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,880
You know what I think?

292
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,127
Way ahead of you.

293
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,769
This is our guy.

294
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:54,007
Cameron WINKLEVOSS.
Cameron spelled the usual way.

295
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:59,214
Tyler WINKLEVOSS. Tyler spelled the usual way,
and my last name is the same as my brother's.

296
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:03,004
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative board hearing.

297
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,536
You're being accused of intentionally breaching security,
violating copyrights, violating individual privacy...

298
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:13,402
...by creating the website <i>www.facemash.com.</i>

299
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:18,365
You're also charged with being in violation of university 
policy on distribution of digitized images.

300
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:22,549
Before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed 
to make a statement. Would you like to do so?

301
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,727
You know, I've already apologized in <i>
The Crimson</i>, to the AVHW...

302
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:35,816
...to varsity Latina, and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted, as I take it that they were.

303
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:39,735
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security...

304
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,278
...I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

305
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:45,816
I'm sorry?

306
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,116
Yes.

307
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,955
I don't understand.

308
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:49,527
Which part?

309
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:51,945
You deserve recognition.

310
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,241
I believe I pointed out some pretty 
gaping holes in your system.

311
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,908
Excuse me, may I?

312
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,400
Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm in charge of security 
for all computers on the Harvard network...

313
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,849
...and I can assure you of its sophistication.

314
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,781
In fact, it was that level of sophistication,
that led us to you in less then four hours.

315
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,396
Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

316
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:16,686
That would be impressive, except if you'd known what you are looking 
for you would've seen it written on my dorm room window.

317
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:16,986


318
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,988
So?
- Six months Academic probation.

319
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,648
Wow, they had to make an example out of you.

320
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:28,411
They had my blog.

321
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,569
I shouldn't have written nothing about the 
farm animals, that was stupid.

322
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:35,139
But I was kidding for God's sakes,
doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

323
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,094
I tried to stop you.
- I know.

324
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,366
How do you do this thing were you 
manage to get all girls to hate us?

325
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,962
Why did I meet you?
You can't do that.

326
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,762
Eduardo, I said I know.

327
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:43,562


328
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,665
OK, let's look at a sample problem.

329
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,957
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit 
virtual address, and a page size of 256 bytes.

330
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:59,303
The system uses one-level page 
tables that start at address 0x0400.

331
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,790
Maybe you want DMA on 
your 16-bit system, who knows.

332
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,575
The first few pages are reserved 
for hardware flags, et cetera.

333
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:09,514
Assume page table entries 
have eight status bits.

334
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:11,983
The eight status bits would
then be... Anybody?

335
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,551
Ah, I see we have our first surrender.

336
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:21,272
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men 
than you have tried and failed this class.

337
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:25,624
One valid bit, one modified bit, 
one reference bit, five permission bits.

338
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,669
That is correct.

339
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:32,476
Does everybody see 
how he got there?

340
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:38,715
Mark?

341
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,387
You Mark Zuckerberg?

342
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:41,871
Yea.

343
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,741
Cameron Winklevoss.

344
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:44,670
Hi.

345
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:45,981
Tyler Winklevoss.

346
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:47,340
Are you guys related?

347
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,356
That's good, funny, never heard that before.

348
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,868
So what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

349
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,764
No... actually... hang on.
- We never asked.

350
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,402
Maybe we should have.
- No.

351
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:59,979
We have an idea we want to talk to you about.

352
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:02,244
Got a minute?

353
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,331
You guys look like you guys 
spend some time at the gym.

354
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:06,291
We have to.

355
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:06,876
Why?

356
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,135
We row crew.

357
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,176
Yeah, I've got a minute.

358
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,209
Great.

359
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:12,909


360
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,226
So you ever been inside the Porcellian?

361
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:18,648
No.

362
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:21,231
We're sorry. We can not take you past the 
bike room 'cause you're not a member.

363
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:26,828
Want a sandwich, or something?

364
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:28,520
Uh, OK.

365
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,449
Mark, right?

366
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:30,049
Yea.

367
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,525
Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

368
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:36,836
We were really impressed with Facemash.
We checked you out, you also built Course Match.

369
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:38,540
Don't know no Course Match.

370
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,505
You can go online and see what 
courses your friends are taking.

371
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:41,816
Really smart man.

372
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:45,519
Mark?

373
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:46,105
Yeah?

374
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,466
We were talking about Course Match.

375
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:50,838
It was kind of a no-brainer.

376
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,091
You invented something
in high school too, right?

377
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:56,731
An app for an MP3 player, that 
recognizes your taste in music.

378
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,258
Any body try to buy it?

379
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,566
Microsoft.

380
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:03,980
How much?
- Didn't sell it, uploaded it for free.

381
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,918
For free?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:06,798
Why?

383
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:14,507
OK, we have something we have been working on for a while,
and we think it's great. It's called the Harvard Connection.

384
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,307
You can create your own page,
interests, bio, friends, pics.

385
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,012
Then people can go online 
and see your bio...

386
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,235
Request you -

387
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,742
Yeah, how is that different 
from <i>MySpace</i> and <i>Friendster</i>?

388
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,971
HARVARD.EDU

389
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:30,529
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious 
e-mail address in the country.

390
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,577
And the whole site is based 
on the idea that girls -

391
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,177
Not to put anything indelicately.
- Girls want to go with guys who go to Harvard.

392
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:39,753
See, my brother doesn't have
trouble putting things indelicately.

393
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:43,694
Main difference between what we're talking about and<i>
MySpace</i> or <i>Friendster</i>, or any of those other social networking sites -

394
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:44,972
- Is exclusivity.

395
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:46,516
Right?

396
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:47,728
Right.

397
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:49,884
Yeah, we'd love you to work with us, Mark.

398
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,698
We need a gifted programmer who is creative.

399
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,441
And we know you've been 
taken to the shitters.

400
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,541
Women's groups are still 
ready to declare a fatwa.

401
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,571
This could help rehabilitate your image.

402
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:02,310
Wow - you would do that for me.

403
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,106
We'd like to work with you.

404
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:09,082
Our first programmer graduated and went to work for Google.

405
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,748
Our second programmer just got 
overwhelmed with school work.

406
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,049
We would need you to build the site,
write the code and we'll provide all -

407
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,005
I'm in.

408
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:18,130
What?

409
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:20,458
I'm in.

410
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:21,823
Awesome.

411
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:22,823


412
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,727
That's what you said?

413
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,046
It was three or four years ago,
I don't know what I said.

414
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,553
When did you come to Eduardo?

415
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:30,341
I don't understand that question.

416
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:32,511
Do you remember answering 
in the affirmative?

417
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,006
The affirmative?

418
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:36,703
When I did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook?

419
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:38,587
It was called TheFacebook then.

420
00:24:38,707 --> 00:24:40,796
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

421
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,257
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits.

422
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:50,130
Did you answer affirmatively when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra ask you to build Harvard Connection?

423
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,004
Did you say yes?

424
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,270
I said I'd help.

425
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,820
When did you approach Mr. Saverin 
with the idea for TheFacebook?

426
00:24:57,074 --> 00:24:58,385
I wouldn't say I approached him.

427
00:24:58,505 --> 00:24:59,072
Sy?

428
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,638
You can answer the question.

429
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,078
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

430
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:06,121
What's that?
- The Jewish fraternity.

431
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,972
It was Caribbean night.

432
00:25:09,872 --> 00:25:10,772


433
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:33,204
Is there something here that guys are generally attracted to Asian girls?
Because Asian girls generally are attracted to guys like me.

434
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:36,454
I'm developing an algorithm to define the 
connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

435
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:42,118
I don't think it's that complicated - they're hot, they're smart.
They are not Jewish and they can dance.

436
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:43,509
Hey, Mark's here!

437
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:44,552
Mark!

438
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,036
I think I've come up with something.

439
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,805
Hang on, I've got to tell you 
something you're not going to believe.

440
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:03,821
- What.
I got punched by the Phoenix.

441
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:09,444
Are you kidding?
- No, it's the first of a four-step process.

442
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,050
But they slipped the invitation 
under my door tonight.

443
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,693
My first punch party tomorrow.

444
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,829
You got punched by the Phoenix.

445
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:23,329
Yea, it's probably just a diversity thing,
just ride that horse 'til...

446
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,705
What did you want to 
talk to me about?

447
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:27,743
Mark, you said you've
come up with something.

448
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,250
Yeah, I've think I've come up 
with something. Come outside.

449
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,655
It's twenty degrees outside.

450
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:36,300
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls, which 
has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,300


452
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,974
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right?

453
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,414
It wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls.

454
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:54,323
You can go anywhere on the 
internet and see pictures of hot girls.

455
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:57,708
Because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

456
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:03,525
People want to go on the Internet and check out their friends, so 
why not build a website that offers that: friends, pictures, profiles...

457
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:07,455
...whatever you can visit just browse around,
maybe someone you just met at a party.

458
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:09,694
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

459
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:13,596
I'm talking about taking the 
entire social experience of college...

460
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,212
...and putting it online.

461
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:17,886
I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

462
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,679
I'm totally psyched about 
this too, but Eduardo...

463
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:22,280
<i>It would be exclusive.</i>

464
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,348
You would have to know the people on 
the site to get past your own page, like...

465
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,997
...getting punched.
- That's good.

466
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:31,935
Eduardo, it's like a Final Club, 
except we're the president.

467
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:34,131
I told him I thought it sounded great.

468
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:36,879
It was a great idea.

469
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:41,395
There was nothing to hack. People were gonna 
provide their own pictures, their own information.

470
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:46,396
And people had the ability to 
invite or not invite their friends to join.

471
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:50,180
In a world were social 
structure was everything...

472
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:52,672
...that was THE thing.

473
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,710
It was a big project, and he was going to have
to write tens of thousands of lines of code.

474
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,434
So I wondered why he was coming
to me and not his room mates.

475
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,007
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, 
they were programmers.

476
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:06,719
We're gonna need a little startup cash 
to rent the servers and get it online.

477
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,553
So that was why.

478
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:09,906
Did he offer terms?

479
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,447
Well split it 70/30.

480
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:16,722
Seventy for me, thirty for you for putting up the thousand dollars,
and for handling everything on the business end.

481
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:17,519
You're CFO.

482
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:18,796
And you said?

483
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,033
I said,<i> let's do it.</i>

484
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:23,903
OK, did he add anything else?
- Yes.

485
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:29,431
It probably was a diversity thing.

486
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,475
But so what?

487
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:34,181
Why you think he said that?

488
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,507
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, 
but whose discovery is this?

489
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:39,150
Sy, if you let me continue
with my line of questioning.

490
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:44,830
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix,
and began a plan to screw him out of a company I hadn't even invented yet.

491
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:45,992
Were you?
- Gretchen!

492
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,903
Jealous of Eduardo!
- Stop typing, we're off the record.

493
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:50,736
Ma'am, I know you've done you're homework
and so you know money is not a big part of my life...

494
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:55,183
...but at the moment I could buy Mount Auburn street,
take the Phoenix club and turn it into my ping-pong room.

495
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,966
I'll let you know how the party is.

496
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:02,966


497
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:13,426
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit
 involving Facebook, and a witness in another.

498
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:13,938
Yes, sir.

499
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,936
At any time in the weeks prior 
to Mark's telling you his idea...

500
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:21,913
...did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,
Divya Narendra, or Harvard Connection?

501
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:25,283
Yes. He said they asked him 
to work on their site.

502
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:28,261
But that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

503
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:32,424
He said even his most pathetic friends 
knew more about getting people interested...

504
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,003
...in the website than these guys.

505
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:35,973
These guys, meaning my clients.

506
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:36,617
Yes.

507
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:38,969
Yes, he resented, Mark resented that...

508
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,885
...they, your clients that he thought that he 
needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.

509
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:45,652
Mark didn't want to rehabilitate 
anything. With Facemash...

510
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:49,153
...he hacked into the Harvard computers, 
he thumbed his nose at the ad board.

511
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:52,728
He got a lot of notoriety. Facemash 
did exactly what he wanted it to do.

512
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:57,612
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building <i>
TheFacebook</i>, he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?

513
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,343
Not at the time I wasn't.

514
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:04,426
It really did not have much to do 
with the Winklevoss's dating site.

515
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:05,915
How would you know, 
you weren't even there.

516
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,183
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg 
was building <i>TheFacebook...</i>

517
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:13,587
<i>...</i>he was leading the plaintiffs to believe 
he was building Harvard Connection?

518
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:15,497
You're offering a conclusion 
not found in evidence.

519
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:17,399
We are about to find it in evidence.

520
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:26,299
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss, November 30, 2003.<i>
I read over all the stuff you sent me RE: HARVARD CONNECTION...</i>

521
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,391
<i>...and it seems like it shouldn't take to long to implement.</i>

522
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:33,034
<i>So we can talk about it after I get all 
the basic functionality up tomorrow night.</i>

523
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:37,986
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss, December 1, 2003.

524
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:39,731
<i>Sorry I was unreachable tonight.</i>

525
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:43,956
<i>I just got about three of your missed calls,
I was working on a problem for my Systems class.</i>

526
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:48,971
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and 
Cameron Winklevoss, December 10, 2003.

527
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:52,194
<i>This week has been pretty busy,
between Harvard, classes and work.</i>

528
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:54,599
<i>So I think it's probably best 
to postpone the meeting.</i>

529
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,004
<i>I'm also really busy tomorrow.</i>

530
00:30:57,124 --> 00:31:00,249
OK, anybody else feel like 
there is something up with this guy?

531
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:02,079
Tell him OK.

532
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,120
But we do have to make sure we
meet up before we go off for a break.

533
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,921
I know, I know.

534
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:07,621
Yeah, watch out.

535
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,251
Hey, Mark.

536
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:43,585
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MYSQL backend

537
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:45,087
It's gonna cost a little more.

538
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:45,761
How much more?

539
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:46,868
About two hundred more.

540
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:48,268
Do we need it?

541
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,559
Gotta handle the traffic.

542
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:53,905
Do it.

543
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:54,733
I already did.

544
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:00,663
Hey, guess what.

545
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,601
I made the second cut.

546
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,586
That's good.

547
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:08,653
You should be proud of that right there,
don't worry if you don't make it any further.

548
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:15,535
I'll get out of here.

549
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,424
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss...

550
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:19,696
… and Divya Nevendra.

551
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,745
Dec 15, 2003.

552
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:28,191
<i>I have a CS problem set that I am just getting started with 
and it should be about 15 hours of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night.</i>

553
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:31,232
<i>I won't really be free to meet 
until next Wednesday afternoon.</i>

554
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:33,806
<i>I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.</i>

555
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,982
<i>I've basically been in the lab this whole time.</i>

556
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:41,060
<i>And I also won't be able to do Saturday, 
as I have to meet up with my parents.</i>

557
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,363
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard.

558
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:50,264
Founder of Harvard University in 1638.

559
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,262
It's also called the statue of three lies.

560
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,338
What are the three lies?

561
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,145
Mr. Dowd.

562
00:32:57,265 --> 00:32:59,435
The three lies.

563
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,013
Shit.

564
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:01,853
Take your pants off.

565
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,566
I know.

566
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:04,996
Ah, Mr Saverin.

567
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,641
1 - Harvard was founded in 1636.

568
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,723
Not 1638.

569
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,383
2 - Harvard was not founded by John Harvard.

570
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:12,897
3 - That is not John Harvard.

571
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:13,737
Who is it?

572
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:18,743
Friend of the sculptor Daniel Chester.

573
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:20,605
Keep your jacket on.

574
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:21,605


575
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:28,055
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients...

576
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,854
...and he still hadn't completed work 
on Harvard Connection.

577
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:34,354
But on January 11, 2004...

578
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:41,017
...Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name 
theFacebook, by Network Solutions.

579
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,903
To the best of your knowledge, had he 
even begun work on Harvard Connection?

580
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:48,702
Not to my knowledge.

581
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:49,237
No.

582
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:02,341
<i>Hey Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have
enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention...</i>

583
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:05,724
<i>...and gain the critical mass necessary
to get a site like this to run.</i>

584
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,651
<i>We'll speak soon?</i>

585
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,482
This is the first time he mentioned any problem.

586
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,182
Yes, it was.

587
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:16,218
You sent thirty-six e-mails...

588
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,198
...to Mr. Zuckerberg...

589
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:19,156
...and received sixteen e-mails in return...

590
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:21,942
...and this is the first time 
he indicated he was not happy.

591
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:22,757
That's correct.

592
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,633
He had forty-two days to study our
 system and get out ahead.

593
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:27,765
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you -

594
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,817
Did I use any of your code?

595
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,565
You stole our whole goddamn idea!

596
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:32,198
Fellas.

597
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,275
-  Match.com for Harvard guys? 
- Can I continue with my deposition?

598
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:37,921
You know you really don't need a 
forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

599
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,136
If you guys were the 
inventors of Facebook...

600
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,635
...you would have invented Facebook.

601
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:46,669
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder 
and watch you write us a check.

602
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:47,878
No shit.

603
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,924
Let's continue.

604
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:55,518
February 4, 2004.

605
00:34:58,732 --> 00:34:59,292
Mark?

606
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:01,086
Mark?

607
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:04,153
There is a girl in your art history class.

608
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:07,271
Her name is Stephanie Attis, 
do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend?

609
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,263
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

610
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:16,617
And if not, do you happen to know if 
she's looking to go out with me one night?

611
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:17,217
Dustin...

612
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,767
People don't walk around 
with a sign on them that says, I'm...

613
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:28,098
Mark.

614
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,382
We were supposed to meet at nine.

615
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:58,519
Slept yet?

616
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,436
Have to add something.

617
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:00,861
What?

618
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,919
Shit, that looks good, really good.

619
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,790
Clean and simple, no Disneyland.

620
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,590
No live nude girls.
Watch.

621
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:21,364
What are you writing?

622
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:23,871
<i>Relationship status</i>

623
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,123
<i>Interested in</i>

624
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:26,892
This is what drives life at college:

625
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,055
Are you having sex, or aren't you...

626
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:30,989
...is why people take certain 
classes and sit where they sit...

627
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,651
...and do what they do, and
add some center, you know...

628
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,763
...that's what <i>TheFacebook </i>will be
about. People are going to log on...

629
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:39,062
...because after all the cake and watermelon 
there is a chance they're actually gonna -

630
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,440
- Gonna get laid?

631
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:41,402
- Meet a girl.
Yes.

632
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:43,992
- That is really good.
- And that was it.

633
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:44,922
- What do you mean?

634
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:47,035
- It's ready.
- It's ready, right now?

635
00:36:47,036 --> 00:36:47,948
Yeah. Have a seat.

636
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,049
And here is the masthead.
- You made a masthead?

637
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:51,583
Yeah.

638
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,447
<i>Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO</i>

639
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,065
Yeah.

640
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,242
You have no idea what that's 
going to mean to my father.

641
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,018
Sure, I do.

642
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,345
So when is it going live?

643
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,675
Right now.

644
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,260
Get your laptop out.

645
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,334
What, why do we need my laptop?

646
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:11,339
Because you got e-mails of 
everybody at the Phoenix.

647
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:19,185
I'm not sure if it's going to be
cool with them that I'm...

648
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:20,185
...gonna spam their -

649
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:21,539
This is not spam.

650
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:22,582
No, I know it's not spam.

651
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:25,389
If we send it to our friends, it's just 
gonna bounce around our dorm.

652
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,293
I haven't got in yet.

653
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,011
These guys know people...

654
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:29,156
...and I need their e-mails.

655
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:32,152
Sure, good.

656
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,359
Give me the mailing list.

657
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,599
<i>jabberwock12@listserver.harvard.edu</i>

658
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:38,662
These guys.

659
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:42,462
They're literary geniuses 'cause of the 
world's most obvious Lewis Carroll references.

660
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:44,485
They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

661
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:45,667
Yeah, you're right.

662
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,860
The site's live.

663
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:57,339
You know, let's go get 
a drink and celebrate.

664
00:37:58,686 --> 00:37:59,641
I'm buying.

665
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:02,471
Mark?

666
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,660
Mark, are you praying?

667
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,660


668
00:38:20,504 --> 00:38:22,960
Whatever happened to Cole Porter 
and Irving Berlin?

669
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
It's a Valentine's Day theme, 
they're playing love songs.

670
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,569
Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.

671
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:34,752
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

672
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:37,513
Just having different people 
spam me the same link.

673
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:38,226
Casey...

674
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,229
What is it?
- I don't know...

675
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,704
I'm really hoping it's cats that look like Hitler,
'cause I can never get enough of that.

676
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,604
No, it's not.

677
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:51,869
Div?

678
00:38:53,854 --> 00:38:54,490
What?

679
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,734
Hey, w-what is wrong?

680
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:08,834
It's fine.

681
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,734


682
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:26,574
Hey!

683
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:27,401
- Not now.

684
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,297
We need twenty minutes.

685
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:35,141
OK, I just want to let you know 
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

686
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:40,119
Mark Zuckerberg. 
He stole our website.

687
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:43,524
It's been live for more
than thirty-six hours.

688
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:44,524


689
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:48,907
Mr. Hotchkiss.

690
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:50,536
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with dad.

691
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,719
I'm here with my brother Tyler 
and my business partner Divya.

692
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,115
<i>"Welcome to TheFacebook. 
TheFacebook is an online directory...</i>

693
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:58,724
<i>"...that connects people through 
different social networks..."</i>

694
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,954
<i>"You must have a Harvard.edu 
address to register..</i>

695
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:01,643
That's right, yes sir.

696
00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:03,896
I called earlier. I'm looking 
for Mark Zuckerberg

697
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:06,275
Yes, sir he's actually quoted 
a couple of times...

698
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:06,619
...I can read it to you.

699
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,999
<i>"Everyone is talking a lot about
Universal Facebook within Harvard..."</i>

700
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:10,538
He says, he meaning Mark.

701
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,000
<i>"I think it's kind of silly that it would take 
the university a couple of years to get around to it."</i>

702
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,883
<i>"I can do a classier job than they can.'</i>

703
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:16,659
<i>"And I did it..."</i>

704
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:26,120
<i>As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said over 
650 students had registered to use Thefacebook.com...</i>

705
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,238
<i>He said he anticipated that nine hundred 
students would join the site by this morning."</i>

706
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,905
Yes, Divya was just reading that 
650 students signed up for it on the first day.

707
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:37,230
God, if I was a drug dealer, I couldn't 
give free drugs to 650 people in a day.

708
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,498
This guy doesn't have three 
friends to rub together...

709
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:40,440
...to make a fourth.

710
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:42,629
Alright yes, that's what 
we'll do Mr. Hotchkiss...

711
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:44,067
...we'll put it all together and well e-mail it to you.

712
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:46,521
You won't be able to go 
on the website yourself.

713
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,753
Because you don't have a Harvard...

714
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,096
You know, it would just be 
easier for us to e-mail it to you.

715
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:56,187
I'm sure you're right. He is a good guy, and
he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to...

716
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:56,810
Wow.

717
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,532
What he did.

718
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,930
Thank you very much and dad...

719
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:02,846
I love you too.

720
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:03,839
This is a good guy?

721
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,162
We don't know that 
he's not a good guy.

722
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,409
We know he stole our idea.

723
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:07,465
We know lied to our faces...

724
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,225
...for a month and a half.

725
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:09,357
No, he never lied to our faces.

726
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:11,826
OK, he never saw our faces, fine. 
He lied to our e-mail accounts...

727
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:13,989
...and he gave himself a 
forty-two day head start.

728
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,013
Because he knows what apparently you don't...

729
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,807
...which is that getting 
there first, is everything.

730
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,666
I'm a competitive racer, Dave. I don't think you need 
to school me on the importance of getting there first.

731
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,225
Thank you.
- Alright.

732
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:25,282
That was your father's lawyer?
- His in-house counsel.

733
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,976
He is going to look at all this, and if he thinks it's 
appropriate, he's going to send a cease and desist letter.

734
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:30,724
What's that gonna do?
- What, you want to hire an IP lawyer and sue him?

735
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,879
No, I want to hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

736
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,017
We're not going to have to do that.
- That's right.

737
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,819
We can do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5'', 220, and there's two of me.

738
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,909
Whatever, I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

739
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:44,423
How much more information
are you waiting for?

740
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:47,074
We met with Mark three times, 
we've exchanged fifty-two e-mails...

741
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,423
...we can prove that 
he looked at the code.

742
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,332
What is that on the 
bottom of the page?

743
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:51,518
<i>A Mark Zuckerberg production</i>

744
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,702
On the home page?
- On every page.

745
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:57,802
Shit, I need a second to let
that classiness waft over me.

746
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,902
They wrote Zuckerberg said he hoped the 
privacy options would help restore his reputation...

747
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:04,402
...following student outrage over <i>Facemash.com.</i>

748
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,528
It's exactly what we said to him.

749
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,757
He's giving us the finger in <i>The Crimson.</i>

750
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,867
While we are waiting for dad's lawyer to look this stuff over 
we can at least get something going in the paper.

751
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:16,877
- No.
- So people know that this is in dispute.

752
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:19,848
We're not starting a knife fight in <i>The Crimson,</i>
and we're not suing anybody.

753
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:20,684
Why not?

754
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,838
I don't understand, why not?

755
00:42:25,225 --> 00:42:26,586
He's gonna say it's stupid.

756
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:28,533
Me?

757
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,156
Say it, why not?

758
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,617
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

759
00:42:33,737 --> 00:42:38,173
This is Harvard, were you don't plant stories, 
and you don't sue people.

760
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:41,559
You thought he was gonna be the 
only one who thought that was stupid?

761
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,005
During the time when you
say you had this idea...

762
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:48,556
...did you know Tyler and Cameron 
came from a family of means?

763
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:50,566
A family of means?

764
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:52,746
Did you know their father was wealthy?

765
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,398
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

766
00:42:55,418 --> 00:42:57,276
It's not important. 
You be sure why I'm asking.

767
00:42:57,396 --> 00:42:58,256
Not important to you.

768
00:42:58,536 --> 00:42:59,248
Sy.

769
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,997
Did you know that they came from money?

770
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,493
I had no idea whether they 
came from money or not.

771
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:09,875
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra, you 
referenced Howard Winklevoss's consulting firm.

772
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:10,703
If you say so.

773
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,764
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm 
whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.

774
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,856
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members 
of a Harvard final club called The Percillian.

775
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:21,001
They pointed that out.

776
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:22,388
Excuse us for inviting you in.

777
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:23,352
To the bike room.

778
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,451
So it's safe to say you were 
aware that my clients had money.

779
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:29,899
Yes.

780
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:34,062
Let me tell you why I'm asking, I'm wondering
why, if you needed a thousand dollars...

781
00:43:34,063 --> 00:43:36,645
...for an internet venture you
didn't ask my clients for it.

782
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:39,445
They had demonstrated an interest 
to you in that kind of thing.

783
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:42,299
I went to my friend for the money because 
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

784
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:47,905
Eduardo was the President of the Harvard Investors 
Association, and he was also my best friend.

785
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,436
Your best friend is suing you 
for six hundred million dollars.

786
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:53,074
I didn't know that, tell me more.

787
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:56,475
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch?

788
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,164
I'm sorry Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

789
00:43:59,165 --> 00:44:01,720
Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

790
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,805
We already went through this on the... never mind.
Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch?

791
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:07,706
It exploded.

792
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:12,667
Everybody on campus was using it. <i>Facebook me.</i> 
It was the common expression after two weeks.

793
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:14,314
And eh, Mark?

794
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:16,414
And Mark was the biggest thing on campus...

795
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:19,584
...that included nineteen Nobel laureates
and fifteen Pulitzer Prize winners,...

796
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:22,931
...two future Olympians, 
and a movie star.

797
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,293
Who's the movie star?

798
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:25,654
Does it matter?

799
00:44:26,254 --> 00:44:26,854
No.

800
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:27,654


801
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:14,856
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

802
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:16,328
Yeah.

803
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:17,579
He made Facebook?

804
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:20,082
Yeah. I mean,
it's both of ours, but...

805
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,359
Cool. I am a Chrisy, this is Alice.

806
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:29,657
Very nice to meet you.

807
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:32,991
Facebook me if you get home,
maybe we all can go out and grab a drink.

808
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,167
Certainly, can absolutely do that.

809
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:46,748
She said, <i>Facebook me, 
and we can all go for a drink.</i>

810
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:49,697
Which is stunningly great 
for two reasons.

811
00:45:49,698 --> 00:45:51,031
One, she said <i>Facebook me</i>, right?
And the other -

812
00:45:51,032 --> 00:45:52,231
- They want to have drinks later.

813
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,636
Yes, have you ever heard so many different good things 
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

814
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:56,764
Excuse me, Mark?

815
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:58,533
Yeah.

816
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,396
I am Stewart Singer, 
I'm in you're OS class.

817
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:02,302
Sure.

818
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,542
Awesome job with TheFacebook.

819
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:05,372
Awesome job.

820
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:06,234
Thanks.

821
00:46:06,576 --> 00:46:07,212
I'm Bob.

822
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:08,779
How are you doing?

823
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,039
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you...

824
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,372
...when he said "the next Bill Gates 
could be right in this room."

825
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:14,141
I doubt it.

826
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,660
I showed up late I didn't 
even know who the speaker was.

827
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:19,363
It was Bill Gates.

828
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,464
Shit, that makes sense.

829
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,306
Alright, thanks guys.

830
00:46:29,006 --> 00:46:30,406
You a moron?
- You medically stupid?

831
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:33,406
You don't recognize Bill Gates when 
he's in front of you for an hour?

832
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:36,606
I get a Glock and kill you.

833
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:29,506


834
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:39,593
Time to monetize the thing.

835
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,045
What were their names?

836
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:42,215
Heard what I just said?

837
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:42,623
What?

838
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:45,220
I said it's time to monetize the site.

839
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:47,320
What does that mean?

840
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,260
It means, it's time for the website 
to start generating revenue.

841
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,608
I know the word means, 
I'm asking how you want to do it.

842
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:54,541
Advertising.

843
00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:55,480
No.

844
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,512
Well, we got four thousand members.

845
00:46:58,632 --> 00:46:59,733
Because TheFacebook is cool.

846
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,062
And if we start selling pop-ups for 
Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool -

847
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:03,534
- Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew, 
but at some point...

848
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:06,575
...I am talking as the business end of the company.

849
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:09,929
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know... what it is.

850
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:15,764
We don't know what it can be, we don't 
know what it will be, we know that it is cool.

851
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,829
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

852
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:19,072
So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

853
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,068
That's the point, the way
 fashion's never finished.

854
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,679
Fashion.
Fashion is never finished.

855
00:47:22,888 --> 00:47:24,669
You're talking about fashion?
Really, you...

856
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,342
I'm talking about the idea of it,
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

857
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:30,447
OK, but they manage to make 
money selling pants.

858
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:33,241
Mark, what is this?

859
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:34,221
A what.

860
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:34,981
This.

861
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:36,814
It's called a Cease and Desist letter.

862
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:37,514
What were their names?

863
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:39,532
Who?
- The girls.

864
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:44,463
When did you get this?
- About ten days ago, right after we launched the site.

865
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:48,137
They're saying the Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

866
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,582
I find that to be a little more then mildly annoying.

867
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,700
They find it to be intellectual property theft.

868
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:56,537
Why didn't you show this to me?
- It was addressed to me.

869
00:47:55,899 --> 00:47:59,398
<i>They're saying we stole TheFacebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss twins.</i>

870
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:01,696
I know what it says.
- Did we?

871
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:02,324
Did we what?

872
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:04,579
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

873
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,446
The letter says we could face legal action.

874
00:48:06,347 --> 00:48:08,102
No, it says <i>I</i> could face legal action.

875
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:10,520
This is from a lawyer, Mark,
they must feel they have some grounds.

876
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:13,734
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

877
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:16,497
The grounds are: our thing is cool, and popular,
and <i>Harvard Connection</i> is lame.

878
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:20,174
Eduardo, I didn't use any of their code.
I promise I didn't use anything.

879
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:23,509
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe money
to everyone who's ever built a a chair.

880
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,749
Look, they came to me with 
an idea, I had a better one.

881
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,895
Why didn't you show me this letter?

882
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:28,653
I didn't think it was a big deal.

883
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,664
If there is something wrong...

884
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:37,674
If there is ever anything wrong...

885
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:38,972
...you can tell me.

886
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:40,347
I'm the guy that wants to help.

887
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:41,542
This is our thing.

888
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,283
Now, is there anything you need to tell me?

889
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,585
No.

890
00:48:49,756 --> 00:48:51,588
What are we doing about this?

891
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:55,062
I went to 3L Student Legal Services,
and they told me to write them back.

892
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:56,017
And what did you say?

893
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:59,383
When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site.

894
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:03,099
Where it stood with graphics, how much 
programming was left that I had not anticipated.

895
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:08,734
Lack of hardware, we had to deal with a site that lacked
promotion, then go on to successfully launch the website.

896
00:49:08,735 --> 00:49:12,620
This was the first time to you raised 
any of those concerns, right?

897
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:14,088
I'd raised concerns before.

898
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,081
Bullshit.

899
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:16,328
Not to us.

900
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,014
I'm talking about the meeting in 
January to which this letter is referring.

901
00:49:20,134 --> 00:49:20,562
Yeah.

902
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:22,282
Let me rephrase this.

903
00:49:22,402 --> 00:49:25,060
You sent my client sixteen emails.

904
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,812
The first fifteen, you didn't raise any concerns.

905
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:28,958
Is that a question?

906
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:32,541
In the sixteenth e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

907
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:36,038
Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

908
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,375
Then why didn't you raise any 
of these concerns before?

909
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,601
It's raining.

910
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:40,429
I'm sorry.

911
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:41,448
It just started raining.

912
00:49:41,568 --> 00:49:44,722
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

913
00:49:46,097 --> 00:49:47,068
No.

914
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,383
Do you think I deserve it?

915
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:50,492
What?

916
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,899
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

917
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:57,679
I had to swear an oath before I began this deposition
and I don't want to perjure myself...

918
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,475
...so I have a legal obligation to say no.

919
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:00,722
OK, no.

920
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:03,938
You don't think I deserve your attention.

921
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:05,360
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders...

922
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:11,573
...and call themselves tall, they have a right to give it a try, but 
there is no requirement that I enjoy sitting here, listening to people lie.

923
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:15,196
You have part of my attention, you have the minimum amount.

924
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:18,108
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook...

925
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:22,254
...where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,
including and especially your clients...

926
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,641
...are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

927
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:29,423
Did I adequately answer your condescending question?

928
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:40,405
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

929
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,059
Back at 2:30.

930
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,940
So, what are their names.

931
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,969
Their names were Christie and Alice.

932
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,747
And they want to have drinks, tonight.

933
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:56,247


934
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,747
I don't care.

935
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,552
Hey man, sorry.
A couple of girls are freshing up in there.

936
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,613
Sweet.

937
00:51:56,806 --> 00:51:59,806
We have groupies.

938
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:05,495
I'll be right back.

939
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:09,163
Mark, where you going?

940
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:16,219
Erica?

941
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:19,264
Hi.

942
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:22,550
I saw you from over there,
I didn't know you came to this cupboard.

943
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:25,939
First time.
- Mine too, can I talk to you alone for a second?

944
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:30,097
I think I'm good right here
- I just...

945
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,791
I'd love to talk to you alone,
If we could go some place.

946
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,123
Right here is fine.

947
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:38,946
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched?
- No.

948
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,460
<i>TheFacebook</i>?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

949
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,232
That's why I wanted to talk to you -

950
00:52:43,615 --> 00:52:44,213
On the Internet -

951
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:45,793
That is why I came over -

952
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:47,538
Comparing women to farm animals?

953
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:49,194
I didn't end up doing that.

954
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:50,877
Didn't stop you from writing it.

955
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:53,989
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head is so clever...

956
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:56,190
...it would be a crime for it 
not to be shared.

957
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,156
The Internet is not written in pencil, Mark...

958
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,696
...it's written in ink. And you published 
that Erica Albright was a bitch...

959
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:06,008
...right before you made an ignorant 
crack about my family's name...

960
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:09,807
...my bra size, then rated 
women based on their hotness.

961
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:11,909
Erica, is there a problem?

962
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:13,015
No, there's no problem.

963
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:18,164
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room,
because that's what the angry do nowadays,

964
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:22,507
I was nice to you,
don't torture me for it.

965
00:53:22,508 --> 00:53:27,755
If we could just go somewhere for a minute.
- I don't want to be rude to my friends.

966
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,769
OK.
- OK.

967
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:32,692
Good luck with your... video game.

968
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:37,486
Hey, that was great, that was the 
right thing to do. You apologized, right?

969
00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:42,332
We have to expand.

970
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,261
You want more?

971
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:45,821
Is he mad about something?

972
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:46,921


973
00:53:47,537 --> 00:53:50,097
OK, we are expanding to 
Yale and Columbia.

974
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:53,474
Dustin, I want you to show the coding work with me.
Chris, you are in charge of publicity and outreach...

975
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:55,665
...and you can start by getting us 
a story in the BU newspaper...

976
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:56,353
...it's <i>The Bridge.</i>

977
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,341
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

978
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:00,585
Somebody at the newspaper will be a 
computer science major, tell him.

979
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:02,496
Mark Zuckerberg will do 
ten hours of free programming.

980
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:04,356
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

981
00:54:04,357 --> 00:54:05,108
Because I do.

982
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,898
Now here's the arrangement:

983
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:07,987
Eduardo is CFO and owns 
thirty percent of the company.

984
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:11,847
Dustin is a vice-president and head of programming, 
and his five percent of the company will come from my end.

985
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:16,242
Chris is director of publicity, and his compensation
will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

986
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:17,241
Any questions?

987
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:17,866
Who are the girls?

988
00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:20,317
Sorry, they are Christie and Alice.

989
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:21,471
Hi.

990
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,082
Hi.

991
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:22,770
Hello.

992
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,038
Hi.

993
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:25,241
Is there anything we can do?

994
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:26,235
No.

995
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:26,890
Nothing.

996
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:27,871
Yale and Columbia.

997
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:29,107
- And Stanford.

998
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:31,732
What?
- Stanford.

999
00:54:31,737 --> 00:54:33,635
It is time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1000
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:34,635


1001
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,287
You don't want any lunch?

1002
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:41,501
No.

1003
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,367
You're welcome to some salad.

1004
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:45,093
No, thank you.

1005
00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:53,535
This must be hard.

1006
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:55,489
Who are you?

1007
00:54:56,235 --> 00:54:58,630
I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself

1008
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,210
I mean what do you do?

1009
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,643
I am a second year associate at the firm

1010
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:04,834
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition case.

1011
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:07,685
What are you doing?

1012
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,704
Checking to see how it's going in Bosnia

1013
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:12,130
Bosnia.

1014
00:55:12,704 --> 00:55:14,360
They have no roads but they have Facebook.

1015
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:23,951
You must really hate the Winklevoss's?

1016
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:25,518
I don't hate anybody.

1017
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:30,074
The Winklevosses are suing me for intellectual property theft

1018
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:32,418
They're suing me because for 
the first time in their lives...

1019
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:34,979
...things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1020
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,177
He is expanding.

1021
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,464
What?

1022
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:48,070
Yale, Columbia and Stanford.
It's gonna be in <i>The Crimson</i> tomorrow.

1023
00:55:48,618 --> 00:55:49,115
Really?

1024
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:49,523
Yeah.

1025
00:55:49,943 --> 00:55:53,039
Well, it looked like the cease and desist order
really scared the shit out of him, huh.

1026
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:56,015
- I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive releasing it, the site taken down now.

1027
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:59,213
Every minute the site is up 
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1028
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,162
I want an injunction, I want damages,
 I want punitive relief.

1029
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:03,067
I want him dead.

1030
00:56:03,187 --> 00:56:04,201
Yeah, I want those things too.

1031
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:05,793
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1032
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:09,707
Because we are gentlemen of Harvard?
- Because you're not thinking about how it's gonna look.

1033
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:10,646
How's it gonna look?

1034
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:13,563
Like my brother and I in skeleton costumes 
chasing the karate kid around a high school gym.

1035
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:14,096
Cam.

1036
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,459
He has violated Massachusetts State law.

1037
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,580
When he goes to Connecticut, New York 
and California he will have violated federal law.

1038
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,963
By the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.

1039
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:24,874
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1040
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:26,431
Wait. Yeah...

1041
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:27,791
There is.

1042
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:33,107
Harvard student hand book.

1043
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:35,056
Every freshman is issued one of these.

1044
00:56:35,176 --> 00:56:37,884
Somewhere in this book it says 
you can't steal from another student.

1045
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:40,839
This is what we need.

1046
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:44,109
You can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.

1047
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:45,701
My brother and I we pay tuition at this school.

1048
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,701
We carry a 3.9 GPA.

1049
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:48,937
We won trophies for this school.

1050
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,243
And well be rowing in 
the Olympics for this school.

1051
00:56:51,363 --> 00:56:53,531
I want a meeting with the 
goddamn president of this school.

1052
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:55,777
Why Stanford?

1053
00:56:56,983 --> 00:56:58,283
Why do you think?

1054
00:56:58,383 --> 00:56:59,283


1055
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:05,576
Sorry, I'm late for bio-chem.

1056
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:07,869
OK.

1057
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:12,417
You don't know my name, do you?

1058
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,046
Is it Stanford?

1059
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:16,490
I should just kick your ass.

1060
00:57:16,897 --> 00:57:18,248
How do you go to a party?

1061
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,027
Amelia Ritter,
but you prefer Amy.

1062
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,804
You're from Olinda.

1063
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,907
Your father's in commercial real estate 
and your mother's ten years sober.

1064
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,270
What's my major?

1065
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:28,926
Trombone.

1066
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:29,678
Really.

1067
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:32,187
I remember something about a trombone.

1068
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,691
<i>Tu as fait l'amour à la jolie fille.</i>

1069
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:38,749
French, your major is French.

1070
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:39,749
And yours?

1071
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,680
Mine? 
I don't have one.

1072
00:57:40,894 --> 00:57:42,364
You haven't declared?

1073
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:46,522
I don't go to school.
- You're kidding.

1074
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:46,251
No.

1075
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:49,028
Where did you go to school?

1076
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:51,918
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.

1077
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:52,898
Seriously...

1078
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,743
...you're not like fifteen years 
old or anything, are you?

1079
00:57:58,032 --> 00:57:59,629
You're not like fifteen, are you?

1080
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,283
No.

1081
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:03,245
So what do you do?

1082
00:58:04,873 --> 00:58:05,752
I am an entrepreneur.

1083
00:58:06,898 --> 00:58:07,866
You're unemployed.

1084
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:08,834
I wouldn't say that.

1085
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:09,956
What would you say?

1086
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,344
That I'm an entrepreneur.
- Well, then what was your latest preneur?

1087
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:17,612
Well, I founded an Internet company that let
folks download and share music for free.

1088
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,039
Kind of like Napster?

1089
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,713
Exactly like Napster.

1090
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:21,643
What do you mean?

1091
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,962
I founded Napster.

1092
00:58:24,255 --> 00:58:26,089
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1093
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:27,248
Nice to meet you.

1094
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:28,930
You're Sean Parker?

1095
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:31,090
Uh huh, you see the shoes 
on the other...

1096
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:31,943
- Foot?

1097
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,491
...table, which just turned.

1098
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,211
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1099
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,325
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1100
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,752
You're a zillionaire.

1101
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:40,599
Not technically.

1102
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:41,551
What are you?

1103
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,589
Broke.

1104
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:47,793
There's not a lot of money in free music, even less when 
you're being sued by anyone who's ever been to the Grammies.

1105
00:58:48,188 --> 00:58:49,755
This is blowing my mind.

1106
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:50,904
I appreciate that.

1107
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:52,802
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1108
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:56,062
Bio-chem, even though you're
 a French major whose name is Amy.

1109
00:58:56,877 --> 00:58:59,509
- You passed.
I'm a hard worker.

1110
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,772
There's juice. Anything else 
you can find, help yourself.

1111
00:59:05,307 --> 00:59:06,313
Mind if I check my e-mail?

1112
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,664
Yeah, go ahead.

1113
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:18,583
Amy.

1114
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:23,220
Amy.

1115
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:25,029
Can you come out here?

1116
00:59:25,946 --> 00:59:26,902
Just a second.

1117
00:59:30,311 --> 00:59:32,095
There a snake in here, Amy.

1118
00:59:32,096 --> 00:59:32,694
What?

1119
00:59:35,725 --> 00:59:36,248
Where?

1120
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,955
OK there is no snake but I need to ask you something.

1121
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,423
Are you kidding me, I could have been killed.

1122
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:41,971
How?

1123
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:44,929
By running too fast,
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1124
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,640
What do you need to ask me?

1125
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:49,468
I went to check my e-mail 
and there's a website open on your computer.

1126
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,731
Yeah after you passed out last night 
I went on TheFacebook for a little bit.

1127
00:59:54,732 --> 00:59:55,253
What's that?

1128
00:59:55,373 --> 00:59:56,259
TheFacebook?

1129
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:59,368
Stanford had it for like two weeks now.

1130
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:02,749
It's really awesome, except it's
freakishly addictive.

1131
01:00:02,762 --> 01:00:05,476
Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day.

1132
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,864
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1133
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:08,507
Yeah, is everything okay?

1134
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,628
Everything's great.

1135
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:15,702
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1136
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:16,702


1137
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:20,759
Ever been in this building before?

1138
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:23,795
This building's a hundred years older then the country it's in.

1139
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:25,336
So do be careful.

1140
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,258
We're sitting in chairs.

1141
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:29,732
Yes.

1142
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:31,851
Very good.

1143
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:33,875
You can go in now.

1144
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,274
Catherine, I've got students now.

1145
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,371
Students.
Undergrads.

1146
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:53,693
Don't know, from the looks of it 
they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1147
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:56,399
Good morning.

1148
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,086
Good morning, sir

1149
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:58,855
I'm Cameron Winklevoss, this is my brother Tyler.

1150
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,917
And you're here because?

1151
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:06,723
Either of you can answer.
- I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter.

1152
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,024
Read the letter.

1153
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:09,669
Well, we came up with an idea for a website called <i>Harvard Connection</i>.

1154
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,845
We've since changed the name to ConnectU...

1155
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,512
...and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and -

1156
01:01:13,513 --> 01:01:14,123
I understand.

1157
01:01:14,555 --> 01:01:16,540
I'm asking what you want me to do about it?

1158
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:17,622
Well, sir.

1159
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:21,164
In the Harvard student handbook, which is distributed to each freshman...

1160
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:23,849
...under the heading standards of conduct in the Harvard community...

1161
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:26,534
...it says the college expects all the students to be honest...

1162
01:01:26,535 --> 01:01:29,257
...and forthcoming in their dealings with members in the community.

1163
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,846
Students are required to respect public and private ownership...

1164
01:01:32,966 --> 01:01:35,084
...and instances of theft, misappropriation.

1165
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:35,581
- Anne?

1166
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:36,382
Yes, sir?

1167
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:38,279
Punch me in the face, go ahead.

1168
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,020
Or...

1169
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,929
...unauthorized use will result in...

1170
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,420
...disciplinary action...

1171
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,482
...including required withdrawal from the college.

1172
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:49,620
You memorized that instead of doing what?

1173
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,401
What my brother and I came...

1174
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:53,017
...here to ask you respectfully.

1175
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:56,437
Sir, it's against university rules to steal from other students,
plain and simple.

1176
01:01:56,565 --> 01:01:57,620
You've spoken to your house master.

1177
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:58,333
Yes, sir.

1178
01:01:58,334 --> 01:02:01,934
And the house master made a recommendation to the Ad board 
but the Ad board won't hear us.

1179
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:03,598
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

1180
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,861
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our e-mails 
and phone calls for the last two weeks.

1181
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:09,924
He doesn't answer when we 
knock on his door at Kirkland.

1182
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:11,705
And the closest I've come to dealing with him face to face...

1183
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:14,649
...was when I saw him on the quad 
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1184
01:02:14,786 --> 01:02:17,075
- Chased him?
I, I, I saw him and I know he saw me, I went after him.

1185
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:18,259
and he disappeared

1186
01:02:18,379 --> 01:02:20,521
I don't see this as a university issue.

1187
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:22,150
Of course this is a university issue.

1188
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,644
There's a code of ethics and an honor 
code and he violated them both.

1189
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:27,820
You enter into a code of ethics with the university,
not with each other.

1190
01:02:28,403 --> 01:02:32,548
I'm sorry president Summers,
 what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1191
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:33,350
I'm devastated by that.

1192
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:34,635
What my brother means is...

1193
01:02:34,636 --> 01:02:37,334
...Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room 
and stole our computer.

1194
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:38,810
That would be a university issue.

1195
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:41,025
I don't know this office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1196
01:02:41,026 --> 01:02:42,189
This isn't petty larceny.

1197
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,518
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.

1198
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,116
Millions!

1199
01:02:45,236 --> 01:02:45,765
Yes.

1200
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,119
You might just be letting your 
imaginations run away with you.

1201
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:48,705
Sir...

1202
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:51,275
I honestly don't think you're in 
any position to make that call.

1203
01:02:51,276 --> 01:02:53,182
I was the US Treasury secretary.

1204
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,129
I'm in some position to make that call.

1205
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,266
Letting our imagination run away with us...

1206
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,404
...is exactly what we were told 
to do in your freshman address.

1207
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:02,077
Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations...

1208
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,621
...run away with you on a new project.

1209
01:03:03,622 --> 01:03:04,092
You would?

1210
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:06,484
Everyone at Harvard's inventing something.

1211
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:11,294
Harvard undergraduates believe that 
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1212
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:14,859
So I suggest again that the two of 
you come up with a new, new project.

1213
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,653
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.

1214
01:03:16,654 --> 01:03:17,124
Please...

1215
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,220
...come right at the point.

1216
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:21,910
You don't have to be a intellectual property expert 
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1217
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,259
You're saying that I don't...

1218
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:24,608
Of course I am not saying that, sir.

1219
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:25,219
I'm saying that...

1220
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,529
Really?

1221
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:27,166
Sir.

1222
01:03:27,497 --> 01:03:28,044
Ann.

1223
01:03:28,164 --> 01:03:29,467
How did I get this appointment?

1224
01:03:29,468 --> 01:03:30,828
Colleagues of their father.

1225
01:03:32,903 --> 01:03:35,460
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, 
Mr Winklevoss...

1226
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,522
Since you're on the subject of right and wrong.

1227
01:03:37,642 --> 01:03:39,468
This action, this meeting...

1228
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:42,204
The two of you being here, is wrong.

1229
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:43,642
It's not worthy of Harvard.

1230
01:03:43,762 --> 01:03:45,767
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1231
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:48,057
You don't get special treatment.

1232
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,126
We never asked.

1233
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:50,692
Just start another project.

1234
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:53,135
Like were making a diorama for a science fair.

1235
01:03:53,148 --> 01:03:54,051
If you have a problem with that, Mr Winklevoss...

1236
01:03:54,052 --> 01:03:55,782
We never asked for special treatment.

1237
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,805
The court's always at your disposal.

1238
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,637
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1239
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:01,523
Ty.

1240
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:04,030
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1241
01:04:10,353 --> 01:04:10,926
Oops.

1242
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,280
I broke this 335 year old door knob.

1243
01:04:15,759 --> 01:04:18,890
Eduardo, spring break you and 
Mr Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1244
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,386
Yes.

1245
01:04:19,506 --> 01:04:20,728
What was the purpose of the trip?

1246
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,235
Well, as CFO...

1247
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:26,048
...I had set up some 
meetings with potential advertisers...

1248
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:27,295
Who paid for the trips?

1249
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:30,514
It was paid for out of the thousand 
dollar account I set up a few months earlier.

1250
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:34,363
At this point your thousand dollars was the only 
money that had been put into the company?

1251
01:04:34,364 --> 01:04:34,999
Yes.

1252
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,361
How did you feel the meetings went?

1253
01:04:37,926 --> 01:04:38,639
They went terribly.

1254
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:39,402
Why?

1255
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:40,853
Mark was asleep.

1256
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:42,264
I was not asleep.

1257
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,275
Can I rephrase my answer?

1258
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:46,005
I wish he'd been asleep.

1259
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:52,853
So we're at 29 schools now 
with over 75 000 members.

1260
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,878
People who go on TheFacebook tend to stay on longer 
then almost any other website.

1261
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,078
Now here's the most impressive statistic:

1262
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:02,937
Ninety-one percent of the people who try it 
once, come back. Now, if you'll allow me...

1263
01:05:02,938 --> 01:05:05,917
Excuse me one second. What sound
 is he making, is that like a tsk?

1264
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:10,783
It wasn't a tsk...

1265
01:05:11,419 --> 01:05:12,017
...it was...

1266
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,816
...like a gobble stop.

1267
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:17,423
Almost a gag reflex.

1268
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,298
Just what is this?

1269
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:23,620
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip

1270
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,129
Yes.

1271
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:25,147
It was a dinner.

1272
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:26,821
It was set up through 
my girlfriend at the time.

1273
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,417
Would you say that Mark 
was excited about this meeting?

1274
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:30,715
Yes.

1275
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:32,255
Very.

1276
01:05:32,256 --> 01:05:34,253
They're not gonna card us.

1277
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:34,966
Look around.

1278
01:05:35,086 --> 01:05:35,818
It will be embarrassing.

1279
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:37,906
Tell him they're not gonna card us.

1280
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:39,382
They're not gonna card us.

1281
01:05:39,383 --> 01:05:39,764
Mark.

1282
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:41,189
Are you gonna talk about ads again

1283
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:45,147
Unless you're the BALLET THEATER of HARTFORD, 
the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1284
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:46,419
It isn't a business yet.

1285
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,173
That's tough...

1286
01:05:47,265 --> 01:05:48,945
That's tough for me, cause my job...

1287
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:50,345
Never mind.

1288
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:54,595
He's twenty-five minutes late.

1289
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:56,695
He founded Napster when he was nineteen.

1290
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:57,399
He can be late.

1291
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,175
He's not a God.

1292
01:05:58,176 --> 01:05:59,066
What is he?

1293
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,670
He's twenty-five minutes late.

1294
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:02,095
I think you're just jealous.

1295
01:06:02,096 --> 01:06:03,915
I honestly wasn't jealous.

1296
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:05,556
I was nervous.

1297
01:06:05,676 --> 01:06:06,332
Why?

1298
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,694
I didn't know him at all.

1299
01:06:07,814 --> 01:06:11,404
But I had done a search 
and asked around and he...

1300
01:06:11,524 --> 01:06:14,089
...he struck me as a kind of a...

1301
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:16,889
...a wild card.

1302
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:17,876
Why?

1303
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:23,094
He crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in a 
spectacular fashion, he's got a reputation with drugs.

1304
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:24,532
He also founded the companies.

1305
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:25,834
We don't need him.

1306
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:27,895
He's here.

1307
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:32,395
No, no, take your time.

1308
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:33,695
And he does own a watch.

1309
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:34,795
Stop it.

1310
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:37,900
I'm Sean Parker.

1311
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:38,448
How do you do?

1312
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:39,122
You must be Eduardo.

1313
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:41,082
And Christy, and Mark.

1314
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:41,629
Nice to meet you.

1315
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:44,823
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1316
01:06:44,943 --> 01:06:45,294
No.

1317
01:06:45,614 --> 01:06:46,173
Tori.

1318
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:47,675
Hey, baby boy.

1319
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:51,340
Could you bring out some things,
the lacquered pork with that ginger comfit.

1320
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:54,319
Tuna tartar, and the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.

1321
01:06:54,439 --> 01:06:55,044
Christie,

1322
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,050
...what do you like to drink?

1323
01:06:57,882 --> 01:06:58,658
An appletini.

1324
01:06:59,078 --> 01:06:59,791
Great.

1325
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:01,356
Four of those.

1326
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:04,487
From that point on,
it was a Sean-a-thon.

1327
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:15,735
The question was what did you talk about.

1328
01:07:27,413 --> 01:07:29,882
He took us through his 
episode with Napster.

1329
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:32,736
I didn't want to spend my twenties
as a professional defender.

1330
01:07:32,856 --> 01:07:35,650
Who knew the music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor?

1331
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:41,531
They tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said 
we owed in royalties, but I guess to them that was a little like...

1332
01:07:42,149 --> 01:07:44,478
...selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1333
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:46,221
So we said screw it...

1334
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:47,290
...and declared bankruptcy.

1335
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,334
You made a name for yourself.

1336
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:49,886
And you are dry.

1337
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:51,044
Tori!

1338
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:54,270
And then he went on to
his second business venture...

1339
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,024
which was an online Rolodex
 that he got thrown out of by his Case Equity.

1340
01:07:58,144 --> 01:08:03,920
And I wanted to do it nice this time. I put on a tie and shined my 
shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1341
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:06,834
So let me tell you what happens to a
 twenty-year old on the top of a hot dot.com.

1342
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:08,530
I'm not a psychiatrist, but...

1343
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,095
- We got that on the record.

1344
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,157
You're not a psychiatrist, but what...?

1345
01:08:12,462 --> 01:08:15,300
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.

1346
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:17,822
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1347
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:20,099
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1348
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,555
I can't prove it, but I know they tapped my phones.

1349
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:25,152
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, 
you've done already.

1350
01:08:25,153 --> 01:08:28,016
Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by,

1351
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:30,969
...and if somehow, someway, you've managed
 to live your life like the Dalai Lama but...

1352
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,351
...they'll make shit up because...

1353
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:34,557
...they don't want you, they want your idea...

1354
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:37,115
...and they want you to say thank you while you...

1355
01:08:37,235 --> 01:08:37,980
...excuse me,

1356
01:08:38,273 --> 01:08:39,672
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1357
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:40,894
That's what happened to you?

1358
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:42,345
And delusional.

1359
01:08:43,235 --> 01:08:43,719
Yes.

1360
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:44,745
What?

1361
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:49,637
There'll be payback at Case. It brought down the
record companies with Napster and...

1362
01:08:49,638 --> 01:08:50,737
...Case will suffer for their sins too.

1363
01:08:49,757 --> 01:08:52,144
Sorry, you didn't bring 
down the record companies.

1364
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:53,098
They won.

1365
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:54,065
In court.

1366
01:08:54,358 --> 01:08:54,836
Yeah.

1367
01:08:55,528 --> 01:08:57,539
Do you want to buy a 
Tower Records, Eduardo?

1368
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:02,655
He told story after story about...

1369
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:05,359
...life in SILICON VALLEY, parties at STANFORD...

1370
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,069
...down in LA, friends who'd become millionaires..

1371
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:12,951
...but mostly how Mark had to,
he had to come to California.

1372
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:16,158
And then he cut around to TheFacebook.

1373
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,365
So tell me about your progress.

1374
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:20,884
Well, were in twenty-nine schools now.

1375
01:09:21,004 --> 01:09:22,767
We got over 75 000 members.

1376
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:23,989
Tell me about the strategy you're using.

1377
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,295
OK.

1378
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:28,359
For instance we wanted Baylor in Texas, 
but Baylor already had a social network on campus so...

1379
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,049
...instead of going right after them, we made 
a list of every school within a hundred miles.

1380
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,691
Put TheFacebook on those campuses first.

1381
01:09:33,692 --> 01:09:36,098
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were 
seeing their friends on our site and we were in.

1382
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:37,561
It's called the little bighorn, that's smart, Mark.

1383
01:09:37,562 --> 01:09:38,967
Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1384
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:40,921
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1385
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:43,175
I say It's time to start making
money from TheFacebook.

1386
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:44,448
But Mark doesn't want advertising.

1387
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:45,097
Who's right?

1388
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:48,112
Well, neither of you yet.

1389
01:09:48,507 --> 01:09:50,836
TheFacebook is cool, that's
what it's got going for it.

1390
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:53,520
You don't want to ruin it with ads, 
because ads aren't cool.

1391
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:54,041
Exactly.

1392
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:55,785
It's like you're throwing 
the greatest party on campus...

1393
01:09:55,786 --> 01:09:57,821
...and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11.

1394
01:09:58,864 --> 01:10:00,849
You don't even know what the thing is yet.

1395
01:10:00,969 --> 01:10:02,820
How big it can get, how far it can go.

1396
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:04,780
This is no time to take your chips down.

1397
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:06,767
A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool.

1398
01:10:06,768 --> 01:10:07,276
You?

1399
01:10:10,546 --> 01:10:12,379
A billion dollars.

1400
01:10:15,823 --> 01:10:16,815
That shut everybody up.

1401
01:10:17,197 --> 01:10:18,712
And that's were you're headed.

1402
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:20,519
A billion dollar evaluation.

1403
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:26,361
Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as
well have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1404
01:10:26,362 --> 01:10:28,461
When you go fishing you 
can catch a lot of fish.

1405
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:29,964
Or you can catch a big fish.

1406
01:10:29,965 --> 01:10:33,540
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout.

1407
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,106
No, he's holding a three thousand pound marlin.

1408
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:35,347
Yep.

1409
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:36,364
That's a good analogy.

1410
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:39,189
OK, we all know that marlins don't 
really weigh 3 000 pounds, right?

1411
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,220
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1412
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:43,045
No I haven't. But looking at the guy holding 
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1413
01:10:43,057 --> 01:10:45,793
Tat would be a really big fish 
and a very strong guy.

1414
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:47,499
You think you might be getting 
away from the point.

1415
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:51,266
I don't have a dog in this fight,
 I just a fan and came to say hi.

1416
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:54,320
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1417
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:57,198
He picked up the check, he told
 Mark that they'd talk together soon...

1418
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:02,086
..and he was gone, but not before he made 
his biggest contribution to the company.

1419
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,563
Drop the <i>The</i>, just <i>Facebook. </i>It's cleaner.

1420
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,563


1421
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:26,029
That's gotta be some kind of 
landspeed record for talking

1422
01:11:26,423 --> 01:11:27,632
You want to end the party at 11.

1423
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:30,220
I'm trying to pay for the party

1424
01:11:30,221 --> 01:11:31,110
There won't be a party...

1425
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,332
...unless it's cool.

1426
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:35,532
What do you think?

1427
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:36,875
Yeah sure, lets drop the <i>The.</i>

1428
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,420
I meant catching the marlin 
instead of the fourteen trout

1429
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:40,961
Doesn't that sound good?

1430
01:11:41,483 --> 01:11:42,425
If you're a trout.

1431
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:46,842
I'm going to enter this into the record, 
incorporation papers for Facebook...

1432
01:11:46,843 --> 01:11:48,142
...an LLC registered in Florida.

1433
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:49,498
Why Florida?

1434
01:11:49,818 --> 01:11:50,907
It's where my family lives.

1435
01:11:51,027 --> 01:11:54,810
And ask the respondents to stipulate that the 
articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows:

1436
01:11:54,824 --> 01:12:00,906
65% for Mark Zuckerberg, 30% for Eduardo Saverin,
 and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1437
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:01,897
We stipulate -

1438
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:04,111
...and that was April 13, 2004.

1439
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:04,785
You can mark it.

1440
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:06,083
Do you have anything here

1441
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:07,623
Yes, thank you.

1442
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:14,007
Mr Saverin, have you ever done anything that might 
be considered legitimate grounds for termination?

1443
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:16,241
No.

1444
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:20,847
You've never did anything to embarrass 
the company, or even seriously jeopardize it?

1445
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:22,229
No.

1446
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:23,027
No?

1447
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:27,664
No!

1448
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:29,371
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1449
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:33,927
You weren't?

1450
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:35,848
This is not happening.

1451
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:38,150
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson</i>.

1452
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:39,626
Jesus Christ.

1453
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,166
I can't have this, Eduardo.

1454
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:44,616
Oh, come on man, this is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1455
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,822
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1456
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:51,826
I'd been accepted, and as part of 
my initiation I had to, for one week...

1457
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:57,726
...carry with me at all times, 
and take care of, a chicken.

1458
01:12:57,727 --> 01:13:00,085
They identify you as one of the founders 
of Facebook, Jr Eduardo Saverin.

1459
01:13:00,086 --> 01:13:02,521
I'm not the expert, but being connected to
torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1460
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:06,877
I did not torture the chicken. 
I don't torture chickens

1461
01:13:06,878 --> 01:13:07,945
Are you crazy?

1462
01:13:07,946 --> 01:13:09,282
No, now settle down, please.

1463
01:13:09,283 --> 01:13:11,562
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1464
01:13:11,563 --> 01:13:12,402
This is scathing.

1465
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:13,178
956

1466
01:13:13,298 --> 01:13:20,594
I was having dinner at the Kirkland dining hall, with Mark 
and I had the chicken with me, cause I had to have the chicken with me at all times.

1467
01:13:20,607 --> 01:13:21,472
This is college.

1468
01:13:21,473 --> 01:13:22,974
Somebody is going to have to answer for this.

1469
01:13:22,975 --> 01:13:23,788
969

1470
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:32,465
The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner, so I had to feed my chicken, 
so what I took little pieces of chicken, and I gave it to the chicken.

1471
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:36,348
Someone must have seen cause the next thing
 I knew, I was accused of forced cannibalism.

1472
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,003
I didn't know...

1473
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,199
...you couldn't do that.

1474
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:41,922
I dealt with various animal rights groups.

1475
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:44,333
I dealt with the associate dean at the college.

1476
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,038
This was all resolved.

1477
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:47,133
988

1478
01:13:47,134 --> 01:13:51,788
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must
 have reported it, for all I know it was the Winklevosses.

1479
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:53,086
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1480
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:54,104
This is absurd.

1481
01:13:54,224 --> 01:13:56,344
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1482
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:58,058
Next I'll be accused of necrophilia.

1483
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,330
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1484
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:02,741
I'm gonna have to explain this to my father, 
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1485
01:14:03,288 --> 01:14:04,650
What is happening on that?

1486
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:07,500
I have my final coming up for "Post War and Contemporary Art"
 and I haven't been to class.

1487
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:09,378
I'm supposed to write about those four paintings.

1488
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:10,740
It's a Facebook page.

1489
01:14:10,741 --> 01:14:10,969
Yeah.

1490
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,000
I put it under an ALIAS

1491
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:16,466
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.
Every once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going

1492
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:19,224
Mr Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?

1493
01:14:19,225 --> 01:14:20,891
I'd rather not answer that question.

1494
01:14:20,892 --> 01:14:21,706
And why not?

1495
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,472
Cause I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam.

1496
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:26,368
That's not what friends do.

1497
01:14:26,488 --> 01:14:28,289
Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1498
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:30,160
Oops.

1499
01:14:32,161 --> 01:14:34,541
You told your lawyer I was torturing animals.

1500
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:38,833
No he didn't tell us about it at all,
our litigators are capable of finding a <i>Crimson </i>article.

1501
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:41,353
In fact, when we raised the subject, he defended you.

1502
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:44,726
Oops.

1503
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:47,984
993, we are so close.

1504
01:14:48,104 --> 01:14:49,905
Oh yeah, that reminds me...

1505
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,725
We're gonna need more money, Eduardo.

1506
01:14:51,845 --> 01:14:53,329
I agree, more servers, more help.

1507
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:56,817
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto,
and we are going to have to pay them something

1508
01:14:56,937 --> 01:14:57,555
Sorry, what?

1509
01:14:57,568 --> 01:15:01,793
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from 
the Stanford campus. It's perfect and it's got a pool.

1510
01:15:01,794 --> 01:15:03,775
When did you decide to go to California for the summer?

1511
01:15:03,776 --> 01:15:05,353
You mean, when did I actually decide?

1512
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:07,962
Somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1513
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:11,245
He was right, California is the place we've gotta be.

1514
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:12,759
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1515
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,970
I guess you guys have the Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil?

1516
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:18,189
What is your problem with Sean?

1517
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:20,073
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1518
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:22,236
Doesn't have money, Dustin's a better programmer.

1519
01:15:22,237 --> 01:15:23,089
He's got connections.

1520
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:23,914
Got connections to VC's.

1521
01:15:23,915 --> 01:15:26,820
We need advertisers. I have connections with VC's.

1522
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:30,498
They're real players, and as someone who's just 
really embarrassed the company in a bad way -

1523
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:31,826
It was the Winklevosses, Mark.

1524
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:32,360
Hang on.

1525
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:33,620
Hit refresh.

1526
01:15:34,766 --> 01:15:37,069
150. 000

1527
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,237
150. 000 members

1528
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:40,929
Eduardo.

1529
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,074
Congratulations.

1530
01:15:43,003 --> 01:15:47,012
You don't think it was strange that 
he was followed by private detectives.

1531
01:15:47,013 --> 01:15:48,297
Who came up with nothing.

1532
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,804
Enough to get him out of the company. 
The drugs, the girls.

1533
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:51,992
We don't know if any of that's true.

1534
01:15:51,993 --> 01:15:52,628
Read about it.

1535
01:15:52,629 --> 01:15:54,995
And I can read about you torturing birds, 
since when does reading about something.

1536
01:15:54,996 --> 01:15:58,507
Do fish eat other fish? The marlins and the trout?

1537
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:01,740
What's he talking about?

1538
01:16:01,741 --> 01:16:06,419
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in the CS lab.
Get on board with this man, you know.

1539
01:16:06,776 --> 01:16:07,895
I don't really know what else to say.

1540
01:16:42,756 --> 01:16:44,168
What's going on?

1541
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:50,228
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a python webserver, 
expose its SSL encryption, then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1542
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,030
They're hacking.

1543
01:16:51,031 --> 01:16:53,181
All behind a PIX Firewall Emulator, 
but here's the beauty.

1544
01:16:53,182 --> 01:16:55,058
You know I didn't understand 
anything you just said, right?

1545
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:55,681
I do know that.

1546
01:16:55,682 --> 01:16:56,305
So what's the beauty?

1547
01:16:56,306 --> 01:16:58,341
Every tenth line of code written, they have to take a shot.

1548
01:16:58,342 --> 01:17:03,174
And hacking is supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server 
detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1549
01:17:03,175 --> 01:17:07,004
I also have a program running that has a pop-up window 
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1550
01:17:07,005 --> 01:17:08,808
The last candidate to hit 
the window has to take a shot.

1551
01:17:08,809 --> 01:17:11,074
Plus every three minutes,
they all have to take a shot.

1552
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:17,189
Can I ask what part of the interns job 
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1553
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:21,325
You're right. A more relevant test might be seeing 
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1554
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:24,535
That was mean.

1555
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:25,756
Here.

1556
01:17:26,316 --> 01:17:26,838
What is this?

1557
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:29,808
I opened a new account and put $18 000 in it.

1558
01:17:31,412 --> 01:17:32,761
Will that get you through the summer?

1559
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:42,066
Welcome to Facebook

1560
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:53,782
$18 000?

1561
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:54,126
Yes.

1562
01:17:54,246 --> 01:17:56,747
In addition to the $1 000 you already put up.

1563
01:17:56,748 --> 01:17:57,065
Yes.

1564
01:17:57,185 --> 01:17:59,638
A total of $19,000, then

1565
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:00,274
Yes.

1566
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:04,016
Just checking your math on that.

1567
01:18:04,385 --> 01:18:05,084
Yes.

1568
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:06,828
I got the same thing.

1569
01:18:07,486 --> 01:18:08,466
May I continue?

1570
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:13,161
After expressing misgivings about Mr Zuckerberg
taking the company and moving it to California...

1571
01:18:13,162 --> 01:18:17,081
...for the summer, why did you put 
$18,000 in an account for his use?

1572
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:18,589
I figured we were partners.

1573
01:18:18,971 --> 01:18:20,561
I wanted to be a team player.

1574
01:18:20,681 --> 01:18:26,491
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on 
the site, while I was generating advertiser interest in New York.

1575
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:27,823
But mostly I figured...

1576
01:18:28,395 --> 01:18:31,118
...how much could possibly
go wrong in three months?

1577
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,722
OK, ready?

1578
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:46,511
Sounds like an eight.

1579
01:18:46,995 --> 01:18:47,720
That was like a two.

1580
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,933
He's better than that.

1581
01:18:59,066 --> 01:18:59,690
I'm OK.

1582
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:00,403
Sure?

1583
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,989
That's the doorbell.

1584
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:07,363
I didn't know we had a doorbell

1585
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:08,636
Hey Andrew, get the door.

1586
01:19:08,637 --> 01:19:09,654
No, he's wired in.

1587
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:12,130
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1588
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:21,764
Mark.

1589
01:19:22,248 --> 01:19:23,368
You live here?

1590
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:24,093
Yeah.

1591
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,943
We live right across the street, we saw the chimney.

1592
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:27,262
Yeah.

1593
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:27,847
Is anybody hurt?

1594
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:28,229
You look...

1595
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,362
We live across the street.

1596
01:19:31,043 --> 01:19:32,137
I'm Sharon.

1597
01:19:32,557 --> 01:19:35,026
This is my Sharon, she lives across the street...

1598
01:19:35,027 --> 01:19:36,286
...I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney.

1599
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:38,386
Yeah, we had a little accident by the pool.

1600
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:41,478
You came to California.

1601
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:44,887
You made the right choice.

1602
01:20:00,187 --> 01:20:01,498
I'm so sorry.

1603
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:01,880
No problem.

1604
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:02,542
I didn't know you were gonna

1605
01:20:03,012 --> 01:20:03,521
No wait...

1606
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:10,362
This house and this team are great. 
It's exactly what it should be.

1607
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:11,940
I'm Sean Parker.

1608
01:20:12,411 --> 01:20:13,391
Oh, he's wired in.

1609
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:15,378
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1610
01:20:17,147 --> 01:20:18,305
Where's Eduardo?

1611
01:20:18,425 --> 01:20:20,736
He got a internship in New York.

1612
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:22,797
Eduardo didn't come out.

1613
01:20:43,657 --> 01:20:49,523
I was crashing there for a little bit while taking care of some things, but 
she's done for the summer, so she's back at her parents' place.

1614
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,723
The homeless rockstar Palo Alto.
- Alright.

1615
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:55,081
What's your plan for the summer?

1616
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:00,935
I'm sorry, I was looking
at the architecture.

1617
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:03,724
I asked what your plans for the -

1618
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,302
A hundred schools by
the end of the summer.

1619
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:14,729
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1620
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:16,014
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1621
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:17,236
What do you mean?

1622
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:22,536
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond 
wants to buy his wife some lingerie...

1623
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:25,292
...but he's too embarrassed to shop for 
it in a department store.

1624
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:29,835
Comes up with an idea for a high end 
place that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1625
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:34,341
He gets a $40 000 dollar bank loan,
borrows another $40 000 from his in-laws...

1626
01:21:34,342 --> 01:21:37,319
...opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1627
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,984
Makes half a million dollars in the first year.

1628
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:47,212
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores and after five years,
he sells the company to Leslie Wester unlimited for four million dollars.

1629
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:48,949
Happy ending, right?

1630
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:56,559
Except, two years later the company is worth $500,000,000 
and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge.

1631
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:05,720
Was that a parable?

1632
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,360
My date's a Victoria Secret model,
that's why she looks familiar to you.

1633
01:22:10,661 --> 01:22:13,511
Don't be impressed by all this,
I read your blog.

1634
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:17,525
You know why I started Napster?

1635
01:22:18,595 --> 01:22:23,100
The girl loved in High School was with 
the co-captain of the varsity Lacrosse team.

1636
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:25,174
And I wanted to take her from him.

1637
01:22:25,175 --> 01:22:27,427
So I decided to come up with the next big thing.

1638
01:22:27,428 --> 01:22:28,356
I didn't know that.

1639
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:33,739
Napster wasn't a failure. I changed the 
music industry for better and for always.

1640
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:37,711
It may not have been good business 
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1641
01:22:37,712 --> 01:22:40,602
And isn't that what your Facemash was about?

1642
01:22:40,603 --> 01:22:43,719
They're sacred of me pal, 
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1643
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:47,957
What the VC's want to say, <i>good idea kid, 
grown-ups are gonna take it from here.</i>

1644
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,993
But not this time, this is our time.

1645
01:22:51,194 --> 01:22:56,703
This time you gonna hand them a 
business card that says I'm CEO, bitch

1646
01:22:57,479 --> 01:22:59,363
That's what I want for you.

1647
01:23:00,818 --> 01:23:01,773
So were the hell is Eduardo?

1648
01:23:03,596 --> 01:23:04,258
He's in New York.

1649
01:23:04,378 --> 01:23:05,467
Sucking up to ad execs.

1650
01:23:06,612 --> 01:23:07,643
He's got an internship.

1651
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:12,724
The company's here, a
billion dollar company's here.

1652
01:23:13,457 --> 01:23:14,399
Do you live and breathe Facebook?

1653
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:16,529
I know you do.

1654
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:20,080
Eduardo wants to be a business man
and for all I know he'll be a good one, but...

1655
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:23,384
...he shouldn't be in New York 
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1656
01:23:24,269 --> 01:23:27,705
This is a once in a generation holy shit idea...

1657
01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:32,097
...and the water under the 
Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1658
01:23:33,272 --> 01:23:37,115
Look at my face and tell me 
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1659
01:23:39,826 --> 01:23:41,073
You ever think about that girl?

1660
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:41,620
What girl?

1661
01:23:42,423 --> 01:23:45,604
T-the girl from high school, the Lacrosse team.

1662
01:23:47,519 --> 01:23:47,888
No.

1663
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:48,888
You need to top up.

1664
01:23:51,445 --> 01:23:52,717
A hundred schools by the end of the summer?

1665
01:23:53,773 --> 01:23:59,589
Tell you what,a gesture of faith.
You get into hundred schools, I'll put you on two continents.

1666
01:24:07,204 --> 01:24:10,742
If you don't have a place to crash 
I think you should definitely come live with us.

1667
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:13,950
Let's line up some shots.
Excuse me.

1668
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:19,211
You can take this away and bring back the 1942?

1669
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:21,184
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1670
01:24:21,284 --> 01:24:22,184


1671
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:17,017
Tyler.

1672
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,796
Oh, and this is my brother Cameron.

1673
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:26,558
His Royal Highness Prince Albert,
Your highness this is Taylor and Cameron Winklevoss.

1674
01:26:26,678 --> 01:26:28,301
Of course brilliant race.

1675
01:26:28,302 --> 01:26:29,917
I've never seen a race that close.

1676
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,831
My grandfather Jack Kelly was one of the premier rowers.

1677
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:37,661
I've been coming to Henley for thirty years, 
and I've never seen a race that close.

1678
01:26:37,662 --> 01:26:39,455
Have you seen a race that close?

1679
01:26:40,677 --> 01:26:43,209
No, Your Highness. A mile and a half races are 
more commonly won by a boat-length or two.

1680
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:45,069
Yes, that's absolutely right.

1681
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:46,125
Brutally close.

1682
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:47,168
May I introduce my team mates?

1683
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:49,205
I'm sorry, you have to excuse us.

1684
01:26:54,092 --> 01:26:55,963
We flew all the way out here to see that?

1685
01:26:55,964 --> 01:26:57,082
Wouldn't miss it, brother.

1686
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,062
How's the royalty?

1687
01:26:58,063 --> 01:27:00,938
Ah, he just wanted to tell me 
a couple of times how close the race was.

1688
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:03,611
Brutally, brutally excruciating.

1689
01:27:03,612 --> 01:27:06,818
The guy's is the prince of a country the size of a Kentucky pie, it's fine.

1690
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,338
Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1691
01:27:10,637 --> 01:27:12,394
I'm sorry dad, you and Mom 
had to fly all the way to see this.

1692
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:15,015
No son, don't apologize to me for loosing a race like that.

1693
01:27:15,016 --> 01:27:17,764
I'd never apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1694
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:19,574
Mr Kenright.

1695
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:23,099
Dad, this is Mr Kenright, head of the host family this week.

1696
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:24,651
Pleasure to meet you, Pleasure to meet you

1697
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:26,912
I had a chat with my daughter.

1698
01:27:26,928 --> 01:27:29,502
She told me that she and her friends 
already talking about the race...

1699
01:27:29,503 --> 01:27:31,527
...which they've just seen by their computers.

1700
01:27:31,528 --> 01:27:33,285
A new website called Facebook.

1701
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:35,105
Do you have this in America?

1702
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:38,010
I'm gonna find your mother.

1703
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:42,385
Must be something wrong?

1704
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:43,799
Your daughter doesn't go to school in the States.

1705
01:27:43,812 --> 01:27:46,780
No, no. Cambridge, majoring in French literature.

1706
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:48,232
Though I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1707
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:49,378
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

1708
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:51,850
And apparently Oxford, and the London School of Economics.

1709
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:52,874
for the present

1710
01:27:55,014 --> 01:27:58,492
Good race boys, the bitter or the better, eh?

1711
01:28:00,912 --> 01:28:02,161
You watch my stuff.

1712
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,283
This is online, I want to see it.

1713
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:09,253
What are you doing?

1714
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:12,501
Knock it off.

1715
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,546
I don't mind that we lost to 
the Dutch by less then a second...

1716
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:17,527
...that was a good race...

1717
01:28:17,528 --> 01:28:20,138
...and that was a fair race, 
and they'll see us again.

1718
01:28:20,139 --> 01:28:22,826
What I mind and what
you should mind...

1719
01:28:22,827 --> 01:28:25,645
...is showing up on Monday for a race
that was run on Sunday.

1720
01:28:26,486 --> 01:28:29,569
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter, we'd tried the Ad board...

1721
01:28:29,169 --> 01:28:32,169
...and we tried talking to 
the president of the university.

1722
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:34,123
Now I am asking you
for the last time...

1723
01:28:34,595 --> 01:28:39,563
...let's take the considerable resources at 
our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1724
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,105
Come on.

1725
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:43,933
I need a real drink.

1726
01:28:52,017 --> 01:28:52,514
Screw it.

1727
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,030
Lets gut the friggin' nerd.

1728
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:00,730
Talkin' about.

1729
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:04,897
Check it out, I saw him today.

1730
01:29:04,866 --> 01:29:06,879
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham

1731
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:10,513
Are you guys using spikes or ghostesses?

1732
01:29:10,514 --> 01:29:12,269
We don't know, we're just 
shooting at each other

1733
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,643
Use sweet kamikazes.

1734
01:29:13,763 --> 01:29:14,925
And that is?

1735
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:19,560
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera 
and he saw me too.

1736
01:29:19,897 --> 01:29:21,118
I know he did.

1737
01:29:24,078 --> 01:29:27,119
Don't, don't sweat it.

1738
01:29:29,409 --> 01:29:30,835
Does anybody hear that banging?

1739
01:29:30,955 --> 01:29:32,878
You don't hear anything,
you're writing code.

1740
01:29:33,532 --> 01:29:34,474
Somebody's at the door.

1741
01:29:43,922 --> 01:29:45,271
I'm gonna call you back.

1742
01:29:47,842 --> 01:29:48,542
What's up?

1743
01:29:48,662 --> 01:29:49,318
What's up?

1744
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:55,372
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport 
an hour ago. I've been calling his cell.

1745
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:59,132
He was on a 36 hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a few hours.

1746
01:30:06,453 --> 01:30:07,331
What happened here?

1747
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:09,482
Not happened, happening.

1748
01:30:09,602 --> 01:30:11,022
Next big thing.

1749
01:30:11,142 --> 01:30:12,116
Eduardo.

1750
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:14,237
Hey man, back to work.

1751
01:30:14,555 --> 01:30:17,863
Sorry about it, It's the more wasted I get..

1752
01:30:18,283 --> 01:30:19,734
I meant the more...

1753
01:30:19,963 --> 01:30:21,375
We understand.

1754
01:30:24,234 --> 01:30:25,163
How old are they, Sean?

1755
01:30:25,799 --> 01:30:26,970
It's not polite to ask.

1756
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:27,734
Sean, how old are they?

1757
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:31,029
You think you know me, right?

1758
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:31,806
I've read enough.

1759
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,825
You know how much I've read about you?

1760
01:30:40,545 --> 01:30:41,054
Eduardo.

1761
01:30:41,055 --> 01:30:44,007
I waited an hour for you at the airport.

1762
01:30:44,008 --> 01:30:45,483
What time is it?

1763
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:47,926
Midnight, it's 3 A.M. in New York 
where I just came from.

1764
01:30:49,162 --> 01:30:51,033
You got to see some of the new stuff we got.

1765
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:53,641
Dustin, show him the wall,
I'm just calling it the wall.

1766
01:30:53,642 --> 01:30:56,112
Forget about the wall, 
tell him about the meeting I got set up.

1767
01:30:56,353 --> 01:30:57,626
You know Peter Thiel?

1768
01:30:58,071 --> 01:30:58,720
Nope.

1769
01:30:58,721 --> 01:31:02,727
No reason you should. He just runs a two billion 
dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital.

1770
01:31:04,203 --> 01:31:05,565
Why is he setting up meetings for you?

1771
01:31:05,577 --> 01:31:06,735
Thiel may want to make an angel investment

1772
01:31:06,736 --> 01:31:09,611
I don't care if he's an actual angel, 
why is he setting up business meetings?

1773
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:10,859
You've had a long flight.

1774
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:15,223
No I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long 
wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO.

1775
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:16,852
And in between there was a long flight.

1776
01:31:17,241 --> 01:31:18,831
I'm the business end of this company.

1777
01:31:19,786 --> 01:31:22,178
And he is a house guest
living here rent-free...

1778
01:31:22,179 --> 01:31:25,448
...on a very generous grant
 from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1779
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:28,431
I heard about your big ticket Big Daddy Big Buys, Gary's Tuxedos -

1780
01:31:28,432 --> 01:31:28,825
Hey, man.

1781
01:31:28,826 --> 01:31:33,361
Harvard Bartending Course, you're just a small step away 
from bagging Snookies Cookies. Can feel it.

1782
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:44,062
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

1783
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:44,456
Sure.

1784
01:31:49,408 --> 01:31:50,807
Uh, bong hit.

1785
01:31:50,927 --> 01:31:52,436
I'm so high.

1786
01:31:54,103 --> 01:31:57,501
How's it going? How's the internship, 
how's Christy?

1787
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:00,512
How's the internship?

1788
01:32:03,325 --> 01:32:08,046
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship, we talked about this 
on the phone. I quit on my first day.

1789
01:32:09,603 --> 01:32:11,282
I do remember you saying that.

1790
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:12,682
So how's Christy?

1791
01:32:14,286 --> 01:32:15,317
Christy's crazy.

1792
01:32:16,106 --> 01:32:16,997
Is that fun?

1793
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:17,517
No.

1794
01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:22,465
Psychotic, she's insanely jealous, 
she's irrational.

1795
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:24,680
And I'm frightened of her.

1796
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,830
Still it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1797
01:32:29,304 --> 01:32:31,417
I do not want that guy...

1798
01:32:32,142 --> 01:32:34,153
...representing himself as 
part of this company.

1799
01:32:34,154 --> 01:32:36,240
You've got move out here Eduardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1800
01:32:36,241 --> 01:32:36,651
Did you here what I just said?

1801
01:32:36,652 --> 01:32:38,306
The connections, the energy.

1802
01:32:38,307 --> 01:32:38,878
Mark, Mark.

1803
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:41,640
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're going to be left behind.

1804
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,650
I want, I want, I need you, 
please don't tell me -

1805
01:32:45,623 --> 01:32:46,501
What did you just say?

1806
01:32:46,621 --> 01:32:48,853
It's moving faster then any of us 
ever imagined it would.

1807
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:51,347
It's moving fast and Sean thinks that we should -

1808
01:32:51,348 --> 01:32:52,250
Sean's not part of this company.

1809
01:32:52,251 --> 01:32:54,655
We have over three hundred thousand members,
 we're in hundred sixty schools.

1810
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:54,973
I'm aware.

1811
01:32:55,093 --> 01:32:56,208
Including five in Europe.

1812
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,200
I'm aware of that - MARK.

1813
01:32:57,201 --> 01:32:58,931
MARK, I'm the CFO.

1814
01:32:58,932 --> 01:33:01,667
We need more programmers, and we need more 
money and he set up the Thiel meeting.

1815
01:33:01,668 --> 01:33:02,990
He set up meetings all over town.

1816
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:04,314
Set up other meetings.

1817
01:33:04,315 --> 01:33:04,568
Yes.

1818
01:33:04,688 --> 01:33:06,070
Without me knowing anything about it.

1819
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:06,461
You're in New York.

1820
01:33:06,462 --> 01:33:10,457
I'm in in New York riding subways fourteen 
hours a day, trying to find advertisers.

1821
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:11,666
Yeah, and how is 
it going it go so far?

1822
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:18,136
What did you mean, 
get left behind?

1823
01:33:24,728 --> 01:33:30,492
I'd like to freeze this bank account 
and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.

1824
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:32,808
May I see some ID, please.

1825
01:33:32,809 --> 01:33:33,585
Yeah, sure.

1826
01:33:41,028 --> 01:33:43,980
Sean, he'll be right with you.
- No problem.

1827
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:48,604
You know this is where they 
filmed Towering Inferno?

1828
01:33:48,704 --> 01:33:49,604
That's comforting.

1829
01:33:51,823 --> 01:33:53,427
Hey guys, come on back.

1830
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:55,986
Did she offer you some water?

1831
01:33:56,287 --> 01:33:57,533
Oh yeah, we're cool.

1832
01:33:59,748 --> 01:34:00,906
You must be Mark.

1833
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:07,646
We took a look at everything 
and congratulations.

1834
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:11,412
We're gonna start you off with a 
$500,000 investment.

1835
01:34:11,413 --> 01:34:14,630
Maurice is going to talk to you about 
some corporate restructuring.

1836
01:34:15,444 --> 01:34:17,289
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware.

1837
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:19,465
We've come up with a stark structure 
that allows for new investors.

1838
01:34:20,013 --> 01:34:22,570
Now let me ask you something

1839
01:34:23,014 --> 01:34:25,075
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1840
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:50,792
When did you get back?

1841
01:34:50,793 --> 01:34:52,408
You scared me, I need you to knock.

1842
01:34:52,409 --> 01:34:54,571
When did you get back?

1843
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,271
I got back this afternoon.

1844
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:58,365
And when were you gonna call me?

1845
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:00,783
Jesus. it was kind of a bad trip.

1846
01:35:01,088 --> 01:35:02,183
And I was tired.

1847
01:35:02,184 --> 01:35:05,812
Or answer 1 of my 47 texts, 
did you know I sent 47 texts?

1848
01:35:05,813 --> 01:35:09,795
I did and I thought that 
was incredibly normal behavior

1849
01:35:09,915 --> 01:35:11,144
Are you mocking me?

1850
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:12,692
I bought you a present.

1851
01:35:14,614 --> 01:35:16,790
Why does your status say <i>single</i> 
on your Facebook page?

1852
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:17,790
What?

1853
01:35:18,537 --> 01:35:22,737
Why does your relationship status say<i>
single</i> on your Facebook page?

1854
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:24,467
I was single when I set up the page.

1855
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,309
And you never bothered to change it?

1856
01:35:26,521 --> 01:35:26,852
What?

1857
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:28,468
I don't know how.

1858
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:30,848
Do I look stupid to you?

1859
01:35:31,433 --> 01:35:32,566
No, calm down.

1860
01:35:32,567 --> 01:35:37,712
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook
 doesn't know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?

1861
01:35:37,713 --> 01:35:38,437
A little embarrassing...

1862
01:35:38,438 --> 01:35:40,778
...so you should take it as a sign of 
trust that I would tell you that.

1863
01:35:40,779 --> 01:35:41,376
Go to hell.

1864
01:35:41,377 --> 01:35:42,115
Take it easy.

1865
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:45,368
You didn't change it, so you could 
screw those little Silicon Valley sluts -

1866
01:35:45,369 --> 01:35:48,379
That's not even remotely true and 
I can promise you that the Silicon Valley...

1867
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,679
...sluts don't care what any body's 
relationship status is on Facebook.

1868
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,964
Please open your present.

1869
01:35:54,265 --> 01:35:55,409
Your phone does work.

1870
01:35:56,796 --> 01:35:57,776
It's Mark.

1871
01:35:59,481 --> 01:36:00,881
Uh, open you present.

1872
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:02,319
It's a scarf.

1873
01:36:03,115 --> 01:36:05,113
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1874
01:36:05,114 --> 01:36:06,398
This'll be your first.

1875
01:36:07,404 --> 01:36:07,849
Yeah.

1876
01:36:08,154 --> 01:36:08,956
You froze our accounts.

1877
01:36:09,076 --> 01:36:09,516
I did.

1878
01:36:09,636 --> 01:36:10,585
You froze the accounts.

1879
01:36:10,705 --> 01:36:11,696
I had to get your attention, Mark.

1880
01:36:11,697 --> 01:36:15,245
Do you realize you jeopardize the entire company?
Do you realize your actions can permanently destroy...

1881
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:16,545
...everything I've been working on?

1882
01:36:16,446 --> 01:36:17,446
WE have been working on.

1883
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:18,713
Without money the site can't function.

1884
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:21,213
Let me tell you the difference 
between Facebook and everybody else.

1885
01:36:21,214 --> 01:36:22,384
We don't crash ever.

1886
01:36:22,385 --> 01:36:26,100
If the servers are down for even a day 
our reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1887
01:36:26,101 --> 01:36:26,455
Look -

1888
01:36:26,456 --> 01:36:30,527
Napster and Friendster have proven that. Even a few people 
leaving would reverberate through the entire user base.

1889
01:36:30,528 --> 01:36:33,127
The users are interconnected, that's the whole point.

1890
01:36:33,128 --> 01:36:37,857
College kids are online because their friends are online, and 
if one domino goes, the other domino goes, don't you get that?

1891
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:40,889
I am not going back to the Caribbean night at A.E.Pi.

1892
01:36:42,487 --> 01:36:43,509
Holy shit.

1893
01:36:46,787 --> 01:36:47,805
What is wrong with you?

1894
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:51,114
Did you like being nobody. Did you like 
being a joke? You want to go back to that?

1895
01:36:51,115 --> 01:36:51,919
Hang on, hang on.

1896
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,804
That was the act of a child, not a businessman.

1897
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:56,326
Certainly not the act of a friend.

1898
01:36:56,327 --> 01:36:59,863
You know how embarrassed I was to cash 
a check today? I am not going back to that life.

1899
01:36:59,864 --> 01:37:01,285
Maybe you were frustrated.

1900
01:37:01,285 --> 01:37:02,185
Yeah.

1901
01:37:01,786 --> 01:37:03,604
Maybe you were angry.

1902
01:37:03,605 --> 01:37:04,215
I was.

1903
01:37:04,773 --> 01:37:10,499
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,
because Eduardo, I've got some good news,

1904
01:37:10,501 --> 01:37:13,697
I'm sorry, I was angry 
and maybe it was childish.

1905
01:37:14,698 --> 01:37:16,334
But I had to get your attention.

1906
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:18,488
I said I've got some good news

1907
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:20,461
What is it?

1908
01:37:20,462 --> 01:37:23,184
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of half a million dollars.

1909
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:25,538
Half a million dollars.

1910
01:37:25,994 --> 01:37:28,552
And he's setting us up in an office.

1911
01:37:28,573 --> 01:37:30,177
They want to re-incorporate the company.

1912
01:37:30,197 --> 01:37:33,417
They want to meet you, they need 
your signature on some documents.

1913
01:37:33,417 --> 01:37:38,617
So you need to get your ass on the first 
flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO.

1914
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:43,650
I'm on my way.

1915
01:37:43,651 --> 01:37:44,706
Eduardo.
- Yeah.

1916
01:37:45,006 --> 01:37:46,002
We did it.

1917
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:50,404
Eduardo.

1918
01:37:51,696 --> 01:37:53,080
You're going back there already?

1919
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,380
Yes.

1920
01:37:56,594 --> 01:37:58,795
Also I'm breaking up with you.

1921
01:37:58,895 --> 01:37:59,795


1922
01:38:06,912 --> 01:38:09,879
Four documents. The first two are 
common stock agreement purchases...

1923
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:15,379
...allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated 
Facebook, as opposed to the old shares...

1924
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:16,879
...which are now worthless.

1925
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,682
The third is an exchange agreement allowing 
you to exchange the old shares for new shares.

1926
01:38:20,683 --> 01:38:23,049
And finally the voter holding agreement.

1927
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:25,008
How many shares of stock will I own?

1928
01:38:25,128 --> 01:38:28,806
1,328,334
- Jesus Christ.

1929
01:38:28,926 --> 01:38:32,828
That represents 34.4% ownership share.

1930
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,516
Why the increase from 
the original thirty percent?

1931
01:38:35,517 --> 01:38:37,985
Because you may dilute 
to award shares to new investors.

1932
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:41,454
I love working with business majors.
- Intelligent.

1933
01:38:42,472 --> 01:38:47,269
You should know that Mark has already taken 
his percentage from sixty down to fifty-one.

1934
01:38:48,771 --> 01:38:51,519
Well, Mark doesn't care about
the money and he needs to be protected.

1935
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:59,197
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81 percent, 
Sean Parker 6.47 percent.

1936
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:02,571
I can live with that.

1937
01:39:02,572 --> 01:39:04,390
And Peter Thiel seven percent.

1938
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,109
Would you like to use my pen?

1939
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:11,509


1940
01:39:11,692 --> 01:39:12,621
Eduardo.

1941
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:14,434
Eduardo.

1942
01:39:15,986 --> 01:39:17,310
Can you please repeat the question?

1943
01:39:17,411 --> 01:39:20,686
No, it was an outrageously lewd question
 the first time and now you want us to hear it twice?

1944
01:39:20,687 --> 01:39:22,611
Yes, we do. 
Read it back, please.

1945
01:39:23,045 --> 01:39:23,523
Go ahead.

1946
01:39:23,543 --> 01:39:28,009
Counsel, when you signed these documents, were you 
aware you were signing your own death certificate?

1947
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,909
No.

1948
01:39:34,049 --> 01:39:37,981
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all these...

1949
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:41,195
In all honesty, I thought 
they were my lawyers.

1950
01:39:44,871 --> 01:39:45,800
I was your only friend.

1951
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:49,536
You had one friend.

1952
01:39:54,273 --> 01:39:55,189
My father won't even look at me.

1953
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:59,959
OK. Eduardo, did Mr Zuckerberg say 
anything to you after you had signed the papers?

1954
01:40:00,936 --> 01:40:03,659
There was a lot of hand shaking,
a lot of congratulations.

1955
01:40:04,728 --> 01:40:08,456
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming 
back to school for at least a semester.

1956
01:40:09,396 --> 01:40:11,369
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1957
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:15,019
Before I left he said:
- But you gotta come back.

1958
01:40:15,394 --> 01:40:17,379
Somewhere around the end of 
November, early December...

1959
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:20,436
...Peter wants to throw us an amazing 
party when we hit a million members.

1960
01:40:20,437 --> 01:40:23,436
It's gonna be out of control,
you gotta come back for it.

1961
01:40:23,456 --> 01:40:24,456
A million members?

1962
01:40:25,385 --> 01:40:27,836
Remember the algorithm?
On the window at Kirkland.

1963
01:40:34,491 --> 01:40:35,687
Yeah, I'll be here.

1964
01:40:35,787 --> 01:40:36,687


1965
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,958
You sure about this?

1966
01:40:42,078 --> 01:40:43,269
You're twenty minutes late.

1967
01:40:43,289 --> 01:40:46,305
You're gonna walk in there, say you overslept
and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1968
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:50,098
Their gonna pitch you. Case Equities is going
pitch you, Their gonna beg you take their money.

1969
01:40:50,099 --> 01:40:52,590
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod...

1970
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:56,390
...and then you're gonna say: which one of you
is David Roth? No, not Roth. Manningham.

1971
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,590
Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?

1972
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:58,790
And he'll say, I am.

1973
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,790
And then you'll say, Sean Parker
says 'Fuck You.'

1974
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:03,690
And walk out.

1975
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:04,690
OK.

1976
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:05,690


1977
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:22,480
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling
me to come out for the millionth member party.

1978
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,248
What else did the e-mail say?

1979
01:41:24,249 --> 01:41:26,706
It said that we had to have a business meeting.

1980
01:41:26,746 --> 01:41:30,398
That Mark and Sean had played some 
kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity.

1981
01:41:31,058 --> 01:41:35,461
And that Manningham was so impressed he was now
making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1982
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:40,258
So I went to California and I 
went straight to the new offices.

1983
01:41:41,251 --> 01:41:44,903
I didn't know weather to dress for 
the party or the business meeting...

1984
01:41:45,023 --> 01:41:46,367
...so I kinda dressed for both.

1985
01:41:48,214 --> 01:41:49,155
But it didn't matter.

1986
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:50,097
Why not?

1987
01:41:50,217 --> 01:41:52,248
Because I wasn't called out there for either one.

1988
01:41:52,368 --> 01:41:53,825
What were you called out there for?

1989
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:58,831
An ambush.

1990
01:41:59,491 --> 01:42:00,904
Mr Saverin, please.

1991
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:15,385
At first I thought he was joking.

1992
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,315
Giving more contracts to sign.

1993
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:23,156
But then I started reading.

1994
01:42:26,156 --> 01:42:27,156
What is this?

1995
01:42:28,797 --> 01:42:32,271
Well, as you know we 
had some new investors that -

1996
01:42:32,272 --> 01:42:33,264
What is this?

1997
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:49,909
Mark.

1998
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,365
Mark.

1999
01:42:52,585 --> 01:42:53,318
He's wired in.
- Sorry?

2000
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:54,318
He's wired in.

2001
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:54,918
Is he?
- Yes.

2002
01:42:57,237 --> 01:42:59,044
How about now, you still wired in?
- Call security.

2003
01:42:59,469 --> 01:43:01,849
You issued twenty-four million 
new shares of stock.

2004
01:43:03,322 --> 01:43:05,230
You were told that if 
new investors came along -

2005
01:43:05,631 --> 01:43:07,756
How much were your shares diluted? 
How much were his?

2006
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:10,855
What was Mr. Zuckerbergs shares diluted down to?

2007
01:43:12,713 --> 01:43:13,584
It wasn't.

2008
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:16,829
What were Mr Moscovitz's ownership 
shares diluted down to?

2009
01:43:17,554 --> 01:43:17,999
It wasn't.

2010
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:21,123
What were Sean Parkers 
shares diluted down to?

2011
01:43:21,963 --> 01:43:22,599
It wasn't.

2012
01:43:22,968 --> 01:43:25,653
What were Peters Thiels ownership shares diluted down to?

2013
01:43:26,048 --> 01:43:26,608
It wasn't.

2014
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,916
And what was your ownership shares diluted down to?

2015
01:43:31,099 --> 01:43:33,097
.03 percent.

2016
01:43:41,567 --> 01:43:42,547
You signed the papers.

2017
01:43:42,618 --> 01:43:43,559
You set me up.

2018
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:48,119
You're gonna blame because you were the business head of the 
company, and you made a bad business deal with your own company.

2019
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,214
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2020
01:43:50,215 --> 01:43:52,453
Won't be like you're not a part of Facebook, 
you're not a part of Facebook.

2021
01:43:52,454 --> 01:43:53,599
My name's on the masthead.

2022
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:54,783
You may want to check again.

2023
01:43:55,089 --> 01:43:56,501
Because I froze the account?

2024
01:43:56,502 --> 01:44:00,166
You think we were gonna let you parade around in your 
ridiculous suits and pretending you were running this company.

2025
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:02,317
Sorry, my Prada's are at the cleaners.

2026
01:44:02,318 --> 01:44:04,774
Along with my hoodie and fuck-you flip flops.

2027
01:44:04,775 --> 01:44:06,950
You pretentious douchebag.

2028
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:08,299
Security's here, you'll be leaving now.

2029
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,330
I'm not signing those papers.

2030
01:44:09,331 --> 01:44:10,972
We'll get the signature.

2031
01:44:11,226 --> 01:44:14,217
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix.

2032
01:44:17,879 --> 01:44:20,679
I knew you did it, you 
planted that story about the chicken.

2033
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,384
I didn't plant that story about the chicken.

2034
01:44:22,385 --> 01:44:23,021
What's he talking about?

2035
01:44:23,022 --> 01:44:24,518
You had me accused of animal cruelty.

2036
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:25,714
Seriously, what the hell's the chicken?

2037
01:44:25,715 --> 01:44:31,389
What you hated most, was that they 
identified me as a co-founder of Facebook.

2038
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,363
Which I am.

2039
01:44:32,364 --> 01:44:34,208
You better lawyer up, asshole.

2040
01:44:34,209 --> 01:44:39,629
Cause I'm not coming back for thirty percent, 
I'm coming back for everything.

2041
01:44:50,502 --> 01:44:50,922
Hang on.

2042
01:44:54,007 --> 01:44:54,860
I almost forgot.

2043
01:44:56,463 --> 01:45:00,217
Here's your nineteen thousand dollars. 
I wouldn't cash it though, I drew it on the account you froze.

2044
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:07,604
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2045
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:10,798
Makes me look so tough.

2046
01:45:26,691 --> 01:45:28,612
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2047
01:45:29,643 --> 01:45:33,460
I want to see everybody here geared up for a party.
We're going to walk into that club...

2048
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:37,098
...like it's the Macy's parade, Mackie, put it up on the big 
screen, we've gotta almost be there.

2049
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:41,602
You alright?

2050
01:45:43,806 --> 01:45:44,620
You were kinda rough with him.

2051
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:46,402
That's life in the NFL.

2052
01:45:47,509 --> 01:45:49,112
You know you didn't have to be that rough on him.

2053
01:45:49,113 --> 01:45:50,283
I'm putting together a party.

2054
01:45:50,284 --> 01:45:50,843
Sean.

2055
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,585
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2056
01:45:54,586 --> 01:45:55,985
He almost killed it.

2057
01:45:58,172 --> 01:45:59,114
I'll send flowers.

2058
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:04,744
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting
 together a party after the party...

2059
01:46:05,045 --> 01:46:06,080
...at Kappa Beta Sigma.

2060
01:46:06,431 --> 01:46:07,564
Ash is a sister.

2061
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:08,956
Ashley.
- The intern.

2062
01:46:10,127 --> 01:46:11,170
I know who she is.

2063
01:46:12,018 --> 01:46:12,717
Are you guys..

2064
01:46:12,777 --> 01:46:14,932
Ashley? Me? No.
Well, a little bit.

2065
01:46:17,293 --> 01:46:18,093
Why?

2066
01:46:18,749 --> 01:46:19,791
Excuse me, Mark.

2067
01:46:20,353 --> 01:46:21,791
We were just talking about you.

2068
01:46:21,827 --> 01:46:23,150
Just that you're doing 
a really good job.

2069
01:46:24,143 --> 01:46:25,899
Thanks, I appreciate that.

2070
01:46:27,524 --> 01:46:28,924
These came in for you.

2071
01:46:28,968 --> 01:46:29,960
Put it on my desk.

2072
01:46:36,925 --> 01:46:37,969
What's the package?

2073
01:46:39,116 --> 01:46:39,772
Nothing.

2074
01:46:43,165 --> 01:46:43,712
Mackie.

2075
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:44,987
Yes, sir.

2076
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:45,712
Refresh.

2077
01:46:53,519 --> 01:46:54,817
And you're not a hugger.

2078
01:46:55,888 --> 01:46:56,423
I know.

2079
01:46:59,631 --> 01:47:00,687
One million.

2080
01:47:03,087 --> 01:47:04,087
Who's got champagne?

2081
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,387
I've got champagne.

2082
01:47:08,487 --> 01:47:09,387


2083
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:34,863
The next transformative development of picture sharing application, 
a place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.

2084
01:47:35,264 --> 01:47:38,523
It is the true, the digitalization of your life.

2085
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:46,972
You go through the party with a digital camera 
and then your friends re-live the party online.

2086
01:47:46,973 --> 01:47:48,754
And tagging, the idea -

2087
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:49,912
Would it be easier without the bra?

2088
01:48:05,683 --> 01:48:10,137
I spend hours watching what people do when they 
log on. How they check their friends status updates.

2089
01:48:10,237 --> 01:48:11,437
That's weird, why did the music stop?

2090
01:48:11,438 --> 01:48:14,970
To see which one of their friends change 
their profiles, change their photos and mostly-

2091
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:15,970
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2092
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:20,528
We lived on farms. And then we live 
in cities, and now were going to live on the internet

2093
01:48:22,026 --> 01:48:23,795
Stop. I think something's 
going on downstairs.

2094
01:48:43,144 --> 01:48:44,034
It's the cops.

2095
01:48:50,008 --> 01:48:52,222
Good to see you officer, what can I do for you?

2096
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:54,248
What's going on?

2097
01:48:54,879 --> 01:48:57,207
Was the music too loud? 
We were having a celebration.

2098
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:58,607
Miss, I need you to button your blouse

2099
01:48:58,727 --> 01:49:00,529
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2100
01:49:05,585 --> 01:49:06,272
Not mine.

2101
01:49:06,735 --> 01:49:08,555
OK, we're going to need identification.

2102
01:49:08,656 --> 01:49:10,157
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2103
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:13,649
You got anything else in your 
pockets I should know about?

2104
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:14,549
No, no, sir.

2105
01:49:14,569 --> 01:49:16,776
Don't be stupid now
- I don't, I don't.

2106
01:49:21,643 --> 01:49:22,139
What's this?

2107
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:24,437
That's an EpiPen.

2108
01:49:25,821 --> 01:49:27,571
And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2109
01:49:29,315 --> 01:49:29,824
How old are you?

2110
01:49:31,778 --> 01:49:32,414
21.

2111
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:34,323
21.

2112
01:49:34,718 --> 01:49:35,494
21.

2113
01:49:35,495 --> 01:49:36,268
I'm 21.

2114
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:37,617
Lying makes it worse.

2115
01:49:39,182 --> 01:49:40,824
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2116
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:56,520
Listen, something has happened.

2117
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,660
It's alright, it's gonna be alright.

2118
01:50:06,661 --> 01:50:11,104
I've posted bond, I wasn't doing anything.
I mean I got allergies.

2119
01:50:15,861 --> 01:50:16,568
Interns.

2120
01:50:16,588 --> 01:50:18,675
It was just a party.

2121
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,308
This is gonna be news Sean,
it's gonna be online in a second.

2122
01:50:26,628 --> 01:50:27,531
I know.

2123
01:50:27,532 --> 01:50:28,740
You know with an intern.

2124
01:50:28,741 --> 01:50:31,005
It's cool, I have it under control.

2125
01:50:31,006 --> 01:50:31,960
I will get it under control.

2126
01:50:32,838 --> 01:50:36,203
I will call someone and see 
what the next move is.

2127
01:50:37,228 --> 01:50:39,188
You don't think Eduardo was involved, do you?

2128
01:50:40,555 --> 01:50:41,939
You think?
- No.

2129
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:47,488
Or Manningham. One of them, somebody sent 
the coke 'cause it got in there.

2130
01:50:47,489 --> 01:50:49,162
You believe me? This is gonna be fine.

2131
01:50:58,254 --> 01:50:59,578
Go home, Sean.

2132
01:51:18,862 --> 01:51:19,524
Mark.

2133
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:23,876
We're done for the day.

2134
01:51:25,272 --> 01:51:26,620
Yeah, I was just sitting.

2135
01:51:30,094 --> 01:51:31,189
What happened to Sean?

2136
01:51:32,449 --> 01:51:34,663
He still owns seven percent of the company.

2137
01:51:38,897 --> 01:51:42,231
All you had all day was that salad. 
You want get something to eat?

2138
01:51:43,275 --> 01:51:44,636
I can't.

2139
01:51:52,098 --> 01:51:53,294
I'm not a bad guy.

2140
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:54,554
I know that.

2141
01:51:55,525 --> 01:51:59,343
An emotional testimony I assume 85 percent of it is exaggeration

2142
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:00,373
And the other fifteen

2143
01:52:00,615 --> 01:52:01,124
perjury

2144
01:52:02,206 --> 01:52:03,746
Creations the work mostly of the devil.

2145
01:52:07,431 --> 01:52:08,398
What happens now?

2146
01:52:09,861 --> 01:52:14,124
Sy and the others are having 
a steak on university avenue.

2147
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:18,834
Then they'll come back to the office and 
work on a settlement deal to present to you.

2148
01:52:19,623 --> 01:52:21,099
They're gonna settle.
- Oh yeah.

2149
01:52:21,702 --> 01:52:23,573
And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.

2150
01:52:23,693 --> 01:52:24,082
Why?

2151
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:27,010
So that these guys sign a non-disclosure agreement.

2152
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:31,310
They say one unflattering word about you in public 
and you're away from wife and kids.

2153
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:33,606
I invented Facebook.
- I'm talking about a jury.

2154
01:52:33,936 --> 01:52:36,570
I specialize in <i>voir dire </i>jury selection.

2155
01:52:36,571 --> 01:52:38,937
What a jury sees when they look at a defendant.

2156
01:52:39,057 --> 01:52:42,563
Clothes, hair speaking style, likability.

2157
01:52:42,568 --> 01:52:46,131
Likability.
- I've been licensed to practice law for all of twenty months and..

2158
01:52:46,132 --> 01:52:49,923
...I could get a jury to believe you planted
the story about Eduardo and the chicken.

2159
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:51,179
Watch what else.

2160
01:52:51,743 --> 01:52:53,957
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night?

2161
01:52:54,682 --> 01:52:56,235
You think I'm the one who 
called the police on him?

2162
01:52:56,236 --> 01:52:58,346
Doesn't matter. I asked the question,
 now everybody's thinking about it.

2163
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:02,343
You've lost your jury in the first ten minutes.

2164
01:53:01,743 --> 01:53:04,043
Farm animals.
- Yeah.

2165
01:53:06,001 --> 01:53:08,661
I was drunk, and angry,
and stupid.

2166
01:53:08,662 --> 01:53:11,526
And blogging.
- And blogging.

2167
01:53:11,771 --> 01:53:12,407
Pay them.

2168
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:16,047
In the scheme of things, it's a speeding ticket.

2169
01:53:18,843 --> 01:53:20,153
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2170
01:53:20,937 --> 01:53:23,584
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2171
01:53:23,685 --> 01:53:25,567
I can imagine it would be a problem.

2172
01:53:27,396 --> 01:53:29,605
I appreciate your help today.

2173
01:53:33,403 --> 01:53:35,217
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2174
01:53:37,179 --> 01:53:38,846
You're just trying so hard to be.

2175
01:53:38,946 --> 01:53:39,846
