1
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,211
Colm?

2
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,173
Are you coming out to the pub, Colm?

3
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,554
It's 2:00, like.

4
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,978
Will I see you down there, so?

5
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,567
I'll see you down there, so.

6
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,989
What are you doin' home?

7
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,616
Brother?

8
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,993
What are you doin' home?

9
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,538
I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.
He's just sitting there.

10
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,832
Sitting there doin' what?

11
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,250
Sittin' there doin' nothing.

12
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,793
Smoking.

13
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,795
Was he asleep?

14
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,298
He was smoking, Siobhán.
How do you smoke in your sleep, like?

15
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
Have ye been rowing?

16
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,927
We haven't been rowin'.

17
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,306
I don't think we've been rowin'.

18
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,518
Have we been rowin'?

19
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,817
Why wouldn't he answer the door to me?

20
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,654
Maybe he just doesn't like you no more.

21
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
Pint, Jonjo.

22
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,190
Is Colm not with you?

23
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,733
- No.
- Colm's always with you.

24
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,110
- I know.
- Did you not knock for him?

25
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,361
I did knock for him.

26
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,839
- Well, where is he?
- Just sittin' there.

27
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,114
Sittin' there doin' what?

28
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,365
Sittin' there doing nothin'.

29
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,326
Smokin'.

30
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,995
Have ye been rowin'?

31
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,358
I don't think we've been rowin'.

32
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,664
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

33
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,750
It does sound like we've been rowin'.

34
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,543
Will I try him again?

35
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,086
That'd be the best thing.

36
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,679
Officer Kearney.

37
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,809
Never says "hello."

38
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,187
Never fecking says "hello."

39
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,905
Colm?

40
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,835
Colm?

41
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,298
The door was open, Colm.

42
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,809
Colm?

43
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,925
Where the hell are you headin' off to?

44
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,223
- Everybody?
- No, this is true.

45
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,058
He scored six points from open play.

46
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,354
He was barely the size of a dwarf!

47
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,439
This is true!

48
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,737
- Howdo.
- Howdo, Pádraic.

49
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,238
Sit somewhere else.

50
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,365
Huh?

51
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,455
Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.

52
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,956
He has his pint there, Colm,

53
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,375
from when he came in
and ordered his pint before.

54
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,960
Okay.

55
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,962
I'll sit somewhere else, so.

56
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,889
Are ye rowin'?

57
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,349
I didn't think we were rowin'.

58
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,642
Well, ye are rowin'.

59
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,952
Well, ye are rowin'. He's sittin' outside

60
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,436
on his own like a whatchamacallit.

61
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,521
It does look like we're rowin'.

62
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,860
Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,279
See what all this is fecking about.

64
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,864
That'd be the best thing.

65
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,886
Now I'm sittin' here next to you,

66
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,387
and if you're goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside,

67
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,955
and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.

68
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,627
Now, if I've done somethin' to ya,

69
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,896
just tell me what I've done to ya.

70
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,980
And if I've said somethin' to ya,

71
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,899
maybe I said somethin' when I was drunk,
and I've forgotten it,

72
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,026
but I don't think I said somethin'
when I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

73
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,927
But if I did, then tell me what it was,

74
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,929
and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.

75
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,682
With all me heart,
I'll say sorry.

76
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:58,061
Just stop running away from me
like some fool of a moody schoolchild.

77
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,064
But you didn't say anything to me.

78
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,025
And you didn't do anything to me.

79
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,528
That's what I was thinking, like.

80
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,572
I just don't like you no more.

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,418
You do like me.

82
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,294
I don't.

83
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,339
But you liked me yesterday.

84
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,799
Oh, did I, yeah?

85
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,844
I thought you did.

86
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,167
Pádraic.

87
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,251
Dominic.

88
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,337
What's the matter with ya?

89
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
There's nothing the matter with me,
for God's sake.

90
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,675
Look at this I found.

91
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,427
A stick with a hook.

92
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,053
What would you use it for, I wonder?

93
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,182
To hook things
that were the length of a stick away?

94
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,642
Where you goin'?

95
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,810
Down here.

96
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,437
As good a plan as any!

97
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,855
- Have you any fags?
- No.

98
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,024
Uh, you do. You always have fags.

99
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,693
ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's
handing out a rake of fags.

100
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,962
Whoever's in the mood for one.

101
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,987
- Is he?
- No!

102
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,953
You're behavin' awful unusual.

103
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,968
What are you doin' here?

104
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,556
Was the pub closed?

105
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,809
No, it was open.

106
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,190
Anything in the paper?

107
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,777
- Just the Civil War still.
- Ugh.

108
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,780
A bad do.

109
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,836
Mrs. McCormick's comin' over
later, Pádraic. I couldn't avoid her.

110
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,519
I don't know if you're gonna be in or out,
but you're usually out.

111
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,798
Am I?

112
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,633
You are. Yeah, you know you are.

113
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,176
I don't care, Siobhán.

114
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,720
This is your house, too.

115
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,293
Is it six years
since your mammy and daddy died, Siobhán,

116
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,045
or is it seven years since they died?

117
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,133
It's coming up to eight years,
Mrs. McCormick, aye.

118
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,635
Is it comin' up to eight years?

119
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,180
Doesn't time be flyin'?

120
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,349
Aye, when you're havin' fun.

121
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,436
Oh, be off to the pub now, Pádraic,
if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

122
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,563
I don't have to be down there
every night, do I?

123
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,070
ColmSonnyLarry's
scared him off, I suppose.

124
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,116
What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?

125
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,620
Didn't you and he
used to be the best of friends?

126
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,996
We're still the best of friends.

127
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,473
- MRS. McCORMICK: No, you're not.
- Who says we're not?

128
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,498
She says.

129
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,958
Ah, for God's sake, Siobhán.

130
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,211
I said nothing of the like,
Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.

131
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,465
Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Pádraic,
and don't be getting under our feet.

132
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,176
Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance
to come over for a chat.

133
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,820
She never gets a chance
'cause you avoid her.

134
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,845
I do not avoid her!

135
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,348
You hide behind walls
if she's coming up the road.

136
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,767
-I do not

137
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,353
h... hide behind walls.

138
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,950
Good luck to ye.

139
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,495
Whatever it is you're fightin' about.

140
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,195
I didn't hear there was to be a session.

141
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,863
Last-minute thing.

142
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,448
Colm decided.

143
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,829
All the ladies love Colm, you know.
Always did.

144
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,206
Yeah? That's not true.

145
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,584
You're still barred, Dominic! Out!

146
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,211
You said barred until April.

147
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,379
What are we now?

148
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,547
April.

149
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,234
Well, put that stick outside anyways,
and don't be bothering the women.

150
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,259
There's women?

151
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,136
There is women.

152
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,345
And good ones.

153
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>Well, I took out my dog</i>

154
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>And him I did shoot</i>

155
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,906
<i>All down in the County Kildare...</i>

156
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,369
If we sat next to Colm,
the women would have to talk to us too,

157
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,663
and then we could get at them
with our small talk.

158
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,874
I'm happy enough sittin' here, now.

159
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,792
Are ya, yeah?

160
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,502
Are ya happy enough, yeah?

161
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,296
<i>So fill up your glasses</i>

162
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,964
<i>With brandy...</i>

163
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,050
I can't stand the maudlin ones.

164
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,177
Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

165
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,054
To dance to.

166
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,181
And not have that mope whining.

167
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,274
<i>So be easy and free...</i>

168
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,611
Here, amn't I in enough trouble with him
without your mouthing?

169
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,654
What trouble in are you in with him?

170
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,448
Uh, he just...

171
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,826
doesn't want to be friends
with me no more.

172
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,205
What is he, 12?

173
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,752
Why does he not
want to be friends with you no more?

174
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,685
Shh.

175
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,316
Daddy'll kill us
if we wake him when he's been wanking.

176
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,969
You won't get into trouble
for taking his poteen?

177
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,096
I will get into trouble,

178
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,056
but fuck it.

179
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,187
I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire
on the mainland tonight.

180
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,480
Did you see it?

181
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,691
That'll be the Civil War.

182
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,526
I know that, sure.

183
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,445
Me, I pay no attention to wars.
I'm agin 'em.

184
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,364
Wars and soap.

185
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,286
I tell you this much.

186
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,913
We're good at chatting, aren't we?

187
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,290
Me and you?

188
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,588
Your sister, does she like to chat?

189
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,966
Not as much as most women,
but she'll chat, like.

190
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,551
She more likes reading.

191
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,761
Reading?

192
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,639
Feckin' hell.

193
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,391
Reading.

194
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,440
And did you ever see her
with no clothes on?

195
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,736
I didn't.

196
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,780
Did you not, and you her brother?

197
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,909
Not even as a child?

198
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't like to be chattin'
about these types of things, Dominic!

199
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,787
What types of things?

200
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,164
Sisters with no clothes on!

201
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,583
You saw my daddy with no clothes on.

202
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,127
And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.

203
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,670
Sure, don't I know it.

204
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,841
The tiny, brown cock on him.

205
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,768
What's the matter with him?

206
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,481
Maybe bad news he's had?

207
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,024
Daddy?

208
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,568
No, ColmSonnyLarry.

209
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,822
Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went
whining about that lummox one more time?

210
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,910
I tell ya, it didn't look like
he had bad news tonight.

211
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,663
It looked like a weight was lifted
from his shoulders tonight.

212
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,614
Just bringing me cows past.

213
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,782
What?

214
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,869
I was just bringing me cows past.
I wasn't, you know, trying to...

215
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,204
You don't usually bring them this way.

216
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,557
I don't, but then the little fella

217
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,624
took a fright
at a hen on the corner, so...

218
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,379
I only...

219
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,426
I only just saw
what month we changed to yesterday.

220
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,349
More fool me?

221
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,021
Changed to April.

222
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,187
So, will I be callin' for ya
on me way to the pub later?

223
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,786
I will so.

224
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,038
Anyways,

225
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,833
I better chase after these goons
for they're gettin' away from me.

226
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,963
Maybe they don't like me no more neither.

227
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,511
See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

228
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,434
Why don't you come down
for a sherry later?

229
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,770
There's no need to be stuck inside
on a nice day.

230
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,731
I will so.

231
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,191
How's the book?

232
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,444
It's sad.

233
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,612
Sad?

234
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,882
Well, you should read
a not sad one, Siobhán,

235
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,157
else you might get sad.

236
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
Hmm.

237
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,128
Do you never get lonely, Pádraic?

238
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,633
Never get what?

239
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,428
Lonely.

240
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,764
Do I never get lonely?

241
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,103
What's the matter with everybody?

242
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,065
Jesus.

243
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,154
"Lonely." Fecking hell.

244
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,459
Colm?

245
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,120
Pint, Jonjo.

246
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,007
How's he seem?

247
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,510
Grand, I think. With me, anyways.

248
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,604
What are you doing?

249
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh, so you're gonna be
an eejit again today, is it?

250
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,627
Amn't I allowed to have a
quiet pint on me own, Pádraic?

251
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,879
Well, don't ask a man to call up to ya
at your fecking house, so,

252
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,422
like he has nothing better to do
with his fecking time.

253
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,865
I didn't ask you to call up to me
at me house.

254
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,635
And you do have nothing better to do
with your fecking time.

255
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,826
Huh?

256
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,788
You do have nothing better to do
with your fecking time.

257
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,933
I know I've nothing better to do
with me fecking time,

258
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,060
but there's better things I could be doing
with me fecking time

259
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,284
than to be calling up to ya
at your house, Colm Doherty!

260
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,712
Like what?

261
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,214
Huh?

262
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,049
Like what else could you be doin'?

263
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,718
Reading.

264
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,011
Reading, yeah?

265
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,348
Me, this morning...

266
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,560
this I wrote.

267
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,135
Tomorrow, I'll write
the second part of it.

268
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,096
And the day after,
I'll write the third part of it.

269
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,057
And by Wednesday,
there'll be a new tune in the world,

270
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,060
which wouldn't have been there
if I'd spent the week

271
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,229
listening to your bollocks,
Pádraic Súilleabháin.

272
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,693
So, do you want to take your pint outside,
or do you want me to take my pint outside?

273
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,322
I'll take my pint outside,
'cause it's a shite tune anyways,

274
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,032
I wouldn't bother with it.

275
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,689
I was too harsh yesterday.

276
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,191
Yesterday, he says.

277
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,569
I know well you was too harsh yesterday.

278
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,654
And today.

279
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,822
I just, uh...

280
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,244
I just have this tremendous sense of time
slippin' away on me, Pádraic.

281
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,289
And I think I need to spend
the time I have left

282
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,375
thinking and composing.

283
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,419
Just trying not to listen

284
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,063
to any more of the dull things
that you have to say for yourself.

285
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,424
But I'm sorry about it. I am, like.

286
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,678
Are you dying?

287
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,346
No, I'm not dying.

288
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,141
But then you've loads of time.

289
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,518
For chatting?

290
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,936
- Aye.
- For aimless chatting?

291
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,815
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.

292
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:49,071
So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting
and me life'll keep dwindling.

293
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,075
And in 12 years,
I'll die with nothin' to show for it

294
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,412
bar the chats I've had with a limited man,
is that it?

295
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,582
I said, "Not aimless chatting."

296
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,461
I said, "Good, normal chatting."

297
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,589
The other night,
two hours you spent talking to me

298
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,300
about the things you found
in your little donkey's shite that day.

299
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,052
Two hours, Pádraic. I timed it.

300
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,097
Well, it wasn't me little donkey's shite,
was it?

301
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,100
It was me pony's shite,
which shows how much you were listenin'.

302
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,394
None of it helps me, do you understand?

303
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,938
None of it helps me.

304
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,741
We'll just chat about somethin' else then.

305
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,558
What's the matter with ya?

306
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,934
Nothin'.

307
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,269
Aren't we going for a sherry?

308
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,687
Don't feel like it.

309
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,692
No, I'm not having this again today!

310
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,550
Hey! What the hell's going on with you
and me fecking brother?

311
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,010
Don't come in here shouting the odds at me

312
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,470
in the middle of the fecking day,
all right, Siobhán?

313
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,622
You can't just all of a sudden
stop being friends with a fella!

314
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,790
Why can't I?

315
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,668
Why can't ya? Because it isn't nice.

316
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:27,812
Do you want a sherry, Siobhán?

317
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,046
- No!
- Righty-ho.

318
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,482
Has he said somethin' to ya
when he was drunk?

319
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,007
No, I prefer him when he's drunk.

320
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,027
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.

321
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,761
What's the fecking matter, then?

322
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,179
He's dull, Siobhán.

323
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,139
He's what?

324
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,350
He's dull.

325
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,481
But he's always been dull. What's changed?

326
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,942
I've changed.

327
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,821
I just don't have a place for dullness
in me life anymore.

328
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,367
But you live on an island
off the coast of Ireland, Colm.

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,410
What the hell are you hoping for, like?

330
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,330
For a bit of peace, Siobhán. That's all.

331
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,917
For a bit of peace in me heart, like.

332
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,088
You can understand that. Can't ya?

333
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,557
Can't ya?

334
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,643
Do you think I'm dull?

335
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,980
No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.

336
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,149
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.

337
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,068
Or I was.

338
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,613
Till me best friend
started acting the gilly-gooly.

339
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,948
It's him, Pádraic.

340
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,159
Maybe he's just depressed.

341
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,747
That's what I was thinking,
that he's depressed.

342
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,458
Well, if he is,

343
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,602
he could at least
keep it to himself, like.

344
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,502
You know, push it down,
like the rest of us.

345
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,298
No, Jenny! Out!

346
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,966
-Out!

347
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,900
She just wants a bit of company, Siobhán.

348
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,513
Animals is for outside, I've told ya.

349
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,439
And people don't be laughing at me
behind me back,

350
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,857
do they?

351
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,233
No. Why would they be?

352
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,611
They don't think I'm dim or anything?

353
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,279
Dim?

354
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:00,948
No.

355
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,242
You don't seem very sure about it.

356
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,911
Of course, I'm sure about it.

357
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,040
Dominic's the dim one
on the island, isn't he?

358
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,210
He is, aye. By miles.

359
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,799
Uh, hang on, by miles.
And then, who's the next dimmest?

360
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,593
Well, I don't like to judge people
in those terms now, do I?

361
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,154
- In what terms?
- In order of their dimness.

362
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,948
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?

363
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:25,973
- But try, like.
- No!

364
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,224
I won't try.

365
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,519
There's enough judgy people
on this fecking island, so no!

366
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,398
You're not dim!
You're a nice man, all right? So, move on!

367
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,943
I'm as clever as you, anyways.

368
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,111
I know that at least.

369
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,154
Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.

370
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,531
Huh?

371
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,579
What happened to you?

372
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,873
Me daddy discovered the poteen situation.

373
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,207
Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

374
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,126
You poor thing, ya.

375
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,919
What the hell was he hittin' you with?

376
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,048
A kettle was the final thing.
I wouldn'ta minded, but for the spout.

377
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,317
Do you want a ride to church?

378
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,718
Uh, feck them gobshites!

379
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,094
Dominic!

380
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,805
But could I stay the night
with ye the night?

381
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,182
Just for the one night, like?

382
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,309
Mm...

383
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,020
Well, just the one night, mind.

384
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,731
Nice! I'll see ye for supper, so.

385
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,232
Whoo-hoo!

386
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,712
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

387
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,280
It's eight weeks
since my last confession, I think.

388
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,116
Go on, Colm.

389
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,579
Just the usual, I suppose, Father.
The drinking and the impure thoughts.

390
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,623
And a bit of pride, I suppose.

391
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,252
Although I never really saw that as a sin,
but sure I'm here now.

392
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,212
And

393
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,090
how's the despair?

394
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,844
Not so much of it of late. Thanks be.

395
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,640
And why aren't you talking
to Pádraic Súilleabháin no more?

396
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,186
That wouldn't be a sin, now,
would it, Father?

397
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,857
It wouldn't be a sin, no,
but it's not very nice either, is it?

398
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,818
Who told you?

399
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,697
It's an island, Colm. Word gets around.

400
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,285
Also, Pádraic asked me
to put in a word, like.

401
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,120
I see.

402
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,246
So...

403
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,417
It isn't him
you have the impure thoughts about, is it?

404
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,044
Are you joking me?

405
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,798
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

406
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,676
People do have impure thoughts
about men, too.

407
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,345
Do you have impure thoughts
about men, Father?

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,558
I do not have impure thoughts about men.

409
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,311
And how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth?

410
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,605
Well, you started it.

411
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,608
Well, you can get out of my confessional
right now, so you can.

412
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,377
And I'm not forgiving you
any of these things

413
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,681
until the next time, so I'm not!

414
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,797
Well, I better not be dying
in the meantime then, eh, Father?

415
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,822
I'll be pure fucked!

416
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,033
You will be pure fucked!

417
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,494
Yes, you will be pure fucked!

418
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,261
Pint, Colm?

419
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,142
If you don't stop talkin' to me,
and if you don't stop botherin' me,

420
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,436
or sendin' your sister or your priest
to bother me...

421
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,080
I didn't send me sister
to bother you, did I?

422
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,439
She has her own mind.

423
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,500
Although, I did send the priest though,
you have me there.

424
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,443
What I've decided to do is this.

425
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,737
I have a set of shears at home.

426
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,740
And each time you bother me
from this day on,

427
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,825
I'll take those shears

428
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,709
and I'll take one of me fingers off
with them.

429
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,163
And I'll give that finger to ya.

430
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,749
A finger from me left hand.
Me fiddle hand.

431
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,252
And each day you bother me more,

432
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,920
another I'll take off and I'll give ya

433
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,422
until you see sense enough to stop.

434
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,675
Or until I have no fingers left.

435
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,469
Does this make things clearer to ya?

436
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,347
Not really, no.

437
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,683
Because I don't want
to hurt your feelings, Pádraic.

438
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,809
I don't, like.

439
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,247
But it feels like the drastic
is the only option left open to me.

440
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,731
You've loads of options left open to ya.

441
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,692
How's fingers the first port of call?

442
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,529
Please, don't talk to me

443
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,657
no more, Pádraic. Please.

444
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,575
I'm begging you.

445
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,494
- But...
- Shush, like, Pádraic.

446
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,871
- Just, you know, shush, like.
- Yeah, I'd shush, like.

447
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,707
I will shush.

448
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,169
Except me and me sister were thinking

449
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,797
you might just be
a bit depressed, Colm.

450
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,385
And I tell you this much,
fingers just confirms it.

451
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,180
Don't you think, Colm?

452
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,600
Starting from now.

453
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,245
Well, I never heard the like.

454
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,873
I never heard the like.
He must really not like you, Pádraic.

455
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,333
Fingers!

456
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,834
Jesus. He's serious, lads.

457
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,002
He is serious!

458
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,795
You can see it in his eyes he's serious.

459
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,589
Just because he thinks you're dull.

460
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,923
That's going overboard!

461
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,759
Who told you about the dull?

462
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,055
Well, I overheard it.
Like, what was I supposed to do?

463
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,765
I don't think you're dull.

464
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,975
And jeez,
if I was to cut something off meself

465
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,437
for every dull person that came in here,
I'd only have me head left.

466
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,022
Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

467
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,148
No.

468
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,901
That said,

469
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,113
I did think the two of ye
always made a funny pairing, like.

470
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,199
- No, we didn't.
- Yeah, ye did.

471
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,909
Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

472
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,787
'Cause now he'd rather maim himself
than talk to ya.

473
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,914
Colm was always more of a thinker.

474
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,998
Huh?

475
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,875
Why's every... I think.

476
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,001
Ah, you don't, Pádraic.

477
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,711
- You don't, Pádraic.
- Your sister does.

478
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,773
- Your sister does, aye. Siobhán does.
- You're more of a...

479
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,131
You're more of a... What is he?

480
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,175
You're more one of life's good guys.

481
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,678
You're more one of life's good guys, aye.
Apart from when you're drunk.

482
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,430
Apart from when you're drunk, aye.

483
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,850
I used to think
that'd be a nice thing to be.

484
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,144
One of life's good guys.

485
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,855
And now, it sounds like
the worst thing I ever heard.

486
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,291
Ah, don't take it like that, Pádraic.

487
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,150
Don't take it like that, Pádraic.

488
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,610
We're on your side.

489
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,292
What are you smiling at?

490
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,570
What's this mope so mopey for?
He's just a fecking man, lads!

491
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,155
A fat, ginger man!

492
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,198
Ay yi yi.

493
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,493
I'll tell ya this much.
Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

494
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,177
Luckily, you won't have to put up with us
more than one night, so,

495
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,831
and try eatin' with your mouth closed.

496
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,332
Where are we now, France?

497
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,792
Will you tell him, Pádraic?

498
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,253
Aye, stop being
a little fecking bollocks, Dominic.

499
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,380
No. Just about the mouth thing.

500
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,010
Colm Doherty and his fat fecking fingers.

501
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,237
He probably wouldn't even be able

502
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,941
to cut through the blubber
on them fingers.

503
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,907
Would you not want him
to have to do the one finger

504
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,211
to see if he was bluffing, like?

505
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,434
No, we wouldn't.

506
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,578
That's what I'd have him do,

507
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,021
I'd have him do the one finger
to see if he was bluffin'.

508
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,224
'Cause worst comes to worst,

509
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,649
he can still play the fiddle
with four fingers, I'll bet ya.

510
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,775
Or the banjo.

511
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,316
We don't want any of that.

512
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,880
We just want
nothing to do with him no more.

513
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,906
You don't. This gom does.

514
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,033
I am a gom, is right.

515
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,160
-You're not a gom!

516
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,787
Jeez.

517
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,748
This is a depressing house.

518
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,417
Would you prefer your own, so?

519
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,252
I've heard it's a barrel
of fecking laughs.

520
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,713
Well, touché.

521
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,340
Too what?

522
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,134
Ché. Touché. It's from the French.

523
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,358
And how is it, Siobhán,
that you was never married?

524
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,698
It's none of your fecking business
how I was never fecking married.

525
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:46,908
How isn't it?

526
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,993
How isn't it?

527
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,870
Was you never wild?

528
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,499
Wild? Was I never wild?

529
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,353
I don't know
what you're talkin' about, Dominic.

530
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,587
Wild, how? Angry?

531
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,422
'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,
I can tell ya!

532
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,966
Not angry. Wild.

533
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,717
You just keep sayin' wild, Dominic!

534
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,719
- Wild!
- My brother told you, didn't he?

535
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,514
That you'd be out in the road
if you started talking stupid to me?

536
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,765
He said creepy, not stupid.

537
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,017
Well, you've failed on both counts,
haven't ya?

538
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,102
I have.

539
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,624
I'm off to bed and he's not stayin' here
another night, Pádraic.

540
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,110
I don't care how depressed you are.
I'd rather have the donkey in.

541
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,825
Foiled again.

542
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,369
But "faint heart" and all that.

543
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,087
Here.

544
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,300
Ye two, ye'll be all right.

545
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,094
Will we be?

546
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,163
Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I've the milk outside for ya.

547
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,956
So, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, I think.

548
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,109
Nobody has a lick of news for us
from your side of the island, Pádraic.

549
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,545
Are you going to be the same as them?

550
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,781
I am, Mrs. O'Riordan, I'm afraid.
And I'm in a bit of a rush, so...

551
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,950
Eileen Coughlan had no news.

552
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,453
Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

553
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,039
It was a poor old week for news.
But then it is, sometimes.

554
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,376
ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

555
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,627
Did he not?

556
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,504
That man never talks.

557
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,172
- Eh, he talks sometimes.
- Up himself.

558
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,068
Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

559
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,385
As I was sayin'.

560
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,099
Ladies.

561
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,183
Oh, it's Peadar.

562
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,477
Peadar always has a rake of news.

563
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,729
- What news have you, Peadar?
- News, is it?

564
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,941
Fella killed himself, over Rosmuck way.

565
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,859
Walked into a lake for himself.

566
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,487
Twenty-nine and nothing wrong with him,
the fool.

567
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,114
God love us!

568
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,199
No, not "God love us." Fool!

569
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,575
Another fella,

570
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,160
Protestant, of course,

571
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,454
stabbed his missus in Letterkenny.

572
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,914
Six times he stabbed her.

573
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,792
Good God! And did she die, Peadar?

574
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,419
She did die, aye.

575
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,504
It wasn't with a spoon
he was stabbin' her.

576
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,089
That's a lot of news.

577
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,384
This man has no news, don't ya not?
No-Newsy!

578
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,971
- Stukes never have news.
- Stukes!

579
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,389
Funny.

580
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,183
There was a bit of news
I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

581
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,769
Dominic Kearney's father
beat Dominic senseless

582
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,146
with a kettle Saturday,

583
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,149
and is staying with me
and me sister, Dominic is.

584
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,875
So, at least his father'll
take a bit of a break

585
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,900
from his beatin' of him.

586
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,319
And him, a policeman.

587
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,196
Isn't that news?

588
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,408
Ar, that Dominic's
an awful little bollocks.

589
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,576
That's no news.

590
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,078
Still, he was in a bad way
when I came upon him.

591
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,289
I'd beat him with a kettle meself
if I wasn't old.

592
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,874
It's news is all I'm sayin'.

593
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,085
That's no news. That's shite news.

594
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,004
Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan,
thanks for the...

595
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,339
I'll see ya when I see ya.

596
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,922
And you can tell
that skitter of a son of mine

597
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,186
he'd better be home by teatime,

598
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,700
or it's over to batter
the both of ye I'll be,

599
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,452
and your dreary fecking sister, too!

600
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,339
Oh, hello there, Colm.

601
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,008
Will I see you at Jonjo's tonight
for that pint you owe me?

602
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,384
I owe you no pin...

603
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,345
You will, Peadar.

604
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,763
Good man yourself.

605
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,836
Whoa, stand.

606
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,546
Stand.

607
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,688
What's that, Jenny?

608
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,525
Will we go to the pub for ourselves?

609
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,778
We will. Come on.

610
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,339
One drink you're havin', lady,
then it's off home with ya.

611
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,009
I've a shirt that wants ironing
for the morning.

612
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,761
Okay, Daddy.

613
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,682
Aye. Off to the mainland in the morning
I'm headin'.

614
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,684
That's why I need the clean shirt, like.

615
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,789
"And why are you off to the mainland
in the mornin', Peadar?"

616
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,274
Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.
I'll tell ya why.

617
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,153
They've asked for extra manpower
for a couple of the executions

618
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,488
in case there's
any kind of a to-do, like.

619
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,991
Six bob and a free lunch
they're payin' me.

620
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,659
And sure I'd have gone for nothin'.

621
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,996
I've always wanted to see an execution,
haven't you?

622
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,914
Although, I'd have preferred a hanging.

623
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,541
Who are they executin'?

624
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,669
The Free State lads are executin'
a couple of the IRA lads.

625
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,756
Or is it the other way around?

626
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,384
I find it hard to follow these days.

627
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,363
Wasn't it so much easier
when we was all on the same side,

628
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,431
and it was just the English
we was killin'?

629
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,725
I think it was. I preferred it.

630
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,352
But you don't care who's executin' who?

631
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,772
For six bob and a free lunch,
I don't care!

632
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,774
They could be executin' you.

633
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,276
Why don't you come with me?

634
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,737
You could write
a miserable feckin' song about it.

635
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,325
Nah, I'm only messin'.

636
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,810
Who are them?

637
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,270
Music students, I think,
from Lisdoonvarna.

638
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,284
Another whiskey, anyways, Jonjo.

639
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,955
Jeez, you're goin' at it
at a fair old lick tonight, Pádraic.

640
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,290
Yeah? What's it to ya?

641
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,614
Pádraic, don't now...

642
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,870
Go get Siobhán, Dominic, would ya?

643
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,625
What are you after, gobshite?

644
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,169
Another beatin', is it?

645
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,588
You, copper,
I'm allowed to chat to you, aren't I?

646
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,715
It's just tubbyguts
I'm not allowed to talk to.

647
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,958
Actually, no, I'd rather
you didn't talk to me neither.

648
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,469
Oh, well, anyways,

649
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,055
do you want to know what the three things
that I hate the most

650
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,390
- on Inisherin is?
- Not really.

651
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:37,850
One,

652
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,810
policemen.

653
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,770
Two,

654
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,272
pudgy fiddle players.

655
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,816
And three...

656
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,690
Wait, I had some funny thing
for three. What was it?

657
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,447
Uh, I'll start again. One, um,

658
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,948
policemen.

659
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,325
Two...

660
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,077
Pudgy fiddle players.

661
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,871
Pudgy fiddle players.

662
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,497
And shite, what was three?

663
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,901
Go on back to your own gang now, Pádraic.
I'm serious, now.

664
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,210
Serious, are ya?

665
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,089
And talkin' to me, are ya?

666
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,176
Siobhán!

667
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,157
Pádraic's out of his brains on whiskey,
and Colm's there.

668
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,641
You'd better come.

669
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,317
You, Colm Doherty,
do you know what you used to be?

670
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,319
No, Pádraic, what did I used to be?

671
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,528
Nice!

672
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,822
You used to be nice!

673
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,491
Didn't he not?

674
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,494
And now, do you know what you are?

675
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:39,995
Not nice.

676
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,080
Ah, well,

677
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,125
I suppose niceness doesn't last then,
does it, Pádraic?

678
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,670
But will I tell ya something
that does last?

679
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,547
What? And don't say
somethin' stupid like music.

680
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,591
- Music lasts.
- Knew it!

681
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,552
And paintings last. And poetry lasts.

682
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,554
-So does niceness.

683
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,618
Do you know who we remember

684
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,103
for how nice they was in the 17th century?

685
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,480
- Who?
- Absolutely no one.

686
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,316
Yet we all remember the music of the time.

687
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,735
Everyone, to a man, knows Mozart's name.

688
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,988
Well, I don't, so there goes that theory.

689
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,616
And anyway, we're talkin' about niceness.

690
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,576
Not whatsisname.

691
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,997
My mammy, she was nice.

692
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,207
I remember her.

693
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,544
And my daddy, he was nice. I remember him.

694
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,130
And my sister, she's nice.

695
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,842
I'll remember her.
Forever I'll remember her.

696
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,303
- And who else will?
- "Who else will" what?

697
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,722
Remember Siobhán and your niceness?

698
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,640
No one will.

699
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,309
In 50 years' time,

700
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,561
no one will remember any of us.

701
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,232
Yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago...

702
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,401
"Yet," he says, like he's English.

703
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,695
Come home, Pádraic.

704
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,115
I don't give a feck about Mozart,

705
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,159
or Borvoven,

706
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,078
or any of them funny name feckers.

707
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,289
I'm Pádraic Súilleabháin.

708
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,625
And I'm nice.

709
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,461
Come home.

710
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,589
So you'd rather be friends
with this fella, would ya?

711
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,049
A fella who

712
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,051
beats his own son
black and blue every night

713
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,414
that he's not fiddling with him.

714
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,556
I never told him that, Daddy.
He's... He's just drunk now.

715
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,892
You used to be nice.

716
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,936
Or did you never used to be?

717
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:31,982
Oh, God.

718
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,945
Maybe you never used to be.

719
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,383
I'll have a word with him, Colm.
You don't need to do anything drastic.

720
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,218
He won't be botherin' you no more.

721
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,594
That's a shame.

722
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,555
That's the most interesting
he's ever been.

723
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,015
I think I like him again now.

724
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:12,189
It was the 18th century, anyway. Mozart.

725
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,358
Not the 17th.

726
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,063
Siobhán Súilleabháin! Well, well.

727
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,898
I only came in for rashers,
Mrs. O'Riordan.

728
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,292
I've no time to talk, I'm afraid.

729
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,693
Letter came for ya.

730
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,489
Fell open, did it?

731
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,991
Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

732
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,874
A job offer, is it?

733
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,800
A job offer from a library
on the mainland, is it?

734
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,597
Just the rashers, please, Mrs. O'Riordan.
About ten of them.

735
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,732
You never tell me anything!

736
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,986
Well, it'd crucify him, your leaving!

737
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,613
Hey, no one's leaving!

738
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,296
Listen, I didn't come down to chat.

739
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,259
I just came down to say
that all that last night

740
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,758
was just the whiskey talkin', Colm.

741
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,926
All what last night?

742
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,636
All whatever it was I was sayin'.

743
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,262
What were you sayin'?

744
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,182
Uh... Yeah. I can't remember much of it,

745
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,309
but I remember
the gist of it wasn't the best.

746
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,645
You always know, don't ya?

747
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,859
Well, anyways,
I just wanted to say I was sorry.

748
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,069
Will we leave it at that?

749
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,739
Why can't you just
leave me alone, Pádraic?

750
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,866
Huh?

751
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,410
I've already told ya, haven't I?

752
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,995
Yeah, I know. I was just...

753
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,081
I mean, why can't you just leave me alone?

754
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,178
- What are ya doing?
- I don't know.

755
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,014
For fuck's sake, like.

756
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,857
How... How's the new tune?

757
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,818
What?

758
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,418
Ar, for God's sake, Pádraic.

759
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,794
How many more times?

760
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,298
I am not putting me donkey outside
when I am sad, okay?

761
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,300
Well, stringy bits of shite
I had to pick up

762
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,593
yesterday when ya let her in!

763
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,803
There was no stringy bits
in that donkey's shite.

764
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,139
There was bits of straw,
if there was anything.

765
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,016
Maybe it was straw, so.

766
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,061
I'll get us our porridge.

767
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,498
Was I awful last night?

768
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,046
No, you was lovely.

769
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,423
Well, I know I wasn't lovely
now, Siobhán.

770
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,009
You were lovely. About me, anyways.

771
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,345
Of course I was lovely about you.

772
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,722
What else is there to be about ya?

773
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,123
What was that? A bird?

774
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,125
What was what?

775
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,876
The bang at the door.

776
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,461
A bird?

777
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,546
- Aye.
- No.

778
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,257
What was it, so?

779
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,675
- The bang at the door?
- Aye!

780
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,385
-What was the bang at the door?

781
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,053
It was, uh...

782
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,596
hard to lie...

783
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,598
it was, uh...

784
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,852
a finger.

785
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,565
A what?

786
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:47,983
Finger.

787
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,529
Jesus, Siobhán!
You'll frighten the little fella!

788
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,654
Throw it out, Pádraic!

789
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,858
I'm not throwing his finger out!
It'll get dirt on it!

790
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,072
Where... Where'd you put it?

791
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,039
Shoebox.

792
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,667
Oh, my. Oh, God.

793
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:06,752
Well,

794
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,171
he's serious, then.

795
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,142
Do we have to have it in here
while we're eating?

796
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,293
Once I finish me porridge,
I'll bring it back to him.

797
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,465
Are you feckin' stupid?

798
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:38,593
I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

799
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,797
No, I'm not feckin' stupid.
We've had this discussion.

800
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,765
You've got to leave him
alone now, Pádraic. For good!

801
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,767
Do you think?

802
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:48,228
Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

803
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,064
He's cut his feckin' finger off,
and thrown it at ya!

804
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,191
Come on! It wasn't at me.

805
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,903
Well, what are we going to do?

806
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,489
We can't keep a man's finger.

807
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,559
Jesus, Colm!

808
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,061
Did it hurt?

809
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:33,398
Hurt awful to begin with.
Thought I was going to faint.

810
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,612
It's funny, feels fine now,
in all the excitement.

811
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,032
Would you like a cup of tea?

812
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,243
I won't, Colm. I only came up
to give you your finger back.

813
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:46,995
Oh, yeah?

814
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,581
Thanks.

815
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,418
Cleared up quite nice, actually.

816
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,128
And you wouldn't have thought it would.

817
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,465
What do you need from him, Colm?

818
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,050
To end all this?

819
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,763
Silence, Siobhán.

820
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,057
Just silence.

821
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:12,604
One more silent man on Inisherin, good-oh!

822
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,230
Silence it is, so.

823
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,443
This isn't about Inisherin.

824
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,905
It's about one boring man
leaving another man alone, that's all.

825
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,742
"One boring man"!
You're all fecking boring!

826
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,536
With your piddling grievances
over nothin'!

827
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,456
You're all fecking boring!

828
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,918
I'll see he doesn't talk to you no more.

829
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,002
Do.

830
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,298
Else it'll be all four of them
the next time, not just the one.

831
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,884
You're not serious.

832
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,555
Well, that won't help your fecking music.

833
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,349
Aye.

834
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,476
We're gettin' somewhere now.

835
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,565
I think you might be ill, Colm.

836
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,112
Do worry sometimes
I'm just entertaining meself

837
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,572
while I stave off the inevitable.

838
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,701
Don't you?

839
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,746
No, I don't.

840
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,625
Yeah, you do.

841
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,640
Declan!

842
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:41,896
Howdo!

843
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,815
Howdo!

844
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,066
Do you want a ride?

845
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,986
I will so.

846
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,279
Thanks, fella!

847
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,249
Oh, no, you're not that student fella
from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

848
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,209
I am. I'm Declan.

849
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,253
Why?

850
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,772
They told me at the post office
to try to find

851
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,090
that student fella, Declan,
from Lisdoonvarna.

852
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,842
Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

853
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,260
From your mammy.

854
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,512
My mammy is no longer with us.

855
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,639
Not your mammy, sorry.

856
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,808
Did I say your mammy?
Your auntie. Yeah, your auntie.

857
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,310
It's about your daddy.

858
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,603
What about Daddy?

859
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,856
Uh, bread van crashed into him.

860
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,733
- The bread van?
- Yeah.

861
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,536
They said you'd best hurry home to him,
lest he should die all alone.

862
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,737
Die?

863
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,364
Or get worse, all alone.

864
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,743
This is impossible.

865
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,369
It's not impossible.

866
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,763
Bread vans crash into people all the time.

867
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,788
I know!

868
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,708
That's how me mammy died.

869
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,549
If it's the same fecking bread van,
I'll kill them.

870
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,150
Thanks.

871
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,446
What were you talking
to the boat fella for?

872
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,907
For none of your fecking
business, I think it was.

873
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,117
Of course, it's me business.
Aren't I the law?

874
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,619
Fecking knob.

875
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,120
Huh?

876
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,890
Well, you can tell
that whiny brother of yours

877
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,208
I'll be around soon
for that battering I owe him.

878
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,376
A battering?

879
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,504
That'd be good, actually.
It might take him out of himself.

880
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:30,630
Huh?

881
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,258
You're an awful strange lady.

882
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,551
No wonder no one likes ya.

883
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:04,706
Oh.

884
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,749
Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

885
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:11,129
A death shall come to Inisherin
afore the month is out.

886
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,922
A death, huh?

887
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,967
Maybe even two deaths.

888
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,052
Well, that'd be sad.

889
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,806
We shall pray to the Lord

890
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:25,476
'tis neither you, nor poor Siobhán,
will be either of them.

891
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,396
Well, is that a nice thing to be sayin'?

892
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,606
I wasn't trying to be nice.

893
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,860
I was trying to be accurate.

894
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,615
Fecking hell.

895
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,816
What's the matter?

896
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:16,903
Nothing.

897
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,747
Me daddy say he's gonna kill you Sunday

898
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,066
for spilling the beans
about that fiddling with me.

899
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,572
"Kill me," kill me, or, you know,

900
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,408
"beat me up a bit," kill me?

901
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,869
"Beat you up a bit," kill ya, I think.

902
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,913
Although he did kill a man once.

903
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,336
I'm sorry for that
spilling the beans on ya, Dominic.

904
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,131
I was out of order that night.

905
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,574
You was funny apart from that bit.

906
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,220
That's why I don't understand
why that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

907
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,948
He seemed fine when you were slagging him.

908
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,557
He did not.

909
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,724
Did he?

910
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:32,353
"That's the most interesting
Pádraic's ever been," he said.

911
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,022
"I think I like him again now."

912
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,696
Aye.

913
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:47,326
Maybe this whole thing has just been about
gettin' you to try a new tack,

914
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,203
start standin' up for yourself a bit.

915
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,289
Do you think?

916
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,583
Yeah, and be less of a, you know,

917
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,251
whiny little dull-arse.

918
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,398
Well, I have been less
of a whiny little dull-arse, actually.

919
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,715
Have ya, yeah?

920
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,717
Just yesterday,
there was this musician fella

921
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,635
that Colm was getting along great with.

922
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:05,720
And what did I do?

923
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,523
I went and sent him packing
from the island.

924
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,515
Did ya? How?

925
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,368
I told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy,

926
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,811
and he'd have to be rushing
home to him, lest he die.

927
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:18,816
Oh...

928
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,944
That sounds like the meanest thing
I've ever heard.

929
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,073
Huh?

930
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:30,745
Well, aye, it was a bit mean, but...

931
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,390
he'll be fine once he gets home

932
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,534
and he finds his daddy
hasn't been hit by a bread van.

933
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,713
I used to think
you were the nicest of them.

934
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,150
Turns out you're just the same as them.

935
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,885
I am the nicest of them.

936
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:49,931
Ar, Dominic, now!

937
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,061
Well, maybe I'm not a happy lad, so!

938
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,689
Maybe this is the new me!

939
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,943
Aye.

940
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,029
Maybe this is the new me.

941
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,606
-Howdo!

942
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,525
Jesus Christ, Dominic!

943
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,402
Would you ever stop creeping up on people?

944
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,696
You almost gave me a fecking heart attack!

945
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:47,863
I wasn't creeping up on ya.

946
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,031
I was sidling up on ya.

947
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,200
Between you and that ghoul, Jesus!

948
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,661
I always call her a ghoul, too,
because she is a ghoul.

949
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,747
Jeez, we have a lot in common, don't we?
Me and you.

950
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,083
Calling old people ghouls and that.

951
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,880
It's a great old lake, isn't it?

952
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,304
I'm glad I caught you, actually.

953
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,724
Because there was somethin'
I was wantin' to ask ya, actually.

954
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,768
And discovering how much
we have in common,

955
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,021
well, it just makes me
want to ask you even more.

956
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:21,957
We don't have anything in common.

957
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,566
Uh, don't skip ahead.

958
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,861
But yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

959
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,406
Somethin' along the lines of...

960
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,533
Should've planned this, really.

961
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,661
Well, yeah,
what I was wantin' to ask you was...

962
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,419
You probably wouldn't ever want to,
I don't know,

963
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,714
to fall in love with a boy like me,
would ya?

964
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,802
Oh, Dominic, I don't think so, love.

965
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,514
No, yeah, no. Uh, I was thinking no.

966
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,187
Not even in the future, like?
Like when I'm your age?

967
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:11,155
Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

968
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,408
Just thought I'd ask
on the off chance, you know,

969
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,744
-like, "faint heart" and that.

970
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,251
Well, there goes that dream.

971
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,425
Well,

972
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,846
I best go over there and do whatever
that thing over there I was gonna do was.

973
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,015
Mm-hmm.

974
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,785
<i>I walked from Mallow Town</i>

975
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,621
<i>To Aghadoe, Aghadoe</i>

976
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:04,834
<i>I took his head
from the jail gate to Aghadoe</i>

977
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,460
Come on, Sammy, you have to dance too.

978
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,966
<i>Like an Irish king he sleeps in Aghadoe</i>

979
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:15,553
How are you, fatty?

980
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,971
Dancing with your dog, is it?

981
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,783
Well, who else is gonna dance with ya?
Your poor dog has no say in the matter.

982
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,143
And if you're too rude
to be offering me a seat,

983
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,353
I'll be taking one of me own accord!

984
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,607
Now, how's that for an old hello?

985
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,651
Have you gone fecking mental?

986
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,695
Have I gone fecking mental?

987
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:36,198
No, I haven't gone
fecking mental, actually.

988
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,284
Not only have I not gone fecking mental,

989
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,953
but I have ten fingers
to prove I've not gone fecking mental.

990
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,432
How many fingers do you have
to prove you've not gone fecking mental?

991
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,457
Nine fingers.

992
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,126
And nine fingers is the epitome of mental.

993
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,837
That's right. The epitome!

994
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,216
Heh. There'll be none of that!
I didn't come here for licks!

995
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,444
I came here for the opposite of licks.

996
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,570
What's the opposite of licks?

997
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:57,636
Huh?

998
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,972
What did you come here for?

999
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,891
I didn't come here for anythin', did I?

1000
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,578
I just came to kick your door in
and give you a slagging.

1001
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,246
Well, you've done that, so you can go now.

1002
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,521
Haven't finished yet, have I?

1003
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,525
Well, I finished with your door.
I haven't finished with your slagging.

1004
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,153
We were doin' so well, Pádraic.

1005
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,071
I wasn't doing so well.

1006
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:19,950
I was doing terrible.

1007
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,369
All right, I was doin' so well.

1008
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,538
Yeah, well, it can't all be
you, you, you, can it?

1009
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:25,915
Yes, it can.

1010
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,209
- There's two of us in this.
- No, there isn't.

1011
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,627
It takes two to tango.

1012
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,295
I don't want to tango.

1013
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,506
Well, you danced with your dog.

1014
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:48,437
Talkin' of tangos,
how's your new tune comin' along?

1015
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,065
I just finished it, actually.

1016
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,691
Just this morning.

1017
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,778
No, Colm, that's great, like!

1018
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,113
That's why I was dancing with me dog.

1019
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,825
I don't usually dance with me dog.

1020
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,993
There's no harm
dancin' with your dog.

1021
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:07,373
I'd dance with me donkey if I knew how.
And she did.

1022
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,960
Is it good?

1023
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,253
Your tune?

1024
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,175
Mm, what's it called?

1025
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:22,096
"The Banshees of Inisherin,"
I was thinking.

1026
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,475
But there are no banshees on Inisherin.

1027
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,395
I know, I just like the double S-H sounds.

1028
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:31,856
Aye.

1029
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,067
There's plenty of double S-H on Inisherin.

1030
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,151
Yeah.

1031
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,404
Maybe there are banshees, too.

1032
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,367
I just don't think that they scream
to portend death anymore.

1033
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:48,122
I think they just sit back, amused,
and observe.

1034
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,082
Portend?

1035
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,126
Yeah.

1036
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,965
I keep having thoughts
about playing it for you at your funeral.

1037
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,509
But that wouldn't be fair on either of us,
would it?

1038
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,775
Well, that's great
that you finished your tune, Colm.

1039
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,777
That's more than great.

1040
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,654
That's...

1041
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,282
really great.

1042
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:38,005
So, do you want
to meet me down the pub, Colm?

1043
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,799
We could celebrate your tune, like.

1044
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:48,933
Only if you'd like, like.

1045
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,020
But I could run up ahead. Order them in.

1046
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,816
Why don't you do that, Pádraic?

1047
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,403
Why don't I run up...

1048
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,615
and order them?

1049
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,576
Well, I will so.

1050
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,957
Jeez, that went well!
And maybe on the way,

1051
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,459
I can find that student friend
of yours, that Declan fella!

1052
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,312
I told him his daddy was dying,
so he'd feck off home

1053
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,463
and leave us alone,
but there's no need now!

1054
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,590
Sure he could join us.

1055
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,621
What are you sitting over there for
when I'm over here?

1056
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,897
Just thought I'd have a sit for meself,
you know.

1057
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,400
Wait for me friend.

1058
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,527
Are you fecking joking me?

1059
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,237
Your four-fingered friend?

1060
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,680
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

1061
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,657
No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

1062
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,285
He just needed
a bit of tough love was all.

1063
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,404
Siobhán, do you want a sherry?

1064
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:09,031
- No.
- Righty-ho.

1065
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,076
What are you doin'?

1066
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,660
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1067
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,329
Nothing. Just drinkin'.

1068
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,039
- Not waitin'?
- Not waitin'.

1069
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,975
Well, he is waitin', Siobhán.
He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

1070
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,000
I amn't waitin'.

1071
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,418
He just told me he was waitin'.

1072
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:22,920
Telltale!

1073
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:29,426
Come home with me, Pádraic.
I've somethin' to discuss with ya.

1074
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,637
You've somethin' to discuss with me?

1075
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,681
That sounds, uh...

1076
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,809
I don't want to discuss somethin'.

1077
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,895
Well, ya have to, 'cause I'm leavin'.

1078
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,397
Leavin'?

1079
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,652
Like leavin'?

1080
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,446
Like...

1081
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,324
not staying?

1082
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:57,830
Yeah.

1083
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:42,833
But what about me?

1084
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,209
What about you?

1085
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,627
I'll have no friends at all left!

1086
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,588
- You'll have Dominic.
- Ah here!

1087
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,673
And he's gone off me now, too.

1088
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,450
What kind of a place is it
when the village gom goes off ya?

1089
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,761
And who's gonna do the cookin'?

1090
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,615
Oh, that's your first question, isn't it?
"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

1091
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,117
Well, it wasn't me first question, was it?

1092
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,226
"But what about me?"
was me first question.

1093
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,679
Pádraic.

1094
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:40,724
Pádraic!

1095
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:47,481
Now?
But you can't be leavin' now!

1096
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,691
I can be leavin' now.

1097
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,277
I can't be waitin' round
for any more of this madness!

1098
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,655
What the hell did you say to him, Pádraic?

1099
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:55,948
Nothin' really.

1100
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,743
Well, I'd sort of had a chat
with Dominic earlier.

1101
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,579
And a new sort of,

1102
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:06,041
you know, standin' up for meself
sort of tack we thought I should try.

1103
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,209
God!

1104
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,087
It was all going fine
until he chopped off all his fingers.

1105
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,847
Me books wouldn't fit.

1106
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,684
Would you look after them for me?

1107
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,061
Ar, don't go, Siobhán.

1108
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,980
They're all I have, really.

1109
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,608
Apart from the obvious.

1110
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,743
You'll be back soon, won't you, Siobhán?

1111
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,621
Oh, Pádraic!

1112
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,957
Don't say, "Oh, Pádraic."

1113
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,376
Say yes.

1114
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:07,782
Ah, Jenny.

1115
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:48,740
Oh.

1116
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,616
I don't want to talk.

1117
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,410
Don't go killin' his dog now.

1118
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:58,638
And don't be puttin' things in me head

1119
01:30:58,662 --> 01:30:59,930
that weren't there
in the first feckin' place,

1120
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,456
you feckin' nutbag!

1121
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,167
"Nutbag!"

1122
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,180
What would I ever hurt you for?

1123
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,934
You're the only nice thing about him.

1124
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,008
How are you, Pádraic? You're lookin' well.

1125
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,142
That's lovely, lads.

1126
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,149
I don't need your apologies, all right?

1127
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,067
It's a relief to me.

1128
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,278
So, let's just call it quits

1129
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:58,156
and agree to go our separate ways,
for good this time.

1130
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,912
Your fat fingers
killed me little donkey today.

1131
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,498
So, no, we won't call it quits.

1132
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,082
We'll call it the start.

1133
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,794
- You're jokin' me.
- Yeah, no.

1134
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:12,462
I'm not jokin' ya.

1135
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,756
So tomorrow, Sunday,

1136
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,841
God's day, around 2:00,

1137
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,653
I'm going to call up to your house
and I'm gonna set fire to it,

1138
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,763
and hopefully you'll still be inside it.

1139
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,808
But I won't be checkin' either way.

1140
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,479
Just be sure and leave your dog outside.

1141
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,690
I've nothing against that gom.

1142
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,779
Or you can do
whatever's in your power to stop me.

1143
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,243
To our graves we're taking this.

1144
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,621
To one of our graves, anyways.

1145
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:49,707
Here.

1146
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,085
I've a bone to pick with you, dreary.

1147
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,979
Is that little gobshite of mine
at your place again?

1148
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:56,005
Leave him, Peadar. His donkey's just died.

1149
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:57,674
Did he?

1150
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,342
The little miniature fella?

1151
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,845
Well, Jesus, boys,
I'll tell ya this much...

1152
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:15,108
Two o'clock.

1153
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:18,463
I killed a miniature donkey.

1154
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,177
It was by accident...

1155
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,015
but I do feel bad about it.

1156
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:35,897
Do you think God gives a damn
about miniature donkeys, Colm?

1157
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,192
I fear he doesn't.

1158
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,572
And I fear
that's where it's all gone wrong.

1159
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:48,201
Is that it?

1160
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:50,453
Is what it?

1161
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,039
Aren't you forgetting a couple of things?

1162
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,668
No, I think I've covered it.

1163
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:00,964
Wouldn't you say
punching a policeman is a sin?

1164
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,007
Ah here.

1165
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,885
If punching a policeman is a sin,

1166
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,972
we may as well just pack up and go home.

1167
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,892
And self-mutilation is a sin.

1168
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:15,186
It's one of the biggest.

1169
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:16,980
Is it?

1170
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,400
Self-mutilation, so you have me there.

1171
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,985
Multiplied by five.

1172
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:29,242
How's the despair?

1173
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,164
It's back a bit.

1174
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:40,128
But you're not gonna do anything about it?

1175
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,759
I'm not gonna do anything about it, no.

1176
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:02,775
<i>Dear Pádraic,</i>

1177
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:07,030
<i>I am safely ensconced in the mainland
and, Pádraic, it's lovely here.</i>

1178
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,533
<i>There's a river running past my window
as I write,</i>

1179
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:13,369
<i>and the people already seem
less bitter and mental.</i>

1180
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,831
<i>I'm not sure why, but I think
it's 'cause a lot of them are from Spain.</i>

1181
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:21,502
<i>Mostly, I wanted to say
there's a spare bed here for you, Pádraic.</i>

1182
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:25,214
<i>And with the war almost over,
I think there'd be work for ya here.</i>

1183
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:28,176
<i>Because there's nothing
for you on Inisherin.</i>

1184
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,678
<i>Nothing but more bleakness and grudges</i>

1185
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:33,514
<i>and loneliness and spite</i>

1186
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,517
<i>and the slow passing of time until death.</i>

1187
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,394
<i>And sure, you can do that anywhere.</i>

1188
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:44,525
<i>So come, Pádraic. Leave there.</i>

1189
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:47,403
<i>Dominic can look after Jenny
and the rest of your animals.</i>

1190
01:37:47,487 --> 01:37:49,614
<i>They could move into the house together.</i>

1191
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,333
Hut!

1192
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:25,149
<i>So come now, Pádraic, please.</i>

1193
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,155
<i>Before it's all too late.</i>

1194
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,077
<i>Dear Siobhán.</i>

1195
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,038
<i>Obviously, I don't know
what "ensconced" is,</i>

1196
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:29,667
<i>but I thank you for the offer
of the free bed and the whatnot.</i>

1197
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,878
<i>But I won't be takin' you up on it,
I'm afraid.</i>

1198
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:37,049
<i>As I told you, me life is on Inisherin.</i>

1199
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,051
<i>Me friends, me animals.</i>

1200
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:44,140
<i>Even now as I write,</i>

1201
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,225
<i>little donkey Jenny
is looking at me, saying,</i>

1202
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:48,978
<i>"Please don't go, Pádraic. We'd miss ya."</i>

1203
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,731
<i>And nuzzling me, the gilly-gooly.</i>

1204
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:53,858
<i>Get off, Jenny.</i>

1205
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,362
MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

1206
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:09,999
<i>In other news,</i>

1207
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:12,043
<i>in sadder news, actually,</i>

1208
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:15,254
<i>I won't be able to ask Dominic
anything, I'm afraid.</i>

1209
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,967
<i>Because they found him
in the lake this morning.</i>

1210
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,308
<i>I suppose he must've slipped and fell in.</i>

1211
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:38,319
<i>So, there'd be no one
to take care of the animals, anyway.</i>

1212
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,552
<i>No other news, really.</i>

1213
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,772
<i>Except that I love you, Siobhán.</i>

1214
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,108
<i>And I miss ya.</i>

1215
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,821
<i>And I hope I'll see ya again someday.</i>

1216
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,200
<i>If you ever come back home.</i>

1217
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,247
Come back home, Siobhán.

1218
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:39,255
<i>Yours sincerely, your loving brother...</i>

1219
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:42,925
<i>Pádraic Súilleabháin.</i>

1220
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,979
Suppose me house makes us quits.

1221
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:23,442
If you'd stayed in your house,
that would've made us quits.

1222
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:26,487
But you didn't, did ya,
so it doesn't, does it?

1223
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:40,376
I'm sorry about your donkey, Pádraic.

1224
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,419
Honestly, I am.

1225
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:46,799
I don't fucking care.

1226
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:05,568
Haven't heard any rifle fire
from the mainland in a day or two.

1227
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,710
I think they're coming to the end of it.

1228
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,116
I'm sure they'll be at it again
soon enough, aren't you?

1229
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:16,161
Some things there's no movin' on from.

1230
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,125
And I think that's a good thing.

1231
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:44,898
Pádraic.

1232
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:53,616
Thanks for lookin' after me dog
for me, anyways.

1233
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:00,956
Any time.

1234
01:47:56,330 --> 01:48:00,830
