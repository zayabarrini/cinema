1
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,607
Excuse me. I was looking
for the <i>Weekly Volcano</i> office.

2
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,274
I wish to see
Mr. Dashwood.

3
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,915
A friend of mine desired me
to offer a story by her.

4
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,017
She... She wrote it.

5
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,118
She'd be glad to write more
if this suits.

6
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,921
Not a first attempt,
I take it.

7
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,724
No, sir. She has sold
to <i>Olympic</i> and Scandal,

8
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,793
and she got a prize for a tale
at the <i>Blarneystone Banner.</i>

9
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,595
A prize?

10
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,163
Yes.

11
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,433
Sit.

12
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,678
We'll take this.

13
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,514
Oh, you will?

14
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,717
With alterations.
It's too long.

15
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,053
Um, but you've cut...

16
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,222
I took care to have
a few of my sinners repent.

17
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,224
The country just
went through a war.

18
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,696
People want to be amused,
not preached at.

19
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:16,731
Morals don't sell nowadays.

20
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,834
Perhaps mention that
to your friend.

21
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,272
What compensation...?
How do you...?

22
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,709
We pay 25 to 30
for things of this sort.

23
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,044
- We'll pay 20 for that.
- Oh.

24
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,516
You can have it.
Make the edits.

25
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,425
Should I tell my...
uh, my friend

26
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,029
you'll take another
if she had one better than this?

27
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,765
We'll look at it. Tell her
to make it short and spicy.

28
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,633
And if the main character's
a girl,

29
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,402
make sure she's married
by the end.

30
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,072
- Or dead. Either way.
- Excuse me?

31
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:01,374
What name would she like
put to the story?

32
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:05,213
Oh, uh, yes.
None at all, if you please.

33
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,048
Just as she likes,
of course.

34
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,349
Oh, well, heh...

35
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,954
Good morning, sir. Good day.

36
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,555
Yes!

37
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,195
My Beth would
like you very much.

38
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,663
I'd like a room for two.

39
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,965
Perfect. That's 4.50 a week.

40
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,667
And that's a good price.

41
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,368
Isn't that a little expensive?

42
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,838
This is a
boardinghouse, not a charity.

43
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,940
I need the rent on time.

44
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,848
Good
afternoon, Miss March.

45
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,917
Oh, good afternoon.

46
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,525
You're on fire.

47
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,960
Thank you.

48
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,231
You're on fire!

49
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:37,138
- Thank you.
- I have the same habit. You see?

50
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,974
Oh.

51
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,943
Kitty and Minnie are waiting.

52
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,179
- Oh, my students need me.
- Always working.

53
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:48,850
Money is the end and aim
of my mercenary existence.

54
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,118
No one gets
ink stains like yours

55
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:52,954
just out of
a desire for money.

56
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,454
My sister Amy's in Paris,

57
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,824
and until she marries
someone obscenely wealthy,

58
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,026
it's up to me
to keep the family afloat.

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,427
Goodbye.

60
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,052
The Decadents have
ruined Paris, if you ask me.

61
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,622
These French women
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

62
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,957
- Amy!
- Hm?

63
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,292
I said, these French women

64
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,693
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

65
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,363
Oh, yes. Very true,
Aunt March.

66
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,932
Oh, don't humor me, girl.

67
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,370
What do they write,
your troublemaking family?

68
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,907
Mother doesn't say
anything about Beth.

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,175
I feel I should go back.
They all say, "Stay."

70
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,511
You can do nothing
if you go back.

71
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,513
The girl is sick,
not lonely.

72
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:55,182
And you shouldn't go home
until you and Fred Vaughn

73
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,450
are properly engaged.

74
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,120
Yes, and until I've completed

75
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,088
all of my painting lessons,
of course.

76
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,759
Oh, yes, yes.

77
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,228
Of course.

78
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,871
- Stop the carriage! Laurie!
- What are you doing?

79
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,073
- Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!
- Amy!

80
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,975
- Laurie! Ha, ha!
- Amy!

81
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,643
Amy!

82
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,978
- How are you?
- Oh!

83
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,478
My, you've grown so much.

84
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,315
You wrote you'd meet me
at the hotel.

85
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,750
- I couldn't find you.
- You didn't look hard enough.

86
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,953
I didn't recognize you.
You're so beautiful.

87
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,486
- Oh, stop it.
- I thought you liked that?

88
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,323
- Where's your grandfather?
- In Germany.

89
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,825
He's still traveling.
I'm on my own now, relaxing.

90
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,928
- Flirting, gambling and drinking.
- Yes. Don't tell your mother.

91
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,764
Are you chasing
some young girl across Europe?

92
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,333
No.

93
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,171
I couldn't believe Jo
turned you down. I'm so sorry.

94
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,441
Don't be, Amy. I... I'm not.

95
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:56,410
Amy!

96
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,745
Amy March!

97
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,680
- Come back this instant!
- Oh, Aunt March.

98
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,149
Come. Come on.

99
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,151
- Aren't you looking grand?
- Get him off me!

100
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,886
We need to be somewhere.
Off you go!

101
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,521
Come to
the New Year's Eve party.

102
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,457
Everyone will be there,
including Fred.

103
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,659
Pick me up at the hotel
at 8, The Chavain.

104
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,996
Oh! And, Laurie,
dress for festivities!

105
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,630
Top hats and silks!

106
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,766
I will.
I'll wear my best silk.

107
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,307
It's Laurie.

108
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,210
I know.

109
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,388
Twenty yards of blue silk,
as well as pink.

110
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,023
Someone will be by for it later.

111
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,358
Oh, Meg, that would
look so lovely on you.

112
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:46,227
I know the dressmaker
to send you to.

113
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,195
You'll be the prettiest wife
in Concord.

114
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,698
Oh, I... John needs
a new coat for winter,

115
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,433
and Daisy and Demi
need new clothes.

116
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,435
And his wife
needs a new dress.

117
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,937
I can't. It's...
I just can't.

118
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,340
He'll be so pleased
with how you look,

119
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,409
he'll forget
all about the expense.

120
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,413
I don't suppose it's too much
of an extravagance.

121
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,481
Will 20 yards do?

122
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,151
- Yes.
- Very good.

123
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,991
Fifty dollars?
What was I thinking?

124
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,167
Mommy!

125
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,071
Oh, my loves.

126
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,941
Go play.

127
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,739
Beth!

128
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,242
Beth?

129
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,377
There lies your way,
due west.

130
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,279
Then westward ho!

131
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,783
Grace and good disposition
attend Your Ladyship.

132
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,486
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

133
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:23,124
Stay, I prithee,
tell me what thou thinkest of me.

134
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,160
That you do think
you are not what you are.

135
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,429
If I think so,
I think the same of you.

136
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:31,098
Then think you
right, I am not what I am.

137
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,694
Like, a big one.
Like, a big one... Like that.

138
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,367
Excuse me?

139
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,170
I only speak English.
I'm sorry, what?

140
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,704
- What did you say?
- Come dance!

141
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,339
Oh!

142
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,595
I know exactly
who I wanna dance with.

143
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,761
I'll take this off.

144
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,430
Who will you dance with, Jo?

145
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,998
You know I never dance.

146
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,200
Why can't we all go?
It's not fair.

147
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,070
- Wear your regular shoes.
- These fit last winter.

148
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,272
My nose will simply
not look refined.

149
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,574
I like your nose.

150
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,375
- Now, Jo.
- Don't touch me.

151
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,511
I feel ridiculous.
I don't wanna look it.

152
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,112
You could be pretty
if you tried.

153
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,114
- Don't want to. Won't.
- I don't want to go,

154
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,782
but I wish
I could hear the music.

155
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,685
I'll keep it in my head
and sing it for you.

156
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,420
- Ought they to smoke like that?
- It's the dampness drying.

157
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,557
What a queer smell,
like burnt feathers.

158
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,425
Now I'll take this off and
you'll see a perfect ringlet.

159
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,731
Why is her hair off?

160
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,132
- Meg, I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?!

161
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,468
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,003
You shouldn't have
asked me.

163
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,672
Marmee!

164
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,674
I can't go, I'm spoiled!

165
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,441
My hair!

166
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,777
Don't stare, don't put
your hands behind your back,

167
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,846
don't say "Columbus,"
don't say "capital."

168
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,347
- All right.
- Don't shake hands.

169
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:01,583
Don't whistle.

170
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:04,084
Meg March,
you look so pretty.

171
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,954
Well...

172
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,822
Meg.

173
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,674
Thank you.

174
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,909
No, it's so early. No.

175
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,578
Fine.

176
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,195
Ooh! Sorry. I didn't know
anyone was here.

177
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,831
- Not at all. Stay if you like.
- I won't disturb you?

178
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,833
No. I don't know
many people here.

179
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,835
I felt rather strange
at first, you know?

180
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,805
Mm, so do I. Heh.

181
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,906
Miss March, isn't it?

182
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,875
Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not
Miss March. I'm only Jo.

183
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,011
And I'm not Mr. Laurence,
I'm only Laurie.

184
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:10,918
Don't you dance?

185
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,886
I don't know
how you do things here yet.

186
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,723
I've spent most
of my life in Europe.

187
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,524
Europe! Oh, that's capital!

188
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,893
Shouldn't use
words like that.

189
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,896
- Says who?
- Oh, Meg.

190
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,965
She's my older sister. Here.

191
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,002
Hm...

192
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,739
Oh, that's her. See?

193
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:35,710
- The girl in the violet dress.
- Mm. It's very pretty.

194
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,412
She reminds me to be good

195
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,516
so Father will be proud of me
when he returns.

196
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,016
Where is he?

197
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,252
He volunteered
for the Union Army.

198
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,454
And I wanted
to go fight with him.

199
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,091
I can't get over my
disappointment in being a girl.

200
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,293
Jo, would you like
to dance with me?

201
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,062
I can't because...

202
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,531
Because of what?

203
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,402
- You won't tell?
- Never.

204
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,072
I scorched my dress.
See? There.

205
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,576
And Meg told me to keep still
so no one would see it.

206
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,813
You can laugh if you want to.
It's funny, I know.

207
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,948
I have an idea
of how we can manage.

208
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,097
Oh!

209
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,777
- What?
- My foot.

210
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,211
- I've hurt my ankle.
- Oh!

211
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,445
<i>How am I gonna get home?</i>

212
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,848
I don't see what you can do,

213
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,816
except get a carriage
or stay all night.

214
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,017
- Carriages are too expensive.
- Let me take you.

215
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,787
- It's right next door.
- No, thank you.

216
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,690
- We cannot accept.
- You must take mine, please?

217
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,358
No. It's so early.
You can't mean to leave yet.

218
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,494
I always leave early.
I do, truly.

219
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,597
What choice
do you have, hm?

220
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,467
Goodness gracious.
What have you done?

221
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,537
She's lame and can't walk.
She's hobbling.

222
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,439
Clear that chair.
You're supposed to be asleep.

223
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,642
Help your sister,
then back to bed.

224
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,777
Make room.
Meg is a wounded soldier.

225
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,547
- I sprained my ankle.
- Oh, Meg, you'll kill yourself

226
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,916
for fashion
one of these days.

227
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,352
Here. Hannah, we need ice!

228
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,722
- Oh, come in. Come in.
- Is it all right?

229
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,322
Apologies for the chaos.

230
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,391
I enjoy baking
in the middle of the night.

231
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,728
Don't mind the clutter,
Mr. Laurence. We don't.

232
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:07,929
Laurie, please.

233
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,430
- Can I call you Teddy?
- Yes.

234
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,667
You must be part
of their theatricals.

235
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,736
- They could use an extra player.
- I'm Amy.

236
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,203
- Hello.
- You'll have to fight Jo

237
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,272
for the male roles
or play a girl.

238
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,173
- Have a scone.
- Yes, thank you.

239
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,544
And ice.
Laurie, how are your ankles?

240
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,979
- Do you need ice?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

241
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,549
Just call me "mother" or Marmee.
Everyone does.

242
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,718
You wore those pink shoes?

243
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:33,086
Ah, It's cold.

244
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,189
- But they look so good, okay?
- Do you want more ice?

245
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,058
Feels like being
a fine young lady

246
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,028
to come home from a party
in a carriage

247
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,162
and have maids wait on me. Ah!

248
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,400
<i>For the writer in the attic.</i>

249
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,303
Because you enjoyed
the play so much tonight,

250
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,139
I wanted you to have this.

251
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:04,177
It will help you study character
and paint it with your pen.

252
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,346
<i>I would love to read
what you're writing,</i>

253
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,315
<i>if you'll trust me.</i>

254
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,954
<i>I promise honesty and whatever
intelligence I can muster.</i>

255
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,123
Yours, Friedrich.

256
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,379
- Fred, would you like a glass?
- I will. Thank you.

257
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,388
Would you excuse me
a second?

258
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,732
Laurie.

259
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,033
Amy.

260
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,668
I waited an hour for you.

261
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,705
I feel caught.

262
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:06,908
Hm.

263
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,210
Amy, please. Amy.

264
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,180
Do you want to know
what I think of you?

265
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,848
- What do you think?
- I despise you.

266
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,783
- Why do you despise me?
- With every chance

267
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,417
of being good,
happy and useful,

268
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,587
you are lazy, faulty
and miserable.

269
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,421
- Ooh, interesting.
- Well, selfish people

270
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,356
- like to talk about themselves.
- Selfish?

271
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,026
- Yes, very selfish.
- Oh.

272
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,360
With your money, talent,
beauty, and health...

273
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,763
Oh, you think
I'm beautiful.

274
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,598
Yes, you like that,
you old vanity.

275
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:34,401
With good things to enjoy, you
find nothing to do but dawdle.

276
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:37,872
I'll be good for you, St. Amy.
I'll be good.

277
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,874
Aren't you ashamed
of a hand like that?

278
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,709
- I'm not.
- Looks like it's never done

279
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:44,444
a day of work in its life,
and that ring is ridiculous.

280
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,013
Jo gave me this ring.

281
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,052
I feel sorry for you.
I really do.

282
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,720
I just wish
you'd bear it better.

283
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:54,287
You don't have to feel sorry.

284
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,724
- You'll feel the same one day.
- No, I'd be respected

285
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,426
if I couldn't be loved.

286
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,731
What have you done lately,
oh, great artiste?

287
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:07,300
Perhaps you're fantasizing about
spending Fred Vaughn's fortune.

288
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,904
Fred Vaughn,
ladies and gentlemen!

289
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,781
Fred, I...

290
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:21,082
I'm so sorry.

291
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,900
Those are just stories,
of course.

292
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,939
But I'm working on a novel.

293
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,842
And your novel...

294
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,309
it will be like this?

295
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,513
Yes. So far, anyway.

296
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:54,248
With plots like this?

297
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,654
- Duels and killing and...
- It sells, so...

298
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,522
Why don't you sign
your real name?

299
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,390
Oh, my mother
wouldn't like it.

300
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,360
It's too gory for her.

301
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,363
I wanna help with the money
I make and not worry her.

302
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,238
Mm.

303
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,244
You know, I...
I don't like them.

304
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,248
Honestly, uh...

305
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,985
I mean, I... I think
that they're not good.

306
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,391
Uh, but...

307
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:40,728
They're...

308
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,497
They're published
in the papers,

309
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:47,735
and people have always said
that I'm talented.

310
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,071
Oh, I think you're talented.

311
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,974
Which is why I'm being so...
So blunt.

312
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:58,579
Well, I can't afford
to starve on praise.

313
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,715
Are you upset?

314
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,650
Of course I'm upset.
You just...

315
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,384
You told me
you didn't like my work.

316
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:06,053
Jo, I thought
you wanted honesty.

317
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:09,190
I... Yes, I do.

318
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:13,060
Has no one ever talked
to you like this before?

319
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,029
Yes, I've been rejected
plenty of times.

320
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,965
Do you have anyone
to take you seriously, Jo,

321
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,601
- to talk about your work?
- And who made you high priest

322
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,236
of what's good
and what's bad?

323
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,072
- No one, and I'm not...
- Then why are you acting like it?

324
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,308
Your reaction indicates
there is some truth...

325
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,443
My reaction indicates
that you are a pompous blowhard.

326
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,113
Shakespeare wrote
for the masses.

327
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,481
Shakespeare was the greatest
poet who ever lived

328
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,884
because he smuggled his poetry
in popular works.

329
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,120
- I'm no Shakespeare.
- Thank goodness.

330
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:40,588
We already have him.

331
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,056
If you know so much about it,

332
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,858
why don't you just
do it yourself?

333
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,260
Because I'm not a writer.

334
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:49,263
- I don't have the gifts you have.
- No, you don't.

335
00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:52,033
You will always be a critic
and never an author.

336
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,902
And the world will forget
that you ever even lived.

337
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:57,437
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- But...

338
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:58,706
I... But I...

339
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,944
No one will forget Jo March.

340
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,649
I can believe it.

341
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:09,817
Listen.

342
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,152
We are not friends.

343
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,688
You are not my friend.

344
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,823
And I don't want your opinion

345
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,625
because I don't
like you very much.

346
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,927
So just don't talk
to me anymore. Thank you.

347
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,616
Oh, Josephine,
this came for you.

348
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,151
Oh, thank you.

349
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,762
Beth.

350
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:39,774
Merry Christmas, world.

351
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,414
Merry Christmas!

352
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,150
- Merry Christmas.
- Give me another orange.

353
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:51,719
- Jo, we've been up for hours.
- What have you been writing?

354
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,921
Oh, I got carried away
with our revenge play

355
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,022
last night, <i>Poison.</i>

356
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,891
No, no poison.
It's Christmas.

357
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,859
Won't be Christmas
without any presents.

358
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:01,095
- It's dreadful being poor.
- It's not fair.

359
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,997
How come some girls
have pretty things

360
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,265
and others have nothing?

361
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,167
We have Father, Mother
and each other.

362
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,836
We haven't got Father as
long as this war drags on.

363
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,905
I wish I had money
and plenty of servants,

364
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,106
so I never had to work.

365
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,141
Or you could be
a proper actress.

366
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,609
They aren't all fallen women.

367
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,878
- I can't be an actress.
- I have lots of wishes,

368
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:20,214
but my favorite one
is to be an artist in Paris

369
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:23,084
and do fine pictures and be
the best painter in the world.

370
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,453
That's what you want, Jo,
to be a famous writer?

371
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,556
Yes, but it sounds crass
when she says it.

372
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:28,923
- Why be ashamed?
- I'm not.

373
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:30,157
My wish is to have us

374
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,159
all be together
with Father and Mother.

375
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,495
- That's what I want.
- Beth is perfect.

376
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:36,565
- Amy.
- What about your music, huh?

377
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,833
I do that for us. I don't need
anyone else to hear it.

378
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:40,434
You must not limit yourself.

379
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,636
Mother proposed not having
presents this year

380
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,573
because men are suffering
in the Army.

381
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,207
We can't do much,
but we can make

382
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,109
our little sacrifices
and do it gladly.

383
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,911
Don't play mother
just because she's not home.

384
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,714
- Jo, that's so boyish.
- That's why I do it.

385
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:57,251
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- I hate affected little chits.

386
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,887
- Jo!
- My nose! My nose! Ow!

387
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,989
It's already no good!

388
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,324
Jo! Jo!

389
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,059
I know you don't care
what I think,

390
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:07,596
but you don't want your mother
to find you like this, do you?

391
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:08,996
We care what you think.

392
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,998
You're more family
than old Aunt March.

393
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,067
- Don't, Jo.
- Where is Marmee? I'm starving.

394
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,036
Goodness only knows. Some
poor creature came a-begging.

395
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,472
Your ma set straight off
to see what was needed.

396
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,208
I wish she could help others
at a time convenient to us.

397
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,210
Joanna and I
are very hungry.

398
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:25,679
- Dolls don't get hungry.
- I've rewritten the climax.

399
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:28,182
We need to set it to memory.
Amy, get the costumes.

400
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,284
I have made
the most divine crown,

401
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,354
and I painted my old shoes blue,
so she looks like a princess!

402
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,489
The melancholy piece
is pretty good.

403
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:37,224
Wait until
you see this new speech.

404
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:39,561
I don't see how you
write such splendid things.

405
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,563
- You're a regular Shakespeare.
- Not quite.

406
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:44,498
Miss Michelangelo, can you
rehearse the fainting scene?

407
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,667
- You're as stiff as a poker.
- I can't help it.

408
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,637
I never saw anyone faint.
I don't intend

409
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,471
to make myself
all black and blue.

410
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:52,306
If I can fall down easily,
I'll drop.

411
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,842
If I cannot, I shall fall
gracefully into a chair.

412
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,646
And I don't care if Hugo
comes at me with a pistol.

413
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:59,113
- Hannah?
- I'm not acting.

414
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,714
I didn't even say anything.

415
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,184
I knew what you were going
to say. I'm not acting.

416
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:16,163
I need both of you
to kneel right there.

417
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:18,232
- I need you to kneel.
- I don't want to.

418
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,401
This is supposed to be
our special scene.

419
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,537
- No one's gonna be looking at us.
- Smile.

420
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:24,205
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

421
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:25,940
I think Meg should be
the director.

422
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,075
So I think that
she'll need to kneel...

423
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,679
- But it's our scene.
- If you'll kneel and look...

424
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,213
Merry Christmas, girls.

425
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:34,381
- Marmee!
- Oh, merry Christmas!

426
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:38,018
I'm so glad to see you so happy.
How's your play?

427
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:40,955
Jo, you look tired. Were you up
again all night writing?

428
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,291
- Of course.
- Amy, come kiss me. Thank you.

429
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:45,960
Merry Christmas.
How are my girls?

430
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:47,662
- I'm so hungry.
- Look at this.

431
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,397
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't say that, Jo.

432
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,602
What?

433
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,837
What is it?

434
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,840
Not far from here lives
a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel.

435
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:02,776
Her five children are in one bed
to keep from freezing,

436
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,745
and there's nothing to eat.

437
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:06,581
Will you give them
your breakfast

438
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:08,415
as a Christmas present?

439
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:16,524
Is this where you say
that Father would want us to?

440
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:17,958
Yes.

441
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,137
Thank you.

442
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:33,642
And thank you, Mr. Laurence,
for including me.

443
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:34,808
You're welcome.

444
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,617
Perhaps you could tutor
my grandson in manners,

445
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,686
as well as mathematics,
huh?

446
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,762
Oh, girls...

447
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:57,732
Be careful.

448
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,671
Watch yourselves.

449
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,805
Out here with no sleeves.

450
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,989
It is good angels come to us.

451
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:29,129
Hello. I'm back.
And have food and blankets.

452
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:30,565
And sweaters.

453
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,399
And we brought some medicine.

454
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,234
So these are my girls.

455
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:35,402
Say hello.

456
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:37,539
He is not well.

457
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:40,040
Girls, why don't you
unpack the food?

458
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,743
Would you like some?

459
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,314
You want one?

460
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,551
- Yeah, have it all.
- Why don't we get some firewood?

461
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:50,918
It's good, isn't it?

462
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,056
That's nice, huh?

463
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,898
Marmee, we don't need our toes.
I think I've lost one.

464
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,134
Has anyone else
lost their toe?

465
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,805
- That was amazing.
- I can't feel my feet.

466
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:17,010
- Is it fairies?
- Santa Claus.

467
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,581
- It's Aunt March.
- Mr. Laurence sent it.

468
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:21,982
- The Laurence boy's grandfather?
- Yes.

469
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,350
- Why?
- He saw you

470
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,185
giving your
Christmas breakfast away.

471
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,688
He wanted you
to enjoy the day.

472
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:28,556
I thought he was a mean old man.

473
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,724
It's so generous.

474
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:30,924
His grandson, Laurie,

475
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,393
put the idea into his head.

476
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,928
I know he did.
We should make friends with him.

477
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,265
Boys scare me, and that
big old house scares me.

478
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,602
Jenny Snow says
Mr. Laurence disowned his son

479
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,570
after he went off
with an Italian woman.

480
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,304
Now his grandson
is an orphan

481
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:47,241
and spends his time in that
house locked up with his tutor.

482
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,577
He's a very kind man
who lost his little girl

483
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,146
when she was only a child.
Now his son as well.

484
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,981
- His daughter died?
- So sad.

485
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,717
Doesn't Laurie
seem so romantic?

486
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,619
- He's half Italian.
- What do you know?

487
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,219
You've barely spoken
to him. Ow!

488
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,221
I'm not responsible
for this feast,

489
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:02,524
but I have got a surprise.

490
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,426
A letter from Father!

491
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,127
Don't I wish I could go?

492
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,296
Jo, we can't give up
our only brother.

493
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,566
It must be so disagreeable
to sleep in a tent.

494
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:13,802
Jo sits in back,
so we can't see her cry. Ow!

495
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,637
- What if I do?
- Will he be coming home?

496
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,071
He'll stay and work faithfully
as long as he can.

497
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,707
We won't ask
for him to come back

498
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,743
a minute sooner
than he can be spared.

499
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,747
"Give them all
my dear love and a kiss.

500
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,751
"Tell them I think of them
by day, pray for them by night

501
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,921
"and find my best comforts
in their affection at all times.

502
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:36,758
"A year seems a very long time
to wait before I see them.

503
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,827
"But remind them
that while we wait,

504
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,796
"we may all work,
so these hard days...

505
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,431
"need not be wasted.

506
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,267
<i>"I know that they will
be loving children to you.</i>

507
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,370
<i>"Do their duty faithfully.</i>

508
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,373
<i>"Fight their enemies bravely.</i>

509
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,946
<i>And conquer themselves
so beautifully."</i>

510
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,949
<i>The Witch's Curse,</i>
a play by Jo March.

511
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:05,252
Make it sweet
and swift and strong...

512
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,254
<i>"That when I
come back to them..."</i>

513
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,256
Spirit, answer now my song.

514
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:11,759
<i>"...I may be...</i>

515
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,294
<i>fonder and prouder
than ever..."</i>

516
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,765
<i>"of my little women."</i>

517
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,768
Brava!

518
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,841
Excuse me. Excuse me.

519
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,644
Excuse me.
Your stop, ma'am.

520
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:31,813
Oh, thank you.

521
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,848
<i>She's gone? Why?</i>

522
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:36,216
I don't know. She just left.

523
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,085
She didn't say
if she was coming back?

524
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:40,220
We didn't have
a heart-to-heart, professor.

525
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:43,758
Why are you just sitting there?
Please, go, go. Dust something.

526
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,058
And what about the girls?

527
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,995
She was the best teacher
they ever had.

528
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:48,228
I know.

529
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:03,011
<i>It is so hard to go back
to work after such good times.</i>

530
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,679
I wish it was Christmas
every day.

531
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,681
Or New Year's.
Wouldn't that be exciting?

532
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,482
We are a bunch
of ungrateful minxes.

533
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,083
Don't say
such despicable things.

534
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,219
I like strong words
that mean something.

535
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,589
I have to go back,
and I don't have any limes.

536
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:16,824
- Limes?
- Girls are trading pickled limes,

537
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,259
and I'm in debt.
I owe ever so many limes.

538
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,094
- Will this do?
- What'd you do that for?

539
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,063
- Meg, thank you.
- I know what it is

540
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:25,399
to want things
and feel less than other girls.

541
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,569
That and the drawings
will wipe out my debt.

542
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:28,703
- What drawings?
- Nothing.

543
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,237
I'm glad Mother
doesn't make me

544
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,739
go to school
with those girls.

545
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:32,974
Hurry. I'll be late.

546
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,642
Beth, after shopping,
I need you

547
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,744
to work through
the new sums and spelling.

548
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,047
- I'll check it when I get home.
- Oh, fine.

549
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,080
Bye.

550
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,268
Ooh!

551
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,871
- Josephine.
- Yes?

552
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:07,240
- Oh! Josephine.
- Yes? Here.

553
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:10,545
Is there a reason
you stopped reading Belsham?

554
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,814
I'm sorry.
I'll continue.

555
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,117
You mind yourself, deary.
Someday you'll need me

556
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,554
and you'll wish
you had behaved better.

557
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,656
Thank you, Aunt March,
for your employment

558
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,057
and your many kindnesses,

559
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,292
but I intend to make
my own way in the world.

560
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:26,928
Oh, well.

561
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:29,564
No. No one makes
their own way.

562
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:31,131
Not really.

563
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:34,368
Least of all, a woman.
You'll need to marry well.

564
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:37,270
- But you are not married.
- That's because I'm rich.

565
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,607
And I made sure
to keep hold of my money.

566
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,110
Unlike your father.

567
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:45,145
So the only way to be an
unmarried woman is to be rich?

568
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,280
- Yes.
- There are precious few ways

569
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:49,817
- for women to make money.
- That's not true.

570
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,686
You could run a cathouse.

571
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,888
Or go on the stage.

572
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:56,124
Practically the same thing.

573
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,291
Other than that,
you're right.

574
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,494
Precious few ways
for women.

575
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:03,798
- That's why you should heed me.
- So I can get married.

576
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,268
No. So you can live a better
life than your poor mother has.

577
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:13,373
- But Marmee loves her life.
- You don't know what she loves.

578
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:16,276
Your father cared more about
educating freedmen's children

579
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,445
than he did about caring
for his own family.

580
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,981
Yes, but he was right.

581
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:23,350
Well, it's possible
to be right and foolish.

582
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,819
Well, I don't think so.

583
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,287
Well, you're not paid
to think.

584
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:35,596
I know you don't care much
about marriage now.

585
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,266
Can't say I blame you.

586
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:44,172
But I intend to go
to Europe one more time

587
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,441
and I need a companion,

588
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,744
so how would you like to be
the person I take?

589
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,946
I'd like that
more than anything.

590
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,182
All right, then read.

591
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:56,784
And don't sneak around.

592
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,720
I don't like sneaks.

593
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,456
<i>President Lincoln.</i>

594
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,092
No, Father's fighting for him.

595
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,893
My father says
the war is a waste

596
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:07,929
and we should let
them keep their labor.

597
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,329
Susan, it is immoral.

598
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,032
Everyone benefited
from the system,

599
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,332
including you Marches.

600
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,202
Why should only
the South be punished?

601
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,770
Maybe we should
all be punished.

602
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,337
The Marches
love a cause.

603
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,439
Fine. Just do Mr. Davis.

604
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,778
- I don't know if I should.
- I'll wipe out your debt

605
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,114
and give you
five more limes besides.

606
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,416
...your spelling and, moreover,
your reading habit.

607
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:44,899
Miss March.

608
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:48,836
<i>Sit down.</i>

609
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,607
Sit down, Laurie.

610
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,407
Latin is a privilege.

611
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,144
Please,
you have to learn this.

612
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,979
I can't afford
to lose this position.

613
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,347
- Return to the Cicero...
- There's a girl out there.

614
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,017
- No, there is not.
- Yes, Mr. Brooke, there's a girl.

615
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,019
No, there is not.

616
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,126
I'll never get
to go home again.

617
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,662
- Oh, there is a girl.
- That's a girl.

618
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,298
Hello there. Are you hurt?

619
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:21,135
- I'm Amy.
- Hello, Amy. I'm Laurie.

620
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,771
I know. You brought my sister
back after the dance.

621
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:25,940
I would've never
have sprained my ankle.

622
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,810
I have lovely small feet,
the best in the family.

623
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:33,480
But I can never go home again
because I'm in such trouble.

624
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,283
Look.

625
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,819
Mr. Davis hit me.

626
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:44,292
Tell the servants I want this
painting purchased immediately!

627
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,894
- Amy! Are you in here?
- Meg! My hand. Look.

628
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,495
- Jo.
- What richness.

629
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,397
- It hurts so much.
- You ought to be

630
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,899
the happiest boy in the world.

631
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,668
A fellow can't live
on books alone.

632
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,335
- I could. What did you do?
- Nothing.

633
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,470
I did a drawing,
and then Mr. Davis hit me.

634
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,807
Oh, Christopher Columbus,
look at that.

635
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,176
That's my grandfather.
Are you scared of him?

636
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,212
I'm not scared of anyone.
He looks stern,

637
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,147
but my grandfather
was more handsome.

638
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,015
Jo, we do not
compare grandfathers.

639
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,684
You think
he's more handsome, eh?

640
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:13,054
Oh... No, actually,
you are very handsome.

641
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,857
- I didn't mean...
- I knew your mother's father.

642
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,959
You've got his spirit.

643
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:20,127
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

644
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,497
You are not to attend
that school anymore.

645
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:26,499
Good. That man
has always been an idiot.

646
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:29,136
- Jo will teach you.
- Me? I already teach Beth.

647
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,839
- You're a good teacher.
- Yes, women being taught at home

648
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,307
is more proper, I believe.

649
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,375
Only because schools
for women are poor.

650
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,011
Indeed. Quite right.

651
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,646
I wish all the girls
would leave

652
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:40,681
- and he would die.
- You did wrong.

653
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:43,618
- There will be consequences.
- I didn't even do anything.

654
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,553
- I just did a drawing.
- Thank you so much

655
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,922
- for taking care of Amy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

656
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,358
My girls have a way
of getting into mischief.

657
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,959
Well, so do I.

658
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,394
Then you'll run over
and we'll take care of you.

659
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:56,898
Come over whenever you'd like.
Invite Beth as well.

660
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:00,234
- Yes! Beth would adore the piano.
- Is she the quiet one?

661
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,636
Yes, that's our Beth.

662
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,305
Tell that little girl
to use our piano.

663
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:06,107
Jo, borrow whatever book
you'd like.

664
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,042
- Can I come look at paintings?
- Yes.

665
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:10,044
There's also
a lovely greenhouse.

666
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,713
We must go. Girls.

667
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:16,017
- Can you buy this painting?
- I'm going to take this one.

668
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,952
- If that's okay.
- I'll bring it back soon.

669
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,520
Thank you again.

670
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:20,922
Thank you for my hand!

671
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:22,556
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

672
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:28,029
Oh, uh, Miss Meg?

673
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,730
You forgot your glove.

674
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:40,641
Well, back to work.

675
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:41,909
Back to work.

676
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:02,330
Order! Order.
Order. Order!

677
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,800
A new play written
by Miss Jo March

678
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,601
will appear
at the Barnville Theater

679
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,671
in the course of the next
few weeks that will surpass

680
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:14,642
anything ever seen before
on the American stage.

681
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,510
Starring
the greatest actress

682
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:19,447
from here to the Mississippi
River, Miss Meg March.

683
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,516
- Yes. There we go. Very good.
- Excellent. Bravo, bravo.

684
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,253
- Weekly report. Meg good, Jo bad.
- Mm-hm.

685
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:29,590
Beth very good.
And Amy sort of middling.

686
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,759
- Very well done, sirs.
- Excellent.

687
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,928
- Excellent, excellent.
- Bravo.

688
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:35,830
Mr. President and gentlemen,

689
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,866
I wish to propose the admission
of a new member.

690
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,336
One who would be
deeply, deeply grateful

691
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,341
and would add immensely
to the spirit of the club.

692
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:49,010
I propose...

693
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:54,148
Mr. Theodore Laurence!

694
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,683
- Absolutely not.
- No.

695
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,819
- What? Come, now. Let's have him.
- He's a real boy.

696
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:00,254
We don't want any boys.

697
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:01,856
- This is a club for ladies.
- Yes.

698
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,290
- I think we should do it.
- Why?

699
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:05,259
- Even if we're afraid, I say yes.
- Why?

700
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:06,827
- It's Laurie.
- What? No.

701
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:09,263
- It'll change everything.
- All right, I call a vote.

702
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:11,599
- Put your hands up.
- Don't put your hand up.

703
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,267
Put your hand up. It's Laurie.

704
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,535
Fine. Aye.

705
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:16,270
There is no time
like the present...

706
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,341
Ladies, ladies, please, please.

707
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:23,010
This is my stratagem.
I deserve the blame.

708
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:25,546
Jo only gave in to it
after lots of teasing.

709
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,715
Yes. I merely wish to say

710
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:30,918
as a slight token
of my gratitude that I...

711
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:34,355
- Yes, yes.
- Go on.

712
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:36,090
As a means of promoting

713
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:39,060
friendly relations
between adjoining nations.

714
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:42,096
And thus, I propose
this set of keys

715
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:46,901
for a little post office I've
made in the forest by the pond.

716
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,804
Yes, four keys.
They're for you, darling.

717
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:53,908
- Meg, yes, yes. And for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

718
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,977
This is for me. Without further
ado, thank you for your favor.

719
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,946
I will take my seat
as part of the club.

720
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:04,885
- Yes, well. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Bravo, bravo.

721
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,056
Welcome, Laurie.

722
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,805
- Three, four, five.
- You both got five.

723
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,141
- I asked the doctor.
- That's a draw, I think.

724
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,044
- It doesn't make sense.
- I can't believe it.

725
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,445
Hello.

726
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,913
Jo!

727
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,321
Daisy and Demi!
Can I have a hug?

728
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,223
Oh, you've gotten so big.

729
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:45,326
I wish you were here
to teach them.

730
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,727
I know. Well, I'm here now.

731
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,996
- So good to have you home.
- Take this off.

732
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,098
I think the
loneliness got to Beth,

733
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:52,867
though she ain't
said anything.

734
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,506
- Where is Beth?
- She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo.

735
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:01,475
We thought she was better, but
the fever'd weakened her heart.

736
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,845
Take this and find her
the best doctor you can.

737
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,548
You need this
to live in New York.

738
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,649
No, I'm not going back.
I'm using the rest

739
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:10,851
to take her to the sea
and get her strong.

740
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:16,257
When's Amy coming home?

741
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,528
- We didn't want to worry her.
- Does she not know?

742
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,831
Beth insisted
we not tell her

743
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:26,767
because she didn't want
to ruin Amy's trip.

744
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:31,540
Amy has always had a talent

745
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,642
for getting out
of the hard parts of life.

746
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:36,443
Jo, don't be angry
with your sister.

747
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,655
I can't seem to find anything.

748
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,557
Marmee, have you seen my glove?

749
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,525
When did you last see it?

750
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:55,062
Jo! Jo, where are you?

751
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:57,264
- I can't find my other glove.
- Take mine.

752
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:59,501
- We're going to be late.
- Where are you going?

753
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:01,035
You're not invited.

754
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,937
You're going
somewhere with Laurie.

755
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,239
- I know it.
- Yes, we are. Now stop bothering.

756
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,107
- You have the tickets?
- Yes. Hurry.

757
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:10,377
- You're going to the theater.
- Meg, please, can I come?

758
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,413
- Sorry, you weren't invited.
- You can't go.

759
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:14,348
Don't be a baby
and whine about it.

760
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,850
I've been shut up here.
I never get to go anywhere.

761
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:20,454
- Beth has her piano. I'm lonely.
- I can teach you chords.

762
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,923
I don't want chords.
I want to go to the theater.

763
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,560
I think you'd hate to poke in
where you're not wanted.

764
00:45:25,694 --> 00:45:27,828
We already have to deal
with dull Mr. Brooke.

765
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:30,364
- I like him. He's kind.
- But I can pay for myself.

766
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:31,865
You will not come.

767
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,702
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but Jo is right.

768
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:35,269
- No! Please.
- Next time.

769
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:38,038
- Come, Meg. Stop petting her.
- Please, please, please!

770
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:40,407
Ugh, you'll be sorry
for this, Jo March!

771
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:43,410
- Amy!
- You will! You'll regret this!

772
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,916
Stop looking at me like that!

773
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:38,232
Oh, um...

774
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:44,606
- I loved every second of it.
- Ow! Jo!

775
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:48,842
- I thought the actress was... Oh!
- She was very, very good.

776
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:52,446
- Yes, she was really good.
- She was. She was very good.

777
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:09,863
Bye!

778
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,032
Oh, I love the theater.

779
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,569
Meg, you're a million times
better than she was.

780
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:16,403
Although she was
a terrific fainter.

781
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:18,640
I wonder how she managed
to turn so white.

782
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:21,208
That Mr. Brooke,
could he be any more obsequious?

783
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:23,010
I thought he was
very well-mannered.

784
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,547
Hold on. Let me
just get this idea down.

785
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,187
Beth, what's your
favorite eye color?

786
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,489
- Purple.
- Mr. Brooke has blue eyes

787
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,125
and an old soul, which is
more important than money.

788
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:40,127
Has anyone taken my novel?

789
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,162
- No.
- No. Why?

790
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,576
Amy, you've got it.

791
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,243
- No, I haven't.
- That's a lie.

792
00:47:56,377 --> 00:47:59,246
I haven't got it, I don't know
where it is, and I don't care.

793
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,948
- Tell me, or I'll make you!
- Ahh!

794
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:03,183
- I burnt it up!
- Marmee!

795
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:07,421
I burnt your book. I told you
I'd make you pay, and I did!

796
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:10,124
All right, Jo! Jo! Jo!
Please get off her!

797
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:11,793
- Jo. Amy.
- Ahh! Ahh!

798
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,227
- Get her off!
- I hate you!

799
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,771
I'm sorry, Jo.

800
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:25,205
Amy.

801
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:33,914
It's just the only thing
you care about is your writing.

802
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,683
It's not as if
I could've hurt you

803
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:37,351
by ruining one of your dresses,

804
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:39,353
and I really did
want to hurt you.

805
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:45,058
I am the most sorry for it now.
I'm so sorry.

806
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,227
Oh, Jo...

807
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,864
don't let the sun go down
on your anger.

808
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:51,633
Forgive her.

809
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,100
Help each other.

810
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,969
And you begin again tomorrow.

811
00:48:58,071 --> 00:49:00,775
She doesn't deserve
my forgiveness.

812
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:04,612
And I will hate her.
I will hate her forever!

813
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:38,178
Morning. Brisk and brilliant
out. Last day at the river.

814
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:39,446
- Get your ice skates.
- Let's go!

815
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:40,682
Jo, you promised me

816
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:42,483
I could come last time. Jo!

817
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,154
Is she going to be
like this forever?

818
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,357
It was a very hard loss
for her.

819
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:52,694
Is there nothing I can do?

820
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,130
Go after her.
Don't say anything

821
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:59,199
till Jo has got good-natured
with Laurie,

822
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,301
and then just say
some kind thing.

823
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:03,505
I'm sure
she'll be friends again.

824
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:05,907
Jo, wait!

825
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,842
I'm coming!

826
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:10,578
You said
I could come last time!

827
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,082
Jo, Laurie, wait!
I'm coming!

828
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,484
Wait!

829
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:19,854
Jo!

830
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:21,188
Stay near the edge.

831
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,090
- It's not safe in the middle.
- Got it.

832
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:24,358
Jo!

833
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,197
Jo, I'm coming!

834
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,070
Jo!

835
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,173
Jo, let's go!

836
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:42,977
Uh...

837
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:46,648
Jo, wait!

838
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,590
Jo!

839
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:06,901
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

840
00:51:07,035 --> 00:51:10,470
- Help! Help me!
- Amy. It's Amy.

841
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:13,106
- Come on. Come on, Jo.
- Ahh! Jo!

842
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,208
Ahh, Jo!

843
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:19,112
Jo, get a branch.
Get a branch.

844
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:20,648
- Amy.
- Jo!

845
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:22,617
- Amy. Amy.
- Ahh!

846
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,319
Help! I can't breathe!

847
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:29,323
Jo, help me pull. Amy,
grab the branch. Grab it, Amy.

848
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,637
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my sister, my sister.

849
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:49,276
She's asleep.

850
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:54,782
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

851
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:58,385
She'll be fine.

852
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:02,255
The doctor said that he didn't
even think she'd catch cold.

853
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:05,059
What is wrong with me?

854
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,962
I've made so many resolutions,

855
00:52:08,096 --> 00:52:12,132
and I've written sad notes,
and I've cried over my sins...

856
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:16,169
but it just
doesn't seem to help.

857
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:21,843
When I get in a passion,
I get so savage.

858
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:24,478
I could hurt anyone,
and I'd enjoy it.

859
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:27,715
You remind me of myself.

860
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,219
But you're never angry.

861
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,155
I'm angry nearly
every day of my life.

862
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,358
You are?

863
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:41,763
I am not patient by nature.

864
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:45,198
But with nearly
40 years of effort,

865
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,969
I'm learning to not let it
get the better of me.

866
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,107
Well, I'll do the same, then.

867
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,512
I hope you'll do a great deal
better than me.

868
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:04,484
There are some natures
too noble to curb

869
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,954
and too lofty to bend.

870
00:53:27,742 --> 00:53:29,544
Jo.

871
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:32,412
Oh, Beth, my love. Oh!

872
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:37,785
- You didn't need to come.
- Oh, I never should have left.

873
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,521
Do you need anything? Here.

874
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,889
Take some water.

875
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:48,196
It's so good
to see your face.

876
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:51,099
We're going to the sea
to get you strong and well.

877
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,667
- The sea?
- Mm, I want you dancing

878
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,235
by the time
Amy gets back.

879
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:57,270
She's not cutting
her trip short, is she?

880
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,272
- No, no.
- Good.

881
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,843
Is there any news?
What does she say?

882
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:04,078
She writes
that Laurie is there.

883
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:06,214
I'm glad he's with her.

884
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:09,083
He won't respond
to any of my letters.

885
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:11,886
Do you miss him?

886
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,655
I miss everything.

887
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:17,792
I know.

888
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,765
Hurry up!
Meg's gonna be gone for a week.

889
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:26,000
- We're coming!
- Take the other carriage, Laurie.

890
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,335
Spy on Meg. Make sure
she doesn't fall in love.

891
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:29,771
- I will.
- It was nice of Annie

892
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,471
to invite me
to her debutante ball.

893
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:34,742
- Thank you for letting me go.
- Just be who you are.

894
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:38,679
And wear this to the ball.
It was mine when I was your age.

895
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:41,448
I've never understood
saving jewelry until marriage.

896
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,951
You should have something
that's just yours.

897
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,953
Pretty things
should be enjoyed.

898
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:48,222
Yes, pretty things
should be enjoyed.

899
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:50,691
- Can I see it?
- Hannah!

900
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:52,627
I wish I could go
to the debutante ball.

901
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,563
Do you think this is a good
idea, her going away like this?

902
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,131
Girls have to
go into the world

903
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:59,167
and make up
their own minds about things.

904
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,969
- Don't forget about us.
- I won't, Jo. It's only a week.

905
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:03,971
- It's beautiful.
- It's not yours.

906
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:05,438
It would look good on me.

907
00:55:05,573 --> 00:55:07,575
She needs to have
some decent shoes.

908
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,477
Thank you for the carriage,
Mr. Laurence.

909
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,014
- I don't know how to repay you.
- Nonsense, nonsense.

910
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,583
I said hi to the horses.
They're very nice.

911
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:17,118
Although
there is one thing.

912
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,653
It occurred to me today

913
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:21,522
that my daughter's piano
suffers from want of use.

914
00:55:21,656 --> 00:55:23,991
Any of your girls
like to run over

915
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:27,628
and practice on it now and then?
Just to keep it in tune.

916
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:30,164
If they don't care to come,
why, then never mind.

917
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:33,201
Oh, sir,
they do care.

918
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,401
Very, very much.

919
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,038
You're the musical girl, huh?

920
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,707
I love it dearly.
And I'll come

921
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:42,643
if you are quite sure nobody
will hear me and be disturbed.

922
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:44,477
Not a soul, my dear.

923
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:50,017
- Miss you.
- Bye.

924
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:52,153
- Can I borrow your ribbons?
- No.

925
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:54,055
- Bye!
- Be good. Enjoy the ball.

926
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:57,024
- Bye. I'll be back soon.
- Don't go and get married.

927
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:58,192
Don't go fall in love.

928
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,794
- Come back right now.
- I love you.

929
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,829
- Right this second.
- Right this second.

930
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:14,842
Whoa, there.

931
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,583
Oh, ha, thank you.

932
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,209
I'd be so excited about tonight.

933
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:52,580
- Of course.
- Oh, no, I don't actually...

934
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:56,517
What dress will you
wear tonight, Meg?

935
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,252
- I will wear this one.
- That one?

936
00:56:58,386 --> 00:56:59,887
Can't you send home
for another?

937
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,689
- I haven't got another.
- Only the one?

938
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:03,958
- Oh, that's so funny.
- Not at all.

939
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,394
There's no need
in sending home, Daisy.

940
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:08,529
I'm going to
call you Daisy now.

941
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:10,131
I've got a sweet dress
laid away.

942
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,633
You'll wear it to please me,
won't you, Daisy?

943
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:15,703
- Um, if it's all right.
- Of course.

944
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:54,442
Everyone's in love
with you, Daisy.

945
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:57,144
- You have to keep my dress.
- I can't keep your dress.

946
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:58,646
- You have to. Please.
- No.

947
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,081
Everyone loves you in it.

948
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:04,318
Have fun, little Daisy.

949
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:06,921
Laurie. I didn't know
you were going to come.

950
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:08,656
Supposed to be
a surprise.

951
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,625
And what
a lovely surprise it is.

952
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:15,129
- Why are they calling you Daisy?
- It's their pet name for me.

953
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:18,799
Meg is a perfectly
good name.

954
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:24,038
It's just like playing a part
to be Daisy for a little while.

955
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,977
What would Jo say?

956
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:37,518
You wouldn't actually marry
one of these men, would you?

957
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,322
I might.

958
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:43,324
You'll get
a terrible headache tomorrow.

959
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:52,199
- Do you like how I look?
- No, I don't.

960
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,902
Why not?

961
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:56,971
I don't like fuss and feathers.

962
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:00,174
You're the rudest boy
I ever saw.

963
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:34,001
Please forgive me
and come dance.

964
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:37,104
I'm afraid it would be
too disagreeable for you.

965
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:42,309
I don't like your dress, but
I think you are just splendid.

966
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,615
- Really?
- Really.

967
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:54,388
I know it's silly,
but please don't tell Jo.

968
01:00:54,523 --> 01:00:56,056
Let me have my fun tonight.

969
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,326
I'll be desperately good
for the rest of my life.

970
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:31,926
I'm sorry, John.

971
01:01:33,294 --> 01:01:36,565
The silk was
the first real expense.

972
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:43,737
Ahem, $50, while a lot,
is not, I suppose,

973
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:46,407
too much for a dress
with all the notions

974
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,909
that are needed
to finish it these days.

975
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,283
It's not exactly
even a dress yet. It's...

976
01:01:57,552 --> 01:01:59,920
It's just the fabric.

977
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,324
Oh.

978
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,492
I see.

979
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:08,563
I know you're angry,
John.

980
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:10,898
I don't mean to waste money,
but I can't resist

981
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:12,766
when I see Sallie buying
all she wants

982
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,435
and pitying me
because I don't.

983
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:20,274
I try to be contented,
but it is hard.

984
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,077
And I'm tired of being poor.

985
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:28,282
I was afraid of this.

986
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,184
I do my best, Meg.

987
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:31,720
Oh, John.

988
01:02:31,852 --> 01:02:34,955
My dear, kind,
hardworking boy.

989
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:38,792
It was so ungrateful
and wicked.

990
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,128
How could I say it?

991
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:43,964
- Perhaps you meant it.
- No, I didn't.

992
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:46,433
We'll work out a way
to get you your coat as well,

993
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:49,470
and then won't we be grand,
the two of us?

994
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:52,106
I can't afford it,
my dear.

995
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,142
- John.
- I need to go to bed.

996
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:56,578
John.

997
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:02,751
And I really am very sorry
that you've had to do

998
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:04,885
without so many
beautiful things...

999
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:07,087
and that you're married
to someone

1000
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:09,290
who can't give
them to you.

1001
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:21,335
Hello, Amy.

1002
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:23,137
I don't want to see you.

1003
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,906
Amy, don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry for how I behaved.

1004
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,677
- Have you been drinking?
- Why are you being so hard on me?

1005
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:30,978
- It's 4 p.m.
- Someone has to do it.

1006
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:35,849
When do you begin your
great work of art, Raphaella?

1007
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:39,053
- Never.
- "Never"? What? Why?

1008
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:41,121
I'm a failure.

1009
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:42,890
Jo is in New York
being a writer,

1010
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:44,191
and I'm a failure.

1011
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,327
That's quite a statement
to make at 20.

1012
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,062
Rome took all the vanity
out of me,

1013
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:50,464
and Paris made me realize
I'd never be a genius,

1014
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:52,900
so I'm giving up
all my foolish artistic hopes.

1015
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:55,302
Why give up? You have
so much talent and energy.

1016
01:03:55,436 --> 01:03:57,137
Talent isn't genius.

1017
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:59,808
And no amount of energy
can make it so.

1018
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,042
I want to be great
or nothing.

1019
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,679
And I will not be
some commonplace dauber,

1020
01:04:04,813 --> 01:04:07,014
and I don't intend
to try anymore.

1021
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:15,155
What women are allowed into
the club of geniuses anyway?

1022
01:04:18,693 --> 01:04:21,028
- The Brontes?
- Hm.

1023
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:22,863
- That's it?
- Yes, I think so.

1024
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,567
And who always
declares genius?

1025
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,802
- Men, I suppose.
- Cutting down the competition.

1026
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:30,839
That's a very
complicated argument

1027
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:32,072
to make me feel better.

1028
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:33,742
Do you though?
Do you feel better?

1029
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:36,910
I do think,
male or female,

1030
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:39,880
- I am of middling talent.
- "Middling talent"?

1031
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:49,390
Then may I ask
your last portrait be of me?

1032
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:51,291
- All right.
- Now that you've given up

1033
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:54,562
- your foolish artistic hopes...
- Mm-hm?

1034
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:56,397
what are you gonna do
with your life?

1035
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:58,265
Polish up all my other talents

1036
01:04:58,399 --> 01:05:01,268
and become
an ornament to society.

1037
01:05:01,402 --> 01:05:03,805
Mm, that's where Fred Vaughn
comes in, I suppose.

1038
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:07,274
- Don't make fun.
- I said his name.

1039
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:09,943
- You're not engaged, I hope.
- No.

1040
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,350
But you will be if he goes down
properly on one knee?

1041
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:19,453
Most likely, yes.

1042
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:23,123
He's rich.
Richer than you, even.

1043
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:26,026
I understand queens of society
can't get on without money,

1044
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,529
although it does sound odd

1045
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:30,130
from the mouth of one
of your mother's girls.

1046
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:33,934
I've always known
I would marry rich.

1047
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:36,403
- Why should I be ashamed?
- Nothing to be ashamed of,

1048
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:38,205
as long as you love him.

1049
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:40,642
I believe we have
some power over who we love.

1050
01:05:40,775 --> 01:05:43,076
It isn't something
that just happens to a person.

1051
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,580
I think the poets
might disagree.

1052
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:47,481
Well, I'm not a poet.

1053
01:05:47,615 --> 01:05:49,082
I'm just a woman.

1054
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:55,355
And as a woman, there's no way
for me to make my own money.

1055
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:59,828
Not enough to earn a living
or to support my family.

1056
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,995
If I had my own money,
which I don't,

1057
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,832
that money would belong
to my husband

1058
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:05,432
the moment we got married.

1059
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:08,302
If we had children,
they would be his, not mine.

1060
01:06:08,435 --> 01:06:11,405
They would be his property.
So don't sit there and tell me

1061
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:14,676
that marriage isn't an economic
proposition, because it is.

1062
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,179
It may not be for you,
but it most certainly is for me.

1063
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:25,085
Oh, that's Fred.
Can you unbutton me, please?

1064
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,071
Thank you.

1065
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:52,914
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

1066
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:55,148
You look beautiful.

1067
01:06:58,553 --> 01:07:00,020
You are beautiful.

1068
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:11,566
Fred!

1069
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,200
I've missed you.

1070
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,821
This is Fred Vaughn
and his sister, Kate.

1071
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,422
Of course you know
Mr. Brooke.

1072
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,759
This is Meg, Amy,
Beth and Jo.

1073
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:41,261
- So pleased to meet you.
- Oh, how elegant. Heh.

1074
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,865
I'm Amy March.
You remember that name.

1075
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:45,700
I'm gonna find you
one day in London.

1076
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,134
Oh, I certainly will.

1077
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,927
- Oh, that missed a boat.
- That's very kind.

1078
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:17,297
- Well...
- Sorry.

1079
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:19,433
I know
something you don't know.

1080
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:20,702
Tell me this second.

1081
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,537
Has Meg perhaps
mislaid a glove?

1082
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,238
- Mr. Brooke has it!
- Yes.

1083
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:26,574
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

1084
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,642
- Where?
- In his pocket.

1085
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,876
- All this time?
- Yes.

1086
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,745
- Isn't it romantic?
- No, it's horrid.

1087
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:33,213
- I thought you'd be pleased.
- At the idea of anybody

1088
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,115
coming to take Meg away?
No, thank you.

1089
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:37,885
You'll feel better when
somebody comes to take you away.

1090
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:39,286
I'd like to see anyone try.

1091
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,455
I would like to see
someone try as well.

1092
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:50,765
<i>"We could never have
loved the earth so well</i>

1093
01:08:50,898 --> 01:08:53,635
<i>"if we had had
no childhood in it,</i>

1094
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:55,369
<i>"if it were not the earth</i>

1095
01:08:55,503 --> 01:08:58,773
<i>"where the same flowers come up
again every spring</i>

1096
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:02,442
<i>"that we used to gather
with our tiny fingers.</i>

1097
01:09:02,577 --> 01:09:05,647
<i>"What novelty is worth
that sweet monotony</i>

1098
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,683
"where everything is known
and loved

1099
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:10,450
because it is known?"

1100
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:14,388
- How great is that?
- Mm.

1101
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:16,124
I love to listen
to you read, Jo,

1102
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:18,993
but I love it better when you
read stories you've written.

1103
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:21,261
I don't have any new stories.

1104
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,496
Why not?

1105
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:27,769
Haven't written any.

1106
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:30,638
You have a pencil and paper.

1107
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:32,439
Sit here
and write me something.

1108
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,643
I-I can't.

1109
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:40,014
I don't think
I can anymore.

1110
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:41,448
Why?

1111
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:42,950
It's just...

1112
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:46,621
no one even cares
to hear my stories anyway.

1113
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:49,057
Write something for me.

1114
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,160
You are a writer.

1115
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:54,696
Even before anyone knew
or paid you.

1116
01:09:54,829 --> 01:09:56,764
I'm very sick, and you must
do what I say.

1117
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:01,836
Do what Marmee
taught us to do.

1118
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:04,337
Do it for someone else.

1119
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,542
If you're walking to Vermont,

1120
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,712
there's a Mrs. Sewall
in Keene, New Hampshire,

1121
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:12,412
who will give you
room and board.

1122
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:13,915
There you are.

1123
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:16,084
You should go home.
I can take care of this.

1124
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:18,418
No, I need to be here.

1125
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:20,922
I've spent my whole life
ashamed of my country.

1126
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:24,092
No offense meant,
but you should still be ashamed.

1127
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,893
I know. I am.

1128
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:35,503
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am.

1129
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:37,270
Do you have sons in the Army?

1130
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:40,174
Yes, ma'am.
I had four.

1131
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:44,545
But two were killed,
and one is a prisoner.

1132
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:46,246
I'm going to the other,

1133
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:48,683
who's very sick
in a Washington hospital.

1134
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:53,988
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

1135
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:59,426
I'd go myself if I was any use,
but as I ain't, I give my boys.

1136
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:05,666
Sir, I'll get you a blanket...

1137
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:12,173
to keep you warm.

1138
01:11:16,144 --> 01:11:18,913
- Thank you. God bless.
- Bless you, sir.

1139
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:23,483
Mrs. March. Telegram
from Washington, ma'am.

1140
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:27,287
- Is Jo back yet from Aunt March?
- No, I haven't seen her yet.

1141
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,657
- I've got it!
- Want another pair of shoes?

1142
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,794
Thank you. I can't miss
the last train.

1143
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:35,663
- Did you get Father's shirts?
- Yes, I did.

1144
01:11:35,797 --> 01:11:37,464
What can I do to help, Beth?

1145
01:11:37,598 --> 01:11:39,399
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course.

1146
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:42,402
- You find the blanket?
- If I may be of more assistance,

1147
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:44,005
please tell me.

1148
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:45,940
I'll look in on the girls
without fail.

1149
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:47,809
Do we need
more books or cloth?

1150
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:49,944
- Thank you.
- I've always admired your husband.

1151
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:51,411
I pray for a quick recovery.

1152
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:52,947
I found these linens.

1153
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,382
- Hannah, medicine?
- The medicine is packed.

1154
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,484
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I came to offer myself

1155
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:58,853
as escort to your mother.

1156
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:00,988
Mr. Laurence has commissions
in Washington.

1157
01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:04,058
It would give me satisfaction
to be of service to her there.

1158
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:06,194
- Oh!
- Thank you.

1159
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,628
Of course.

1160
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:10,832
All right, while I'm gone,

1161
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:12,033
Hannah is in charge.

1162
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,734
Remember to check
on the Hummels.

1163
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,903
It will be a difficult winter
for everyone.

1164
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:18,371
Will this be enough
for the train?

1165
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:20,174
Twenty-five dollars?

1166
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:22,375
That's not like Aunt March
to be so generous.

1167
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,411
I didn't go to her.
I couldn't bear to.

1168
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:27,148
- Where'd you get the money?
- I only sold what was my own.

1169
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:30,318
- Oh!
- Jo! Your hair!

1170
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,452
- Your one beauty.
- You look like a boy.

1171
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:36,724
Well, it doesn't affect the fate
of the nation, so don't wail.

1172
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:39,227
Oh, I'm so proud
you're my daughter.

1173
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:41,696
I was just crazy
to do something for Father.

1174
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,698
It'll be good
for my vanity anyway.

1175
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:45,365
- That could be nice.
- Never do that.

1176
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:47,635
- Isn't what I wanted for her.
- Oh, Teddy.

1177
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:51,672
Oh, Jo.

1178
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:54,474
My girls,
I love you more than words can say.

1179
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:57,678
Be good to each other.
Pray for Father's recovery.

1180
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:01,082
And I'll be back as soon
as I can. Love you.

1181
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:10,291
Jo.

1182
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:14,528
What is it? Is it Father?

1183
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:15,796
No.

1184
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:18,933
It's my hair.

1185
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:26,439
I would feel the same way.

1186
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:28,276
I know you would.

1187
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,748
<i>Laurie, when are you
going back to your grandfather?</i>

1188
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:35,383
Very soon.

1189
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:39,053
You've said that a dozen times
in the past month.

1190
01:13:39,186 --> 01:13:40,420
Short answers
save trouble.

1191
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,056
Well, he is expecting you,

1192
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:44,225
so why don't you do it?

1193
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:48,229
- Natural depravity, I suppose.
- Natural indolence, you mean.

1194
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:49,897
I'll only plague him if I go,

1195
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:52,133
so I might as well stay
and plague you longer.

1196
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:54,902
You can bear it. In fact,
I think it agrees with you.

1197
01:13:55,036 --> 01:13:56,938
Stop it. Stop.

1198
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:03,844
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at you.

1199
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:06,781
I mean, what do you
intend to do?

1200
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:07,915
- With life?
- Yes.

1201
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:09,617
I've been writing an opera.

1202
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,154
- I would be the central figure.
- That's a waste of time.

1203
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:15,455
What would you have me do?

1204
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:27,802
Go and work for your grandfather
and make something of yourself.

1205
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:30,571
You're not playing fair.

1206
01:14:35,576 --> 01:14:36,677
Here.

1207
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,750
That's... That's very good.

1208
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:45,786
When did you do this one?

1209
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:49,290
It was the day at the beach.

1210
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:52,526
First time I met Fred.

1211
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,761
That's right.

1212
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:00,935
What's he doing?

1213
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:07,908
He's in London on business.
He'll be back in a few weeks.

1214
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:27,194
Don't marry him.

1215
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:30,064
What?

1216
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:34,635
Don't marry him.

1217
01:15:36,505 --> 01:15:37,805
Why?

1218
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:40,041
Why? You know why.

1219
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:46,515
No. No.

1220
01:15:46,647 --> 01:15:48,582
- Yes.
- No. Laurie.

1221
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:50,184
- What?
- You're being mean.

1222
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:52,853
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What? How am I being mean?

1223
01:15:52,987 --> 01:15:56,757
I have been second to Jo
my whole life in everything.

1224
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:59,260
I will not be
the person you settle for

1225
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,262
just because
you cannot have her.

1226
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:03,064
I won't. I won't do it.

1227
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:10,871
I won't. Not when I've spent
my entire life loving you.

1228
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:25,786
I'm making a mold
of my foot for Laurie

1229
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,822
to remind him
I have nice feet.

1230
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:33,060
Mr. Brooke writes that Father is
still very weak but improving.

1231
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:34,929
Mr. Brooke also says
that Mother

1232
01:16:35,062 --> 01:16:36,864
is the best nurse
a man could ask for.

1233
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:39,767
I wish all the letters were
from Mother and not Mr. Brooke.

1234
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,435
I'm grateful for any letters.

1235
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,038
I think the purple is
very fitting for Mr. Laurence.

1236
01:16:44,171 --> 01:16:45,239
- Do you agree, Amy?
- Quite.

1237
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:46,640
The design is very cunning.

1238
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:48,309
I had to thank him
for allowing me

1239
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:50,478
to play the piano
at his house all the time.

1240
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:51,912
I'm going for groceries.

1241
01:16:52,046 --> 01:16:53,914
- Jo, can you get more firewood?
- Mm-hm.

1242
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:56,150
You haven't been to
the Hummels. We should go.

1243
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:58,285
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves.

1244
01:16:58,419 --> 01:16:59,920
I have to finish this story.

1245
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:01,989
- Marmee said...
- Marmee told us to do lots,

1246
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:03,724
but we can't
possibly do them all.

1247
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:06,460
I always go myself. You haven't
kept up with your tasks.

1248
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:09,663
- We do. We work.
- Don't worry. We'll find a time.

1249
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:11,365
- But it's been weeks.
- We'll go soon.

1250
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:13,467
My foot is stuck!
I can't get it out!

1251
01:17:13,602 --> 01:17:16,670
Stop it, Jo! I can't get it out!

1252
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:19,173
I'm going to lose my foot. Ow!

1253
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:21,008
Fine. I'll go myself.

1254
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:27,114
Hello. For Mr. Laurence.

1255
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,693
Oh! Here she comes.

1256
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,506
Beth, look what
they got you!

1257
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,073
A letter from
the old gentleman.

1258
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:55,142
Open the note.

1259
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:56,844
Oh, Beth, just look.

1260
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:04,852
Jo, read the letter.
I cannot.

1261
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:06,820
"Miss Beth March,
I have had

1262
01:18:06,954 --> 01:18:08,822
"many pairs of slippers
in my life,

1263
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:12,226
"but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours.

1264
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:15,129
"And they will always remind me
of the gentle giver.

1265
01:18:15,262 --> 01:18:18,633
"I like to pay my debts and hope
you will accept this gift.

1266
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:22,036
Your grateful friend and
humble servant, James Laurence."

1267
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:25,005
Oh, Beth!
So sweet. "Your humble servant."

1268
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:27,208
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Look how shiny it is!

1269
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:28,677
- Yes.
- It has gold that goes

1270
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:30,811
- all the way around.
- All the way around!

1271
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:34,315
- His handwriting is beautiful.
- It's got a little drawer here.

1272
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:50,331
Sir, I wanted
to thank you for...

1273
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:04,011
You remind me...

1274
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:06,180
so much of my little girl.

1275
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:08,617
Hm?

1276
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:11,285
The piano is yours.

1277
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,722
I should have given it
to you long ago.

1278
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:15,289
Thank you.

1279
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:17,726
My child...

1280
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:20,828
you're burning.

1281
01:19:22,396 --> 01:19:24,566
The Hummels
are very sick.

1282
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:36,110
She's resting.

1283
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:38,345
How is she?
Is there anything I can do?

1284
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:40,080
- What is it?
- Scarlet fever.

1285
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,181
What's scarlet fever?

1286
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:42,449
I visited the Hummels.

1287
01:19:42,584 --> 01:19:43,817
The baby has died.

1288
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,654
Have you all
had it before?

1289
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:48,856
- Meg and I have, but Amy hasn't.
- She'll have to be sent away.

1290
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:50,324
I don't want
to be sent away.

1291
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:52,761
- Aunt March can take her.
- I don't like Aunt March.

1292
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:55,597
- It's for your own good, child.
- Should we send for Mother?

1293
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,164
Now, we shouldn't
worry her.

1294
01:19:57,298 --> 01:19:59,433
I've never wished for money
more than now.

1295
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:03,638
Listen, we'll nurse her
and she'll get better.

1296
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,005
She will.

1297
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:10,878
"The post office in the forest
was a capital little institution

1298
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,479
"and flourished wonderfully,

1299
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:14,415
"for many things
passed through it.

1300
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:18,185
"Poetry and pickles,
music and gingerbread,

1301
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:21,255
invitations, scoldings
and even puppies."

1302
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,694
- It's all about us.
- It is.

1303
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:29,330
- I love it.
- Mm, it's just a little story.

1304
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:31,098
Nothing like
what you usually write.

1305
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:33,467
- Think it's too boring?
- No, it's my favorite one.

1306
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,002
- Really?
- Write me another.

1307
01:20:35,135 --> 01:20:36,538
- Yes, ma'am.
- Keep writing them.

1308
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:39,139
- I will.
- Even when I'm not here.

1309
01:20:43,143 --> 01:20:45,479
- Don't say that. Don't say it.
- I have to tell you.

1310
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:47,649
- No, you don't.
- I've had a very long time

1311
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:49,718
to think about this, and...

1312
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,219
- And I'm not afraid.
- No.

1313
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:53,722
Nope.

1314
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:58,392
It's like the tide going out.

1315
01:20:58,526 --> 01:21:00,795
It goes out slowly,
but it can't be stopped.

1316
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:09,236
I'll stop it.

1317
01:21:23,752 --> 01:21:25,886
I stopped it before.

1318
01:21:42,169 --> 01:21:44,873
You will get better,
Father will get better,

1319
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:47,141
and we'll all be
together soon, all right?

1320
01:21:48,442 --> 01:21:50,210
We...

1321
01:21:50,344 --> 01:21:51,912
We can't stop God's will.

1322
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:54,248
Well, God hasn't met
my will yet.

1323
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:56,718
What Jo wills
shall be done.

1324
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:14,301
Amy.

1325
01:22:14,435 --> 01:22:15,969
Come here.

1326
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,813
- Yes?
- Come, sit.

1327
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,290
If you are very good, one day,
this ring will belong to you.

1328
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:40,994
- Really?
- If you keep being

1329
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,230
a proper young lady,
just see if it doesn't.

1330
01:22:48,235 --> 01:22:50,237
You are your family's
hope now.

1331
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:54,341
Beth is sick,
Jo is a lost cause,

1332
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:56,578
and I hear Meg
has had her head turned

1333
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:58,746
by a penniless tutor, so...

1334
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:03,751
it'll be up to you
to support them all.

1335
01:23:05,553 --> 01:23:08,021
And your indigent parents
in their old age.

1336
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:11,191
So you must marry well.

1337
01:23:12,794 --> 01:23:13,795
Hm?

1338
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,331
Save your family.

1339
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:21,836
All right, that's, uh...

1340
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,973
That's all I wanted
to say to you.

1341
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:28,810
So you can go back
and do your little painting.

1342
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:39,988
- Hello, Aunt March.
- Oh.

1343
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,690
That Laurence boy
was just here.

1344
01:23:42,824 --> 01:23:45,058
- He was?
- What a disappointment

1345
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:46,995
he's turned out to be.

1346
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,830
Must be the Italian in him.

1347
01:23:48,963 --> 01:23:51,031
Uh, when...
When will he be back?

1348
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:53,535
Mm, he's gone.

1349
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:54,869
To London.

1350
01:23:56,638 --> 01:23:57,739
Why?

1351
01:23:59,072 --> 01:24:01,341
What do you need
to discuss with him?

1352
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:19,527
I... I just told Fred Vaughn
I wouldn't marry him.

1353
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:44,451
Meg.

1354
01:24:51,258 --> 01:24:53,393
<i>I'll come home to
help with the children.</i>

1355
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:55,462
I just... I'm so worried
for Beth.

1356
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:58,365
Stay. I asked for leave. I will
take care of the children.

1357
01:24:58,498 --> 01:24:59,701
Oh, John.

1358
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:04,271
One other thing.
Send your fabric

1359
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:06,206
to the dressmaker
as soon as possible.

1360
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,375
- I can't.
- I don't want to hear a word.

1361
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:09,978
I want you to have that dress.

1362
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,412
My old coat will be fine
for the winter.

1363
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:13,748
- John, I...
- It's all settled.

1364
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:16,050
John, I really can't.

1365
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:18,251
I sold the fabric
to Sallie.

1366
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:21,556
You did?

1367
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,994
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

1368
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,195
I couldn't be.

1369
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:31,866
John Brooke is my husband.

1370
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,534
And I am his wife.

1371
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:40,842
Oh!

1372
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:43,778
Hannah! It's all right.
It's all right.

1373
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:49,784
What do we do?

1374
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:53,487
We should send for your mother.

1375
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,237
- Marmee!
- Bless you.

1376
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,372
She's worse. I didn't know
what else to do.

1377
01:26:12,507 --> 01:26:14,474
- Jo, how is she?
- My girls.

1378
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:15,643
My sweet Beth.

1379
01:26:15,777 --> 01:26:17,011
Hannah, make a clear broth.

1380
01:26:17,145 --> 01:26:19,047
Jo, get ice.
We need to cool you.

1381
01:26:20,882 --> 01:26:22,482
Who's with Father?

1382
01:26:22,617 --> 01:26:23,918
John stayed with him.

1383
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:25,853
We need to change
the linens.

1384
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,455
We're going to move you,
sweet girl.

1385
01:26:28,589 --> 01:26:29,791
- Oh, look at her.
- That's it.

1386
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:30,992
Hold on. It's okay.

1387
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:34,796
I know.

1388
01:27:24,712 --> 01:27:26,214
Please fight.

1389
01:27:32,285 --> 01:27:34,488
Don't go quietly.

1390
01:27:34,622 --> 01:27:36,924
Fight.

1391
01:27:37,058 --> 01:27:40,161
Please, please, just fight
to the end and be loud,

1392
01:27:40,293 --> 01:27:42,830
and don't just
quietly go away, Beth.

1393
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,021
Marmee?

1394
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:11,692
Marmee?

1395
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:13,326
Marmee?

1396
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:17,865
Oh! Oh!

1397
01:28:17,999 --> 01:28:19,267
Jo.

1398
01:28:23,104 --> 01:28:24,272
Jo.

1399
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:27,875
Merry Christmas, Beth.

1400
01:28:28,009 --> 01:28:29,777
Popcorn. Make sure
it's in the middle.

1401
01:28:29,911 --> 01:28:31,478
- I know.
- You're doing the sides first.

1402
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:33,413
The sides aren't spaced
for my popcorn.

1403
01:28:33,548 --> 01:28:35,683
I'm making a popcorn garland.

1404
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:38,619
You're wasting decorations,
and they're not dangling right.

1405
01:28:38,753 --> 01:28:41,789
The sides are most important.
If you don't have the sides...

1406
01:28:41,923 --> 01:28:44,525
Here's another Christmas gift
for the March family.

1407
01:28:45,726 --> 01:28:48,461
- Oh, my God! Father!
- Father!

1408
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:49,597
Father!

1409
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,467
My little women.

1410
01:28:56,469 --> 01:28:58,272
How you've grown.

1411
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:01,008
Oh, Beth.

1412
01:29:01,142 --> 01:29:02,944
Merry Christmas, my dear.

1413
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:06,013
- Merry Christmas to each of you.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

1414
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:07,215
Merry Christmas.

1415
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:11,719
Oh, thank God.

1416
01:29:11,853 --> 01:29:14,822
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God for you.

1417
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:17,325
Now I can be angry
with you in person.

1418
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:29,423
I can't believe
today is my wedding day.

1419
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:31,325
Mm.

1420
01:31:31,459 --> 01:31:33,127
What's wrong?

1421
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,362
Nothing.

1422
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,197
Jo.

1423
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,003
We can leave.
We can leave right now.

1424
01:31:42,136 --> 01:31:44,205
I can make money.
I'll sell stories.

1425
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:46,207
I'll do anything.
I'll cook. I'll clean.

1426
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,809
I'll work in a factory.
I can make a life for us.

1427
01:31:48,943 --> 01:31:50,978
- Jo...
- And you should be an actress,

1428
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:53,047
and you should have a life
on the stage.

1429
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,749
Let's just run away together.

1430
01:31:54,882 --> 01:31:57,385
- I want to get married.
- Oh, why?

1431
01:31:57,518 --> 01:31:59,020
Because I love him.

1432
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:02,189
You will be bored of him
in two years,

1433
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:04,225
and we will be
interesting forever.

1434
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:06,560
Just because my dreams
are different than yours

1435
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:08,729
doesn't mean
they're unimportant.

1436
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,501
I want a home.

1437
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:16,037
And a family. And I'm willing
to work and struggle.

1438
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:19,173
But I want to do it
with John.

1439
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:26,213
I just hate
that you're leaving me.

1440
01:32:27,648 --> 01:32:28,716
Don't leave.

1441
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:30,184
Oh, Jo.

1442
01:32:33,087 --> 01:32:34,688
I'm not leaving you.

1443
01:32:34,822 --> 01:32:37,058
And besides...

1444
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:41,662
one day,
it will be your turn.

1445
01:32:48,369 --> 01:32:51,038
I'd rather be a free spinster
and paddle my own canoe.

1446
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:53,607
I would.

1447
01:32:59,713 --> 01:33:01,882
Can't believe childhood is over.

1448
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:06,954
It was going to end
one way or another.

1449
01:33:07,088 --> 01:33:08,722
And what a happy end.

1450
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:13,294
What excessive promises...

1451
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:16,864
giving yourself away
to get the other.

1452
01:33:16,997 --> 01:33:18,466
What a gift.

1453
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:23,871
Always given before is known
the cost or the reward.

1454
01:33:24,004 --> 01:33:25,306
I pronounce you
man and wife.

1455
01:33:26,874 --> 01:33:28,809
You may kiss
the bride.

1456
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:07,616
<i>Oh, don't have to make a fuss.</i>

1457
01:34:07,748 --> 01:34:09,850
You don't need
to see me to the carriage.

1458
01:34:09,984 --> 01:34:11,152
Oh, I'm happy to.

1459
01:34:11,285 --> 01:34:13,988
I hope you will be
happy now...

1460
01:34:14,121 --> 01:34:16,824
that you've ruined your life
the same way your mother did

1461
01:34:16,957 --> 01:34:18,692
by marrying your father.

1462
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:21,162
My dear sister,
you're too kind.

1463
01:34:21,295 --> 01:34:23,130
And thank you
for today's festivities.

1464
01:34:23,264 --> 01:34:24,298
You're most welcome.

1465
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:25,733
Thank you, Aunt March.

1466
01:34:25,866 --> 01:34:29,203
Oh, I don't like
to be, uh, kissed.

1467
01:34:29,336 --> 01:34:31,839
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, you will be sorry

1468
01:34:31,972 --> 01:34:34,975
when you've tried love in a
cottage and found it a failure.

1469
01:34:35,109 --> 01:34:38,012
It can't be worse than
some people find in big houses.

1470
01:34:38,145 --> 01:34:42,249
Oh, I quite understand
your meaning, missus.

1471
01:34:42,383 --> 01:34:43,918
I don't miss a thing.

1472
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:45,853
We know this.

1473
01:34:45,986 --> 01:34:48,956
And you're not
entirely wrong.

1474
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:53,160
I may not always be right,
but I'm never wrong.

1475
01:34:53,294 --> 01:34:56,997
Oh, and here is the only
sane member of the family.

1476
01:34:58,432 --> 01:35:00,167
I really can't take
any more of this.

1477
01:35:00,301 --> 01:35:02,571
- I know.
- You can imagine.

1478
01:35:10,177 --> 01:35:13,314
Marmee! Marmee!
Marmee, Marmee, Marmee!

1479
01:35:13,447 --> 01:35:15,382
- What?
- Aunt March is going to Europe.

1480
01:35:15,517 --> 01:35:18,085
Oh, and she wants me
to go with her! Ha, ha!

1481
01:35:18,219 --> 01:35:20,421
That's wonderful!
Now I know why I spent

1482
01:35:20,555 --> 01:35:22,323
all those boring hours
reading to her.

1483
01:35:22,456 --> 01:35:23,924
No, no,
she wants me to go.

1484
01:35:25,492 --> 01:35:27,361
As her companion.

1485
01:35:27,494 --> 01:35:30,331
- Europe, with you?
- Yes, she wants me

1486
01:35:30,464 --> 01:35:32,601
to work on my art
and my French, of course.

1487
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:35,836
You don't really
like French though, do you?

1488
01:35:38,138 --> 01:35:39,541
That's wonderful, Amy.

1489
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:44,745
- Father! I'm going to Europe!
- Oh, ha, ha!

1490
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,646
Meg married.

1491
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,847
Amy off to Europe.

1492
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:24,686
And now that you're a graduate,
you'll be off on a long holiday.

1493
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:27,988
I'm just not good like Beth,
so I'm angry and restless.

1494
01:36:28,122 --> 01:36:30,759
You don't have
to stay here, Jo.

1495
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:33,294
Why? Should we run off
and join a pirate ship?

1496
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,368
- No. No.
- It's no use, Jo.

1497
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:42,771
- Don't.
- We gotta have it out.

1498
01:36:42,903 --> 01:36:43,937
- No.
- I have loved you

1499
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:45,306
ever since I've known you.

1500
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:46,541
I couldn't help it.

1501
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:48,777
I tried to show
and you wouldn't let me.

1502
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,745
- No.
- But I must make you hear now

1503
01:36:50,878 --> 01:36:53,447
and give me an answer because
I cannot go on like this!

1504
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:55,149
- Please don't.
- I gave up billiards.

1505
01:36:55,282 --> 01:36:57,818
I gave up everything you
didn't like. I'm happy I did.

1506
01:36:57,951 --> 01:37:02,456
It's fine, and I waited, and
I never complained because I...

1507
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,826
You know, I figured
you'd love me, Jo.

1508
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:07,861
And I realize
I'm not half good enough

1509
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:10,197
- and I'm not this great man...
- No! Yes, you are.

1510
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:11,999
You're a great deal
too good for me.

1511
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:15,869
I'm so grateful to you, and I'm
so proud of you, and I just...

1512
01:37:16,003 --> 01:37:19,106
I don't see why I can't
love you as you want me to.

1513
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:21,175
I don't know why.

1514
01:37:21,308 --> 01:37:22,343
You can't?

1515
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:24,646
No. I can't.

1516
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:27,114
I can't change
how I feel, and...

1517
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:31,485
it would be a lie
to say I do when I don't.

1518
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:35,122
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

1519
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:38,025
I'm so sorry,
but I just can't help it.

1520
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:40,361
I can't love anyone else, Jo.
I only love you.

1521
01:37:40,494 --> 01:37:42,262
It would be a disaster
if we married.

1522
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:44,131
- It wouldn't be.
- We'd be miserable.

1523
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:46,166
- I'd be a perfect saint.
- I can't! I can't!

1524
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,669
I've tried
and failed. I can't.

1525
01:37:47,802 --> 01:37:49,069
Why does everyone
expect it?

1526
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:51,038
Your family
and my grandpa expect it.

1527
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:53,207
Why are you saying this?
Say yes.

1528
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:56,511
- Let's be happy together, Jo!
- I can't say yes truly,

1529
01:37:56,644 --> 01:37:58,212
so I'm not going
to say it at all.

1530
01:37:58,345 --> 01:38:00,582
And you'll see that
I'm right eventually,

1531
01:38:00,715 --> 01:38:02,517
and you'll thank me for it.

1532
01:38:06,654 --> 01:38:08,556
I'd rather hang myself
than realize this.

1533
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:10,958
- Teddy.
- I would rather be dead.

1534
01:38:11,091 --> 01:38:12,393
Teddy, don't say that.

1535
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:14,529
Teddy.

1536
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:20,200
Listen, you'll find
some lovely, accomplished girl

1537
01:38:20,334 --> 01:38:22,903
who will love you
and adore you.

1538
01:38:23,036 --> 01:38:24,471
She's gonna make
a fine mistress

1539
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,741
for your fine house,
but I wouldn't.

1540
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:28,242
- Yes, you would, Jo.
- Look at me.

1541
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:30,210
I'm homely, I'm awkward,
and I'm odd.

1542
01:38:30,344 --> 01:38:32,446
- I love you, Jo.
- And you'd be ashamed of me.

1543
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,314
- I love you, Jo.
- And we would quarrel

1544
01:38:34,448 --> 01:38:36,483
because we can't help it
even now.

1545
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:42,256
I'd hate elegant society,
you'd hate my scribbling,

1546
01:38:42,389 --> 01:38:43,625
and we would be unhappy.

1547
01:38:43,758 --> 01:38:45,259
And we'd wish
we hadn't done it,

1548
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:47,461
and everything
will be horrid.

1549
01:38:49,898 --> 01:38:51,231
Is there anything more?

1550
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,803
- No, nothing more.
- All right.

1551
01:38:54,935 --> 01:38:56,571
Except that...

1552
01:39:00,742 --> 01:39:03,210
Teddy, I don't believe
I will ever marry.

1553
01:39:04,512 --> 01:39:06,046
I'm happy as I am,

1554
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,549
and I love my liberty
too well

1555
01:39:07,682 --> 01:39:09,149
to be in any hurry
to give it up.

1556
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:10,484
- I think you're wrong.
- No.

1557
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:11,786
I think you will marry.

1558
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,454
You'll find someone
and love them.

1559
01:39:13,588 --> 01:39:15,055
You will live
and die for them.

1560
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:17,057
That's your way,
and you will.

1561
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:21,596
And I'll watch.

1562
01:39:59,601 --> 01:40:02,369
Oh. I don't want
to disturb your writing.

1563
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,573
I don't do that anymore.

1564
01:40:07,207 --> 01:40:08,743
It didn't save her.

1565
01:40:25,325 --> 01:40:27,529
You're much too
lonely here, Jo.

1566
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:32,000
Wouldn't you like
to go back to New York?

1567
01:40:32,132 --> 01:40:33,668
What about your friend
Friedrich?

1568
01:40:33,801 --> 01:40:35,168
- Wasn't that his name?
- No.

1569
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:39,039
I ruined our friendship
with my temper,

1570
01:40:39,172 --> 01:40:40,575
just as
I ruin everything.

1571
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:42,242
I'm sure I'll never
see him again.

1572
01:40:42,376 --> 01:40:45,379
I doubt that a sincere friend
would be deterred.

1573
01:40:47,515 --> 01:40:49,182
I wish that were true.

1574
01:40:52,554 --> 01:40:55,890
If I was a girl in a book,
this would all be so easy.

1575
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:00,227
Just give up
the world happily.

1576
01:41:04,197 --> 01:41:06,568
Laurie's returning, you know.

1577
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:08,335
- Oh, he is?
- Mm.

1578
01:41:08,468 --> 01:41:11,238
There was a letter from Amy.
She's coming home.

1579
01:41:11,371 --> 01:41:14,207
She's devastated about Beth.

1580
01:41:14,341 --> 01:41:18,412
Aunt March is very ill,
so Laurie will accompany them.

1581
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:23,585
- That's good of him.
- Mm.

1582
01:41:28,556 --> 01:41:30,592
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1583
01:41:30,725 --> 01:41:33,427
I've always been quite
content with my family.

1584
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:37,297
Don't understand it.

1585
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:41,603
Perhaps, um...

1586
01:41:41,736 --> 01:41:44,137
Perhaps I...

1587
01:41:44,271 --> 01:41:47,742
was too quick
in turning him down.

1588
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:48,977
Laurie.

1589
01:41:51,411 --> 01:41:52,647
Do you love him?

1590
01:41:56,450 --> 01:42:00,420
If he asked me again,
I think I would say yes.

1591
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:03,123
Do you think
he'll ask me again?

1592
01:42:03,256 --> 01:42:04,959
But do you love him?

1593
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:08,796
I care more to be loved.

1594
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:12,033
I want to be loved.

1595
01:42:12,165 --> 01:42:14,468
That is not the same
as loving.

1596
01:42:18,973 --> 01:42:20,041
I know.

1597
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:25,647
You know, I just...
I just feel...

1598
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:28,783
I just feel like...

1599
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:30,885
women, they...

1600
01:42:32,987 --> 01:42:35,657
They have minds
and they have souls,

1601
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:37,357
as well as just hearts.

1602
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:39,794
And they've got ambition
and they've got talent,

1603
01:42:39,927 --> 01:42:41,194
as well as just beauty.

1604
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:43,865
And I'm so sick of
people saying

1605
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:46,501
that love is just
all a woman is fit for.

1606
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:48,402
I'm so sick of it.

1607
01:42:49,771 --> 01:42:52,807
But I'm... I'm so lonely.

1608
01:43:35,616 --> 01:43:38,853
Couldn't let you travel alone
with Aunt March being so sick.

1609
01:43:40,555 --> 01:43:42,523
Even if you despise me.

1610
01:43:43,891 --> 01:43:45,893
I don't despise you, Laurie.

1611
01:43:53,201 --> 01:43:55,503
Beth was the best of us.

1612
01:44:08,049 --> 01:44:10,051
I'm not marrying Fred.

1613
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:16,924
- I heard about that.
- And you are under no obligation

1614
01:44:17,058 --> 01:44:19,961
to say anything
or do anything.

1615
01:44:23,231 --> 01:44:25,767
I just didn't love him
as I should.

1616
01:44:27,434 --> 01:44:28,936
We don't need to talk about it.

1617
01:44:29,070 --> 01:44:30,838
We don't need to say anything.

1618
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,856
<i>My dear Teddy,</i>

1619
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:51,826
<i>I miss you more
than I can express.</i>

1620
01:44:51,959 --> 01:44:56,264
<i>I used to think that the
worst fate was to be a wife.</i>

1621
01:44:56,429 --> 01:44:58,465
<i>I was young and stupid.</i>

1622
01:44:59,767 --> 01:45:01,602
<i>But now I have changed.</i>

1623
01:45:01,736 --> 01:45:06,040
<i>The worst fate is to live
my life without you in it.</i>

1624
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:10,244
<i>I was wrong to turn you down
and to run away to New York.</i>

1625
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:17,118
Oysters!

1626
01:45:21,923 --> 01:45:23,691
Lobsters!

1627
01:45:35,636 --> 01:45:37,538
<i>Jo.</i>

1628
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:39,472
<i>Jo. Jo.</i>

1629
01:45:41,075 --> 01:45:42,109
Jo.

1630
01:45:43,177 --> 01:45:44,779
Wake up.

1631
01:45:44,912 --> 01:45:46,147
Wake up.

1632
01:45:49,449 --> 01:45:54,222
- Teddy! Oh, you're back.
- Are you glad to see me, then?

1633
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:55,957
Yes.

1634
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:58,458
Oh, I was worried.

1635
01:45:58,593 --> 01:46:00,294
Mm. Here, come sit.

1636
01:46:06,466 --> 01:46:07,802
How's Amy?
Did she bother you

1637
01:46:07,935 --> 01:46:09,871
all the way from Europe
with her preening?

1638
01:46:10,004 --> 01:46:12,073
Yes, but I like that.

1639
01:46:12,206 --> 01:46:14,842
- Where is she now?
- Your mother has her at Meg's.

1640
01:46:14,976 --> 01:46:16,376
- We stopped on the way.
- Oh.

1641
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:19,213
There was no getting my wife
out of their clutches.

1642
01:46:21,015 --> 01:46:22,382
Your what?

1643
01:46:22,516 --> 01:46:24,685
I've done it now.

1644
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:26,587
It was meant to be
a surprise.

1645
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:28,689
We were engaged
and were hoping to wait,

1646
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:31,893
but that is to say that
now we are man and wife.

1647
01:46:34,829 --> 01:46:36,197
You and Amy?

1648
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,430
Yes.

1649
01:46:48,943 --> 01:46:50,278
Are you in love?

1650
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,478
Yes.

1651
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:57,417
I want to say one thing
and then put it away forever.

1652
01:46:57,551 --> 01:46:59,720
I've always loved you.

1653
01:46:59,854 --> 01:47:02,156
But the love I feel for Amy,
it's different.

1654
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:03,958
And I think...

1655
01:47:04,091 --> 01:47:05,326
you were right about this.

1656
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:07,762
I think we would've killed
each other.

1657
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,132
Yes.

1658
01:47:11,265 --> 01:47:13,167
I think it was meant this way.

1659
01:47:14,902 --> 01:47:16,570
Oh, Teddy.

1660
01:47:16,704 --> 01:47:19,607
You're the only one that ever
calls me that, Jo. "Teddy."

1661
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:22,643
What does Amy call you?

1662
01:47:22,777 --> 01:47:24,745
"My lord."

1663
01:47:24,879 --> 01:47:26,714
That sounds like her.

1664
01:47:30,785 --> 01:47:32,720
Well, you look
deserving of it.

1665
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:37,224
Could we still
be friends, Jo, please?

1666
01:47:41,195 --> 01:47:43,898
Of course, my boy. Always.

1667
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:56,944
She's a painter.

1668
01:47:57,078 --> 01:47:58,512
Are you excited?

1669
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:11,491
- Laurie told you?
- Yes, yes.

1670
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:14,996
Amy, I'm so happy for you.

1671
01:48:15,129 --> 01:48:17,331
This... This was meant to be.

1672
01:48:17,465 --> 01:48:19,367
Oh, I'm so relieved.
Thank you.

1673
01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:21,369
I wanted to write, Jo.
I wanted to write.

1674
01:48:21,502 --> 01:48:24,205
I wanted to explain, but
everything was happening so fast

1675
01:48:24,338 --> 01:48:26,307
and I was worried
you'd be angry at me.

1676
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:29,210
- No. No.
- No, you're not angry at me?

1677
01:48:31,012 --> 01:48:33,347
Life is too short
to be angry at one's sisters.

1678
01:48:39,553 --> 01:48:42,189
- I really miss her.
- I know.

1679
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,361
Thank you.

1680
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,421
Mr. Laurence.

1681
01:49:50,191 --> 01:49:52,259
Jo. Heh.

1682
01:49:53,227 --> 01:49:54,762
Oh, Jo.

1683
01:49:57,098 --> 01:50:00,367
I couldn't bring
myself to, uh...

1684
01:50:04,371 --> 01:50:08,242
The house doesn't seem right
without her, and...

1685
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,313
Couldn't go in,
knowing she wouldn't be there.

1686
01:50:19,787 --> 01:50:22,690
I know I'm not half
so good as my sister,

1687
01:50:22,823 --> 01:50:26,694
but you know I'll be a friend
to lean on, if you'll let me.

1688
01:50:34,068 --> 01:50:35,269
All right.

1689
01:54:00,908 --> 01:54:02,711
<i>Dear Mr. Dashwood,</i>

1690
01:54:02,843 --> 01:54:04,713
enclosed are
the first few chapters

1691
01:54:04,845 --> 01:54:07,214
of a piece
I've only begun working on.

1692
01:54:07,348 --> 01:54:09,350
It could suit as a story
for young people,

1693
01:54:09,483 --> 01:54:11,720
but I think it is
probably quite boring.

1694
01:54:11,852 --> 01:54:13,854
<i>However, I'm sending it to you
just in case</i>

1695
01:54:13,987 --> 01:54:16,156
<i>it has something of value,
though I doubt it.</i>

1696
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:17,559
<i>Jo March.</i>

1697
01:54:36,811 --> 01:54:38,513
I thought she hated me.

1698
01:54:38,646 --> 01:54:41,014
She could still hate you
and leave you the house.

1699
01:54:41,148 --> 01:54:42,883
What about you and John?

1700
01:54:43,016 --> 01:54:46,220
We can't manage a grand house
like this. It's too big.

1701
01:54:54,662 --> 01:54:57,131
I should sell it,
but I'd love to do something

1702
01:54:57,264 --> 01:54:59,734
that would really make
Aunt March turn in her grave.

1703
01:54:59,868 --> 01:55:01,803
- I wouldn't mind that.
- A nice turning.

1704
01:55:01,935 --> 01:55:03,772
Just a rotation,
nothing terrible.

1705
01:55:03,904 --> 01:55:05,406
What will you do?

1706
01:55:07,408 --> 01:55:09,309
I'd like to open a school.

1707
01:55:09,443 --> 01:55:10,779
We never had
a proper school.

1708
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:12,714
Now there are
women's colleges opening.

1709
01:55:12,847 --> 01:55:14,716
There should be a school.
For Daisy.

1710
01:55:14,849 --> 01:55:16,083
And what will Demi do?

1711
01:55:16,216 --> 01:55:19,119
I'll open a school
for boys and girls both.

1712
01:55:19,253 --> 01:55:21,488
What about writing?

1713
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:24,057
- What about it?
- What are you working on?

1714
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:27,261
I started something, but
I don't think it's very good.

1715
01:55:27,394 --> 01:55:30,297
- Everyone likes what you write.
- No, they don't.

1716
01:55:30,431 --> 01:55:31,900
I do.

1717
01:55:32,032 --> 01:55:34,134
Well, it's just
about our little life.

1718
01:55:34,268 --> 01:55:35,537
So?

1719
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:37,971
Well, who will be interested
in a story

1720
01:55:38,105 --> 01:55:39,940
of domestic struggles
and joys?

1721
01:55:40,073 --> 01:55:41,876
It doesn't have
any real importance.

1722
01:55:42,009 --> 01:55:43,444
Maybe it doesn't
seem important

1723
01:55:43,578 --> 01:55:45,312
because people
don't write about them.

1724
01:55:45,446 --> 01:55:50,083
No, writing doesn't confer
importance. It reflects it.

1725
01:55:50,217 --> 01:55:51,985
I don't think so.

1726
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:54,421
Writing them will
make them more important.

1727
01:55:56,056 --> 01:55:58,959
- When did you become so wise?
- Hm-mm. I always have been.

1728
01:55:59,092 --> 01:56:01,061
You were just too busy
noticing my faults.

1729
01:56:01,195 --> 01:56:02,963
Which were never
there, of course.

1730
01:56:19,547 --> 01:56:20,949
<i>Dear Miss March,</i>

1731
01:56:21,081 --> 01:56:22,917
<i>I read the chapters you sent</i>

1732
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:25,687
and I have to agree,
they aren't very promising.

1733
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,856
<i>But, please,
send more stories</i>

1734
01:56:27,988 --> 01:56:30,457
<i>of the scandalous variety,
if you have any.</i>

1735
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:34,127
Or, shall I say,
your friend can.

1736
01:56:34,261 --> 01:56:36,564
My apologies for the joke.

1737
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:38,232
I couldn't help it.

1738
01:56:38,365 --> 01:56:40,702
Jo, come down!

1739
01:56:40,835 --> 01:56:41,970
Coming!

1740
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:45,807
I'm starving.

1741
01:56:47,609 --> 01:56:49,878
Oh, uh, Jo,
you might wanna wait because...

1742
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:51,144
I'm famished.

1743
01:56:51,278 --> 01:56:53,213
But, Jo, dear,
you have a guest.

1744
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:54,916
Mm. I don't know anyone.

1745
01:56:55,048 --> 01:56:57,886
I'm sorry to intrude,
but...

1746
01:56:59,821 --> 01:57:01,021
It's you.

1747
01:57:10,698 --> 01:57:11,733
Oh, uh...

1748
01:57:14,636 --> 01:57:16,370
Hello.

1749
01:57:16,504 --> 01:57:18,573
Hello.
I'm Josephine March.

1750
01:57:18,706 --> 01:57:20,374
- I'm Jo.
- Josephine, is that you?

1751
01:57:20,508 --> 01:57:24,111
Welcome! Welcome.
This is Kitty and Minnie.

1752
01:57:24,244 --> 01:57:27,247
And I see that you have
already met our professor.

1753
01:57:27,381 --> 01:57:29,584
And he's
a very accomplished man.

1754
01:57:29,717 --> 01:57:31,753
And your mother says
that you are a writer.

1755
01:57:31,886 --> 01:57:33,420
I keep a diary, you know.

1756
01:57:33,555 --> 01:57:35,557
We have a lot of
interesting people here,

1757
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:37,992
intellectuals
and Europeans...

1758
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:41,529
Jo, I hope it is all right. I
got your address from Ms. Kirke.

1759
01:57:41,663 --> 01:57:44,666
- Who's this? Who are you?
- I'm sorry to intrude.

1760
01:57:44,799 --> 01:57:47,735
I was close by,
and I thought I'd...

1761
01:57:47,869 --> 01:57:49,604
- But I'll be going.
- No, no.

1762
01:57:49,737 --> 01:57:51,739
Please stay.
We have more than enough room.

1763
01:57:51,873 --> 01:57:53,575
- Can someone tell me who this is?
- Shh.

1764
01:57:53,708 --> 01:57:55,009
I don't want to be a burden.

1765
01:57:55,142 --> 01:57:56,410
You're not a burden
at all.

1766
01:57:56,544 --> 01:57:58,947
- Yes, of course. Please.
- I'm Laurie. Who are you?

1767
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:00,414
I'm Friedrich Bhaer.

1768
01:58:00,548 --> 01:58:02,951
We were at the same
boardinghouse in New York.

1769
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:05,954
Oh, Jo,
he's very handsome.

1770
01:58:15,262 --> 01:58:17,065
Do you intend
to stay in New York?

1771
01:58:17,197 --> 01:58:21,401
No. I've been offered
a professorship in California.

1772
01:58:21,536 --> 01:58:25,439
And, as I have
nothing keeping me here,

1773
01:58:25,573 --> 01:58:28,042
I thought
I might go west.

1774
01:58:28,175 --> 01:58:29,811
It is new there,
and they are

1775
01:58:29,944 --> 01:58:32,212
less particular
about immigrants.

1776
01:58:32,346 --> 01:58:34,414
Perhaps I should go west.

1777
01:58:34,549 --> 01:58:37,919
You're not an immigrant,
so perhaps you should stay home.

1778
01:58:41,556 --> 01:58:42,824
I'm going!

1779
01:58:51,966 --> 01:58:54,201
- Jo!
- Joseph, not Josephine.

1780
01:58:54,334 --> 01:58:56,037
I know Joseph.
Pretty well, actually.

1781
01:58:56,169 --> 01:58:58,773
Oh, wow!

1782
01:58:58,906 --> 01:59:01,609
This is a beautiful
instrument.

1783
01:59:01,743 --> 01:59:03,111
Which one of you plays?

1784
01:59:03,243 --> 01:59:05,546
Oh, it was
my sister Beth.

1785
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,682
We all play a little, but...

1786
01:59:07,815 --> 01:59:09,483
But none
so well as her.

1787
01:59:09,617 --> 01:59:12,687
It is very hard to lose
a sister.

1788
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:13,988
I'm sorry.

1789
01:59:15,823 --> 01:59:18,626
- Do you play?
- Yes. I do.

1790
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:21,294
It would make us so happy
if you'd play now.

1791
01:59:21,428 --> 01:59:23,698
She wouldn't want
the piano to sit silent.

1792
01:59:25,099 --> 01:59:26,501
I don't wish to offend.

1793
01:59:26,634 --> 01:59:28,168
Not in the least.

1794
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:59,133
- It was so lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Goodbye.

1795
01:59:59,266 --> 02:00:00,868
It was a real pleasure,
Mr. Bhaer.

1796
02:00:01,002 --> 02:00:03,403
- Bye, Laurie.
- Goodbye.

1797
02:00:05,139 --> 02:00:07,508
- Thank you for everything.
- Lovely to have you.

1798
02:00:07,642 --> 02:00:12,914
If you ever come to California,
I would love to see you.

1799
02:00:14,515 --> 02:00:17,018
I don't know that I will,
but thank you.

1800
02:00:21,122 --> 02:00:23,725
Well, goodbye.

1801
02:00:26,027 --> 02:00:26,928
Goodbye.

1802
02:00:41,843 --> 02:00:43,343
What?

1803
02:00:43,477 --> 02:00:45,278
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

1804
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:47,648
What a wonderful man.
I hope he comes back.

1805
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:49,584
He would make
a terrific friend for me.

1806
02:00:49,717 --> 02:00:52,153
- Father, he wasn't here for you!
- No?

1807
02:00:52,285 --> 02:00:55,556
- Jo, you love him.
- What? No, no, I don't.

1808
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:57,959
Yes, you do! I am half
as smart as you,

1809
02:00:58,092 --> 02:01:00,460
but I can see it
so plainly. You love him.

1810
02:01:00,595 --> 02:01:02,730
- Doesn't she?
- Good instinct. You love him.

1811
02:01:02,864 --> 02:01:05,800
I have never seen you so happy.
What else is love?

1812
02:01:05,933 --> 02:01:08,102
You need to go after him.
Prepare the horses.

1813
02:01:08,236 --> 02:01:10,138
- We can catch him.
- I'm coming too.

1814
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,240
- No, I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

1815
02:01:12,372 --> 02:01:13,574
- Amy is right.
- Exactly!

1816
02:01:13,708 --> 02:01:15,342
Never thought
I'd prepare a carriage

1817
02:01:15,475 --> 02:01:17,277
to help Jo March chase a man,
but I like it.

1818
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:19,446
- He's moving to California.
- That was fiction!

1819
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:21,816
He was practically begging
for a reason to stay.

1820
02:01:21,949 --> 02:01:24,085
- But it's raining outside.
- That doesn't matter.

1821
02:01:24,218 --> 02:01:26,286
- Come with me. I need to fix you.
- Jo!

1822
02:01:26,419 --> 02:01:28,122
Laurie, will you
stop standing there

1823
02:01:28,256 --> 02:01:30,191
and go get the horses ready?
Thank you.

1824
02:01:37,165 --> 02:01:39,267
You never ask about my mother,

1825
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:41,602
even when you know
I've seen her.

1826
02:01:41,736 --> 02:01:43,771
I assume
she's still alive.

1827
02:01:43,905 --> 02:01:45,540
But I ask
after your mother.

1828
02:01:45,673 --> 02:01:47,675
And I have no idea why.

1829
02:01:47,809 --> 02:01:49,476
You're willfully
missing the point.

1830
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:50,477
That's true.

1831
02:01:51,646 --> 02:01:52,947
What do they want?

1832
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,347
I have no idea.

1833
02:01:54,481 --> 02:01:55,817
Are you publishing this?

1834
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:57,585
What happens
to the "little women"?

1835
02:01:57,718 --> 02:02:00,288
Tell me you have
the rest of this book.

1836
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:01,756
What?

1837
02:02:15,570 --> 02:02:17,672
I'm just trying
to fix this hair.

1838
02:02:22,342 --> 02:02:24,178
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop the carriage.

1839
02:02:24,312 --> 02:02:25,880
- Stop!
- Stop the carriage!

1840
02:02:26,013 --> 02:02:28,816
Stop. All right, Go. Out. Out.
Go. Go, go, go.

1841
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:30,117
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1842
02:02:30,251 --> 02:02:32,220
Kiss him with love!

1843
02:02:40,862 --> 02:02:44,532
Frankly, I don't see why
she didn't marry the neighbor.

1844
02:02:44,665 --> 02:02:46,868
Well, because the neighbor
marries her sister.

1845
02:02:48,269 --> 02:02:50,905
Right, right.
Of course.

1846
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,575
So who does she marry?

1847
02:02:54,709 --> 02:02:57,078
No one. She doesn't marry
either of them.

1848
02:02:58,179 --> 02:03:00,281
No.

1849
02:03:00,413 --> 02:03:02,783
No! No, no,
that won't work at all.

1850
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:05,253
She says the whole book
she doesn't want to marry.

1851
02:03:05,385 --> 02:03:06,854
Who cares?

1852
02:03:06,988 --> 02:03:09,223
Girls want to see women married,
not consistent.

1853
02:03:09,357 --> 02:03:11,025
No, it isn't
the right ending.

1854
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:13,261
The right ending
is the one that sells.

1855
02:03:14,595 --> 02:03:16,264
Trust me. If you decide

1856
02:03:16,396 --> 02:03:17,932
to end your delightful book

1857
02:03:18,065 --> 02:03:19,700
with your heroine a spinster,

1858
02:03:19,834 --> 02:03:21,434
no one will buy it.

1859
02:03:21,569 --> 02:03:24,404
It won't be worth printing.

1860
02:03:24,538 --> 02:03:26,107
I suppose marriage
has always been

1861
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,542
an economic proposition,
even in fiction.

1862
02:03:28,676 --> 02:03:31,411
- It's romance.
- Heh, heh, it's mercenary.

1863
02:03:31,545 --> 02:03:35,149
- Just end it that way, will you?
- Heh, fine.

1864
02:03:35,283 --> 02:03:36,550
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1865
02:03:36,684 --> 02:03:38,319
Kiss him with love!
Go!

1866
02:03:41,122 --> 02:03:43,958
- You look so beautiful!
- Go, Jo!

1867
02:04:02,677 --> 02:04:03,577
Jo!

1868
02:04:11,619 --> 02:04:14,322
I... I don't want you to leave.
I want you to stay.

1869
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:15,756
- You do?
- Yes.

1870
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:17,892
I would never leave
if you wish me to stay.

1871
02:04:18,025 --> 02:04:20,428
- No, I want you to stay.
- I have nothing to give you.

1872
02:04:20,561 --> 02:04:21,963
It doesn't matter.

1873
02:04:22,096 --> 02:04:23,463
My hands are empty.

1874
02:04:23,597 --> 02:04:24,732
They're not empty.

1875
02:04:32,707 --> 02:04:35,609
<i>I love it. It's romantic.</i>

1876
02:04:35,743 --> 02:04:39,280
It's very moving.
That's very emotional.

1877
02:04:39,413 --> 02:04:42,183
- Well, thank you.
- We could call the chapter...

1878
02:04:43,751 --> 02:04:45,286
"Under the Umbrella."

1879
02:04:45,419 --> 02:04:46,821
- That's good.
- Perfect.

1880
02:04:46,954 --> 02:04:48,923
Now, there's the question
of the contract.

1881
02:04:49,056 --> 02:04:51,491
I'm prepared to give you
5 percent of the royalties.

1882
02:04:51,625 --> 02:04:53,294
So I get 5 percent
of the profit.

1883
02:04:53,427 --> 02:04:56,664
Five percent of the net profits,
after I recoup.

1884
02:04:56,797 --> 02:04:59,499
Huh. Well, what about
a payment up front?

1885
02:04:59,633 --> 02:05:02,336
I'm the one taking the risk
in printing this book.

1886
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:04,505
Yes, but it's my book.

1887
02:05:04,638 --> 02:05:06,674
And if it does well,
we'll both make money.

1888
02:05:06,807 --> 02:05:08,576
If not,
I can stay in business.

1889
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:10,344
Oh, so I get nothing
if it fails.

1890
02:05:10,478 --> 02:05:14,382
No, I'll give you $500 right now
to buy out the copyright.

1891
02:05:14,515 --> 02:05:16,717
- The copyright?
- That's the right for reprinting,

1892
02:05:16,851 --> 02:05:19,653
that sort of thing. Sequels,
characters for other stories.

1893
02:05:19,787 --> 02:05:21,155
Might that
be worth something?

1894
02:05:21,288 --> 02:05:23,691
Well, only if it's a success.

1895
02:05:23,824 --> 02:05:27,161
I see. It seems like something
I would want to own, no?

1896
02:05:27,294 --> 02:05:30,097
Didn't you say your family
needed the money immediately?

1897
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:32,767
Yes, they do, which is why
I wanted up-front payment.

1898
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:37,004
No. It's too risky. I'll only
pay for the copyright.

1899
02:05:43,978 --> 02:05:47,014
You keep your $500,
and I'll keep the copyright.

1900
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:51,052
Also, I want 10 percent
of royalties.

1901
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:56,557
Five point five percent.
That's very generous.

1902
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:59,693
- Nine percent.
- Six percent, and that's it.

1903
02:06:01,295 --> 02:06:03,497
Mr. Dashwood, if I'm going
to sell my heroine

1904
02:06:03,631 --> 02:06:07,334
into marriage for money,
I might as well get some of it.

1905
02:06:07,468 --> 02:06:09,070
Six point six percent.

1906
02:06:10,738 --> 02:06:12,940
- Done.
- And you don't need to decide

1907
02:06:13,074 --> 02:06:15,576
- about the copyright right now.
- No, I've decided.

1908
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:17,512
I want to own my own book.

1909
02:06:24,585 --> 02:06:26,854
Where is she?
She's here, everyone!

1910
02:06:32,893 --> 02:06:34,228
Come on!

1911
02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:45,272
Now, see if you can make a B.
