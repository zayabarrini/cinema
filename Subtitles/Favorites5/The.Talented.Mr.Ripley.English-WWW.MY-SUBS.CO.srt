that we met in a bar.

1534
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:09,456
He couldn't be faithful
for five minutes.

1535
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:11,542
So when he makes a promise,

1536
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:13,669
it doesn't mean what it means
when you make a promise...

1537
01:57:13,752 --> 01:57:16,338
or I make a promise.

1538
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:20,384
He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1539
01:57:20,467 --> 01:57:23,679
He lies. He lies.

1540
01:57:23,721 --> 01:57:28,142
And that's his-- Half the time
he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

1541
01:57:28,225 --> 01:57:31,520
And today,

1542
01:57:31,562 --> 01:57:35,357
I really started wondering whether
he may have killed Freddie.

1543
01:57:35,441 --> 01:57:39,028
He would get so crazy
if anybody would contradict him.

1544
01:57:39,111 --> 01:57:41,822
Well, you know that.
You know that.

1545
01:57:41,906 --> 01:57:44,533
You know that.

1546
01:57:44,575 --> 01:57:46,869
And that’s the irony, Marge.

1547
01:57:46,911 --> 01:57:48,871
I loved you.

1548
01:57:48,913 --> 01:57:50,873
You may as well know, Marge.
I loved you.

1549
01:57:50,915 --> 01:57:53,667
I don’t know, maybe it's
grotesque of me to say this now,

1550
01:57:53,751 --> 01:57:56,545
so just... write it on apiece
of paper or something...

1551
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:59,089
and put it in your purse
for a rainy day.

"Tom loves me. Tom loves me."

1553
01:58:03,469 --> 01:58:05,846
- Why do you have Dickie's rings ?
- I told you.

1554
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:09,016
- He gave them to me.
- Why ? When ?

1555
01:58:09,099 --> 01:58:12,102
I feel as if you haven't been listening
to anything I’ve been saying to you.

1556

I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

- It's all true.
- I don't believe...

1560
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:28,994
Marge, can I hold you ?

1561
01:58:29,078 --> 01:58:31,038
Will you let me hold you ?

- Marge ?

- Peter ! Thank God you're here.
- What’s going on ?

1564
01:58:36,418 --> 01:58:39,755
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Please!

1565

- [Peter] Tom, are you okay ?
- [Marge Sobbing]

1566
01:58:44,718 --> 01:58:47,846
You try.
You try talking to her.

1567
01:58:48,931 --> 01:58:51,016
- [Peter] Tom ?
- I give up.

1568
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:53,686
Tell me what’s going on.
Tom !

1569
01:58:53,769 --> 01:58:56,230
- [Tom] What did I ever do to her?
- Listen--

1570
01:58:56,313 --> 01:58:59,441
Have her tell you one thing
that I’ve ever done to her.

1571
01:58:59,525 --> 01:59:02,194
You can't be angry
with her.

1572
01:59:02,278 --> 01:59:05,239
She's confused, and she needs
someone to blame.

1573
01:59:05,281 --> 01:59:07,241
So she blames you.

1574
01:59:07,283 --> 01:59:09,869
I'll go back home
and talk to her.

1575
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:12,413
As for you,

[Knocking]

1578

- Is Mr. Greenleaf here ?
- Mr. Ripley ?

01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:34,059
- Yes.
- I'm Alvin MacCarron.

1580
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:39,440
[Marge] I don’t know,
I don’t know. I just know it.

1581
01:59:39,523 --> 01:59:42,443
[Mr. Greenleaf] Marge, there's female
intuition and then there are facts.

- Tom.
- Sir.

1583
01:59:47,031 --> 01:59:49,742
Marge, you should have waited.
I didn't--

1584
01:59:49,825 --> 01:59:52,494
Didn't Peter say I’d
come by and pick you up ?

1585
01:59:53,621 --> 01:59:56,248
Marge has been telling us
about the rings.

1586
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:58,792
Yes, I feel ridiculous
I didn't mention them yesterday.

1587
01:59:58,876 --> 02:00:01,295
I clean forgot.
Ridiculous.

1588
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:08,177
Perhaps you didn't mention them because
there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

1589
02:00:10,262 --> 02:00:13,515
I’m going to take Marge for a walk.
Tom, Mr. MacCarron needs to talk to you.

1590
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:15,809
There's no need. We could go
to the bar. There's no need.

1591
02:00:15,893 --> 02:00:18,103
No, no.

1592
02:00:18,145 --> 02:00:20,439
I think you should
stay here.

[Door Opening, Closing]

1594
02:00:42,294 --> 02:00:44,755
I could probably
see my room from here.

1595
02:00:44,838 --> 02:00:46,799
I can see my house.

1596
02:00:48,801 --> 02:00:52,930
When you see where you live from a
distance, it's like a dream, isn't it ?

I don't care for B.S.

1598

I don't care to hear it.
I don't care to speak it.

1599
02:01:00,187 --> 02:01:02,481
- Okay.
- Did you know that at Princeton...

1600
02:01:02,523 --> 02:01:04,858
Dickie Greenleaf
half-killed a boy ?

1601
02:01:05,943 --> 02:01:07,945
At a party over some girl.

1602
02:01:08,028 --> 02:01:11,907
Kicked the kid several times
in the head, put him in the hospital.

1603
02:01:11,991 --> 02:01:15,828
Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw,
lost some hearing.

1604
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:19,164
Why do you think Dickie's father
sent him to Europe in the first place ?

1605
02:01:21,876 --> 02:01:26,088
The Rome police didn't think
to ask Mr. Greenleaf.

1606
02:01:26,171 --> 02:01:29,133
Nor did they think to check
on whether a Thomas Ripley...

1607
02:01:29,216 --> 02:01:32,386
had ever been a student
at Princeton University.

1608
02:01:32,469 --> 02:01:37,099
Oh, I turned up
a Tom Ripley...

02:01:37,182 --> 02:01:41,270
who had been a piano tuner
in the music department.

1610
02:01:42,354 --> 02:01:44,440
You see, in America,

1611
02:01:44,523 --> 02:01:49,028
we are taught to check a fact
before it becomes a fact.

1612
02:01:49,111 --> 02:01:51,530
We're taught to nose around.

When a girl drowns herself,

1614
02:01:54,533 --> 02:01:56,911
find out if
that girl is pregnant.

1615
02:01:56,994 --> 02:01:59,914
Find out if Dickie
had an embarrassment there.

Mr. Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
He really does.

She has a hundred theories.

There are a few things

Three different people...

02:02:17,848 --> 02:02:21,393
saw Dickie
get into Freddie's car.

1623
02:02:21,477 --> 02:02:24,772
One man,
who will not testify...

1624
02:02:24,855 --> 02:02:27,775
because he was jumping somebody
else's wife at the time,

1625
02:02:27,858 --> 02:02:31,862
saw Dickie removing license plates
from a red sports car.

1626
02:02:31,946 --> 02:02:35,908
The police know about this man because
he happens to be a policeman.

1627

I found these in the basement
of Dickie's apartment.

They belong to Freddie's car.

to lose these in the canal

[Bell Tolling]

1632
02:02:56,136 --> 02:02:58,973
Mr. Greenleaf feels that
there was a silent promise...

1633
02:02:59,056 --> 02:03:02,226
in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honor.

1634
02:03:02,309 --> 02:03:04,853
He also intends to transfer
a good portion...

1635
02:03:04,937 --> 02:03:09,650
of Dickie's income from his trust
into your name.

1636
02:03:09,733 --> 02:03:11,819
He does not intend...

1637
02:03:11,902 --> 02:03:15,364
to give the Italians any
information about Dickie's past.

1638
02:03:17,324 --> 02:03:21,120
He's rather hoping that...
you will feel the same.

1639
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:41,098
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Sir.

Good-bye.

those things to you the other evening.

in your purse to New York...

so he asked me to come along
and help out.

in rehearsal so he couldn't--

never been a Ripley rainy day ?

And I've thought about you.

Yeah, well, when I've thought about you,
I was mostly hating you.

Where have you been hiding ?

I haven't been hiding.

I've been in police custody.

Which is why

I came out to find you.

Oh, hardly kissing.

Or Tom and Peter, even.
