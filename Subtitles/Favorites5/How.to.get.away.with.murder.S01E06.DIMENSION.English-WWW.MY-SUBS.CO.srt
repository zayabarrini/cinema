"How to get away</i> <i>with murder"...</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,638
I'm representing one of the defendants,
Rebecca Sutter.

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,481
Does anyone else know about this?

4
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:10,166
Only Rebecca and I know it exists.

5
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:13,531
Sam, why is your penis 
on a dead girl's phone?

6
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:15,991
Did Lila ever share any
details about this man?

7
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,217
Just that he was married.
She called him Mr. Darcy.

8
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,235
Thank you for picking me,
making me Frank's girl.

9
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,754
I have a boyfriend.

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,706
I know how you got
Rebecca's confession tape.

11
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,975
We both know what person in
this house you did it for,

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,226
and it wasn't me.

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,511
- Rebecca? 
- Wes, you can't trust Annalise.

14
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,173
- What happened? 
- The wallpaper, Wes.

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,063
Look at the wallpaper.

16
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:36,869
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- Your husband's Mr. Darcy.

Alicia.

33
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,830
Hey. What time you
going to the bonfire, girl?

34
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:14,132
What? Study group?
No, I don't have to study.

35
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,401
I gots the trophy.

36
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,122
I got to call you back.

37
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,690
Is Michaela in there with you?

38
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,292
I want my freaking trophy back.

39
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:25,877
Open up!

40
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,410
I know you're in there!

41
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:31,762
Everyone, get down.

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,183
Connor.

43
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:38,436
Are you bitches seriously
trying to ignore me right now?

44
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:40,087
Let me in.

45
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,139
And you guys call<i> me</i> immature?

46
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,024
I'm, like, the most grown-up...

47
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,343
Grown-up ever compared to your dumb asses!

48
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,195
We
should just let him in.

49
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:49,647
Open up the damn door!

50
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,582
If he's been in the house, he'll...

51
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:52,900
He'll suddenly be part of it, you know?

52
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,401
Five of us witnessed him here.

53
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,804
Then daddy Millstone can help get us off.

54
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,606
We could get him to step in the blood.
It's not a bad idea.

55
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,574
- Yeah! No!
- He wasn't part of this.

56
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,144
Do you think that I wanted
to be a part of this?

57
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,613
Wait. Listen.

58
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,440
He's gone.

59
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,392
I texted him.

60
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,294
Told him I was at the library.

61
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,252
Take your seats.

62
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,604
We have a lot to get through today.

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,326
Our lesson... habeas corpus,

64
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:48,080
which translates into "produce the body."

65
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:52,351
Who can tell us how that applies
to the case Fay vs. Noia?

66
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,209
<i>Your husband's Mr. Darcy.</i>

67
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,579
- You're confused. 
- Listen to yourself.

68
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,448
You just can't stop lying.

69
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:10,852
Wes... just sit down.

70
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,787
- You're disgusting.
-  Let me explain.

71
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:13,755
You disgust me.

72
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,757
Wes, come back here.

73
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,559
Wes, come back here!

74
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:20,345
Come back here!
Wes, don't you leave this house!

75
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,435
Someone's having a brain fart.

76
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:32,724
Fay v. Noia declared an
individual whose imprisonment

77
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,043
doesn't meet the requirements
of law must be released.

78
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:37,212
This is done by way of habeas corpus,

79
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,866
a.k.a, to produce the body.

80
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,731
Thanks, miss Pratt.

81
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:47,052
Who can tell us what happens
in a habeas corpus proceeding?

82
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:54,105
Something's come up. Class is dismissed.

83
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,268
Keating five, stick around.

84
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,985
Looks like the Keating five
might be four from now on.

85
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,403
Maybe Wes is sick.

86
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,305
I bet the pressure finally
got to him and he dropped out.

87
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,823
That means the trophy's in play.

88
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,275
God, enough with the stupid trophy.

89
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,160
Hey, it's only stupid
'cause you know you'll never win it,

90
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:13,595
l-l-l-loser.

91
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,130
We have a new case.

92
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,816
Okay, but first thing's first...
Is the trophy in play?

93
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:20,466
To those of you smart enough
to know when to shut up.

94
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,499
21 years ago,

95
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,011
when I was a law student
not unlike all of you,

96
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,179
there was a local man,

97
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,626
David Allen, who was put on trial

98
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:28,736
for the murder of his girlfriend,
Trisha Stanley.

99
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,963
Now, the prosecution argued

100
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,039
that David had gone into Trisha's apartment

101
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,536
and shot her because he thought

102
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:36,221
that she'd fallen in love with her boss.

103
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:39,274
And despite there being nothing
but circumstantial evidence

104
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:42,844
to support this theory,
David was convicted of murder.

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,348
Now, this was the first 
case that opened my eyes

106
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:47,766
to the fact that the justice system

107
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,602
doesn't always reward
those who tell the truth...

108
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,972
But those who have the
power to create their own.

109
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,807
And it's a fact that's pissed me off

110
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,609
ever since I heard about this case.

111
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,062
But today, we've been handed the chance

112
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,648
to make an unjust system just.

113
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,785
One hour ago, the Pennsylvania supreme court

114
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,236
granted my petition

115
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:11,906
to develop new facts of
David Allen's conviction.

116
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:15,577
In layman's terms,
we're working our first appeal.

117
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,214
Now, the emergency hearing
that we've been granted

118
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,966
is in three days,

119
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,084
so I hope you're all rested and focused,

120
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:26,304
because what we accomplish
in the next 72 hours

121
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,173
will determine David's fate.

122
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:31,426
Then I was thinking steak.

123
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:36,031
A New York cut, 16 ounces, well-done.

124
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:40,059
Lobster, fried chicken, ribs.

125
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,362
Which is why I'm taking votes
from everybody who visits.

126
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:47,149
What would your last meal be?

127
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:51,070
What if I said you can have them all?

128
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:54,740
Don't mess with me right now.

129
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:56,309
The court called.

130
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:59,328
They're gonna give us one more shot.

131
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,913
That's right.

132
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:03,165
It's a death-row case.

133
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:05,217
And unless we do our jobs,

134
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,219
David will die by lethal injection

135
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,521
in less than two weeks.

136
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,389
I don't know what to say.

137
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:16,595
Thank you.

138
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,847
No.

139
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,350
You don't thank me until
you're out of this prison.

00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,326
Wes could be at the
police station right now.

163
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,328
- He didn't go to the police.
- You don't know that.

164
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,100
I do. He's a confused child.
I can handle him.

165
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,298
Maybe I should get a lawyer.

166
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,050
I should go to the police
and get ahead of this thing.

167
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:28,968
Only a bad lawyer would
give you that advice.

168
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,136
Well, what is the plan here, then?

169
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,155
This was already a mess,
and now you've got to argue

170
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,264
a death-row case in three days from now.

171
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,598
Because when I filed the petition,

172
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,570
I didn't know you were
screwing some white whore.

173
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:46,777
Frank just called.
He said you should go over now.

174
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,196
Great.

175
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,667
Bon.

176
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,453
Look, I just...

177
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:00,324
I want to say thank you...

178
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,794
For putting up with all our crap.

179
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:04,795
I know it's a lot.

180
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:07,264
It's for Annalise.

181
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,184
I'd do anything for her.

182
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,313
We missed you in class today.

183
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:37,811
You haven't been answering
your phone or your door.

184
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,080
Everyone's been asking for you.

185
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:42,466
They're worried that you were sick.

186
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,753
We even got a new case today,
a death-row appeal.

187
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,004
It would be a shame

188
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,839
if you missed the opportunity to work on it.

189
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,812
You can take that back.

190
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,513
I don't want it.

191
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:08,108
You and Rebecca?

192
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,679
What do you want?

193
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:15,749
That's funny,
because that's what I came here to ask you.

194
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,939
What<i> you</i> want.

195
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,157
Stop this.

196
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:26,817
- Stop what?
- You know what.

197
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:33,381
I wrote it all down...

198
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,316
Everything I know.

199
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:38,386
I have another copy in a safe-deposit box.

200
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:41,939
One phone call and it
gets sent to the police.

201
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,760
Unless?

202
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:48,214
You get Rebecca back.

203
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,600
- Are you in love with her?
- This isn't about a crush.

204
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,610
It's about doing the right thing.

205
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:53,836
And you think that means

206
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:55,821
protecting the drug dealer next door?

207
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:56,923
Putting your blind faith

208
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,358
in someone you barely even know? Why?

209
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:00,893
And please don't tell me

210
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,362
it's because you think she's innocent.

211
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:04,447
I taught you better.

212
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,232
I think she's as innocent as your husband.

213
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,533
You really need to stop thinking

214
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:09,118
that me protecting Rebecca and my husband

215
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,486
are mutually exclusive.

216
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:12,905
The idea that I don't have
her best interests at heart

217
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,540
is only in your head.

218
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,409
So prove it.

219
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,628
Find her and get her back here.

220
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,048
Whatever it takes.

221
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,584
Or I swear to God,
I'll tell the police everything.

222
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,339
There you are.

223
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,358
Thought you might be avoiding me.

224
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,855
You were the one out of the office all day.

225
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,757
Annalise having you do some spy work?

226
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,051
What kind of spy would I be if
I told you what I was doing?

227
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:52,320
Come on.

228
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,980
Afraid you'll kiss me
again if we get too close?

229
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:58,927
I think it was the other way around,
actually.

230
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:02,213
We'll call it mutual. How's that?

231
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,765
We'll call it "Never happening again."
How's that?

232
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,451
- Coffee ready?
- Fresh pot.

233
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,873
Frank.

234
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,285
You forgot your coffee.

235
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:17,179
Right.

236
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,476
I'd like Mr. Gibbins brought up to speed.

237
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,185
Now.

238
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,229
Professor Keating,
I-I know you're busy.

239
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,510
I just wanted to ask...
Did you know my father

240
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,296
presided over the original
David Allen trial?

241
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,243
So, Wes, you're not contagious, are you?

242
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,652
That depends.

243
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,664
Is lying contagious?

244
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:46,213
- Honestly, G, enough with the secrets.
- Ignore them.

245
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,914
They're just mad because they
know if they ever missed class,

246
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,950
Annalise would not care.

247
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:53,665
So, what do I need to know about this case?

248
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,307
The puppy's acting up.

249
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:57,693
I need you to find Rebecca right away.

250
00:11:57,695 --> 00:12:00,529
I'm guessing she's being put up
by one of her drug connections.

251
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,231
And what do I say to her?

252
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,999
I asked you to find her, not make contact.

253
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,619
We have less than 65 hours

254
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:09,705
before we argue in front
of the state supreme court.

255
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:12,641
That means no sleep until we
find out how to win the appeal.

256
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:13,775
Wes and Laurel,

257
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,861
find out if there was
any ineffective counsel.

258
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:16,895
Start with a visit

259
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,571
to his original attorney, George Gabler.

260
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:22,064
Believe me, this case was unwinnable.

261
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,334
I mean, you got David all but
caught with a smoking gun.

262
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,520
You got the neighbors who all heard

263
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,938
the fight the night before.

264
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,258
Do I expect this to slow you two down?

265
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,228
You kids, with all your hope,
all this, you know,

266
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,580
"Everybody gets a blue ribbon" nonsense.

267
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,965
You want some real advice?

268
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:43,325
Two words... Corporate law.

269
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:46,772
Connor and Michaela,

270
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:49,959
the original prosecutor,
ADA Vince Travers.

271
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,360
Travers left the case mid-trial.
I want to know why.

272
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,136
I want to know if there's a story
behind his disappearing act.

273
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:58,422
State was hacking our
budget big time in the early '90s.

274
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,140
I got burnt out, frankly.

275
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,732
Needed a minute to relax.

276
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,010
So, that was it, then?

277
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:04,845
Just dropped a big case like that?

278
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,360
It was the case or me.

279
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,451
Bonnie, the eyewitness, Linda Morelli,

280
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,801
I want to know if there's anyone else
she saw that day that could be a suspect.

281
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,126
I'm going to her place tomorrow.

282
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,678
What about me? I-I could go with.

283
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,247
- Old ladies find me charming.
- Great.

284
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,966
- Take Mr. Millstone with you.
- Yeah. Team bosher!

285
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,801
There's nothing else you
recall seeing that day

286
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,820
before seeing David leave
the scene of the murder?

287
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,121
Gosh...

288
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,642
I wish I could say,
but that's a lot of years ago.

289
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,593
And a lot of time

290
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:36,030
trying to push the memory out of my head,
not back in.

291
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,132
Excuse me, ma'am,

292
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,867
but are those prescription
glasses you're wearing?

293
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,470
Yes. And I know why you're asking,

294
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:45,390
but I didn't need them till a few years ago.

295
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,158
I wish it were different.

296
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,094
But I saw him with that gun.

297
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,837
- David had an alibi?
- Yeah.

298
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,579
Guy named J-wat.

299
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:02,066
Sky-high on heroin every
time I tried to talk to him.

300
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,818
I didn't need the jury to associate David

301
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,419
with someone like that.

302
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,221
Appreciate your help.

303
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,240
- Know how busy you must be.
- All right.

304
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:12,093
Well, have a good one.

305
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:14,345
Vince, you said you left

306
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,339
the David Allen trial so you could relax.

307
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:19,183
How relaxing were the depos
you took in the state's case

308
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:22,052
against the dockworkers'
union two days later?

309
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,822
Travers won't admit to
any of this on record,

310
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,840
but apparently he was tipped to there being

311
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,726
perjured testimony in the David Allen case.

312
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,778
He didn't know who it was, but he sent word

313
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,597
to Judge Millstone to look into it, and...

314
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,183
And?

315
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:40,054
And apparently Judge Millstone
did nothing about it.

316
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,338
What?

317
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,401
Okay, guys, this Travers 
guy is clearly a whack job.

318
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,776
Go on, miss Pratt.

319
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,311
Travers was re-assigned

320
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:48,779
to a different case by the DA.

321
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,864
He said he thought there
was pressure to convict,

322
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,833
perhaps even motivated by race.

323
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:55,085
Okay, seriously, my father isn't a sleaze.

324
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:57,121
He wasn't a part of some racist scheme.

325
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,245
Really? Where is it you summer again?

326
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:01,271
It's not just white people
who go to Kennebunkport.

327
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:06,084
My father wrote the book on
judicial conduct, literally.

328
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,869
He's a highly respected federal judge.

329
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,287
You don't get to where he's gotten

330
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,376
by burying evidence of perjury.

331
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:13,869
Believe me, my dad wouldn't do this.

332
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:16,940
Looks like we have a new target...

333
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,716
Judge William Millstone.

334
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,309
You wouldn't be the
first person in the world

335
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,835
disappointed by your father.

336
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,162
There's a gas station
up on elm that's open.

337
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:46,015
Where's elm? Maybe Sam knows.

338
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,968
I mean, he's lived here the longest, right?
What, any ideas, pal?

339
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:49,959
We shouldn't stop around here.

340
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,311
We could run into people we know.

341
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:52,871
Go to route 6 instead.
We'll find a station out there.

342
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:54,008
Where the hell is route 6?

343
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,393
My God. It's Asher.

344
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,130
Wait, really? You want to come over?

345
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,232
My God. My God. My God.

346
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:04,218
Yeah. Totally.
I'll... I'll be there in 20.

347
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,603
Yes!

348
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,673
This is freaking whack-a-mole.

349
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,598
Asher! I thought I heard someone.

350
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:31,824
Hey, Gloria.

351
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,617
I, think I left a book
in here a while back.

352
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:35,825
Good luck finding it.

353
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:38,885
Your father won't let me
cross this line to tidy up.

354
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,261
Yeah, I think I'll, um,

355
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,287
look for a few more minutes,
and then I'll give up.

356
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,094
Who's J-Wat?

357
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,779
Jason Watkins.

358
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,915
He was this kid in my volunteer program.

359
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,450
He had this job interview
but no clothes to wear,

360
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:18,786
so I met him at my apartment to
get him a suit he could borrow.

361
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,105
All right, so there was only
the two of you in the apartment?

362
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,007
- No one saw you? 
- No.

363
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,534
I chilled with him till about 8:00,

364
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,461
then I went to Trisha's alone.

365
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:30,865
Saw the police cars parked out front and...

366
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,474
Anyway, not much of an alibi now, is it?

367
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,393
- You have any idea where we can find him?
- No clue.

368
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,553
He lived up on 72nd by the bus station.

369
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,655
We'll try to find him.

370
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:45,039
Wait, wait. H-hold on. Hold on.

371
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:47,859
Seriously, how you liking our chances?

372
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:50,195
If I spend the afternoon sitting here

373
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,522
looking at your sad face,
I don't like them at all.

374
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,875
All right.

375
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,653
What's wrong with
looking into daddy doucheface?

376
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:01,072
- Would you want one of us doing it to yours?
- Sure.

377
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,974
Maybe they could actually tell
me something about the guy.

378
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,879
Wow, someone have daddy issues?

379
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,871
Someone have a gay fiancé?

380
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,381
- What did we find?
- Not much.

381
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,500
There isn't anything in the trial transcript

382
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:14,185
to suggest that Judge Millstone

383
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,519
was prejudiced toward a conviction.

384
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,621
And I can't find a single
allegation of misconduct

385
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:19,190
in his over 20 years on the bench.

386
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,725
Maybe Asher was right.

387
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,626
Maybe Travers was just trying
to get me out of his office.

388
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:25,804
- Do I detect prejudice in your voice?
- Not at all.

389
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,280
If you look at it through the lens

390
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,648
favorable to your friend's father,

391
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:30,350
you're not gonna find
what you're looking for.

392
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,218
Clinical objectivity, miss Pratt.

393
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,286
Professor Keating?

394
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,388
- I have no time now.
- I don't care.

395
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,273
Time's running out for Rebecca, too.

396
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,708
She has a hearing next week.

397
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,711
I told you I'll find her.
You have to trust me on that.

398
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,696
Did you find Jason Watkins?

399
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,232
- Yes.
- I want to talk to him.

400
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:49,002
O.D.'D 15 months ago.

401
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,415
Come on, girl.

402
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,437
I need you to do something else for me.

403
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,134
Just between us. No one else.

404
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,923
Whatever you need.

405
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:03,046
So, how's it going in school?

406
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,998
You still working with that attorney?

407
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,015
What's her name?

408
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:09,285
Annalise Keating.

409
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,588
You know,
we're actually working on an appeal

410
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:14,190
for a case that you presided over.

411
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:16,059
David Allen?

412
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,574
Guy in, North Philly,

413
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,350
convicted of killing his girlfriend?

414
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:23,277
Sure.

415
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,772
You know, as a kid,

416
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,533
I used to always look through your journals.

417
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:37,329
Years of meetings meticulously documented.

418
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:39,915
It's... it's impressive.

419
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,635
In all that time, there's...

420
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,037
...Only one day unaccounted for.

421
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,708
One in 30 years.

422
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,643
The day you met with the prosecutor

423
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:53,862
on the David Allen case.

424
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:57,766
I don't follow you.

425
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:04,556
Did the a.D.A. In that case, Vince Travers,

426
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,458
tell you that someone had committed perjury?

427
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,909
Where'd you get an idea like this?

428
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,728
That same summer,
a month after that verdict,

429
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:13,331
you received your federal appointment.

430
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:16,968
You were an underdog for the job.

431
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,437
Mom always said your pal Art Trucco

432
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:20,906
put in a good word for you.

433
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:25,607
Is this Keating woman putting
these crazy ideas in your head?

434
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,283
Your whole life,

435
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:30,019
you have prided yourself on
the fact that you don't lie.

436
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,472
And now I'm sitting here

437
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:38,944
accusing you of grave judicial misconduct...

438
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,865
And your only response is to
ask me where I got the idea?

439
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,471
Tell me I'm wrong, dad.

440
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:51,107
Please, tell me that you
didn't get to where you are

441
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,823
on the back of a man who's gonna die.

442
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:58,278
Please, dad.

443
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,967
Tell me I'm wrong.

444
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,010
You can't, can you?

445
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:12,535
- Get out.
- Dad...

446
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,294
After all I've done for you?

447
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:18,331
You ungrateful little twit.

448
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:23,703
Get the hell out of my house.

449
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,071
Welcome back, Mr. Millstone.

450
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:00,185
Ready to rejoin the effort?

451
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:03,719
That depends on your concession
to my two stipulations.

452
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:06,622
Those being?

453
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:08,524
One, you spare my father.

454
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,193
No one can know the role he
played in David's conviction.

455
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:12,461
So he<i> did</i> play a role.

456
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:15,431
Like I'm gonna tell you that
before you agree to my demand.

457
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,227
My father's name stays out of it.
Agreed or not?

458
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,968
Agreed.

459
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:22,276
Demand number two?

460
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:28,416
I want the trophy.

461
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,134
Deal...

462
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,412
If your information is
as good as you say it is.

463
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,969
It's good.

464
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:47,845
We still don't know who falsely
testified in David's trial,

465
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:51,273
but we do know it was to satisfy this man.

466
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:53,742
Art Trucco is a state senator who,

467
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,293
for reasons we need to find out,

468
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:57,362
needed David Allen to
go down for this murder,

469
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:00,015
so much so that he convinced
someone to lie on the stand.

470
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,239
If we can find out who this was,

471
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:04,765
we stand a good chance of seeing
this conviction overturned.

472
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:07,084
We have 12 hours till court.

473
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,003
Let's make David proud.

474
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,472
This isn't my... This isn't my...

475
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,491
- Who's on Trucco's taxes?
- That's me.

476
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,109
$30,000 a year?

477
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,078
How can we pay teachers
in this country so little?

478
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,429
Welcome to America.

479
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:20,348
I apologize for the late hour.

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,616
I was hoping to talk to your husband

481
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:24,919
about a case he worked back in '93.

486
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,357
Is it possible Trucco was a big
player during the re-districting strike?

487
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,459
Trucco's son was a cop.
Maybe he knew the lead detective.

488
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:42,677
Or David's bank did business with Trucco.

489
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:43,928
Or how about an affair with a witness?

490
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,284
Are you talking about the neighbor

491
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:46,998
who heard the shot or the co-worker?

Little late to go out, isn't it?

496
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,500
You worried about me now?

497
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,752
That's cute.

498
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,446
You're looking for Rebecca. Right?

499
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:32,372
The puppy's got you
running recon for him now?

500
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,144
Maybe Rebecca's our client

501
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,381
and I'm just curious about
what's going on with her.

502
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,017
Nice try.

503
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,408
With me. Now.

504
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,163
Stop leading Frank on.

505
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,882
What?

506
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:58,534
- Frank and I are just... 
- Don't, Laurel.

507
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,203
I see the way you look at him.

508
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:02,872
More importantly,
I see the way he looks at you.

509
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,352
And let's be honest.

510
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:08,196
It's not Frank a rich girl
like you ends up with, is it?

511
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,749
And you know that.

512
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,384
Hell, that's the fun in it for you.

513
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,203
- No, that's... - But what sucks
is, Frank doesn't know that...

514
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,439
That you're just leading him on,

515
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,891
letting him believe he has a shot with you.

516
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:21,576
And when he finds out he doesn't,

517
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:22,744
that's going to hurt him.

518
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:29,167
You're becoming a real asset to this team.

519
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,785
I would hate for Annalise to find out

520
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,538
you were screwing with
someone she considers family.

521
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:37,309
Of course I know who Art Trucco is.

522
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:40,145
He owned a bunch of properties in fairmount.

523
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,546
They were trying to raise the rents

524
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,915
to get people to move out...
Poor people, mostly.

525
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,767
Poor black people.

526
00:26:45,802 --> 00:26:48,083
Well, white folks could afford
the higher rents.

527
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,517
Trisha was leading the charge
against the development,

528
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,157
but she had no power.

529
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,831
Definitely not enough to keep him
from doing whatever he wanted.

530
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,075
Or that's what he wanted you to think.

531
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:13,152
What do you want?

532
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:16,585
The real about you and Rebecca.

533
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:17,807
You tapping that ass or what?

534
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,699
That's none of your business, Connor.

535
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,909
She's right. It's not.

536
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:23,678
Evasive. Interesting.

537
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:25,046
You guys, stop.

538
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:27,665
Must be hot, sleeping with a murderer.

539
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:30,885
- Wait, you're screwing our client?
- No.

540
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,855
And the guy with the corrupt dad
doesn't get to say crap to me right now.

541
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,566
- Take that back.
- Why should he?

542
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,192
Your dad sent a guy to
death row for no reason.

543
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:39,851
Honestly, how<i> does</i> that feel?

544
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:41,319
Knowing that your charmed existence came

545
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,821
at the expense of another man's life?

546
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:44,833
Well,
I'm sure it's not the first instance

547
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:47,993
the Kennebunkport Millstones have profited

548
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:49,895
off other people's misfortunes.

549
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:51,580
Aah!

550
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,017
That's the best thing I've seen in days.

551
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,654
What the hell is going on here?

552
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,221
Man's life hangs in the balance

553
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,106
and this is how you spend your time?

554
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,941
Wait. What is this?

555
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:05,110
It's mine.
It's from Trucco's real-estate group.

556
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,112
I've seen this logo before.

557
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:09,281
I saw him with that gun.

558
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:13,885
In Linda Morelli's parking garage.

559
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
People, the key eyewitness

560
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:21,686
lives in a building owned by senator Trucco.

561
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:25,380
So... it's... It's the teacher.

562
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,267
It's always the one you least suspect.

563
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:52,488
Just so you know,
we're all set on that other thing.

564
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,973
Good. And, Frank?

565
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,542
Thanks.

566
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,280
She seems nervous.

567
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:03,555
Wouldn't you be?

568
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,010
You know your life's weird

569
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,941
when you're happy to be back in court.

570
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,401
For the last time,
if I have anything to say about it.

571
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,425
The honorable
chief justice and justices

572
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,742
of the supreme court of Pennsylvania.

573
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,956
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

574
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,976
All men or persons who
stand bound by recognizance

575
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,578
or who otherwise have
business before this court

576
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,181
may now appear and they shall be heard.

577
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,734
In July of 1993, Miss Morelli,

578
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,072
you faced an eviction suit by
the owner of your building.

579
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:53,731
Why were you being evicted?

580
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,042
For failure to make rent.

581
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,510
I was three months behind.

582
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:00,412
My husband, he gambled, and...

583
00:30:00,438 --> 00:30:02,138
So you were being thrown on the street,

584
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:05,366
and yet four days after you
testified to seeing David Allen,

585
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,201
the suit was dropped.

586
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:09,146
According to the records we've obtained,

587
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,920
you never paid the rent you owed.

588
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,429
Is that because your payment

589
00:30:13,465 --> 00:30:15,515
<i>was</i> your testimony in the David Allen trial?

590
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:21,838
Can you tell the court
who owned your building?

591
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,290
Green Ash Properties.

592
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,615
That's Art Trucco's company, no?

593
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,040
The same Art Trucco

594
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,393
who's gone on to become
state Senator Trucco?

595
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,994
That is correct. But I...

596
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,430
Did anyone associated
with Mr. Trucco tell you

597
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,115
that your rent problems would disappear

598
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,384
if you testified that you saw David Allen

599
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,148
- carrying the gun that day?
- Objection, Your Honor.

600
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,623
The witness cannot speak

601
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,208
for the intentions of senator Trucco.

602
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,726
Which is why I would like to ask the state

603
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,595
at this time to subpoena Senator Trucco.

604
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,613
What? No!

605
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,381
My client is set to die

606
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,316
based on the perjured
testimony of Miss Morelli.

607
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,436
- That is an egregious lie.
- Perjured testimony bought by senator Trucco.

608
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,321
Would the court like to be put on record

609
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,490
for refusing to hear his testimony,
all the while,

610
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,127
senator Trucco is sitting in his
corner office right across the street?

611
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,537
Please, Your Honor.

612
00:31:08,394 --> 00:31:12,591
Senator Trucco, in 1993,

613
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:14,650
you developed the land at penn's landing

614
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:16,609
into what is now Trucco Plaza.

615
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:18,644
- Is this correct?
- Let's see.

616
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,213
I know this. You know this.

617
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,800
The few million people

618
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,809
annually that traffic the Plaza know this.

619
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,434
Can we cut to the chase here?

620
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,887
My constituents expect me
to make the most of my time.

621
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,130
I have a record of an injunction

622
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,826
brought against your
project by Trisha Stanley,

623
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,162
advocating for the thousands of citizens

624
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,663
living in low-income housing

625
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:40,398
who would be displaced by your project.

626
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,883
Was there a question in there?

627
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:43,768
10 days after, miss Stanley was murdered.

628
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:46,971
Your attorney struck down the injunction,

629
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,275
and your project went forward unopposed.

630
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:53,363
So my question is,

631
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,877
senator Trucco,
did you have Trisha Stanley murdered?

632
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:01,104
Are you out of your mind?

633
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,106
Your Honor, this has gone on long enough.

634
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,943
Did you convince your tenant
Linda Morelli to testify

635
00:32:05,978 --> 00:32:07,744
that Trisha Stanley was killed

636
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,279
by her boyfriend, David Allen...

637
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:11,231
You are way off base.
I recommend you rein this in.

638
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,934
Explain why your eviction
suit against miss morelli

639
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,086
was dropped despite her
inability to pay rent.

640
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:17,738
- Ms. Keating...
- Is it because her lost rent money

641
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:20,065
was nothing compared to
the millions you made

642
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:21,240
once miss Stanley was out of your way?

643
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,828
Answer the question,
senator.

644
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:26,471
- Ms. Keating, enough. - Why was Linda
morelli granted these concessions?

645
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,391
Mr. Chief Justice,
I have extended great deference

646
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,576
to the court by showing up here today.

647
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:33,929
But I am not gonna put
up with this any longer.

648
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:36,665
I am sorry, senator,
if you do not have the time to answer

649
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,567
- for who bore the real cost of your
development. - Objection!

650
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:41,353
Not just Trisha Stanley and her boyfriend,
David Allen,

651
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:43,839
- who served 21 years in prison...
- Your Honor, please!

652
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,640
But the thousands who were displaced

653
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:47,192
in the name of lining your pockets...

654
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,227
- Ms. Keating!
- ...The majority of whom are poor, powerless,

655
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:50,543
and didn't bear the color of skin

656
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:52,030
desirable to your business interests.

657
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,999
- That's enough, Ms. Keating!
- You tore a community apart.

658
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,851
- Ms. Keating, I want order!
- You tore families apart.

659
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:57,110
- You destroyed lives, senator. 
- Ms. Keating!

660
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,420
- Admit it. 
- Ms. Keating.

661
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:00,088
Admit you killed Trisha Stanley

662
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:03,467
and had my client, David Allen,
set up for her murder.

663
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:06,026
That is enough! Do you hear me?

664
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,384
You say another word,

665
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,670
and I'll have no choice
but to throw you in jail.

666
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,777
If I wanted to be her before...

667
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,296
That's not something she can teach us.

668
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:21,666
Here's a question... If she gets disbarred,

669
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:22,932
does it go on our records, too?

670
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,620
Will the defendant please rise?

671
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:30,624
Ms. Keating, may I say,
we are beyond dismayed

672
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,327
by the conduct you've exhibited here today.

673
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:36,030
You've operated with blatant disrespect

674
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:39,736
for this court and its protocols,

675
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:43,597
and your argument,
when isolated from all the bluster,

676
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:46,817
seems to consist entirely of speculation.

677
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:51,936
The case against your client

678
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,923
seems to be built on the same ground,

679
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,617
rooted singularly in an eyewitness testimony

680
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:01,103
that we no longer have faith in.

681
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:04,373
As a result, it is our recommendation

682
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:06,725
that the district attorney's
office open an investigation

683
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,378
into the actions of senator Trucco

684
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:12,715
and the state's original witness,
Linda Morelli.

685
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:17,803
Now, Mr. Allen...

686
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,220
We have no choice but to
vacate the judgment...

687
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:25,186
...Conviction,
and sentence of death,

688
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:28,163
and prohibit a re-trial.

689
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:30,289
You are a free man.

690
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,988
Let me know what you have.

691
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,137
W-what?

692
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,629
For dinner tonight.

693
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:45,361
Thank you.

694
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:47,046
Thank you.

695
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:49,716
Go be with your family.

696
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:59,542
My baby.

697
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,298
You wanted to see me?

698
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,167
There's been a major
development in Rebecca's case.

699
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:13,997
The police found new evidence
that Griffin killed Lila

700
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,459
because she was dating another man.

701
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,383
<i> After receiving</i> <i>an anonymous tip,</i>

702
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:25,018
<i>detectives searched</i> <i>Mr. O'Reilly's car</i>

703
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,386
<i>and discovered a cellphone</i>

704
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:28,438
<i>believed to belong</i> <i>to Lila Stangard.</i>

705
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:32,043
- I need you to do something else for me.
- Whatever you need.

706
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,930
Have your guy clear any source
of where the photos came from...

707
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,083
Phone number, identifying information.

708
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,217
He can do that, correct?

709
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,720
- I'll make sure. 
- Be 100% sure.

710
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,405
<i>Police are reporting the
cellphone may contain</i>

711
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:48,456
<i>evidence of a relationship
that Lila Stangard</i>

712
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,633
<i>was having with an individual

713
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,826
<i>Our sources report</i> <i>there may be even photos</i>

714
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,761
<i>that support a theory that Lila broke</i>

715
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:57,296
<i>the couple's virginity pact,</i>

716
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>giving O'Reilly a motive
in miss stangard's murder.</i>

717
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,717
<i>According to police, they're...</i>

718
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:05,187
What about your husband?

719
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:06,589
That's my concern, not yours.

720
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:11,594
Go tell Rebecca it's safe to come home.

721
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:15,531
Frank has the address where she's staying.

722
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:24,056
"Whatever it takes."

723
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:26,942
Isn't that what you said?

724
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,270
God, you're such a klutz.

725
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,962
I got this, Frank.

726
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,173
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

727
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,546
I didn't want to have to say this,

728
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,798
but I'm not into you,

729
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,167
and it's not just because we work together.

730
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,453
So you have to stop.

731
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,972
Let's keep this professional.

732
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,574
Otherwise I'm gonna have to tell Annalise.

733
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,810
Tell Annalise? Wow.

734
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,312
I'm not going to. I just...

735
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah, you're not into me.

736
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,929
You don't have to say it twice.

737
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,485
I don't get it.

738
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,863
Did you read it?

739
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:40,279
What the hell is she doing?

740
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,024
She's defending you.

741
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,026
- None of this is true.
- But it's good for you.

742
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:48,414
You never had the phone,
and now Griffin has a motive.

743
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,283
If he knew Lila was cheating on him...

744
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,152
- He didn't.
- You don't know that.

745
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,503
I-I do.

746
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,555
We both do.

747
00:37:57,286 --> 00:38:00,304
I mean, h... How are you okay with this?

748
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,263
'Cause you told me you didn't do it.

749
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,052
And unless you're lying to me...

750
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,351
I don't think you should go to jail

751
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,586
for something you didn't do.

752
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,805
No one's ever believed
in me like this before.

753
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,246
I know.

754
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:26,854
Come home.

755
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,472
Let her defend you.

756
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,659
<i>According to police,</i>

757
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:35,435
<i>they're now seeking</i> <i>additional evidence,</i>

758
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:37,489
<i>hoping to identify</i> <i>the man in the photos</i>

760
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:41,126
<i>Is this man</i> <i>possibly a new suspect?</i>

761
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,395
<i>Or is it the proof</i> <i>prosecutors needed</i>

762
00:38:43,397 --> 00:38:44,880
<i>to show Mr. O'Reilly</i>

763
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,900
<i>had motive</i> <i>for killing his girlfriend?</i>

764
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:50,169
Damn.

765
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,439
I was hoping I'd get to be
the first one to tell you.

766
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,858
You like the new wallpaper?

767
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:02,298
It's the only thing left
that tied you to the photo.

768
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,733
Unless of course there's
someone else out there

769
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,469
knows what your penis looks like.

770
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,279
Why you doing all this for me?

771
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:15,648
I'm not angry. I just...

772
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:18,592
- Don't...
- I need you.

773
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,703
Don't you get that?

774
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:23,189
After everything you've done to me,
lying to me,

775
00:39:23,224 --> 00:39:24,924
screwing that girl,

776
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,042
I need you.

777
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,818
I need you.

778
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,640
Need you.

779
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:44,844
I need you.

780
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:49,448
I need you.

781
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:52,992
And I love you.

782
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:05,911
I love you, too.

783
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:20,309
You're back.

784
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:21,777
For now.

785
00:40:21,812 --> 00:40:23,445
Come in.

786
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:26,015
I'll fill you in on the
next steps of your case.

787
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:37,343
Any luck?

788
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:39,094
Just sent it to you.

789
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:41,780
Surveillance coverage of
O'Reilly for the last 48 hours.

790
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,850
You're gonna like what you see.

791
00:40:49,674 --> 00:40:51,807
You need anything else?

792
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:55,365
No. This is helpful.

793
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:04,765
♪ Tumbling lights come ♪

794
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,860
♪ tumbling lights go ♪

795
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:11,848
Yeah!

796
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,918
Wait, really? You want to come over?

797
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:24,310
Those fricking liars.

798
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:27,146
First they steal my trophy,
then they go party at the bonfire

799
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:29,916
after making fun of me for
wanting to go in the first place.

800
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:32,952
You know you can't tell them about this.

801
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:36,255
This never happened... You understand?

802
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,574
Of course.

803
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:41,394
I'd never be that guy.

804
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,982
Do you think it could
not happen one more time?

805
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,856
Hey.

806
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:55,975
Are you with him?

807
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,885
What?

808
00:41:57,911 --> 00:41:59,661
Do not lie to me right now.

809
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:01,630
I don't know who you're talking about.

810
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:03,665
Sam! Are you with Sam?

811
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,486
No. No, why? What's wrong?

812
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:11,890
Something terrible's happened.

813
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:23,931
