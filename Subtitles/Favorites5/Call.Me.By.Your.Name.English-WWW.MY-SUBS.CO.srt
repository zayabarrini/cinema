1
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,175
The usurper.

2
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,428
Caro? He's here.

3
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,204
- Professor Perlman.
- Welcome, welcome.

4
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,372
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, my goodness.

5
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,910
You're bigger than your picture.

6
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,504
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

7
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,329
That's the problem.

8
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,333
He seems very confident.

9
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,787
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Annella.

10
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,247
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

11
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,746
- Thank you for having me in your home.
- Welcome.

12
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,088
Where's Elio?

13
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,634
I'll go down.

14
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,966
Elio?

15
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,260
- You must be exhausted.
- What gave me away?

16
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,939
Hey.

17
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,495
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

18
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,989
- He's already here?
- Yes!

19
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,239
Every single one of these will.

20
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,204
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

21
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,044
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.

22
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,829
You must be exhausted.

23
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,043
- A little bit.
- Come, come, come.

24
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,873
May I bring your things up to your room?

25
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,038
- Sure. Yeah.
- My room?

26
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,088
Follow him.

27
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,383
- You're very welcome here.
- Si.

28
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,387
Our home is your home.

29
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,930
You're leaving?

30
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,058
- Hello.
- Hi.

31
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,019
Nice to meet you.

32
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,679
My room is now your room.

33
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,600
I'll be next door.

34
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,892
We have to share the bathroom.

35
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,101
It's my only way out.

36
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,158
We're being called for dinner.

37
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,739
Sorry.

38
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,414
Yeah.

39
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,295
We're being called for dinner.

40
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,825
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

41
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,587
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

42
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,378
Thanks, man.

43
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,717
So, this is your old room, huh?

44
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,467
Thanks.

45
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,977
Later.

46
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,443
I'll take care of the tart.

47
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,985
Look at this.

48
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,413
Good morning, Professor.

49
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,951
- Good morning.
- Back from the dead.

50
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,045
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh?

51
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,500
- How are you?
- I... Well, rested now.

52
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,041
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.

53
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,424
Would you like some espresso?

54
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,501
I would love some. Thank you very much.

55
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,916
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?

56
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,715
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

57
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,759
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?

58
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,223
I did. Yeah, big time.

59
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,013
- Thank you.
- Good.

60
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,676
I could show you around.

61
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,395
That'd be great. Thank you.

62
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,395
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

63
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,767
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

64
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,439
Let me do it.

65
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,734
Sorry.

66
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,284
- It happens to the best of us.
- Yeah, well...

67
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,282
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

68
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,825
Really?

69
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,698
Should I take him to Montodine?

70
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,005
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

71
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,459
You try Crema.

72
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,870
Crema?

73
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,458
Thank you.

74
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,093
Is this your orchard?

75
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,589
These are Annella's trees.

76
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,553
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

77
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,389
Pomegranate.

78
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,931
Have another egg.

79
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,438
Oh, stupid.

80
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,310
No, no, no. I know myself too well.

81
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,977
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,

82
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,895
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

83
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,989
- Delicious.
- Darling?

84
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,491
Thank you.

85
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,993
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

86
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,108
So, what does one do around here?

87
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,828
Wait for the summer to end.

88
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,329
Yeah?

89
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,620
What do you do in the winter?

90
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,913
- Wait for summer to come?
- Well, we only come here for Christmas

91
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,578
and some other vacations.

92
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,036
- Christmas? I thought you...
- And Easter as well.

93
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,626
- Thought you were Jewish.
- Well, we are Jewish,

94
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,961
but also American, Italian, French.

95
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,297
Somewhat atypical combination.

96
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,260
Besides my family, you're probably

97
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,264
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

98
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,222
I'm from a small town in New England.

99
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,467
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

100
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,395
So, what do you do around here?

101
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,727
Just read books.

102
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,895
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

103
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,645
- Yeah?
- Go out at night.

104
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,947
- I don't know.
- That sounds fun.

105
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,751
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

106
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,508
Sorry. Sorry about that.

107
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,049
It's all right.

108
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,132
All right, later.

109
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,773
What do you have there?

110
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,775
That should all be...

111
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,692
What is this?

112
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:39,278
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

113
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,953
These are archaeology?

114
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,744
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

115
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,908
Okay.

116
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,366
- More apricot juice?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,877
- Here, tesoro.
- Thank you.

118
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,339
Help yourself, darling.

119
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,709
Thanks.

120
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,305
Help yourself to some more.

121
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,479
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

122
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,150
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

123
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,820
It derives from an Arabic noun

124
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,819
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

125
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,821
The origin of our Italian albicocca

126
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,535
is al-barquq.

127
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,035
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

128
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,787
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, mismish.

129
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,751
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

130
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.

131
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,012
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

132
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,338
do find their origins in Greek words.

133
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,764
However, in the case of "apricot,"

134
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,642
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

135
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,179
How so?

136
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,223
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

137
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,267
Latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere.

138
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,102
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

139
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,857
To be precocious or premature.

140
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,776
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed praecox,

141
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,200
which became prekokkia,
which then became berikokki,

142
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,120
which is how the Arabs got al-barquq.

143
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,795
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

144
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,458
Flying colors.

145
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,758
He does this every year.

146
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,070
It's about drink time. Let's go here.

147
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,239
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

148
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,914
- How are you?
- All good.

149
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,705
Ciao, boys!

150
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,632
All good?

151
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,381
All good!

152
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,962
Let's see. What have we got?

153
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,877
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

154
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,821
Good morning, gentlemen.

155
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,869
How do you know about this place?

156
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,039
Okay.

157
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,881
Go, Chiara!

158
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,963
No, no, no, no, no!

159
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,220
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

160
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,684
Remember?

161
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,601
Get in there!

162
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,562
Much better!
See how cute he is.

163
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,780
Elio, water!

164
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,577
Perfect timing.

165
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,665
What's the matter? Are you all right?

166
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,575
- What, pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.

167
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,538
Here. Hold this.

168
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,628
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

169
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,473
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

170
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,799
You're too stressed.

171
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,343
- You just gotta relax a little bit.
- I am relaxing.

172
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,177
Marzia, come here for a minute.

173
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,643
Back me up here.

174
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,560
- Feel that. Right there?
- Oliver.

175
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,892
- It's too tight, right?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,187
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!

177
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,520
Later.

178
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,064
You should relax more.

179
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,476
Okay, guys, ready?

180
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,788
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

181
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,159
Twelve serving 11.

182
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,036
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

183
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,423
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

184
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,381
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

185
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,883
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

186
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,297
Don't know.

187
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,679
What a movie star!

188
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,469
Yes, those Americans...

189
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,708
Sparkling wine!

190
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,036
He's late.

191
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,709
Don't you think...

192
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,721
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

193
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,514
Arrogant.

194
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,934
I don't think he's arrogant.

195
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,183
Just watch.

196
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,604
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.

197
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,893
With his... "Later."

198
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,897
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

199
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,111
Won't we, darling?

200
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,528
I think he's shy.

201
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,279
You'll grow to like him.

202
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,413
What if I grow to hate him?

203
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,659
Oh, no, sweetheart.

204
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,447
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

205
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,625
Darling?

206
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,653
Elio, play something.

207
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,440
I don't want to.

208
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,485
Why not?

209
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,028
Because I don't want to.

210
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,451
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

211
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,240
Because I don't want to.

212
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,450
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

213
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,589
Play well, darling.

214
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

215
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:41,971
What are you doing?

216
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,267
Reading.

217
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,732
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

218
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,270
- I have an allergy. It's...
- Yeah, me too.

219
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,528
Maybe we have the same one.

220
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,072
Why don't you and I go swimming?

221
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,076
- Right now?
- Yeah.

222
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,368
Come on. Let's go.

223
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,702
Do we have to go right now?

224
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,711
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

225
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,251
Meet you downstairs.

226
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,438
See you downstairs.

227
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,854
Elio, what are you doing?

228
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,524
Reading my music.

229
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,982
No, you're not.

230
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,233
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah?

231
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,741
About what?

232
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,784
It's private.

233
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,616
You're not gonna tell me?

234
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm not gonna tell you.

235
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,446
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

236
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:28,618
Elio.

237
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,365
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

238
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,542
More apricot juice, please.

239
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,628
That's a good boy.

240
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,263
Thank God you're helping me.

241
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,355
Sounds nice.

242
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,661
Thought you didn't like it.

243
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,041
Play it again, will you?

244
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,387
Follow me.

245
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,707
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

246
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,464
- Well, I changed it a little bit.
- Why?

247
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,627
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it

248
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,006
if he'd altered Bach's version.

249
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,013
Play that again.

250
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,095
- Play what again?
- The thing you played outside.

251
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,471
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

252
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,518
- Please.
- Of course.

253
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,635
I can't believe you changed it again.

254
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,261
- I changed it a little bit.
- Yeah. Why?

255
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,719
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

256
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,300
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

257
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,305
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

258
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,927
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

259
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,353
In fact, we're not even sure

260
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,311
- Bach wrote it at all.
- Forget I asked.

261
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,472
It's young Bach.

262
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,429
He dedicated it to his brother.

263
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,714
Hey, Professor.

264
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,924
Hello.

265
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,134
Here, please.

266
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:07,805
I need help.

267
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,301
Just be honest.

268
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,596
How bad is it?

269
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,269
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...

270
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,771
Have you been to the river?

271
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,449
Mafalda!

272
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,368
Isn't she beautiful?

273
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,267
Elio.

274
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,978
You sleeping?

275
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,769
I was.

276
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,528
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

277
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,823
- Wait.
- What?

278
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,615
Can't hear you.

279
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,538
"For the early Greeks,

280
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,246
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness

281
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,126
"is constitutive of the way beings are,

282
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,553
"not only in relation to themselves

283
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,261
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.

284
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,052
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness

285
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,636
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."

286
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,056
Does that make any sense to you?

287
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,523
Doesn't make any sense to me.

288
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,564
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.

289
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,609
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

290
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,412
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

291
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,117
"Kind"?

292
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,203
Yep. Kind.

293
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:30,065
- Hey, Elio.
- Hey.

294
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,530
Hey!

295
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,533
Come here.

296
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,276
What's going on?

297
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,158
Is he trying to get it on with her?

298
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,406
Elio, he already succeeded?

299
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,752
What do I know?

300
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,504
I'd love to be in his shoes.

301
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,495
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

302
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,225
She wants him, no matter what!

303
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,639
Coming?

304
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,313
I'll come later.

305
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,586
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

306
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,348
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,056
Because of him.

308
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,600
Because of who?

309
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,018
Of Oliver.

310
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:23,911
Turn around.

311
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,377
Meet me here tomorrow night?

312
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,564
Wait for me!

313
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,181
Come on.

314
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,625
We almost had sex last night...

315
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,080
Marzia and me.

316
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,581
Well, why didn't you?

317
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,873
I don't know.

318
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,711
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

319
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:22,585
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.

320
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,224
She would have said yes.

321
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,091
Well, try again later.

322
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,928
Try what later?

323
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,683
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.

324
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,605
They say they've come up with something.

325
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,983
Fantastic.

326
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,601
Going there today.

327
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,017
- Would you like to come along?
- I would love to. Thank you.

328
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,606
- Smell this.
- Can I come, too?

329
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,283
On the condition you remain silent.

330
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,205
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"

331
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,871
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody

332
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,620
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

333
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,241
Well, nothing has been dug up.

334
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,958
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.

335
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,224
What are you doing?

336
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,219
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

337
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,301
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

338
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:10,643
Can you tell him I came by?

339
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,478
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

340
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,730
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

341
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,694
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

342
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,738
He's good-looking too.

343
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,986
- Want to get us together?
- No.

344
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,411
Come in.

345
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,705
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

346
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,750
She seems to like you a lot.

347
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,504
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

348
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,382
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

349
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,427
Great body.

350
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,224
Trying to get me to like her?

351
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,394
What would be the harm in that?

352
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,643
No, no harm.

353
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,774
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

354
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:43,939
I'll drive today!

355
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Just don't play at being the good host.

356
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,619
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

357
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,463
What's going on, boys?

358
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:06,087
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

359
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,631
What? What?

360
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:25,859
- Dr Roseburg.
- Samuel!

361
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,901
- Benvenuto.
- Look who's here.

362
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,236
- He's grown a bit, eh?
- And this is Oliver.

363
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,517
Sammy! Come on!

364
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,034
Truce?

365
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,330
Hey, boys.

366
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:31,303
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda

367
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:35,511
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi

368
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,764
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

369
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:45,563
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.

370
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,186
This fellow's at number three.

371
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,862
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,

372
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,862
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down

373
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,776
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.

374
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:21,675
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?

375
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:27,055
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.

376
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,574
Elio!

377
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:37,614
Oliver!

378
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,954
- I have to go. I have to go.
- Hey! Hey!

379
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,746
I have to go.

380
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,080
Goodness.

381
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,169
- Are you going, too?
- No, no.

382
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:56,336
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

383
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,015
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

384
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,313
- Okay, maybe just one.
- All right!

385
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,027
Marzia?

386
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:22,645
The Cosmic Fragments by Heraclitus.

387
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:34,113
The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing

388
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,189
so that we cannot encounter them twice,

389
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:39,405
but that some things
stay the same only by changing.

390
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:30,044
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

391
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,575
Leave the door open.

392
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,381
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

393
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,093
Darling, have you seen my HeptamÃ©ron?

394
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,350
Mafalda.

395
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,644
It's in German.

396
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:43,905
Okay.

397
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,450
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.

398
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,619
Come here, darling.

399
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,368
So, I'll translate, huh?

400
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,800
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.

401
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,888
"And she, too, is in love with him,

402
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,601
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

403
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,392
"Despite the friendship..."

404
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:27,985
"...that blossoms between them,

405
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,896
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,

406
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,493
"the young knight finds himself so..."

407
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,002
"...so humbled and speechless

408
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:46,075
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

409
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,670
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

410
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:04,187
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

411
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,606
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

412
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,446
I doubt that.

413
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:22,582
Hey, Elly-Belly.

414
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,543
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

415
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:36,345
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

416
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,676
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

417
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:42,145
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

418
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,314
Right.

419
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,980
So, does he or doesn't he?

420
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,770
"Better to speak," she said.

421
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,493
But she's on her guard.

422
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,782
She senses a trap somewhere.

423
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,035
So, does he speak?

424
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,370
No.

425
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:10,788
He fudges.

426
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,260
It figures. He's French.

427
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:23,893
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

428
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:27,444
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

429
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,189
Then why don't we go together?

430
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,442
Right now?

431
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,733
Yeah. Right now.

432
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:37,196
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

433
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,609
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

434
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Mind if I put this in your bag?

435
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:54,055
Yes, please.

436
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,140
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

437
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,636
Perfect. Thanks.

438
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:15,192
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

439
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:18,074
Anchiese insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

440
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,698
I think it helped.

441
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,434
Hold this for a second, will you?

442
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,655
- Want one?
- Sure.

443
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:32,598
Not bad, huh?

444
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:34,515
Not bad at all.

445
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:38,856
I thought you didn't smoke.

446
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,565
I don't.

447
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,201
- So, World War II, huh?
- No. This is World War I.

448
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,456
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

449
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,673
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

450
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,423
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

451
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,798
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

452
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,182
Is there anything you don't know?

453
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,599
I know nothing, Oliver.

454
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,357
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

455
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:19,899
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.

456
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,491
What things that matter?

457
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:32,948
You know what things.

458
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,500
Why are you telling me this?

459
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,138
'Cause I thought you should know.

460
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,886
Because you thought I should know?

461
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,024
'Cause I wanted you to know?

462
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,565
Because I wanted you to know.

463
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,281
Because I wanted you to know.

464
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,499
'Cause I wanted you to know.

465
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,263
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

466
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:35,766
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

467
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,440
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

468
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:48,532
You know I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,516
They mixed up all of my pages.

470
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:21,733
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

471
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:23,611
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

472
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,230
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

473
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,108
Damn it.

474
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,323
Shouldn't have said anything.

475
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:31,784
Just pretend you never did.

476
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,115
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

477
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,961
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

478
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,333
Okay?

479
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:45,296
We just can't.

480
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:01,604
Hey.

481
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,359
Let's go, American!

482
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,085
- Ready?
- Let's go.

483
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:03,868
Pretty much.

484
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:13,684
Oh, my God.

485
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,804
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

486
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,676
Good morning, ma'am.

487
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,556
Excuse me.

488
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:26,187
Could I ask for a glass of water?

489
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,197
Il Duce.

490
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:40,083
"People of Italy!"

491
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,578
That's Italy.

492
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

493
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:27,915
Come on!

494
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,358
This is my spot. It's all mine.

495
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,689
Come here to read.

496
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:59,114
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

497
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,195
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

498
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,792
Spring is in the mountains.

499
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:09,043
The Alpi Orobie.

500
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,745
The water comes
straight down from there.

501
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,950
I like the way you say things.

502
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,200
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

503
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,658
So you won't, I guess.

504
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,997
You really that afraid of what I think?

505
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:05,469
You're making things
very difficult for me.

506
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,150
I love this, Oliver.

507
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,044
What?

508
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,503
Everything.

509
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:38,916
Us, you mean?

510
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,049
It's not bad.

511
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:44,185
It's not bad.

512
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,229
Better now?

513
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,865
No, no, no.

514
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:53,584
- We should go.
- Why?

515
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:56,962
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

516
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,292
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

517
00:56:58,377 --> 00:56:59,667
and that's a good thing.

518
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,455
I wanna be good.

519
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:03,214
Okay?

520
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,848
Am I offending you?

521
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,900
Just don't.

522
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,200
I think it's starting to get infected.

523
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,829
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

524
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:34,832
Excellent idea.

525
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:45,419
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

526
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:48,047
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

527
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,055
Let me speak.

528
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:53,637
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

529
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,484
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

530
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,475
I'd like to know what they think too.

531
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,445
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

532
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:05,694
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

533
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:09,857
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

534
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:12,738
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

535
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:14,538
What's that got to do with it?

536
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,410
What are you saying?

537
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,792
You're mad, darling.

538
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,835
You asshole!

539
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:24,798
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

540
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:27,552
Say something.

541
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,336
You're resigned.

542
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:32,006
Why don't we talk
about the death of BuÃ±uel?

543
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:35,135
BuÃ±uel was a genius.

544
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,854
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

545
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:40,234
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

546
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,071
They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty
with constant interr...

547
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,609
Everyone loves BuÃ±uel!

548
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,277
Let's hear his opinion.

549
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:50,822
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

550
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:52,868
Say something. Give us your impression.

551
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,583
Do you have an impression?

552
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,750
Darling, he's American.

553
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:58,158
That doesn't mean stupid!

554
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:06,249
Just stop.

555
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:10,258
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

556
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,182
She didn't say that.

557
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:15,215
I'm going to go mad.

558
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,135
What's the matter?

559
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:20,192
What's wrong?

560
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,269
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

561
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:25,567
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

562
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:28,324
You get used to absolutely everything.

563
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:07,903
Don't you realise
you're mixing everything up?

564
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:09,653
What are you talking about?

565
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,495
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

566
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,164
Elio?

567
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,203
Elio.

568
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,161
You all right?

569
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:24,708
Sit for a second.

570
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,169
If you insist.

571
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,179
- That wasn't my fault, right?
- No.

572
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,007
I'm a mess.

573
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:45,104
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

574
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,526
Where did you learn to do that?

575
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:55,952
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

576
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:57,701
Trust me, it helps.

577
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,544
I used to have one of these.

578
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,206
- You used to?
- Yeah.

579
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,210
How come you never wear it?

580
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,377
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

581
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,089
Well...

582
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,179
I guess that works for your mother.

583
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,719
Funny witch.

584
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:26,099
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

585
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:28,016
I hope not.

586
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,030
Hey, are you leaving?

587
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:41,907
- Where's Elio?
- He's inside.

588
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:44,204
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

589
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:45,958
- Really?
- Yeah.

590
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,669
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll be back in a minute.

591
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,379
Don't go anywhere.

592
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:02,847
You okay?

593
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:11,977
Are we going out?

594
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:17,324
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

595
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,494
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

596
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:26,412
Where's Oliver?

597
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,036
Don't ask me.

598
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:46,977
Where's Oliver?

599
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:50,686
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

600
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,444
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

601
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:54,824
All right.

602
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,232
I'm going out tonight.

603
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,648
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

604
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:01,408
This is no good, madam.

605
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:03,662
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

606
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:05,742
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

607
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:07,451
She's worried about you.

608
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,751
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

609
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,594
Everyone likes Oliver.

610
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:20,093
I think he likes you too.

611
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:21,467
More than you do.

612
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:25,972
Is that your impression?

613
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,928
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

614
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,315
A while ago.

615
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,126
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

616
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,673
I have no idea.

617
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:06,375
Traitor.

618
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:18,646
Traitor.

619
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:36,370
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

620
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:53,893
- Hey.
- Hi!

621
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,725
It's me. Is that Marzia?

622
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,599
Sure it is! Can't you tell?

623
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:00,728
Sorry.

624
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,084
Is that for me?

625
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:24,745
Thanks.

626
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:43,646
Do you really read a lot?

627
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:46,484
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

628
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,740
Why not?

629
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:50,151
I don't know.

630
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:53,572
I think...

631
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:56,616
people who read are...

632
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:58,374
kind of secretive.

633
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,212
They hide who they really are.

634
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:05,424
Do you hide who you really are?

635
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:07,751
No, not with you.

636
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,011
Not with me?

637
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,298
Well, maybe a bit.

638
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:16,807
What do you mean?

639
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,482
You know exactly what I mean.

640
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,271
Why do you say that?

641
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:24,016
Why?

642
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:27,525
Because...

643
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:29,863
I think...

644
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,903
you're going to hurt me,

645
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,780
and I don't want to be hurt.

646
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,554
You're so hard.

647
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:00,349
Wait.

648
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:01,812
Kiss me.

649
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:10,901
- Is that good?
- Yes.

650
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:13,402
Are you lying?

651
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,578
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

652
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,881
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

653
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,100
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

654
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,444
Leave me alone.

655
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:48,275
Fuck, that felt good.

656
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,910
Please don't avoid me.

657
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,080
It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.

658
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,538
Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.

659
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:03,909
I am such a pussy.

660
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:08,455
Way over the top.

661
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,353
Can't stand the silence.

662
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,678
Need to speak to you.

663
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,794
Did someone have a good night
last night?

664
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:49,667
Not really.

665
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:55,879
Well, you must be tired, then.

666
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,838
Or were you playing poker, too?

667
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:00,886
I don't play poker.

668
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:04,097
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him

669
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:06,061
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

670
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,640
We should start cataloguing them.

671
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,477
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.

672
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:11,652
Sure.

673
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:16,151
Beautiful, aren't they?

674
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:20,408
They're all so incredibly sensual.

675
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:23,489
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.

676
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:27,539
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

677
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,251
Right.

678
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:34,877
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

679
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,570
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

680
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:14,036
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

681
01:12:17,296 --> 01:12:20,466
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.

682
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:23,839
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

683
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:27,427
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

684
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,313
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

685
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:34,315
As if they're daring you to desire them.

686
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,214
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

687
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:59,093
- Also known as Sonny and Cher.
- Okay.

688
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:02,342
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

689
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:03,434
No.

690
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,183
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

691
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,142
- Come on. It will make them so happy.
- It looks ridiculous on me.

692
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:10,223
I'll try it on for Oliver.

693
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:11,807
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

694
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,272
I'm not wearing it.

695
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:14,482
Oliver?

696
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,561
Hey, what time you got?

697
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:19,768
It's 2:00.

698
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:27,279
- Well... Later.
- Later.

699
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:40,798
Mafalda.

700
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,342
I won't be here for dinner.

701
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:47,175
Okay, Mr Oliver.

702
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,844
Hello, Mafalda.

703
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:21,919
Marzia.

704
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,337
Where are we going?

705
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:27,685
You'll see.

706
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,900
Stop it!

707
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,015
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

708
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,060
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

709
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:26,601
- How are you?
- You've grown.

710
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:28,147
- How are you.
- I'm good.

711
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:29,442
Good to see you.

712
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:31,575
Remember Marzia from last year.

713
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:32,692
Hello.

714
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:35,108
- Marzia, remember Issac?
- The girl from Paris?

715
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,609
Good to meet you.

716
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:38,158
Want to eat with us tonight?

717
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:39,532
No, no. I have to go.

718
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:41,328
- You're sure?
- Yes.

719
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:43,411
- Okay.
- Have a nice evening.

720
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:44,617
Goodbye.

721
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:54,631
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

722
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:57,216
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

723
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:58,602
- Come, come, come.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:02,604
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.

725
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:03,983
- Yes, you can.
- It'll look like a put-up job.

726
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:05,059
- Papa, it'll...
- Yes.

727
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:07,983
- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
- No misbehaving tonight.

728
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:11,023
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

729
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,608
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

730
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:15,574
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

731
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:17,574
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

732
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:20,026
- That's what Mom calls them...
- Then you accept gifts from them.

733
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,036
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

734
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,750
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

735
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:31,002
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,

736
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:33,376
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

737
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:36,093
And a credit to me.

738
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:39,185
Now, just get into this, you.

739
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:51,648
These are unbelievable. I just...

740
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,936
Hey, look who's here.

741
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,415
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

742
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:47,870
Thank you.

743
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:51,211
Elio. Elio.

744
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:54,746
- Thank you.
- Good night.

745
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,500
Good night.

746
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:02,088
Do I know you?

747
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:21,985
Thank you again for everything.

748
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:30,624
- They're never gonna make it.
- No, no. They're fine.

749
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:12,793
I'm glad you came.

750
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:25,301
Yeah, I'm nervous.

751
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:06,006
I like what you've done with the place.

752
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:09,425
It's nice.

753
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:38,082
You okay?

754
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:44,760
Me okay.

755
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:13,203
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.

756
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:14,723
What are you doing?

757
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:16,807
Nothing.

758
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:30,451
Does this make you happy?

759
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:33,907
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

760
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:35,829
I'm not gonna get...

761
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:07,572
Off, off, off, off, off.

762
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,449
Yeah. Just pull it.

763
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:16,157
Or I'll pull it.

764
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:48,729
Oliver.

765
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:32,531
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

766
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:37,495
Elio.

767
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:41,533
Oliver.

768
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:45,496
Elio.

769
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,537
- Oliver.
- Elio.

770
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:04,141
Did we make noise?

771
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:06,143
Nothing to worry about.

772
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:08,846
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

773
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,809
Well, she's not gonna find any.

774
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,740
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

775
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,699
Will you give it to me when you go?

776
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,440
Let's go swimming.

777
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,081
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

778
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:33,536
No.

779
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:45,108
Elio. Come here.

780
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,081
Take your trunks off.

781
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:09,181
Well, that's promising.

782
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,548
You're hard again.

783
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:11,969
Good.

784
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,640
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

785
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:00,517
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

786
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:02,444
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

787
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:04,824
Later.

788
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:08,946
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

789
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,909
Okay. So later.

790
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:13,374
Later.

791
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:26,594
Oliver.

792
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:38,979
You're not sick of me yet?

793
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:41,766
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

794
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,070
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

795
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:51,535
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

796
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:55,124
I don't know.

797
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:58,163
Of course, you don't know.

798
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:02,252
I don't want you to regret anything.

799
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:05,878
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

800
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,251
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

801
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:09,548
- one way or another.
- No, I...

802
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:11,841
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

803
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:14,388
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

804
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:16,505
That's not what I'm talking about.

805
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,940
Are you happy I came here?

806
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:38,577
I would kiss you if I could.

807
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:51,915
Times change.

808
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,800
Thank God we had the partisans.

809
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:58,097
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

810
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,270
What do you think of Bettino?

811
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:03,229
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

812
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:05,767
I'm happy, actually.

813
01:34:08,774 --> 01:34:10,824
I don't know. We'll see.

814
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:15,818
Anyway, they make the rules.

815
01:34:19,535 --> 01:34:21,045
Pasquina!

816
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:22,409
Hello.

817
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:23,826
Hello, ma'am.

818
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:26,880
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

819
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:51,789
Oh, fuck.

820
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:27,393
Fuck.

821
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:44,325
Fuck.

822
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:44,418
What did you do?

823
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:46,804
- Nothing.
- No?

824
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,442
Oh, I see.

825
01:38:57,813 --> 01:39:00,193
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

826
01:39:00,274 --> 01:39:01,524
What's next? Minerals?

827
01:39:01,608 --> 01:39:03,278
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

828
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,400
You know that's me.

829
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:07,069
I'm sick, aren't I?

830
01:39:10,117 --> 01:39:12,037
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

831
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:14,412
Please don't do that.

832
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:16,326
- You want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.

833
01:39:16,415 --> 01:39:17,505
You want to see something sick?

834
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:18,673
Please don't do this.

835
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,880
Hey. Please don't do it.

836
01:39:25,132 --> 01:39:26,262
Why are you doing this to me?

837
01:39:27,384 --> 01:39:29,054
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

838
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:31,136
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Then don't fight.

839
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:55,408
Sorry.

840
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,036
It's okay.

841
01:40:03,212 --> 01:40:04,672
It's okay.

842
01:40:17,226 --> 01:40:18,346
It's okay.

843
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,980
I don't want you to go.

844
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:27,191
God, we wasted so many days.

845
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:28,858
Why didn't you give me a sign?

846
01:40:28,946 --> 01:40:30,816
- I did. I did.
- You didn't give me a sign.

847
01:40:30,906 --> 01:40:31,986
When?

848
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:34,783
You remember
when we were playing volleyball

849
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,660
and I touched you?

850
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:42,040
Just to show you that I liked you?

851
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:45,588
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

852
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:46,961
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

853
01:40:47,047 --> 01:40:49,087
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

854
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:52,299
I don't know.

855
01:40:56,765 --> 01:40:58,925
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

856
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:01,444
I didn't know that.

857
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:05,571
That's funny, I...

858
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,980
I thought that...

859
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:10,279
Yeah, I know what you thought.

860
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:12,362
Stop. Stop.

861
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,190
"For Oliver.

862
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:53,659
"From Elio."

863
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:05,214
Elio?

864
01:42:17,095 --> 01:42:19,005
You disappeared for three days.

865
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:25,191
I had to work.

866
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,770
You completely disappeared.

867
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:32,185
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

868
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,570
I had a lot to do.

869
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:47,925
Am I your girl?

870
01:43:10,732 --> 01:43:13,652
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.

871
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:14,855
Oh?

872
01:43:14,945 --> 01:43:16,535
Research at the university.

873
01:43:17,823 --> 01:43:20,533
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

874
01:43:21,577 --> 01:43:22,907
But what about Elio?

875
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:28,171
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

876
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:30,090
to get away for a couple of days, no?

877
01:43:34,423 --> 01:43:35,673
What do you think?

878
01:43:38,218 --> 01:43:40,008
You know you've been
our favorite student?

879
01:43:40,554 --> 01:43:42,434
- You must come back.
- You sure you're not just saying that?

880
01:43:42,514 --> 01:43:44,564
- Oliver.
- Thank you very much, Professor.

881
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:48,188
Oh, man.

882
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,480
Please, please come back soon.

883
01:43:51,565 --> 01:43:53,405
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

884
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:56,147
You're welcome.

885
01:43:57,321 --> 01:43:58,411
Oh, well...

886
01:43:59,114 --> 01:44:01,164
- Thank you guys so much.
- Of course.

887
01:44:01,241 --> 01:44:02,581
Oliver, Oliver.

888
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:05,287
- Come back.
- It's been...

889
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:06,912
Come here, come here.

890
01:44:06,997 --> 01:44:09,367
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

891
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,535
Well, later, Perlmans.

892
01:44:12,628 --> 01:44:15,008
Later. Later, later, later.

893
01:44:25,057 --> 01:44:27,267
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

894
01:44:31,104 --> 01:44:32,694
Oh, no.

895
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:50,960
Come for dinner tonight.

896
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:52,291
Bring Marzia.

897
01:44:53,877 --> 01:44:55,127
Bye, darling.

898
01:45:03,178 --> 01:45:04,718
- What?
- Nothing.

899
01:45:04,805 --> 01:45:06,145
- What?
- Nothing.

900
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:20,025
Oh, to see without my eyes

901
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:25,489
The first time that you kissed me

902
01:45:25,576 --> 01:45:28,866
Boundless by the time I cried

903
01:45:30,038 --> 01:45:33,918
I built your walls around me

904
01:45:34,168 --> 01:45:35,168
Yes!

905
01:45:35,252 --> 01:45:37,802
White noise
What an awful sound

906
01:45:39,131 --> 01:45:40,221
Oliver!

907
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:42,183
Elio!

908
01:45:42,968 --> 01:45:44,548
Elio!

909
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:51,806
Hand of God, deliver me

910
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:55,860
Oh, woe is me

911
01:45:56,106 --> 01:45:58,566
The first time that you touched me

912
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:01,400
- Oliver!
- Elio!

913
01:46:01,653 --> 01:46:04,453
Oh, will wonders never cease?

914
01:46:05,657 --> 01:46:10,827
Blessed be the mystery of love

915
01:46:23,634 --> 01:46:25,844
Lord, I no longer believe

916
01:46:27,471 --> 01:46:28,681
Yes!

917
01:46:28,764 --> 01:46:32,274
Drowned in living waters

918
01:46:32,351 --> 01:46:35,601
Cursed by the love that I received

919
01:46:36,855 --> 01:46:41,145
From my brother's daughter

920
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:44,455
Like Hephaestion who died

921
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:50,159
Alexander's lover

922
01:46:50,244 --> 01:46:54,294
Now I'm prone to misery

923
01:46:54,373 --> 01:46:56,503
The birthmark on your...

924
01:47:09,471 --> 01:47:11,721
Oh, God.

925
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:40,878
And I'm feeling low

926
01:47:40,961 --> 01:47:45,971
Understand I'm feeling low

927
01:48:06,945 --> 01:48:08,145
You hear that?

928
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:11,199
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:48:13,327 --> 01:48:15,197
No, no, no, it's this way.

930
01:48:15,287 --> 01:48:17,367
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

931
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:19,330
Come on.

932
01:48:27,007 --> 01:48:28,797
Don't stop.

933
01:48:28,884 --> 01:48:31,804
A kiss is not enough...

934
01:48:31,887 --> 01:48:33,717
This. This.

935
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:35,345
This. You.

936
01:48:35,432 --> 01:48:36,772
You are...

937
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:38,600
Love my way

938
01:48:38,685 --> 01:48:41,765
It's a new road

939
01:48:42,814 --> 01:48:45,194
I follow...

940
01:48:45,275 --> 01:48:46,815
If you'll excuse me...

941
01:48:46,902 --> 01:48:48,902
Just one second.

942
01:48:49,821 --> 01:48:51,241
One second!

943
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:55,874
They'd dearly make us pay

944
01:48:55,953 --> 01:48:59,413
For laughing in their faces

945
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:02,628
And making it our way

946
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:07,509
There's emptiness behind their eyes

947
01:49:07,589 --> 01:49:10,629
There's dust in all their hearts

948
01:49:10,843 --> 01:49:12,843
I saw them last year.

949
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,179
Richard Butler... fantastic!

950
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:20,018
Really? We saw them in concert too.

951
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:22,942
We hitchhiked to London.

952
01:49:24,314 --> 01:49:25,364
What'd she say?

953
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,610
It's a new road

954
01:49:28,694 --> 01:49:31,704
I follow

955
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:35,030
Where my mind goes

956
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,000
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

957
01:51:21,098 --> 01:51:22,468
Did you get your passport?

958
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:25,734
You get your passport?

959
01:53:48,328 --> 01:53:49,538
Mafalda?

960
01:53:50,539 --> 01:53:51,659
Mom?

961
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:54,211
Yeah, it's me.

962
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:57,924
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

963
01:53:58,630 --> 01:53:59,960
in Clusone.

964
01:54:01,842 --> 01:54:03,552
Listen, Mom, can you...

965
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:07,139
Can you come get me, Mom?

966
01:54:57,981 --> 01:54:59,071
How are you?

967
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:00,903
Good.

968
01:55:05,864 --> 01:55:08,124
I read the book you bought me.

969
01:55:08,825 --> 01:55:10,575
The poems...

970
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:12,161
They're really beautiful.

971
01:55:12,287 --> 01:55:15,327
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

972
01:55:18,502 --> 01:55:20,502
I'm sorry, excuse me...

973
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:22,339
that you're sad.

974
01:55:23,632 --> 01:55:26,552
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

975
01:55:26,677 --> 01:55:28,347
I'm not mad at you.

976
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,260
Not at all.

977
01:55:38,897 --> 01:55:40,187
I love you, Elio.

978
01:55:45,612 --> 01:55:46,952
Stay friends?

979
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:50,331
For life?

980
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:52,408
For life?

981
01:57:00,395 --> 01:57:01,595
Missed you at dinner.

982
01:57:25,754 --> 01:57:27,214
So...

983
01:57:29,007 --> 01:57:30,047
Welcome home.

984
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:31,551
Thanks.

985
01:57:33,095 --> 01:57:34,895
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.

986
01:57:35,931 --> 01:57:36,971
I think he did.

987
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:39,810
You two had a nice friendship.

988
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:43,274
Yeah.

989
01:57:49,653 --> 01:57:52,203
You're too smart not to know how rare,

990
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,080
how special what you two had was.

991
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:01,870
Oliver was Oliver.

992
01:58:05,377 --> 01:58:07,297
Because it was him.

993
01:58:08,463 --> 01:58:10,303
Because it was me.

994
01:58:10,549 --> 01:58:12,549
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

995
01:58:13,468 --> 01:58:15,048
He was more than intelligent.

996
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:18,314
What you two had,

997
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:23,227
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

998
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:24,976
He was good.

999
01:58:27,316 --> 01:58:30,236
You're both lucky
to have found each other

1000
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,900
because you, too, are good...

1001
01:58:40,037 --> 01:58:41,617
I think he was better than...

1002
01:58:43,582 --> 01:58:45,212
I think he was better than me.

1003
01:58:48,337 --> 01:58:50,207
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1004
01:58:50,297 --> 01:58:52,667
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1005
01:58:53,634 --> 01:58:54,884
It flatters you both.

1006
01:58:58,889 --> 01:59:00,269
And when you least expect it,

1007
01:59:02,434 --> 01:59:05,734
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1008
01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:12,072
Just remember, I am here.

1009
01:59:20,077 --> 01:59:22,037
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1010
01:59:23,539 --> 01:59:25,539
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1011
01:59:29,378 --> 01:59:32,168
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about these things

1012
01:59:34,591 --> 01:59:37,391
but feel something you obviously did.

1013
01:59:41,682 --> 01:59:43,812
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1014
01:59:45,519 --> 01:59:47,019
Maybe more than a friendship.

1015
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:50,020
And I envy you.

1016
01:59:53,193 --> 01:59:56,533
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1017
01:59:57,364 --> 01:59:59,624
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1018
02:00:02,077 --> 02:00:03,617
but I am not such a parent.

1019
02:00:06,832 --> 02:00:10,342
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1020
02:00:11,461 --> 02:00:13,711
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1021
02:00:15,424 --> 02:00:18,594
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1022
02:00:21,138 --> 02:00:23,008
But to make yourself feel nothing

1023
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:25,676
so as not to feel anything.

1024
02:00:27,811 --> 02:00:28,901
What a waste.

1025
02:00:36,862 --> 02:00:38,202
Have I spoken out of turn?

1026
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:44,622
And I'll say one more thing,

1027
02:00:48,498 --> 02:00:49,708
it'll clear the air.

1028
02:00:52,711 --> 02:00:54,131
I may have come close

1029
02:00:55,672 --> 02:00:57,222
but I never had what you two have.

1030
02:01:00,177 --> 02:01:03,387
Something always held me back

1031
02:01:04,765 --> 02:01:06,605
or stood in the way.

1032
02:01:11,605 --> 02:01:13,695
How you live your life is your business.

1033
02:01:13,982 --> 02:01:16,532
Just remember,

1034
02:01:18,612 --> 02:01:21,872
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1035
02:01:24,993 --> 02:01:27,833
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1036
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:30,670
And as for your body,

1037
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:33,171
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1038
02:01:34,837 --> 02:01:36,497
much less wants to come near it.

1039
02:01:40,175 --> 02:01:46,465
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1040
02:01:47,015 --> 02:01:48,345
Don't kill it,

1041
02:01:50,018 --> 02:01:52,688
and with it, the joy you felt.

1042
02:02:04,783 --> 02:02:06,163
Does Mom know?

1043
02:02:11,957 --> 02:02:13,497
I don't think she does.

1044
02:03:18,315 --> 02:03:20,905
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

1045
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,530
Latkes.

1046
02:03:30,827 --> 02:03:32,497
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

1047
02:03:32,621 --> 02:03:33,711
To you too.

1048
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:55,853
She looks a bit weak.

1049
02:04:03,735 --> 02:04:05,985
She comes highly recommended by...

1050
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:11,082
Her special area of study is...

1051
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:15,746
I'll get it.

1052
02:04:19,668 --> 02:04:20,668
Hello?

1053
02:04:20,752 --> 02:04:22,462
Elio, you there?

1054
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:25,669
- Hi.
- Hey.

1055
02:04:26,216 --> 02:04:28,046
- How are you.
- I'm good.

1056
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:29,799
I'm good. How are you?

1057
02:04:29,887 --> 02:04:31,547
- How are your parents?
- I'm good. They're fine.

1058
02:04:32,139 --> 02:04:33,259
Good.

1059
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:36,230
I miss you.

1060
02:04:37,644 --> 02:04:38,814
I miss you too.

1061
02:04:40,063 --> 02:04:41,113
Very much.

1062
02:04:45,319 --> 02:04:47,989
- I have some news.
- News?

1063
02:04:50,824 --> 02:04:52,414
What, you're getting married?

1064
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:54,080
I suppose.

1065
02:04:56,455 --> 02:04:59,005
I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.

1066
02:05:02,586 --> 02:05:04,246
You never said anything.

1067
02:05:06,381 --> 02:05:08,551
Been off and on for three years.

1068
02:05:12,596 --> 02:05:13,926
That's wonderful news.

1069
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:17,271
Do you mind?

1070
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,778
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

1071
02:05:25,859 --> 02:05:27,859
- Oliver.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1072
02:05:27,945 --> 02:05:29,245
Darling, when are you coming back?

1073
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:31,163
I wish I was.

1074
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:34,910
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.

1075
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,660
- And guess what? He's a she.
- Oh, no.

1076
02:05:37,746 --> 02:05:40,456
Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.

1077
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:44,537
Wonderful!

1078
02:05:44,628 --> 02:05:46,498
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov!

1079
02:05:46,588 --> 02:05:48,668
- Congratulations, Oliver.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1080
02:05:48,757 --> 02:05:52,137
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.

1081
02:05:52,344 --> 02:05:54,434
- Happy Hanukkah!
- Happy Hanukkah!

1082
02:05:54,513 --> 02:05:55,643
Bye, sweetheart.

1083
02:06:03,397 --> 02:06:04,807
They know about us.

1084
02:06:06,275 --> 02:06:07,445
I figured.

1085
02:06:09,903 --> 02:06:11,153
How?

1086
02:06:12,906 --> 02:06:14,776
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

1087
02:06:16,201 --> 02:06:18,121
He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.

1088
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:20,004
Almost like a son-in-law.

1089
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:23,327
You're so lucky.

1090
02:06:24,918 --> 02:06:27,708
My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.

1091
02:06:30,257 --> 02:06:31,507
Elio.

1092
02:06:35,137 --> 02:06:39,177
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1093
02:06:42,853 --> 02:06:44,353
Oliver.

1094
02:06:47,232 --> 02:06:48,782
I remember everything.

1095
02:10:53,645 --> 02:10:54,935
Elio.

1096
02:10:57,191 --> 02:10:58,191
Elio.
