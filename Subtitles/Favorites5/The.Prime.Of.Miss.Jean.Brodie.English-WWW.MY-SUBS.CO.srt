1
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,270
Morning, girls.

2
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,730
Good morning.

3
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,520
There's Miss Brodie.

4
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,560
Miss Brodie!

5
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, girls, how lovely
to see you. Thank you.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,400
- I've been looking for you all over the place.
- Have you had a nice holiday?

7
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,010
Oh, you wait till
I tell you about Italy.

8
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,690
- Good morning, Miss Brodie.
- Morning, Miss Brodie.

9
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,460
Oh, good morning,
Mr. Lowther, Mr. Lloyd.

10
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,250
- Will you put that upstairs?
- Yes, Miss Brodie.

11
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,730
- Put that on the desk.
- Yes, Miss Brodie.

12
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Come on.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Good morning, Miss Mackay.

14
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,770
You take charge of these two new girls.
Please see that they know what they have to do.

15
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,890
- Yes, Miss Mackay.
- Thank you so much.

16
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,890
- Sheila, there's no need to run.
- No, Miss Mackay.

17
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,420
" Lord, behold us with Thy blessing "

18
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,410
" Once again assembled here "

19
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,980
" Onward be
our footsteps pressing "

20
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,600
" In Thy love
and faith and fear "

21
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,990
" Still protect us,
Still protect us "

22
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,330
" By Thy presence
ever near "

23
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,950
" For Thy mercy
we adore Thee "

24
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,850
" For this rest
upon our way "

25
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,730
" Lord, again we bow
before Thee "

26
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,330
" Speed our labors
day by day "

27
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,120
" Mind and spirit
Mind and spirit "

28
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,630
" With Thy choicest
gifts array "

29
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,580
" Keep the spell
of home affection "

30
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,180
" Still alive
in every heart "

31
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,850
" May its power
with mild direction "

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
" Draw our love
from self apart "

33
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,900
" Till Thy children
Till Thy children "

34
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,210
" Feel that Thou
their Father art "

35
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,620
" Break temptation's
fatal power "

36
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,840
" Shielding all
with guardian care "

37
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,370
" Safe in every
careless hour "

38
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,040
" Safe from sloth
and sensual snare "

39
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,350
" Thou, our savior
Thou, our savior "

40
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,320
" Still our failing
strength repair "

41
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Here comes Miss Brodie.

42
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,350
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Miss Brodie.

43
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,510
You may sit down.

44
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,560
Who opened the window?

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880
Whoever opened the window
has opened it too wide.

46
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,180
Six inches is
perfectly adequate.

47
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,350
More is vulgar.
Forsooth, one should have...

48
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,000
an innate sense of these things,
of what is suitable.

49
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,350
Morag, will you please?

50
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,740
Thank you.

51
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,580
I see we have
two new girls this term.

52
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,860
Will the two new girls
please stand up?

53
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
- You are?
- Emily Carstairs, Miss Brodie.

54
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,950
Emily Carstairs.

55
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,650
There.
You are inscribed.

56
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,670
Would you like to tell us
something about yourself, Emily?

57
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,990
I'm a Girl Guide, Miss Brodie.
I have six merit badges.

58
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,570
One for knot tying.
One for flag folding.

59
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,600
- Indeed.
- One--

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,720
For those who like that sort of thing,
that is the sort of thing they like.

61
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,050
You may sit down, Emily.

62
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,460
And this is Mary McGregor.

63
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,040
Well, what about you, Mary?
You don't look to me like a girl who ties knots.

64
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,110
N-N-No, Miss Brodie, but my b-b-brother does.

65
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,640
That is as it should be.

66
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,260
But what about you?
What are your interests?

67
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,160
I haven't g-got any.

68
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
I d-d-don't think.

69
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,900
That is what I am for,
Mary McGregor...

70
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
to provide you
with interests.

71
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,550
You may sit down now, Mary.

72
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,300
Little girls, I am in the business
of putting old heads on young shoulders.

73
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,230
All my pupils are
the crème de la crème.

74
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,750
Give me a girl
at an impressionable age...

75
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,290
and she is mine for life.

76
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,670
You girls are my vocation.

77
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,570
If I were to receive
a proposal of marriage tomorrow...

78
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,360
from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,
I would decline it.

79
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,200
I am dedicated
to you in my prime.

80
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,280
And my summer in Italy
has convinced me...

81
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,360
that I am truly
in my prime.

82
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,650
Emily, Mary McGregor,
you are new to this institution.

83
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,020
It is possible you will hear my teaching
methods decried in certain quarters...

84
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
as being unsuitable for a conservative school
like Marcia Blaine.

85
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,560
That is to say, a school dedicated
to the status quo.

86
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,710
Can anyone define
"status quo"?

87
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,200
Sandy?

88
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,650
Does it mean staying the same,
Miss Brodie?

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,680
Precisely.

90
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,600
Staying the same to the point
of petrification.

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,680
P-E-T-R-I-F...

92
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,760
I-C-A-T-I-O-N.

93
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,350
Petrification.

94
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,910
I do not intend to devote
my prime to petrification.

95
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,740
Prop up your books
in case of intruders.

96
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,700
If there are intruders,
we are doing our history.

97
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,740
But we will not
do our history.

98
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,380
Can anyone tell me who is
the greatest Italian painter?

99
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,810
Leonardo da Vinci,
Miss Brodie.

100
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,300
That is incorrect,Jenny.

101
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,410
The answer is Giotto.
He is my favorite.

102
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,930
Observe, little girls,
Stanley Baldwin...

103
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,480
who got in as prime minister
and got out again ere long.

104
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,630
Our headmistress,
Miss Mackay...

105
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,520
retains him on the walls because
she believes in the slogan "safety first".

106
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
Safety does not come first.

107
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,170
Goodness, Truth
and Beauty come first.

108
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,750
One's prime brings one's insight
into these things.

109
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,620
One's prime is the moment
one is born for.

110
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,010
You little girls must be
on the alert to recognize your prime...

111
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,270
at whatever time
it may occur...

112
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,840
and live it to the full.

113
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,330
"Season of mist
and mellow fruitfulness".

114
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,320
I want to tell you
of a moment in my life...

115
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,420
when I was very young...

116
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,660
younger even
than the man himself.

117
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,430
His name was Hugh.

118
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,190
I fell deeply in love
with Hugh...

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,940
in the last year
of the war...

120
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,370
but he fell
on Flanders field.

121
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,190
Helen McPhee, are you thinking
of doing a day's washing?

122
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,740
- No, Miss Brodie.
- You have your sleeves rolled up.

123
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,250
Roll them down at once.
I won't have to do with girls...

124
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,270
who roll up the sleeves
of their blouses.

125
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,670
We are civilized beings.

126
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,370
He fell on Flanders field.

127
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
He fell the week before
armistice was declared.

128
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,860
He fell like an autumn leaf.

129
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,710
Remind me to show you a map of Flanders
and the spot where my lover...

130
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,030
was laid to sleep forever,
before you were born.

131
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,140
"Come autumn so pensive
in yellow and gray...

132
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,250
and soothe me with tidings
of nature's decay".

133
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,380
Robert Burns.

134
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,760
Hugh fell
like an autumn leaf.

135
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,510
After the armistice,
people were dancing and singing forjoy...

136
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,640
in the streets, but...

137
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,840
Hugh was one of the flowers
of the forest...

138
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,530
lying in his grave.

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,720
What seems to be
ailing the spirits of...

140
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,740
Monica Maclaren,
isn't it?

141
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,740
Monica cries easily.

142
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,260
Well, Monica, perhaps you can
tell me why you are crying.

143
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
She's moved by a story
I have been telling...

144
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,410
of the Battle of Flodden.

145
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,410
Crying over
a history lesson?

146
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,460
It is a moving story.

147
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,540
The night before Flodden,
at Mercat Cross beside St. Giles...

148
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,310
a ghostly herald was heard
reading the names...

149
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,580
of all the noble families of Scotland
beginning with the king.

150
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,710
After the battle,
there was not one family...

151
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,440
who had not suffered
grievous loss...

152
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,470
as you well know,
Miss Mackay.

153
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,310
To be sure.

154
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Well, girls, I know you're all
going to work hard...

155
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,350
at every subject
this year.

156
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,870
A good beginning
makes a good ending.

157
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,180
I hope you all
had splendid holidays...

158
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,430
and I look forward to reading
your splendid essays...

159
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,880
on how you spent them.

160
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,740
You shouldn't be crying
over a history lesson at your age.

161
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,220
My word.

162
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
Thank you,Janet.

163
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,810
Good morning,
Miss Mackay.

164
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,340
You may sit down, girls.

165
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,290
You did well, Monica,
not to answer the question put to you.

166
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,180
It is well when in difficulties
to say never a word...

167
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
neither black
nor white.

168
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,390
But you did,
Miss Brodie.

169
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,630
You were in difficulty,
and you made up about Flodden.

170
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,750
Sandy, please try to do as I say
and not as I do.

171
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,380
Remember, you are
a child, Sandy...

172
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,680
and far from your prime.

173
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,660
- I hear I must congratulate you
on the birth of another child.
- Yes, another daughter.

174
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Have you never heard
of Marie Stopes...

175
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
architect for constructive birth control
and racial progress?

176
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,480
Ah, yes. An estimable woman. But my church
enjoins me to go forth and be fruitful.

177
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm aware of your unfortunate affiliation
with the Church of Rome.

178
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,060
I doubt, however,
whether that body gives...

179
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,780
the same interpretation
to go forth that you do.

180
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,060
My church understands human imperfection
and forgives it. Why can't you?

181
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,190
I am not interested in human imperfection.
I am interested in Beauty, in Art, in Truth.

182
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,490
In Art and Beauty, maybe.
In truth, no.

183
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
This is outrageous!

184
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
The truth is that you bounced
into bed with an artist...

185
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,680
... but you were horrified,
when you woke up with a man!

186
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,030
- R-Release me instantly!
- I finished your portrait,Jean.

187
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,490
- Come back to the studio. Come Sunday.
- I can't. I can't.

188
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,500
- Why not?
- I have another engagement!

189
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,510
- Well, break it!
- I can't possibly!

190
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,510
- I'm-I'm-- I'm going to Cramond.
- What for?

191
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,470
Mr. Lowther has invited me
to his estate at Cramond.

192
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,990
- Lowther?
- He has a small boat.

193
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm invited
to go sailing...

194
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,020
on Sunday.

195
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,720
What do you want me to do--
ravish you on the floor...

196
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,860
for the edification
of your girls?

197
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,380
- Here.
- Is this liver paste, Miss Brodie?

198
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,700
It is pâté de foie gras.

199
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,750
Pâté de foie gras.

200
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,830
Oh, it must be marvelous
to be French.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,440
The French have
a genius for food...

202
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,350
but I doubt French women
will ever get the vote.

203
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,680
I was quite emphatic about it.

204
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,290
"I'll not pull my punches,
Miss Mackay", I said.

205
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,720
"Miss Brodie's girls
are different".

206
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,540
- Oh, you said that?
- Oh, I said it, all right...

207
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,570
and I meant it.

208
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,580
Thank you,
Miss Lockhart.

209
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,940
The Brodie set, indeed.

210
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,910
Wee girls refusing
to wash their faces.

211
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh, Miss Brodie,
they informed me...

212
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,210
hasn't washed her face
in 20 years.

213
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,250
She looks clean enough
from here.

214
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,820
Miss Brodie prescribes
cold cream.

215
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,520
She always looks
so extreme.

216
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,880
This is my new girl,
Mr. Lowther, Mary McGregor.

217
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,050
Mr. Lowther. There's a great deal
Mr. Lowther can teach you...

218
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,300
about the modulation
of your tones.

219
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,310
Oh!

220
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,750
Miss Brodie, I thought-- that is,
I hoped there might be time...

221
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,820
for a wee cup of tea in the common room
before the afternoon classes.

222
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,140
Oh!

223
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,470
how nice of you
to ask me, Mr. Lowther.

224
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,490
Now, girls, I leave
Mary McGregor in your charge.

225
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,420
Thank you.

226
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,070
Well, Mary McGregor,
how much pocket money do you get?

227
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,560
O-O-One and six a week.

228
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,900
One and six?
Your father gives you one and six?

229
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
M-M-Mr. Ealing
gives it to me.

230
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,180
I don't have
a f-f-father or mother.

231
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,220
- Who's Mr. Ealing?
- At the b-b-bank. He's our guardian.

232
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,620
He takes care
of the m-m-money.

233
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,560
Well, I'd like to be an orphan heiress
and get my pocket money...

234
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
from bankers that
don't know any better.

235
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,640
Does your brother
get one and six too?

236
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,480
I d-d-don't know.
He's 14.

237
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,440
My b-b-brother
has run away...

238
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,560
from four schools.

239
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,410
Your brother sounds
like a bad lot.

240
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
So I thought that this Sunday...

241
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,490
I would treat myself
to one last day...

242
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,130
of sun and water.

243
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,480
I wonder, Mr. Lowther,
if you might be able to help me.

244
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,570
- In what way, Miss Brodie?
- Why, you might know if there's any possibility...

245
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,700
of my renting
a little boat at Cramond.

246
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,150
Oh, well, Miss Brodie,
I have a boat.

247
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, do you, Mr. Lowther?

248
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,450
It would give me
the greatest pleasure, uh--

249
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,460
I mean, i-if you would consider
coming with me.

250
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,460
Oh, but I couldn't
trouble you, Mr. Lowther.

251
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,350
Trouble? Oh, Miss Brodie,
I would have asked you before many times...

252
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,550
but I-- I didn't want
to seem to push myself.

253
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,160
Please, Miss Brodie,
say you'll come with me.

254
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,340
Very well, Mr. Lowther.
On Sunday?

255
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,290
On Sunday.

256
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,190
After church, of course.

257
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,950
Oh, of course, Mr. Lowther.

258
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,680
Do you think Mr. Lloyd
is the crème de la crème...

259
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,700
or Mr. Lowther?

260
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,020
Neither. It's us.

261
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
''Little girls, if you will
only listen to me...

262
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,050
I will make of you
the crème de la crème.''

263
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,770
My father says these are
the happiest days of our lives.

264
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,920
But if these are supposed
to be the happiest...

265
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,480
why does Miss Brodie
say prime is best?

266
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,710
Miss Brodie never got married
like our mothers and fathers.

267
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,400
- They don't have primes.
- They have sexual intercourse.

268
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,070
- Oh, I don't like to think about it.
- You don't have to.

269
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,860
It happens on
the spur of the moment.

270
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,900
You lead.

271
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,530
- How do you know?
- About what?

272
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,900
What you were saying-- about how sexual
intercourse happens on the spur of the moment.

273
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,600
Because it happened to Teenie,
that works in my father's shop...

274
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,030
when she was out walking
at Puddocky with her boyfriend.

275
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,400
They had to get married.

276
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,740
You'd think the urge would have passed
by the time they'd got their clothes off.

277
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,840
Yes. That's what
I can't understand.

278
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,890
People take their clothes off
in front of each other.

279
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,090
It's so rude.

280
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,740
They're bound to be
put off their passion.

281
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,130
Do you think Miss Brodie
ever had sexual intercourse...

282
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,390
with Hugh of Flanders field...
before he fell?

283
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,930
I don't know.

284
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,470
I don't think
they did anything like that.

285
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,530
Their love
was above all that.

286
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,020
Well, Miss Brodie said
they clung to each other...

287
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,080
with passionate abandon
on his last leave.

288
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,390
I don't think they took
their clothes off though. Do you?

289
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,420
No. I can't see it.

290
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,270
Observe, little girls,
the castle.

291
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,140
It is built on a rock
of volcanic plug.

292
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,260
It was through
one of yon windows...

293
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,100
that Mary, Queen of Scots
lowered her infant son...

294
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,500
straight down 187 feet
in a basket in a high wind.

295
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
Mary McGregor, will you please
do up your shoelace?

296
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
Oh. Observe the litter.

297
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,450
In Italy, Mussolini has put an end
to litter in the streets.

298
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,090
Do any of you little girls remember what
the followers of Mussolini are called?

299
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,630
- Fascisti.
- That is correct. F-A-S-C-I-S-T-I.

300
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,780
Fascisti.
And Mussolini is called?

301
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,900
- "Dukee".
- Il Duce. That is to say, the leader.

302
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,990
Il Duce.
We move on.

303
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,990
Ah.

304
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Straighten your shoulders,
Mary McGregor.

305
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,360
All you girls must learn to
walk with your heads up, up...

306
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,180
like Sybil Thorndike,
a woman of noble mean.

307
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
In the Kirk
of the Greyfriars...

308
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,470
on the 20th day
of February, 1638...

309
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,670
the people of Scotland
pledged themselves...

310
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,920
to the Presbyterian faith.

311
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,890
Many of them used their own blood
to sign the covenant.

312
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,010
- Ew.
- This part of Edinburgh is very rich in history.

313
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,100
It is very romantic.

314
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,140
So you see, little girls,
you must always remember...

315
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,330
you are citizens of Edinburgh,
city of Hume and Boswell.

316
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,340
You are Europeans,
not dowdy provincials.

317
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,820
- Sandy, what on earth are you doing?
- Walking like Sybil Thorndike.

318
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,650
You know, one day, Sandy,
one day you will go too far.

319
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Lloyd.

320
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,330
Girls, you know Mr. Lloyd, the art master
from the senior school.

321
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,400
- Yes.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Lloyd.

322
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,320
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Mr. Lloyd has his studio
somewhere in this neighborhood.

323
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,120
Number six-- fourth floor, front.
The door's always open.

324
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,830
I've been giving my girls an outing.
We've been to the gallery.

325
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,900
I've been telling them
the story of Gauguin.

326
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,470
Ah, the dangerous Miss Brodie.

327
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,490
By whom, pray,
am I considered to be dangerous?

328
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,730
It is the consensus.
Your girls are said to be vastly informed...

329
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,550
in subjects irrelevant
to the accepted curriculum.

330
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,380
Most heinous of all,
you are said to inculcate no team spirit.

331
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,420
Is that true, girls?

332
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,340
Does Miss Brodie incite you
to shirk your duties on the hockey field?

333
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,940
Phrases like the "team spirit" are always
employed to cut across individualism.

334
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,330
Cleopatra knew nothing of the team spirit,
if you read your Shakespeare.

335
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,150
And where would the team spirit
have got Anna Pavlova?

336
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,220
She is the prima ballerina.

337
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,420
It is the corps de ballet
that had the team spirit.

338
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,470
Oh, Miss Brodie,
you are dangerous.

339
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,560
Mm-hmm. Yes.
We must away and catch our tram.

340
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,480
I doubt we will get seats.
It is 1932, and chivalry is dead.

341
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,770
Miss Brodie?

342
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,300
I do want you to come and see
the picture, the one I told you about.

343
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
What about
next weekend?

344
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,570
- No. I'm afraid I'm going--
- Going to Cramond?

345
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,900
Why, yes. My girls and I spend nearly
every weekend at Cramond.

346
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Mr. Lowther
is most hospitable.

347
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,840
Good afternoon,
Mr. Lloyd.

348
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,870
Come along, girls.

349
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
Got it!

350
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,250
There we are.

351
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,940
- Oh, there's some nice ones up here.
- No. Get one.

352
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,330
- I'm watching. It's all right.
- Watch out.

353
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,460
Thank you.

354
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,010
Crepe de Chine.

355
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,050
Miss Brodie's legs
are longer than Mr. Lowther's.

356
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,420
She'd have to
wrap hers around his.

357
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,030
First he puts out
the light.

358
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,140
Then their toes touch.

359
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,500
Then--
"Miss Brodie, Miss Brodie".

360
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,090
Miss Brodie says,
"Darling".

361
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,310
- She says--
- "Mr. Lowther...

362
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,440
you are
the crème de la crème".

363
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,710
We will have to watch
Miss Brodie's stomach.

364
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,250
It is the curve
I am attempting to introduce you to.

365
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,530
The curve here
in this drape...

366
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,980
and here,
and here in the arm.

367
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,440
The curve flows through
a painting like a river.

368
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,430
It is sinuous, sensuous...

369
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,870
epitomizing everything
that is female.

370
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,960
The curve is
a beckoning line...

371
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,490
here, and here.

372
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,560
And here,
in the breast.

373
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,050
And the belly!
And the buttocks!

374
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,830
- Shut up!

375
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,860
Go on.
Get along with you.

376
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,260
Go to your sewing classes
and your singing lessons. It's all you deserve.

377
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,680
"They flee from me...

378
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
who once did seek me out".

379
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,670
I miss you,Jean.
Shall I beg you?

380
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,960
Please, come back.

381
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,260
You have a family.
I am a teacher.

382
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,230
I had a family last June.
You were a teacher last June.

383
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,110
My God. I wish I had a pound note
for every time I've heard you say...

384
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,990
"I am a teacher. I am a teacher.
First, last and always".

385
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,580
What a firm reminder
your postcard was.

386
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,340
A postcard
from romantic Italy.

387
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,580
The incomparable
Giotto frescoes--

388
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,500
How triumphantly his figures vibrate
with life. Yours truly, J. Brodie".

389
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,660
A postcard from my passionate,
abandoned inamorata.

390
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,530
That night
at the studio--

391
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,030
that one night
at the studio...

392
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,180
I was pleased to feel it was I
who enjoyed the tutorial position.

393
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,270
Come back,Jean.

394
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,190
I need you.

395
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,780
M-M-M--

396
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,110
Mary McGregor!

397
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,760
Mary McGregor, do you know
what happened to Peeping Tom?

398
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,670
His eyes were shriveled
into darkness in his head...

399
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,750
and dropped before him!

400
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,220
Poor old Tom.

401
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,590
Don't worry, Jean. You've got your girls
well trained. You're safe from that quarter.

402
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,160
It's me you've got
to worry about.

403
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,790
Come to the studio.
Come to pose again.

404
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,530
- Only to pose.
- You should paint one of my girls.

405
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,330
- Jenny is the pretty one.
- Hang your girls. It's you I want to paint.

406
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,360
I will not come
to the studio.

407
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,610
Then to hell with you!

408
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,400
Teddy, you know,
you really should paintJenny.

409
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,600
You'd likeJenny.
She has a profile...

410
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,620
of deceptive purity.

411
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,280
What's the matter with you, Mary?
What's happened to you?

412
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Your face is all funny.

413
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,460
N-No, it's not.

414
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,950
Yes, it is, Mary.
Very funny.

415
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,970
So is your voice.

416
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,970
Well, well.
Miss Brodie's brood, I presume.

417
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,340
Yes, Mr. Lloyd.

418
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,990
- Would you like a rosebud?
- A what?

419
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,140
It's the favorite sweet
of little Princess Margaret Rose.

420
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,670
Unmistakably Brodie.

421
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,290
And you, I suppose,
are the pretty one.

422
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,980
Good afternoon, girls.

423
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,660
Mary, you're definitely
upset about something.

424
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,070
- N-No.
- Tell! Tell, or I'll pinch you.

425
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,010
- Tell.
- No, I w-won't tell.

426
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,690
I love Miss Brodie,
and I won't t-tell.

427
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,710
What about Miss Brodie?

428
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,960
Tell, or we'll take you
into the locker room...

429
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,050
- and hang you over the banisters.
- You wouldn't d-dare.

430
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,780
- Tell!
- It's n-none of your b-b-business!

431
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,220
Ow! Ow!

432
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,270
No! Stop!

433
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,710
Get your hands off of me! Help!

434
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,980
- Let go of me!
- Aaah! No!

435
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,030
If you scream again...

436
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,390
we'll drop you squoosh
on your silly head.

437
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,600
Mary, dear, if something's happened
with Miss Brodie, you should tell me.

438
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,620
- What have you done?
- She was s-so angry!

439
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,020
Well, you know
how you are, Mary.

440
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

441
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,410
I j-j-just went in.

442
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,740
- In where?
- The classroom!

443
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,790
So?

444
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,870
There they were!

445
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,600
- There who were?
- Oh, Mr. Lowther.!

446
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,630
Miss Brodie
and Mr. Lowther.!

447
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,950
No! M-M-Mr. Lloyd!
They were kissing!

448
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,860
Kissing?

449
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,730
I saw them k-k-kissing...

450
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,250
together.

451
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,270
- He had his arms around her.
- Mr. Lloyd!

452
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
Mr. Lloyd! Mr. Lloyd's
in love with Miss Brodie!

453
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,510
And she's in l-love
with M-Mr. Lloyd.

454
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,770
You should have
s-seen them.

455
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,380
But what about
Mr. Lowther then?

456
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,050
Mr. Lloyd is an artist.
And Miss Brodie's artistic too.

457
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,360
Miss Brodie's really in love with
Mr. Lloyd, but he's married to another...

458
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,540
so she's working it off
on Mr. Lowther.

459
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,910
- Oh.
- Let's go home.

460
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,260
Listen, Mary.

461
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,260
Was it a long,
lingering kiss?

462
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,620
I shouldn't have
t-told you.

463
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,040
But since you did,
was it a long, lingering kiss?

464
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,990
- Yes.
- I see.

465
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,020
- Didn't they hear you?
- I d-don't think so.

466
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,260
They jumped apart though.

467
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,430
You mean,
they sensed your presence?

468
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,520
I d-d-don't know.

469
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,010
Was it like this--

470
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,130
That's it! That's it!

471
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,420
It's nearly 5:00. Time you girls were away.
What were you doing, Sandy?

472
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,470
-Just playacting, Miss Mackay.
- Playacting at what?

473
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,000
- Opera.
- Opera?

474
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,670
Yes, Miss Mackay.
We've been studying Traviata.

475
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,590
Sandy, show me
what you were doing.

476
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,080
Go on. Show me.

477
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,200
That's enough, Sandy.

478
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,510
She was doing Violetta
expiring for love of Alfredo.

479
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,710
- It's very sad.
- Oh, nonsense.

480
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
Violetta did not expire
for love of Alfredo.

481
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,240
Violetta was a thoroughly silly woman
with diseased lungs.

482
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,310
If she'd been properly
brought up...

483
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,830
she'd have been out on the hockey field,
breathing deeply.

484
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,210
Which is precisely what
you little girls should be doing.

485
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,030
Traviata is not
on the Marcia Blaine curriculum.

486
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,140
But Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther
took us to see Traviata...

487
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,390
when the Carl Rosa Company
came to Edinburgh.

488
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
Miss Brodie and Mr. Lowther
took you to the opera?

489
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,040
Mr. Lowther's jolly nice.
We go to visit him at Cramond too.

490
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,170
When Miss Brodie goes...
on weekends.

491
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,650
How very nice
of Mr. Lowther...

492
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,670
and Miss Brodie.

493
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,790
I hope you're appreciative.

494
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,350
My, my. Miss Brodie's very musical,
I believe--

495
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,740
theaters, concerts
and the opera.

496
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,870
Miss Brodie
is very musical.

497
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,490
I think Miss Brodie's
more interested in art, Miss Mackay.

498
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,990
Now, what makes you think
Miss Brodie prefers art to music, Sandy?

499
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,060
She told us so.

500
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,100
Music is an interest to her,
but painting is a passion.

501
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,260
Miss Brodie said.

502
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,350
- A passion?
- Compared to music.

503
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,540
Well, Mary...

504
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,770
I'm sure you're too young
to have passions.

505
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,020
- What are your cultural interests?
- Stories.

506
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,750
Does Miss Brodie
tell you stories?

507
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,260
Oh, yes.

508
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,000
L-L-Love--

509
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,480
Lovely stories.

510
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,020
- Stories like Traviata?
- Stories of history.

511
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,600
- History.
- She makes history seem like the cinema.

512
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,350
- No. Not the cinema. More like Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.

513
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,740
Indeed.

514
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,200
My, what would we do
without Miss Brodie?

515
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,460
I could wish
your arithmetic papers were better.

516
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,430
Culture is no compensation
for lack ofhard knowledge.

517
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,170
I'm happy to see you are devoted
to Miss Brodie.

518
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,150
Your loyalty is also
due to the school.

519
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,470
I'm always impressed
by Miss Brodie's girls--

520
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
in one way or another.

521
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,920
Benito Mussolini
is a great man.

522
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,030
He began life
as a journalist--

523
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,030
a man of learning,
an intellectual--

524
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,190
but he is also
a man of action.

525
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,960
He has made Capri
into a sanctuary for birds.

526
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
A simple act of goodness.

527
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,420
If you all turn to page 25 of your
geography books,you'll find a map of Capri.

528
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,540
It's off the coast of Naples.

529
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,950
It is because of Il Duce
thousands of birds live and sing there today...

530
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,290
that might well have ended
their careers on a piece of toast.

531
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,170
Miss Gaunt,
is there something you wanted?

532
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,890
Thank you.

533
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,480
"Dear Miss Brodie,
I hope it will be convenient for you...

534
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,130
''to see me in my office
this afternoon at 4:15.

535
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,920
Emmaline Mackay".

536
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,350
4:15. Not 4:00.
Not 4:30, but 4:15.

537
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,730
She thinks to intimidate me,
by the use of quarter hours.

538
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,670
Now, as I was
attempting to say...

539
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,190
Benito Mussolini
is indeed a man of action.

540
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,230
Come in.

541
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:53,470
4:15. I was afraid
I might be late, or early.

542
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,720
Not at all.
You are most punctilious.

543
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,210
Thank you
for finding the time.

544
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,590
I know how busy
your girls keep you.

545
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,980
- Please, sit down.
- Oh. Thank you.

546
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,490
What a colorful frock.

547
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,330
Color enlivens the spirit,
does it not?

548
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,000
Perhaps you're right, though I wonder
if the spirits of the girls need enlivening.

549
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Oh, indeed they do!

550
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,440
My credo is,
"Lift, enliven, stimulate"

551
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,620
No doubt.
But the Marcia Blaine School...

552
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,660
is essentially
a conservative school.

553
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,590
We do not encourage
the, uh, progressive attitudes.

554
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,670
Now, Miss Brodie,
I have noticed...

555
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,550
a spirit of precocity among your girls--
your special girls.

556
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,230
- Why, thank you.
- Oh.

557
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,260
I am in my prime...

558
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,820
and my girls are
benefiting from it.

559
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,250
I'm proud to think that perhaps
my girls are more aware.

560
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,630
- Precisely. Now--
- To me, education is a leading out.

561
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,010
The word education comes
from the root "ex", meaning "out",

562
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,060
and "duco": "I lead".

563
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,700
To me, education is simply a--
a leading out...

564
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,900
of what is
already there.

565
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,880
I had hoped there might also be
a certain amount of putting in.

566
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,910
That would not be education, but intrusion...

567
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
from the root prefix "in",
meaning "in",

568
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,040
and the stem "trudo": "I thrust".

569
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,800
Ergo, to thrust a lot
of information into a pupil's head.

570
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,250
To discuss education with such
a dedicated teacher...

571
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,290
is always instructive.

572
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,740
However, it was not for that reason
I asked you to come here.

573
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,920
Miss Brodie...

574
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,800
I am told that you make
weekly expeditions to Cramond.

575
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,590
Yes. Isn't it
a lovely spot?

576
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,640
It is, indeed.

577
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,360
I believe Mr. Lowther inherited
the estate from his mother.

578
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,390
He's lived there
all his life.

579
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,080
Mr. Lowther is not
a worldly man...

580
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,270
not a reckless man.

581
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,030
It is doubtful whether he would
recognize recklessness in others.

582
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,630
And recklessness
is an indulgence...

583
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,970
that we at Marcia Blaine
must eschew...

584
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,190
not only within our walls,
but in the personal life--

585
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,560
the conduct, as it were,
of the teaching staff.

586
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,770
Oh, Miss Mackay...

587
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,870
I do not believe I have
ever fully appreciated...

588
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,400
the taxing load of trivia...

589
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,740
with which a headmistress
must concern herself.

590
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,880
I must concern myself, Miss Brodie,
with this school's board of governors.

591
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,930
I flatter myself that I am not
unknown to the board...

592
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,450
having been a member
of the staff of Marcia Blaine...

593
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,350
six years prior
to your engagement, Miss Mackay.

594
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,750
I feel quite safe in saying...

595
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,050
that no member of the board
has ever shown anything...

596
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,620
but appreciation and approval
of my teaching methods.

597
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,770
Oh! Oh, Miss Mackay...

598
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,580
I use the woods of Cramond
for lessons in botany...

599
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,010
the rocks of the shore to investigate
the mysteries of geology.

600
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,670
It should be patently clear
that my expeditions to Cramond...

601
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,180
are expeditions for enrichment.

602
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:14,490
Enrichment for my girls...
and for Marcia Blaine.

603
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,970
Well.
Thank you, Miss Brodie.

604
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,050
I feel sure you and I have come
to understand each other better.

605
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,130
I'm always
at your command, Miss Mackay.

606
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,460
I am delighted
to hear it.

607
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,710
Good day, Miss Brodie.

608
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,480
Oh, chrysanthemums.

609
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,240
Such serviceable flowers.
Mmm.

610
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,390
May I have a word with you,
Miss Gaunt?

611
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,800
Miss Gaunt, you are, of course,
aware of the problem...

612
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,670
when a teacher has tenure
and the loyalty of her pupils.

613
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,350
It's not going to
be easy, Miss Gaunt.

614
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,610
However, no doubt,
in due time...

615
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,660
some advantage will
be vouchsafed us.

616
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,510
In the meanwhile, I would deem it
a sincere service to the school...

617
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,510
if any indiscretion
that might reach your ears...

618
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,870
should also reach mine.

619
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,610
Also, your brother...

620
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,360
is a deacon of Cramond Kirk,
is he not...

621
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,790
and naturally eager
to preserve its sanctity?

622
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,050
Thank you, Miss Gaunt.

623
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,060
What are you writing?

624
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,660
"My dear, delightful Gordon...

625
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,310
your letter has moved me deeply,
as you may imagine.

626
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,290
But, alas, I must ever decline
to be Mrs. Lowther.

627
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,330
My reasons
are twofold--

628
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,100
I am dedicated to my girls,
as is madame Pavlova...

629
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,130
and there is another
in my life.

630
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,130
He is Teddy Lloyd".

631
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,800
Here. Let me. Let me.

632
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,330
"But we can still have...

633
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,710
many a breezy day
in the fishing boat...

634
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,770
at sea".

635
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,880
- Shh!
- What are you two girls up to?

636
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,520
Gather your things together,
and leave at once.

637
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,500
This is a library,
not a fun fair!

638
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,180
- Are those your books?
- No, Miss McKenzie.

639
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,280
I want you to remember, girls...

640
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,680
that it is
of primary importance...

641
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,210
that the upper
and lower tensions...

642
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,280
are perfectly even.

643
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,360
And secondly, girls,
it is most important...

644
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,410
to ensure that
you are using...

645
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,450
the correct length
of stitch.

646
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:50,930
If we were to fill this room
with the hydrogen being made in thesejars...

647
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,000
and then
strike a match...

648
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,640
there'd be an explosion large enough
to reduce this building to rubble.

649
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,190
- Look. I'll show you.

650
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,460
" Hey,Johnnie Cope
are ye waukin' yet "

651
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,470
" Or are your drums
a-beatin' yet "

652
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,470
" If ye were waukin'
I wad wait "

653
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,360
" To gang to the coals
in the mornin' "

654
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,390
All together now.

655
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,390
" Hey,Johnnie Cope
are ye waukin' yet "

656
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,390
" Or are your drums
a-beatin' yet "

657
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,400
" If ye were waukin'
I wad wait "

658
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,520
" To gang to the coals
in the mornin' ""

659
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,840
The sun!

660
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,860
Forsooth, we are renewed.
Refreshment alfresco.

661
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,020
Enough to go round,
but the lion's share for Mr. Lowther.

662
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,320
This term, I have sworn
to fatten Mr. Lowther...

663
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,850
by a full half-stone.

664
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,390
That is my pledge.

665
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,490
Did I neglect to tell you girls that once,
on leave from the war...

666
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,860
Hugh took me out sailing
on a fishing boat.

667
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,560
We spent our happiest times among
the rocks and pebbles of a small seaport.

668
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,510
Sometimes Hugh would sing.

669
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,310
He had a rich tenor voice.

670
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,780
At other times, he would set up
his easel and paint.

671
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,240
Hugh was very talented
in both arts...

672
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,660
but I think...

673
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,840
I think the painter
was the real Hugh.

674
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,940
But you girls
are my life now.

675
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,300
I am the potter,
and you are my pride.

676
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,360
You are shaping up.

677
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,360
Soon you will graduate
to the senior school...

678
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,360
and I will no longer
teach you...

679
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,800
but you will always be
Brodie girls.

680
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,220
Ah! Here comes
our Mr. Lowther.

681
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,040
"Our minstrel sweet,
oh, synge unto me roundelaie.

682
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,160
Oh, droppe
the brynie tear with me.

683
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,960
De da de da de da de da
and like a running river be".

684
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,680
Now, Mr. Lowther, you must
cooperate with the fattening project.

685
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,470
It will enrich your voice.
Caruso had the appetite of a giant.

686
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,660
- What good care you take of me.

687
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,270
" La, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la la-la "

688
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,740
I was noticed at the theater.

689
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,040
I was noticed and reported
to Mr. Gaunt.

690
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,810
Mr. Gaunt?
Oh, that deacon at Cramond.

691
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,890
Whatever for?

692
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,210
Well, he considered
Hedda Gabler--

693
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,350
Well, he said
that the choirmaster of his church...

694
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,950
had no business attending that sort of thing
with an unmarried lady and children.

695
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,430
O-Oh, I defended myself...

696
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,040
fiercely.

697
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,230
Girls, as you hear,
there's now been an attempt...

698
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,560
to persecute Mr. Lowther
on our account.

699
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,410
One must never succumb
to provincial ignorance.

700
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,450
Mr. Lowther did not...

701
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,530
nor shall anyone
under my tutelage.

702
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,690
Now, eat up, Mr. Lowther.
What is it, Sandy?

703
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,270
Miss Mackay is watching us
from her window.

704
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,420
Oh, indeed.

705
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,780
I wonder how many more picnics
we will be allowed...

706
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,030
before Miss Mackay thinks
fit to patrol the grounds.

707
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:51,590
It is Miss Mackay's hope to harass me...

708
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,790
into leaving Marcia Blaine.

709
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,800
Miss Gaunt
and certain teachers...

710
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,440
have taken to bidding me good morning
with predestination in their smiles.

711
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,280
Do you really think
Miss Mackay wants to drive you away?

712
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,750
It doesn't signify
what Miss Mackay wants.

713
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,170
Here I am, and here I stay.
I would not leave you girls for the Lord--

714
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,070
Lyon, king of arms.

715
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,150
Not even he! I shall remain
in this education factory...

716
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,190
where my duty lies.

717
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,230
If they want to get rid of me,
they'll have to--

718
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,240
...assassinate me!

719
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,400
Now, eat up, Mr. Lowther.

720
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,450
Cooperation is the keynote. Now,Jenny,
do us a cartwheel for comic relief.

721
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,430
- Oh! Wonderful!
- Bravo. Bravo! Bravo!

722
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,660
Bravo! Oh.

723
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,310
- Oh.
- These are my girls, Mr. Lowther.

724
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,860
Forsooth, they are Brodie girls.

725
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:51,450
Monica--
Monica is histrionic.

726
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,150
She will perform
in plays...

727
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,820
or perhaps write them.

728
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,850
Mary...

729
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,850
our Mary is alone
in this world.

730
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,170
Her needs are great,
but she has me.

731
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,830
Mary will stop stuttering.
She will brisk up.

732
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,380
Mary McGregor will
distinguish herself for me.

733
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
I have no doubt.

734
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,360
Then there is Jenny.

735
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,690
Sometimes I feel there is
a spiritual bond...

736
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,700
between Jenny and me.

737
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,180
I don't expectJenny feels this yet,
but someday she will.

738
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,440
And Sandy...

739
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,340
... Sandy is...

740
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,020
- ... Sandy is dependable.
- Oh, Sandy.

741
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,210
Sandy is very dependable.

742
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,660
Now, Monica,
recite for us, please.

743
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,680
What shall I recite,
Miss Brodie?

744
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,000
Something--
Something of magic.

745
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,820
"There she weaves
by night and day...

746
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,650
a magic web
with colors gay.

747
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,690
She has heard
a whisper say...

748
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,690
a curse is on her
if she stay...

749
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,690
to look down
on Camelot.

750
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,930
She knows not what
the curse may be".

751
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,320
Mr. Lowther,
the Philistines are upon us.

752
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,690
She knows not what
the curse may be...

753
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,740
and so she
weaveth steadily...

754
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,150
and little
other care hath she...

755
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,570
the Lady
of Shalott.

756
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,100
But in her web,
she still delights...

757
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,530
to weave the mirror's
magic sights...

758
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,670
for often through
the silent nights...

759
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,990
a funeral with plumes
and lights and music...

760
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,050
went to Camelot...

761
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,050
or when the moon
was overhead...

762
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,060
came two young lovers
lately wed.

763
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,620
I am half sick
of shadows,

764
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,460
said the Lady
of Shalott.

765
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,840
The Lady of Shalott.

766
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,030
I think perhaps someday...

767
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:06,230
Jenny will catch the eye
of an artist.

768
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,560
Jenny will be
painted many times.

769
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,970
In years to come...

770
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,040
I think thatJenny
will be famous...

771
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,040
for...

772
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,040
sex.

773
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:25,210
Well, Monica,
what do you think of it?

774
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,970
It makes her look
very... mature.

775
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,050
I am very mature.

776
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,130
We're all mature.

777
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:34,490
Some people at the school
think you're too mature.

778
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,510
Everyone's jealous.

779
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,070
They know the Brodie set
has more fun than anyone else.

780
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,420
We go places, and we do things.

781
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,120
And now you've taken to
hanging around an artist's studio.

782
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:50,950
- Very glamorous.
- Miss Brodie's g-g-glamorous, don't you think?

783
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,670
Mr. Lowther thinks she is.

784
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,050
Sandy's awfully late.
Do you think she's coming?

785
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,510
Three years of Cramond
and Mr. Lowther.

786
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,250
- What stamina.
- There's always lovely food at Cramond.

787
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,680
Lasagna verde.

788
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,980
Sweetbreads ŕ la Milanese.

789
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
"Harlot" russe.

790
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,640
Charlotte russe.

791
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,190
Miss Brodie takes good care
of Mr. Lowther.

792
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,490
- What does Mr. Lowther do for Miss Brodie?
- He sings to her.

793
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,050
Put that wet thing
over there.

794
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,090
Mary, for the third time
this afternoon...

795
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,290
- will you get out of the way?
- Sorry.

796
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,710
Mary McGregor.

797
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,150
Well, Mary, what's new on the Rialto?
What's new with your brother?

798
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,310
How's he progressing
up at Oxford?

799
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:45,190
His t-t-tutor
caught fire.

800
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,510
Caught fire?
His tutor?

801
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,480
- Well, how? From what?
- From my brother.

802
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,890
Your brother set fire
to the tutor?

803
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,200
Your brother should be put
in a house of correction.

804
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,520
It makes me look
very mature.

805
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,380
It makes you look
like Miss Brodie.

806
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,330
All the sketches ofJenny do too.
They all look like Miss Brodie.

807
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,420
- I think they do.
- Ew.!

808
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,840
I painted that chap
in my student days.

809
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,840
It's what's called
a "life study".

810
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,930
I had a difficult time
with the pectoral muscles.

811
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,970
Pectoral?

812
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,970
- Chest.
- Oh.

813
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,970
- Oh, Monica!
- What?

814
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,620
Miss Brodie says that anyone
of a cultured home and heritage...

815
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,210
- makes no fuss about the human body.
- Who's making any fuss?

816
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:43,830
- You are.
- I have as much heritage as you do any day.

817
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,860
I think that's enough
for today.

818
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,900
If I keep on,
I shall ruin the mouth...

819
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,430
and that would
be a pity.

820
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,050
- What do you think?
- Well, uh, I think that it's--

821
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,600
- It's--
- Miss Brodie says thatJenny
will be painted many times.

822
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,780
- And what does she say about you?
- That I am dependable.

823
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,950
When should I come back?

824
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,960
Whenever you have time.
Come next Saturday.

825
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,640
- All right. Come on, Sandy. I'm starving.
- I can't come with you.

826
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,750
- I've got to meet my mother.
- Oh, your eternal mother!

827
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,920
- Good-bye, girls.
- Bye, Mr. Lloyd.

828
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,370
- My feet are wet.
- Take your shoes off then, silly.

829
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,560
Dry them
by the stove.

830
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,850
I'll make some tea.

831
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,320
- Aren't there any more biscuits?
- No, that's the lot.

832
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,580
I'm not up to
Cramond standards, I fear.

833
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,510
Lasagna verde,
"harlot" russe.

834
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,830
A wonder all that rich food
doesn't give old Lowther a stoppage.

835
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,370
He eats his greens.

836
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,570
Do you paint portraits
of your own children too?

837
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,900
Is that your wife?

838
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,780
That's my wife.
Her name is Deirdre.

839
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,870
Is she in her prime?

840
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,270
Perhaps
not quite yet.

841
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,290
One day, I'd like to paint
all you Brodie girls.

842
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,050
It'd be interesting to see what sort
of group I can make of you.

843
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,800
We'd all look like
one great big Brodie I suppose.

844
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,520
You're a clever little cat,
aren't you?

845
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,360
That will teach you to look
at an artist like that.

846
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,550
Don't you want
the rest of your things?

847
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,780
Can't have you running through
the streets like a wee whore.

848
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,780
Oh, there's Sandy!

849
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,310
Sandy!

850
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,090
Sandy.!
Sandy, dear.!

851
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,750
Hello, Miss Brodie,
Mr. Lowther.

852
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,790
Whatever are you
doing in this neighborhood?

853
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,560
Mr. Lowther and I have been shopping
for tomorrow's lunch.

854
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,670
Thank goodness we can still have
our Sunday lunch at Cramond.

855
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,400
I can't tell you how much I miss
having you girls in my class this year.

856
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,470
We miss you too,
Miss Brodie.

857
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,550
Tomorrow, I must tell you girls
of a new plot Miss Mackay has...

858
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,960
to force me to apply for a post at a progressive--
that is to say a crank-- school.

859
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,540
But I shall stay at Marcia Blaine
where my duty lies.

860
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,680
- If they want to get rid of me, they will have to--
- Assassinate you.

861
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:26,050
Precisely. I thought you were to attend
some social gathering with Jenny.

862
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,910
- Where is Jenny?
- She went on home ahead of me.

863
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,380
- I stayed at the studio--
- The studio?

864
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,410
She-- Uh,
Jenny just left, you see.

865
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,770
Mr. Lloyd's studio.
Whatever were you doing there?

866
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,830
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

867
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,310
Jenny is sitting
for Mr. Lloyd.

868
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:50,190
Jenny is sitting
for Mr. Lloyd--

869
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,770
And I wasn't--
When did this begin?

870
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,640
- At the start of term. I shouldn't have told you.
-Jean--

871
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:59,750
Oh, I'm very glad
you did tell me, Sandy.

872
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,580
You are developing into a girl
of great insight.

873
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,640
- Thank you, Miss Brodie.
- You know, Sandy...

874
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,800
I would be very interested to hear
your own impressions ofJenny's portrait.

875
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,850
But we won't discuss it
with the others.

876
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,700
So Monday, after school,
you'll come to my flat for tea.

877
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,850
We'll have a nice,
quiet time together.

878
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,900
Yes, Miss Brodie.

879
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,380
Well, come now. I'm sure
Mr. Lowther will take you home.

880
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,090
In you get, Sandy.
Can you manage, dear?

881
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,240
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you, Gordon.

882
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:34,970
- You're very kind.
- Oh, you're more than welcome.

883
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,200
It's a painting
of Mr. Lloyd's family.

884
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,210
It starts with himself
and his wife...

885
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,810
and then all the children graded downwards
to the baby and the dog on the floor.

886
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,200
It's supposed to be funny...

887
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,010
but the funniest part is,
they all look like you.

888
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,880
Like me?

889
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,960
Yes. Even the baby.

890
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,010
Everybody he paints
looks like you.

891
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,650
Hmm.

892
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,840
You shall butter the scones,
Sandy, dear.

893
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,890
Be generous.

894
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,660
Uh, does the portrait
of Jenny look like me?

895
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,770
Oh, yes.

896
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,810
Mr. Lloyd might want
to paint me too.

897
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,340
I doubt if having your portrait painted
is going to be your career.

898
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:23,330
Would you mind shutting the window, dear?
There's a wee bit of a draft.

899
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,070
What do you think
it will be, Miss Brodie?

900
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,030
Uh, what do I think
what will be?

901
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,400
My career.

902
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,060
Well, you're quite
intelligent, of course.

903
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:45,090
Actually, Sandy, you have
something more than mere intelligence.

904
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,210
You have insight.

905
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,470
There goes Miss Lockhart.

906
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,470
The chemistry teacher?

907
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,760
Yes. She's got
her golf clubs.

908
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:04,050
Monica saw Mr. Lowther
playing golf with Miss Lockhart...

909
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:06,110
twice.

910
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,320
Indeed?

911
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,200
Well, I know very little
of, uh, Miss Lockhart.

912
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,880
I leave her
to her jars and gases.

913
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,860
We were talking
about your insight, Sandy.

914
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,910
You do have insight...

915
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:25,710
and Jenny...
has got instinct.

916
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,070
Jenny will be
a great lover.

917
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,400
She's like a heroine from a novel
by Mr. D.H. Lawrence.

918
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,380
The common moral code will not
apply to her. She will be above it.

919
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,020
This is a fact which only someone
with your insight should know about.

920
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,250
You know, Sandy...

921
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,860
you would make an excellent
secret service agent--

922
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,010
a great spy.

923
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:56,310
Sandy, you must try
not to peer at people.

924
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,790
It makes a most
rude impression.

925
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,370
Why do you think I would
make a good spy, Miss Brodie?

926
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,160
Well, because you are intelligent
and not... emotional.

927
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,840
I've observed this
constraint in you.

928
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,940
It has, from time to time,
distressed me...

929
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,110
as I myself
am a deeply emotional woman.

930
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,400
I feel many things
passionately.

931
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,450
I feel things,
Miss Brodie.

932
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,650
Well, everybody does,
of course.

933
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,350
It's simply
a matter of degree.

934
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:31,420
Actually, passion would be
a great handicap to a spy.

935
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,030
- It would?
- Definitely.

936
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,950
What did you mean
when you said that, uh...

937
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,650
Jenny was above
the common moral code?

938
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,120
Oh, simply that it
will not apply to her.

939
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,260
She is the exception...

940
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,230
and we can helpJenny
to realize this.

941
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,990
- Oh, Sandy, dear, I forgot the hot water.
- I'll get it.

942
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,100
Thank you, dear.

943
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:05,570
Miss Brodie, how do you think
that we can helpJenny?

944
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,020
We can encourage her,
give her confidence.

945
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,070
Confidence for what?

946
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,840
For when she is 18.

947
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,670
With a girl likeJenny...

948
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,820
perhaps even 17.

949
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,670
Soon she will...
know love.

950
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:27,470
Do you
understand that, Sandy?

951
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,910
You mean
she'll have affairs--

952
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,920
love affairs.

953
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,070
Oh, Sandy,
you do have insight.

954
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,100
I am never wrong.

955
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:41,260
I can always
depend on you.

956
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:57,100
Little girls, you must all learn
to cultivate an expression of composure.

957
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,800
It is one of
the greatest assets of a woman...

958
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,020
an expression of composure,
come foul, come fair.

959
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,310
Regard the Mona Lisa.

960
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,730
She's older than the rocks
on which she sits.

961
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,780
Whom did I say to regard,
Clara?

962
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,830
The Mona Lisa, Miss Brodie.

963
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:17,750
- That is correct. Clara has artistic tendencies.
- [ Laughing ]

964
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,800
Little girls, I am in the business of putting
old heads on young shoulders.

965
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,040
And all my pupils
are the crème de la crème.

966
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,090
Jean!
Oh,Jean!

967
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,690
- Mr. Lowther!
-Jean-- Uh--

968
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,920
Miss Brodie. Miss Mackay. I've just left her.
I don't know what to do.

969
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,290
Did you wish to speak
to me about something?

970
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,310
What can you be
up to, Gordon?

971
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,390
Such a display
in front of the children.

972
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:41,550
It's Miss Mackay.
She dismissed my class!

973
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,920
She's found something terrible!
Something incriminating!

974
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,260
She demands to see us
both together immediately! Immediately.

975
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,400
I am not accustomed to being
summoned immediately. Not by anyone.

976
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:54,130
But,Jean, she sent me to get you!
She said now.

977
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,150
Please!
Pull yourself together, Gordon.

978
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,880
I promise I won't let
Miss Mackay stand you in the corner.

979
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,110
Just you wait there
a minute.

980
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,420
Well, your headmistress,
Miss Mackay...

981
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,620
wishes to see me
for a few minutes.

982
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,550
She has a wee problem
she wishes to discuss with me.

983
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,590
Now, what subject
were we doing?

984
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:21,590
- History, Miss Brodie.
- Oh, yes.

985
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,590
Open your history books.

986
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,590
While I'm away
from the room...

987
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:30,230
you will all read the chapter on
the succession of the Stuarts.

988
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:34,550
You will sit quietly in your seats
and remain composed...

989
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,760
like the Mona Lisa.

990
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,650
Miss Brodie, do you
know what this is?

991
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:51,530
It would appear to be a piece of blue paper
with writing on it in pencil.

992
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,660
It is, in fact,
a letter.

993
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,860
It was found by Miss McKenzie
in a library book.

994
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,270
She glanced at it, but after the first sentence,
she dared not actually read it.

995
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:01,330
She brought it
instantly to me.

996
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,610
Yes.
Is it addressed to you?

997
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:07,060
No, Miss Brodie.
It's addressed to Mr. Lowther...

998
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,280
but it is signed
by you.

999
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,110
- I shall begin.
- Oh, please do.

1000
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,250
Of course, I realize
it is a forgery...

1001
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,340
just the work
of a child.

1002
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,300
"My dear, delightful Gordon...

1003
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:25,740
your letter has moved me deeply,
as you may imagine...

1004
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:29,610
but, alas, I must ever decline
to be Mrs. Lowther.

1005
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,680
My reasons are twofold.

1006
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,080
I am dedicated
to my girls...

1007
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,100
as is
madame Pavlova...

1008
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:39,590
and there is another in my life--
he is Teddy Lloyd.

1009
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:44,010
Intimacy has never taken place with him.
He is married to another.

1010
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,990
We are not lovers,
but we know the truth.

1011
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:51,750
However, I was proud of giving myself to you
when you came and took me...

1012
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,350
in the bracken while
the storm raged about us.

1013
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,170
If I am in
a certain condition...

1014
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,410
I shall place the infant in the care
of a worthy shepherd and his wife.

1015
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:07,180
I may permit misconduct to occur again
from time to time as an outlet...

1016
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,060
because I am in my prime.

1017
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:16,050
We can also have many a... breezy day
in the fishing boat at sea.

1018
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:21,500
We must keep a sharp lookout for Miss Mackay,
however, as she's rather narrow...

1019
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,680
which arises from an ignorance of culture
and the Italian scene.

1020
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,970
I love to hear you singing
"Hey,Johnny Cope".

1021
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,660
But were I to receive
a proposal of marriage tomorrow...

1022
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:36,130
from the Lord Lyon, king of arms,
I would decline it.

1023
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,190
Allow me,
in conclusion...

1024
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:43,710
to congratulate you warmly on your
sexual intercourse as well as your singing.

1025
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,460
With fondestjoy,
Jean Brodie".

1026
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,850
Is this what your girls,
your set...

1027
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:54,070
has learned under your auspices,
Miss Brodie?

1028
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:02,530
It's a literary collaboration.
Two separate hands are involved.

1029
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,910
One of the authors
slants her tail consonants...

1030
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,760
in an unorthodox manner,
and the other does not.

1031
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,800
Also, the paper seems
somewhat aged.

1032
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,720
Is that all
you have to say?

1033
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,760
What else
is there to say?

1034
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,440
Two little girls at the age
of budding sexual fantasy...

1035
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,520
have concocted a romance
for themselves.

1036
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,320
They've chosen me as a romantic symbol.
Is that so surprising?

1037
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,440
Do you deny that you encourage these fantasies,
as you call them?

1038
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,610
Do you deny that by consorting openly
with Mr. Lowther of Cramond...

1039
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,460
you lead these poor children
into the most fevered conclusions?

1040
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:40,010
Not only Mr. Lowther, but Mr. Lloyd
is brought into the circle of fire.

1041
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,040
Mr. Lloyd, who has
a wife and... six children.

1042
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:47,800
It is diabolic that infants should
be knowledgeable--

1043
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:51,590
12-year-old girls
are not infants, Miss Mackay.

1044
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,510
- How do you know they're 1 2 years old?
- From the handwriting...

1045
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,220
the vocabulary,
the rudimentary knowledge of the facts of life.

1046
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,020
Oh, surely you cannot believe that that is
the work of 9-year-olds?

1047
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,770
I could believe it was the work
of your 9-year-olds, Miss Brodie.

1048
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,170
There's very little
for me to say, Miss Mackay...

1049
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,460
in the face of your
extraordinary prejudice and hostility.

1050
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:13,630
Miss Brodie, I am not
asking you to say anything.

1051
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,640
I am asking-- demanding--

1052
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,040
that you put your signature,
your own signature...

1053
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,060
on a letter of resignation
which I have prepared for you.

1054
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,620
I will not resign.

1055
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,500
If you will not resign,
you will force me to dismiss you.

1056
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,700
I will not resign...

1057
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,110
and you will not dismiss me,
Miss Mackay.

1058
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,970
You will not use
the excuse of that pathetic...

1059
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,960
that humorous document
to blackmail me!

1060
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,940
Mr. Lowther,
you are a witness to this.

1061
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:06,090
Miss Mackay has made totally unsupported
accusations against my name and yours.

1062
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,660
If she has one
authentic shred of evidence...

1063
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,400
just one,
let her bring it forth!

1064
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,240
Otherwise, if one more word of this
outrageous calumny reaches my ears, I shall sue!

1065
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,510
I shall take Miss Mackay
to the public courts...

1066
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,760
and I shall sue the trustees of Marcia Blaine,
if they support her.

1067
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,180
I will not stand quietly by
and allow myself to be crucified...

1068
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,120
by a woman whose fetid frustration
has overcome her judgment!

1069
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,040
If scandal is to your taste,
Miss Mackay, I shall give you a feast!

1070
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,080
- Miss Brodie!
- I am a teacher!

1071
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,840
I am a teacher,
first, last, always!

1072
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,870
Do you imagine
that for one instant...

1073
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,550
I will let that be taken
from me without a fight?

1074
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,110
I have dedicated, sacrificed
my life to this profession.

1075
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,730
And I will not stand by
like an inky little slacker...

1076
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,040
and watch you rob me
of it and for what?

1077
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:54,050
For what reason?
For jealousy!

1078
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,690
Because I have the gift
of claiming girls for my own.

1079
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,360
It is true I am
a strong influence on my girls.

1080
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,430
I am proud of it!

1081
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:05,070
I influence them to be
aware of all the possibilities of life...

1082
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,420
of beauty, honor, courage.

1083
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,040
I do not, Miss Mackay, influence them
to look for slime where it does not exist!

1084
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,710
I am going.

1085
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:17,690
When my class convenes,
my pupils will find me composed...

1086
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,850
and prepared to reveal to them
the succession of the Stuarts.

1087
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,320
And on Sunday, I will go to Cramond
to visit Mr. Lowther.

1088
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,690
We are accustomed,
bachelor and spinster...

1089
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,540
to spend our Sundays together
in sailing and walking the beaches...

1090
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,100
and in the pursuit
of music.

1091
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,720
Mr. Lowther is teaching me
to play the mandolin.

1092
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:38,790
Good day, Miss Mackay.

1093
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,580
Uh, Mr. Lowther...

1094
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:53,550
I am sure I need not
suggest to you that we keep...

1095
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:57,070
the details of Miss Brodie's
little... tantrum to ourselves.

1096
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,700
- Yes--
- I've no doubt that you, as well as I...

1097
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,090
- have her interests at heart.
- Well, I--

1098
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,100
Thank you,
Mr. Lowther.

1099
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,340
No doubt you have
other duties to attend to.

1100
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:10,000
Oh, yes. Yes, Miss Mackay.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1101
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,750
Jean!

1102
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,200
Jean, you were heroic!
Heroic!

1103
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:33,810
Oh, to see you like that,
it was really inspiring!

1104
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,880
If only I could have stood up
like that to Mr. Gaunt, if I said...

1105
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,360
''Look here, Mr. Gaunt. If you have
one authentic shred of evidence,just one--''

1106
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:44,340
- What are you talking about?
- Mr. Gaunt called to see me the night before last.

1107
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:48,110
He advised me to resign as organist
and elder of the church. He spoke plainly.

1108
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,420
And what did you answer?

1109
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,110
I resigned.

1110
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,980
And you allowed this
evil-minded man...

1111
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,060
a man who uses his position
as deacon of the Kirk...

1112
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:03,070
to receive the slanderous gossip
of petty provincials--

1113
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,110
ButJean,
it isn't just gossip.

1114
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,470
You do not go home
on Sunday nights.

1115
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,330
They had no proof!.
None whatever.

1116
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,440
You should have refused
point-blank to resign.

1117
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:16,170
Can't you see that resignation
is tantamount to a confession of guilt.

1118
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,160
- But I feel guilty.
- Well, I do not!

1119
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,680
Will you not marry me and put an end
to all this sneaking about?

1120
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:25,270
- Why won't you marry me?
- Only yesterday...

1121
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:29,850
it was told to my face that you are planning
to marry the chemistry teacher.

1122
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,440
Oh, I-- I played golf
with Miss Lockhart once.

1123
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:36,230
- Twice.
- Twice?

1124
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,460
Beware.
Don't trifle with her.

1125
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,990
She has the means
to blow us all up.

1126
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,450
Now, don't tease me,Jean.
Miss Lockhart means nothing to me.

1127
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,590
You know all I care about is you.
All I want is to see you happy and safe.

1128
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,720
I don't
understand you, Jean.

1129
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,450
You will not marry me,
yet you feed me and share my bed.

1130
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,720
''Share your bed''!
Why can't you say you are my lover?

1131
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,130
I do not want
to be your lover--

1132
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,150
I want
to be your husband.

1133
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:04,710
I want to go on my honeymoon where my mother
and father went on their honeymoon...

1134
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,780
and come back to Cramond
with my bride.

1135
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,300
That's what I want.

1136
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,880
And I want to conduct
the church choir too.

1137
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,280
Rumors are flying.
Are you out?

1138
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,440
Hmph! On the contrary,
Miss Mackay experienced...

1139
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:10,210
the utmost difficulty
in persuading me to stay.

1140
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,960
[ Chuckles ]
How I wish I might have heard her plea.

1141
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,640
The utmost difficulty.
You've been painting Jenny.

1142
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,790
- Yes, that's right.
- I am glad, very glad.

1143
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,760
She's getting more beautiful each year.
She quite amazes me.

1144
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,240
You see it too.
You're an artist.

1145
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,060
You see things other men don't see.
You must see it.

1146
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,410
Jenny's quite
a pretty girl.

1147
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:32,950
Pretty? No, no.
It's much more than that.

1148
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,370
She has... extraordinary
physical instincts--

1149
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,430
Primitive and free.

1150
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,270
Primitive?
Little Jenny?

1151
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,560
What are you
up to, Jean?

1152
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,680
I'm only trying to tell you
I've always felt that Jenny...

1153
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:51,930
could be
magnificently elevated...

1154
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,190
above the ordinary rung
of lovers.

1155
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,840
What are you
talking about?

1156
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,380
It's just that I've
always known that one day...

1157
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:05,050
you would paint Jenny.

1158
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,120
Paint Jenny?

1159
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,450
Jean, I think you're quite aware
of what you're doing.

1160
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,900
You're trying to put that child
in my bed in your place.

1161
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,460
Don't be disgusting!

1162
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,980
It's only the words that disgust you!
You don't boggle at the thought, do you?

1163
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,050
You'll accept anything,
anything but reality!

1164
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:30,810
Trying to useJenny and poor old Lowther,
making him play house.

1165
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:34,890
I do not use Mr. Lowther.
It is I who allow myself to be used.

1166
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,700
I give him every attention.
I cook for him.

1167
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:40,170
You feed him instead of loving him.
Isn't that it?

1168
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,230
You know nothing about what there is
of love between Gordon and me!

1169
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:47,070
Oh, my God! All those boring hours
in bed with old Lowther...

1170
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,190
puffing bravely away--

1171
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,950
Good. That's more like it.
That was direct.

1172
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,710
That's the first actual contact
between us in three years.

1173
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,820
Get out! Get out!
Get out of my class! My girls.

1174
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,150
Little girls, this is Mr. Lloyd,
the art master.

1175
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,340
When you are 14,
if he is still at Marcia Blaine...

1176
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,790
I will then hand you over to him,
and you will be fortunate enough...

1177
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,290
to receive
his artistic guidance.

1178
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,960
- Good-bye, girls.
- [ All ] Good-bye, Mr. Lloyd.

1179
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,940
See you
in three years.

1180
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,540
Good-bye,
Miss Brodie.

1181
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:41,090
I also hope
I shall see you.

1182
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,660
For the rest
of the afternoon...

1183
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,820
I have decided we will
not do more history.

1184
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,670
- [ Murmuring ]
- Rather, I will show you some more slides...

1185
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,220
of my last holidays
in Italy.

1186
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:00,210
Monitors,
the blinds, please.

1187
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,890
Clara, will you
pull down the screen?

1188
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,240
I also spent
two weeks in Egypt...

1189
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:09,770
where people do not believe
in God, but in Allah.

1190
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,040
Kathryn, will you
switch on the light, please?

1191
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,130
The bottom,
left-hand side.

1192
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,700
I have brought you these slides
at my own expense.

1193
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,010
The girls at the back
may sit up on their desks.

1194
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,100
Rome.

1195
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:33,100
This is a large formation
of Il Duce's fascisti.

1196
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:36,390
They are following him
in noble destiny.

1197
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:41,330
I, myself,
mingled with such a crowd.

1198
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,720
I wore my silk dress
with red poppies...

1199
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,460
which is right
for my coloring.

1200
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,490
Benito Mussolini.

1201
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:50,490
Il Duce.

1202
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,860
Italy's leader supreme.

1203
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:59,110
A Roman worthy of his heritage.
The greatest Roman of them all.

1204
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,500
The Colosseum--

1205
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:05,820
where Christian slaves
were thrown to the lions...

1206
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,040
and gladiators
fought to the death.

1207
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:12,410
[Latin]

1208
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:18,260
"Hail, Caesar.
Those who are about to die salute thee".

Florence.

1210
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,140
The David
of Michelangelo.

1211
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:28,150
That is
the original David.

1212
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,710
He's in the Galleria
dell'Accademia di Belle Arti.

1213
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:37,740
There's a copy
in the Piazza della Signoria...

1214
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:41,020
next to
the Palazzo Vecchio.

1215
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,880
He's there for any passer-by
to gaze upon and be uplifted.

1216
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:52,840
He's at once the glory of the past
and the inspiration of the future.

1217
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,600
David,
the young warrior.

1218
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,180
This is a picture
of the Ponte Vecchio--

1219
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,500
"The old bridge"
Ponte Vecchio.

1220
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,480
There's a famous painting
of Dante meeting Beatrice--

1221
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,760
It is pronounced
"Beatrichi" in Italian...

1222
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:21,610
which makes it
very beautiful--

1223
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:26,690
Meeting Beatrice
on the Ponte Vecchio.

1224
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:31,060
He fell in love with her
at that moment.

1225
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:35,550
He was a man in his middle years.
She was 14. That can happen.

1226
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:40,460
A mature man can find love
in a young girl, a very young girl.

1227
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:43,340
Find the spring...

1228
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,050
the essence
of all old loves.

1229
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,300
It is not unlikely that
we shall never know...

1230
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,660
that Beatrice
reminded Dante sharply...

1231
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,990
in that moment
when he first saw her...

1232
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:02,130
on the Ponte Vecchio...

1233
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,060
of an old love...

1234
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:09,540
a lost love,
a sublime love...

1235
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,840
and he was seized
with such a longing...

1236
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,430
such longing--

1237
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:29,990
That picture
was painted by Rossetti.

1238
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,150
Who was
Dante Gabriel Rossetti?

1239
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,840
Jenny, who was
Dante Gabriel Rossetti?

1240
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,550
Clara.

1241
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,660
A painter, Miss Brodie.

1242
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,710
What-- What was that you said?

1243
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,670
A painter.

1244
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:55,770
Yes. Yes, a painter.

1245
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:01,390
Oh, yes.

1246
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:04,350
A paint--
A painter.

1247
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,820
Where you're mistaken is in supposing
that Jean Brodie is unique.

1248
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,740
There's an army of these ladies
in Edinburgh.

1249
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,740
It's simply that they do not
attempt to teach in schools...

1250
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,740
of the traditional character
of Marcia Blaine.

1251
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,820
She is
a magnificent specimen.

1252
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:27,220
She's utterly
ridiculous.

1253
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,960
There's no contradiction in being
both ridiculous and magnificent.

1254
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,160
Your young mind will have to
stretch a bit to grasp that.

1255
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:38,130
I think my young mind
is stretched astonishingly...

1256
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:42,090
to be able to discuss
at 17-- at 17--

1257
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,490
the enduring passion
of my lover for another woman.

1258
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,590
It is not only
astonishing, Sandy...

1259
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,630
it is unnatural.

1260
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:51,790
You should be passionate...

1261
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,960
and involved...

1262
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,330
and shortsighted.

1263
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,790
- I'm tired.
- Take a rest, then.

1264
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,290
I'll make some tea.

1265
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:05,110
Her and her passions,
her fascisti.

1266
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:09,180
You should see her skulking around
the third formers, trying to raise funds for Franco.

1267
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,430
Franco? Oh, my God.

1268
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,040
Oh, yes.
We've gone very Spanish this term...

1269
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,230
what with Mary McGregor's
brother and all.

1270
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,800
What's Mary McGregor's
miserable brother got to do with Franco?

1271
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:23,070
Haven't you heard?
He's run off to Spain to fight.

1272
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,600
Miss Brodie's
beside herself with joy.

1273
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:29,900
Jean knows nothing of politics
or politicians.

1274
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,080
She simply invests all leaders
with her own romantic vision.

1275
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:37,920
Why isn't there ever
anything to eat in this place?

1276
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:40,570
You know, it occurred to me
that the Brodie set...

1277
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:44,470
has been Miss Brodie's faithful fascisti,
marching along...

1278
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,510
and I suddenly thought
of her disapproval of the Girl Guides.

1279
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,790
Why, it's simply jealousy.
The Guides are a rival fascisti...

1280
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,850
and she
cannot bear it.

1281
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:56,410
How I wish
I'd joined the Brownies.

1282
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:03,380
What a spiteful
child it is.

1283
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,040
You're too irritable
for a girl of your age.

1284
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,550
My age does bother you,
doesn't it?

1285
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,660
How much longer are you going to be
tempted by this firm, young flesh?

1286
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,020
Until you're 1 8
and over the hill.

1287
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:21,630
Hey, Teddy,
take me dancing.

1288
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,340
- Certainly not.
- What a coward.

1289
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:27,690
A man with a wife and six children
plus a schoolgirl for a mistress...

1290
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,910
can be called any number of rude names,
but "coward" is not one of them.

1291
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,670
So sweet,
the flesh of the neck.

1292
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,560
If only it could be
bottled and sold across the counter.

1293
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:51,570
I really shouldn't feed
your depraved appetite.

1294
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,520
Hey, Teddy. Teddy, listen.
When can I look at my painting?

1295
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,360
I'm very bored with not being allowed
to see my own portrait.

1296
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,880
When I've finished it,
and I shall never finish it.

1297
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,700
We shall go on like this
until one or both of us is dead.

1298
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:09,340
Now. I want to see myself
mirrored in your eyes.

1299
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:12,250
- I need a vision of myself.
- No, Sandy. No.

1300
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,280
I haven't
finished it yet.

1301
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,730
- I'm not pleased with it yet.
- Oh, you.

1302
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,580
You'll never
be pleased.

1303
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,740
Sandy!

1304
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,280
I cannot
help myself, Sandy.

1305
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:44,590
Believe me, it has nothing to do
with what I feel for you.

1306
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,740
Even the skin tones
are hers.

1307
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,890
It's not even my skin.

1308
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:00,660
And I thought--
I really thought that you--

1309
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,780
Well, you know,
desired me.

1310
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,820
Desired me.

1311
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,900
I-- I do.

1312
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,760
It might just as well
have been Jenny after all.

1313
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,430
It would have been
the same with anyone.

1314
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,580
Sandy,
listen to me.

1315
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:23,490
Love is the most irrational thing
on God's Earth.

1316
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:26,030
Do you think I choose
to love Jean Brodie?

1317
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,630
If I could choose,
I would love my wife or you.

1318
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,440
You are the most
remarkable girl I've ever known.

1319
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:40,810
You are marvelous
and astonishing and desirable.

1320
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:43,930
Why would I not choose to love you,
if I could choose?

1321
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:48,710
Please don't think less
of yourself because I am...

1322
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,770
bewitched.

1323
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,860
Very well.
I shan't.

1324
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:58,220
- Believe what I'm telling you.
- Oh, I believe you, Teddy.

1325
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,120
I even believe that
you are bewitched.

1326
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,920
I'm not sure about God, but I am now
quite sure about witches.

1327
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,580
Will you be back
tomorrow?

1328
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,990
No, I won't be back.

1329
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,640
That really would be
a waste of time, wouldn't it?

1330
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,670
Good night, Teddy.

1331
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,890
You can
go on painting.

1332
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,000
You don't really
need a model.

1333
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:31,420
As this seems to be
a time for truth...

1334
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,470
you're quite
a mediocre painter, Teddy.

1335
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:35,670
You'll never be
really good.

1336
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,400
I wonder you don't try
some other line.

1337
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,840
You are getting on,
you know.

1338
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:47,830
Generalissimo Franco
is called El Jefe, the chief.

1339
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,180
J-E-F-E.
The "J" is silent. El Jefe.

1340
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,760
He is
a dedicated man.

1341
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,780
You must all grow up
to be dedicated women...

1342
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:00,030
as generalissimo Franco has
dedicated himself to a cause...

1343
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,320
as I have dedicated
myself to you.

1344
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,570
Dedication is
the order of the day.

1345
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:08,060
Oh, Mary McGregor, girls,
come and join us.

1346
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:11,570
Mary, dear, is there any news
from your brother from Spain?

1347
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:13,630
No, Miss Brodie.
Nothing.

1348
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,630
Mr. Ealing at the b-bank
is sending for him...

1349
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:20,030
sending d-d-detectives
to Spain.

1350
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,050
Your brother
is being sent for?

1351
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:27,340
Mr. Ealing at the bank
would send for Caesar.

1352
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,470
The Mr. Ealings at the bank
have tried throughout history...

1353
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,560
to stay the march
of civilization.

1354
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,200
Why can't they understand? It should
be obvious to the meanest intelligence.

1355
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:41,430
Franco's army comprises the best
elements of Spain and her supporters.

1356
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,330
They are committed
to heroic action.

1357
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,080
You little girls are living
in a time that will demand...

1358
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:50,270
all that you have to give
of courage and gallantry.

1359
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,080
You must become heroines.
Heroines!

1360
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,880
Do you mean we will have to
march and shoot guns?

1361
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,910
If you are called.

1362
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:00,190
Girls?

1363
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,480
Have you never heard
of Hannah Snell?

1364
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:08,100
She was an English girl born in 1723
and sailed in Admiral Boscawen's fleet.

1365
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:10,610
And fought at Araapong.
She was wounded.

1366
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:15,150
But without medical aid, she extracted
the bullet from her own shoulder...

1367
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,340
and lived
to serve again.

1368
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,620
Hannah Snell was a girl.

1369
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,720
- Ooh!
- Now, you, too, must be prepared...

1370
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,090
to serve, suffer
and sacrifice.

1371
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,460
- Are you prepared?
- Yes, Miss Brodie.

1372
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,080
Yes, Miss Brodie.

1373
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:35,060
No, Miss Brodie.

1374
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,030
But she could
get shot.

1375
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:40,230
Without medical aid, she would extract
the bullet from her own shoulder...

1376
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,280
and live
to serve again.

1377
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,400
It isn't funny.
She could really get hurt.

1378
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:47,050
- What's going on? Who could get hurt?
- Mary McGregor.

1379
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,320
She's run away to Spain
to fight.

1380
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,410
- What kind of joke is this?
- It isn't a joke.

1381
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,410
She's really gone
to Spain.

1382
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,970
Mary McGregor couldn't negotiate
her way across Edinburgh.

1383
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:00,080
- Ah, but she has a guiding spirit.
- What are you talking about?

1384
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:03,930
I'm sure Miss Brodie gave Mary
very explicit directions.

1385
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,800
The Paris train will take you
as far as Perpignan.

1386
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,920
P-E-R-P-I-G-N-A-N.

1387
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:13,290
Now, the pounds are
in this envelope marked "pounds".

1388
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:16,110
And the francs are
in this envelope marked "rancs".

1389
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,620
And the pesetas are
in this envelope marked "pesetas".

1390
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,120
How else?

1391
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,740
- I don't believe it.
- Nor do I.

1392
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:26,770
Miss Brodie
will be frantic.

1393
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,370
Miss Brodie
will be ecstatic.

1394
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,240
Moving your troops
to Barcelona?

1395
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,120
Mary McGregor has gone
to join her brother.

1396
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,240
He is her only kin.

1397
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,130
Yes, I heard you've been
raising funds for Franco.

1398
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:53,290
I find that
extraordinary.

1399
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,410
The times
are extraordinary.

1400
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,400
Miss Brodie!

1401
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,420
Miss Brodie!

1402
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,880
Miss Brodie.!

1403
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:11,050
Oh!

1404
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,490
Oh, Mary McGregor.

1405
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:56,010
Girls, I have
called you together...

1406
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:58,450
my special girls...

1407
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:01,630
to tell you the truth
about Mary McGregor.

1408
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,080
Miss Mackay has told you
the facts about Mary's death--

1409
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:09,420
how the train was bombed and machine-gunned
as it crossed the frontier--

1410
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,320
but only I
can tell you the truth.

1411
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,320
Mary McGregor
died a heroine.

1412
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,600
It was her intention
to fight for Franco...

1413
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:22,770
against the forces of darkness.

1414
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:27,220
So although she was killed before
she herself could strike a blow...

1415
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:32,370
her intention
was a noble and heroic one.

1416
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,530
Had she lived...

1417
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:40,420
Mary would have become a woman
of great spirit and initiative.

1418
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,630
Hers would have been
a dedicated life.

1419
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:49,390
You must all grow up
to be dedicated women...

1420
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:54,550
as Mary McGregor dedicated
her youth to a cause...

1421
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,920
as I have dedicated
myself to you.

1422
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,870
Tonight, little girls...

1423
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:05,130
let your imaginations soar.

1424
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,910
Think of Joan of Arc...

1425
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,220
Florence Nightingale.

1426
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:15,210
Think of Mary McGregor.

1427
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,840
Who among you has
the makings of a heroine?

1428
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,910
Yes, Clara?

1429
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:23,710
May we think of you,
Miss Brodie?

1430
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,660
Well, why not?

1431
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:32,260
Deep in most of us
is a potential for greatness...

1432
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:35,890
or the potential
to inspire greatness.

1433
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:43,210
The day draws late.
Your families will be expecting you.

1434
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:46,700
Take home the story
of Mary McGregor.

1435
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:02,750
Sandy?

1436
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,210
I thought you and I
might have tea together.

1437
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,990
I wanted
to talk to you about Mary.

1438
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:12,030
I'm sorry,
but I have some work to do.

1439
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:16,270
[ Chuckles ]
How busy and grown-up you've become.

1440
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:21,050
Well, I won't try to stop you, but you must
remember how much I do depend on you.

1441
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,480
I'll remember.

1442
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:01,490
" Somebody's crying "

1443
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:04,610
" Do you wonder who "

1444
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:07,730
" Tears that would fill up "

1445
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,980
" An ocean or two "

1446
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:16,910
" He's too unhappy
to even feel blue "

1447
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:21,520
" Somebody's crying for you "

1448
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,500
" Somebody's crying "

1449
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,500
Pay him no mind

1450
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:32,310
He's just a someone

1451
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,580
That you left behind

1452
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:39,150
Although it could be

1453
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:41,660
And you'll never see

1454
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,080
That somebody
crying is me

1455
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,000
Yesterday's lover

1456
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,180
Like yesterday's dream

1457
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,990
Lost like a flower

1458
01:36:57,190 --> 01:37:00,430
That floats
down the stream

1459
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,800
- Mr. Lloyd?
- Yes, I should think so.

1460
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,100
@ Only the sorrow

1461
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,280
@ Somebody's crying
for you

1462
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,760
- Would you like to dance, Sandy?
- No, thank you.

1463
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:17,630
I thought it was considered
a triumph of the first magnitude...

1464
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,420
to be asked to dance
by a male staff member.

1465
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:22,620
Excuse me.

1466
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:25,790
- Mr. Lloyd said I could have my portrait done.
- Monica.

1467
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,240
- Oh, thank you, Sandy.
- All right.

1468
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,400
Somebody's crying

1469
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:42,870
Do you wonder who

1470
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,700
Tears that would
fill up

1471
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:48,810
An ocean or two

1472
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:51,810
You know how I feel

1473
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:54,860
For sadly, but true

1474
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:59,020
That somebody crying is you

1475
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,200
Would you like
some punch, Miss Brodie?

1476
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,440
Oh, Mr. Lloyd.
Thank you.

1477
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,600
That's very
thoughtful of you.

1478
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:18,870
Well,Jean,
how's the Franco fund coming along?

1479
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:22,640
Mm! Not well.
Popular sentiment being what it is...

1480
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,240
one can hardly plead the cause
in the Marcia Blaine assembly hall.

1481
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:31,380
Yes, I dare say. I, too, am attempting
to raise funds for a worthy cause.

1482
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:33,550
You? What sort of cause?

1483
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,280
A romantic one. I am taking up
a collection to buy a wedding present...

1484
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,950
for Lowther
and Miss Lockhart.

1485
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:43,580
May I put you down
for a pound?

1486
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:47,050
It's to be a simple affair in Cramond Kirk
a week on Saturday.

1487
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:50,470
I'm told when they announced
their intention to Miss Mackay last evening...

1488
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:54,290
her delight was so profound that she ran amok
and toasted them in neat whiskey.

1489
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:10,130
- Ah, Miss Brodie.
- Oh, good evening, Mr. Burrage, girls.

1490
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,890
- Good evening, Miss Brodie.
- I've not seen you dancing yet.

1491
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,240
Oh, the night
is young, Mr. Burrage.

1492
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,660
Excuse me
for one moment.

1493
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:21,230
Teddy-- Teddy, who told you
to come to me like that?

1494
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:24,020
I volunteered. "I", said the sparrow,
"with my bow and arrow".

1495
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:27,890
- I volunteered.
- And what kill, pray, did you expect to make?

1496
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:30,770
Do you think I cannot,
with one snap of my fingers...

1497
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:34,850
send poor Miss Lockhart
back to her gaseous domain?

1498
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:39,450
It was I who
encouraged Mr. Lowther...

1499
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,080
in his reluctant
pursuit of Miss Lockhart.

1500
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,950
What I cannot understand is you.
I cannot understand you.

1501
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:47,990
Malice.
Coming to me that way...

1502
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,990
hoping to hurt
and humiliate me, why?

1503
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,870
I don't know.
It's what I wanted, to hurt you.

1504
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,430
Why? Why are you
so angry with me?

1505
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:58,170
Because I'm afraid.
Because I don't feel safe with you around.

1506
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,280
You should have married old Lowther,
you really should.

1507
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:04,530
I'm 43 years old, ean.
How old are you?

1508
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:07,060
- I'm f-- I'm in my prime.
- Your prime!

1509
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,570
Look at yourself,Jean.

1510
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:13,230
Look at me--
a second-rate painter running to seed.

1511
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:15,460
- You're not in your prime,Jean.
- Teddy, don't--

1512
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:20,910
You're a frustrated spinster taking it out
in idiot causes and dangerous ideas.

1513
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:23,570
- A schoolmarm.
- I am a teacher.

1514
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,160
A teacher or a leader?

1515
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:30,950
The dangerous Miss Brodie
and her troops.

1516
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:34,180
Well, where you lead
I cannot follow.

1517
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,600
Arrivederci.

1518
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:46,660
- Mr. Burrage, will you dance?
- Yes. Yes. Delighted.

1519
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,180
Thank you so much.

1520
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:00,210
Miss Mackay...

1521
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:03,170
since you were first appointed
headmistress of Marcia Blaine...

1522
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:07,250
you have done nothing but try
to dismiss me from the teaching staff.

1523
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,420
You have tried
every feeble excuse...

1524
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:13,510
even that of immorality,
and failed.

1525
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:18,470
Now you are accusing me
of preaching politics to my pupils.

1526
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,360
Such a continuous
personal vendetta...

1527
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:25,070
is hardly conducive
to the dignity of your position.

1528
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:30,100
Miss Brodie, I don't think
you quite understand.

1529
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:33,790
Let me make the situation
perfectly clear.

1530
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,780
It is not I,
but the board of governors...

1531
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,660
who have pursued this investigation
to its conclusion.

1532
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:42,220
And it is
the board of governors who...

1533
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:46,680
after having given due consideration
to the grave charges laid against you...

1534
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:50,470
have given instructions that you leave
this school immediately...

1535
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:55,740
and that your classes be taken over
tomorrow morning by another teacher.

1536
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:01,470
The board have asked me
to convey to you the fact that...

1537
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:04,550
your salary will be paid in full
until the end of the term...

1538
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,950
which, in the circumstances,
is more than generous.

1539
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:12,170
Miss Brodie,
there is nothing more to be said.

1540
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:17,350
I shall not accept
the board's action.

1541
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:21,850
I shall petition. I shall put
the question before the public...

1542
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,700
before the parents
and the student body.

1543
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:28,370
You will find, Miss Mackay,
that I have the loyalty of my girls.

1544
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:32,110
Do you, Miss Brodie?

1545
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,020
For they are
jolly good fellows

1546
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,750
For they are
jolly good fellows

1547
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:41,620
For they are
jolly good fellows

1548
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,140
Which nobody can deny.

1549
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,360
Come, now, Lowther, give us a song.!

1550
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:52,590
Why, Miss Brodie,
aren't you coming to the common room?

1551
01:42:52,830 --> 01:42:56,790
- Common room?
- The celebration honoring
Miss Lockhart and Mr. Lowther.

1552
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,640
My love is like
a red, red rose

1553
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,160
Aren't you coming,
Miss Brodie?

1554
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,580
I'll--
I'll be there shortly.

1555
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,630
§In June

1556
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:14,560
Oh, my love
is like a melody

1557
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:19,410
That's sweetly
played in tune

1558
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:26,990
As fair art thou
my bonny lass

1559
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:32,310
So deep in love am I

1560
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:39,870
And I will love
thee still, my dear

1561
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:56,050
Sandy.

1562
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:03,170
Sandy.

1563
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:06,940
I believe, Sandy--

1564
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:10,650
I believe
I am past my prime.

1565
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,480
I had reckoned
on my prime lasting...

1566
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:18,600
till I was
at least... 50.

1567
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,930
Are you listening,
Sandy?

1568
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,340
I'm listening,
Miss Brodie.

1569
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,920
I have been dismissed
from Marcia Blaine.

1570
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:34,190
I am accused of teaching
treason and sedition to my students.

1571
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:37,170
I am being transported
for radicalism...

1572
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:39,930
like Thomas Muir
of Huntershill.

1573
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:43,960
But if Miss Mackay
and her conspirators...

1574
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,840
expect that I shall meekly lay my head
on their chopping block...

1575
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,240
- they're in for a wee surprise.
- What will you do?

1576
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:53,380
As I informed Miss Mackay,
I will resort to public petition.

1577
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:57,110
I have no doubt that many supporters
will rally to my defense.

1578
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:00,060
My students are loyal.

1579
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,100
My girls.

1580
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:08,740
Someone betrayed me, Sandy.
Someone spoke against me to the board.

1581
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,900
Who could it
have been? Who?

1582
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:13,780
Are you thinking that
maybe one of your girls betrayed you?

1583
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,380
I said
to Miss Mackay...

1584
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,680
''I have the loyalty
of my girls,''

1585
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:24,940
and she said,
''Do you?''

1586
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:28,070
I'll not believe it. I'll not believe
it was one of my girls.

1587
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,280
Perhaps it's true.

1588
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:36,300
I thought possibly Monica.
There's very little soul--

1589
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:39,730
- Monica is a loyal girl.
- I know. You all are.

1590
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,280
Monica and Jenny.
Oh, notJenny.

1591
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,740
She's like
a part of myself.

1592
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,640
You, Sandy-- As you see,
you are exempt from all suspicion.

1593
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,120
You have had more
of my confidence than anyone.

1594
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:55,420
You know more than anyone
what I have sacrificed for my girls.

1595
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:59,510
Teddy Lloyd was greatly
in love with me, Sandy...

1596
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,560
as I think
you've always known.

1597
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,800
And I gave him up to consecrate
my life to the young girls in my care--

1598
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,620
you and Monica
and Jenny.

1599
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:14,110
Jenny--

1600
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:17,190
She and Mr. Lloyd
will soon be lovers.

1601
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,000
- I have that.
- Do you think that you are Providence?

1602
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,960
That you can ordain love?

1603
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,760
What?

1604
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:27,750
You haven't
pulled it off.

1605
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:30,070
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover.

1606
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,120
What are you saying,
Sandy?

1607
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:35,170
Jenny will not be
Teddy Lloyd's lover...

1608
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:39,210
and I'll not be your spy,
your secret service.

1609
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:43,180
My spy? What on earth
are you talking about?

1610
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:46,020
Do you understand at all
what has happened to me?

1611
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:49,770
I have been dismissed
from Marcia Blaine!

1612
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,210
Why are you standing there talking
about Providence and the secret service?

1613
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:56,310
What is the matter
with you?

1614
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:59,990
Miss Brodie,
I am Teddy's lover.

1615
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:03,190
What?

1616
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,390
I am Teddy's lover.

1617
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,080
Teddy's lover? You?

1618
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,680
Is that so difficult
to believe?

1619
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,620
What does it matter to you which one of us it is?
It doesn't matter to Teddy.

1620
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:20,870
Whatever possessed you?
You know his religion.

1621
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:23,150
How could a girl
with a mind of her own...

1622
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,730
have to do with a man
who can't think for himself?

1623
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:28,390
That doesn't seem
to have bothered either of us, does it?

1624
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:31,420
We were neither of us
very interested in his mind.

1625
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:35,700
How dare you speak to me
in this manner!

1626
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,800
I suppose I've always known that one day
you were going to ask how dare I?

1627
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,830
Why? I don't understand.

1628
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:46,690
I don't seem to understand
what has happened to everyone.

1629
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:48,730
Where has everyone gone?

1630
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,930
Only Mary is gone.

1631
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:54,180
Mary? What has Mary
to do with it?

1632
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:58,110
Miss Brodie,
Mary McGregor is dead!

1633
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:02,010
Are you aware of
the order of importance...

1634
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:05,070
in which you place
your anxieties?

1635
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,310
One, you have
been betrayed.

1636
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:10,520
Two, who is or is not to be your proxy
in Teddy Lloyd's bed...

1637
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,300
and three, Mary's death.

1638
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:16,930
Miss Brodie, aren't you concerned
at all with Mary's death?

1639
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,040
I grieve for Mary.

1640
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,640
It was because of you
she went!

1641
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:23,670
Because of me?
It was her brother.

1642
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:26,550
The poor, unfortunate girl
hadn't anyone else in the world.

1643
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:30,230
She had you.
That was her misfortune.

1644
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:34,740
To please you, that silly, stupid girl
ran off and got herself killed!

1645
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,370
Don't you feel
responsible for that?

1646
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,990
No.

1647
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:42,890
No, I feel responsible
for giving her ideals--

1648
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:44,930
The ideals that
sent her to Spain.

1649
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:49,100
I feel responsible for teaching her
that service to a cause is a privilege.

1650
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:52,510
You call it a privilege
to be killed?

1651
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:55,050
And for nothing.
Nothing!

1652
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:58,470
You really are
a shallow girl, Sandy.

1653
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:02,090
By the way she died,
Mary McGregor illumined her life.

1654
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,920
- She died a heroine.
- She died a fool!

1655
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:08,790
Joining her brother to fight for Franco--
wasn't that just like Mary?

1656
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:11,950
Her brother is fighting
for the other side.

1657
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,280
- Her brother--
- Her brother is fighting for the Republicans!

1658
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,770
Mary was headed
for the wrong army!

1659
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,320
Oh, Mary McGregor!

1660
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,340
"Mary McGregor".

1661
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,580
I used to wonder why
you always called Mary by her full name.

1662
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:31,790
I think it was because you had
such a hard time remembering who she was.

1663
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,610
Poor, dim Mary.

1664
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,120
I was devoted to Mary.

1665
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,980
No, you were only attracted to Mary
because she had no one else...

1666
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:42,180
and she was
so totally suggestible.

1667
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:44,710
She appealed
to your vanity!

1668
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:52,020
It was you
who betrayed me.

1669
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:54,550
I didn't betray you!

1670
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:57,530
I simply
put a stop to you!

1671
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:03,510
Oh, I see.

1672
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,580
No, you don't see.

1673
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:08,180
You don't see that
you're not good for people.

1674
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:11,170
In what way?

1675
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:14,050
In what way, Sandy,
was I not good for you?

1676
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:16,170
You are dangerous
and unwholesome...

1677
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,530
and children should not
be exposed to you!

1678
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:21,030
How can you think it?

1679
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:23,370
How can you think
that I would harm you?

1680
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:26,070
- But you have-- You have harmed me!
- How?

1681
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:28,250
You have murdered Mary!

1682
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:31,060
You have
assassinated me!

1683
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,620
Oh, why must you
always strike attitudes?

1684
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,400
You really are
a ridiculous woman!

1685
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:57,540
What will you do... now?

1686
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:00,580
Do?

1687
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:07,420
I don't know.

1688
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,140
But I am a descendant,
do not forget...

1689
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:16,410
of Willie Brodie.

1690
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:19,430
He was a man
of substance--

1691
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,630
A cabinetmaker
and a designer of gibbets...

1692
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,320
a member of the town council
of Edinburgh...

1693
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:29,750
the keeper of two mistresses
who bore him five children between them.

1694
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:34,050
Blood tells.
He played much dice and fighting cocks.

1695
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:38,110
Eventually, he was a wanted man
for having robbed the excise office.

1696
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:40,310
Not that he needed
the money.

1697
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,320
He was a burglar
for the sake of the danger.

1698
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:48,240
He died cheerfully
on a gibbet of his own devising in 1 7 88.

1699
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:51,280
That is the stuff
I am made of.

1700
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:54,210
I knew you would rise
like a phoenix.

1701
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,730
I'm glad I shall not
have to worry about you.

1702
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,080
No, I expect that
is to be your gift, Sandy--

1703
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:04,130
to kill without concern.

1704
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:06,930
It is you
who are dangerous.

1705
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,400
You see yourself as a conqueror,
don't you, Sandy?

1706
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:12,580
Kaiserian in all
his beauty rare.

1707
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:16,950
But you profess to be
a great admirer of conquerors.

1708
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,170
Good-bye, Miss Brodie.

1709
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,360
Assassin!

1710
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,040
Assassin!

1711
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:54,720
" Lord, dismiss us
with Thy blessing "

1712
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:59,270
" Thanks for mercies
past receive "

1713
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:03,940
" Pardon all
their faults confessing "

1714
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:08,370
" Time that's lost
may all retrieve "

1715
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,910
" May thy children
May thy children "

1716
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:18,490
" Never again
Thy spirit grieve ""

1717
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:26,770
Today we say good-bye
to those senior girls...

1718
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,780
who are leaving
Marcia Blaine for the last time.

1719
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:33,580
You girls are about
to take your place...

1720
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:36,370
in a larger,
more demanding world.

1721
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:40,730
In this world, you will be called upon
to make many moral decisions...

1722
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:43,270
affecting not only
your own lives...

1723
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:47,600
but the lives of your families,
your friends,your acquaintances.

1724
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:52,150
We are confident,
truly confident...

1725
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,210
that the training you have received
here in this school...

1726
01:53:55,370 --> 01:54:00,530
will have equipped you to face life's quandaries
with courage and character.

1727
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:03,790
For here at Marcia Blaine...

1728
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,480
we have done our best
to nurture the virtuous woman...

1729
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,520
for her price
is far above rubies.

1730
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,400
Let us pray.

1731
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:31,810
Little girls...

1732
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:37,100
I am in the business
of putting old heads on young shoulders...

1733
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,600
and all my pupils
are the crème de la crème.

1734
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:47,710
Give me a girl
at an impressionable age...

1735
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,400
and she is mine for life.
