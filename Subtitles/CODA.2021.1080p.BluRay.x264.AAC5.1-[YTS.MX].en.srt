00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,277
I mean, you have no control,
but your tone is lovely.

547
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,445
Thanks.

548
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,489
It's my favorite thing.

549
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,369
What are you doing next year?

550
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,454
I don't know.

551
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,831
Working with my dad.

552
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,375
No college?

553
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,918
I'm not good at school.

554
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,634
Miles is auditioning
for Berklee College of Music.

555
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,886
I've been coaching him for his audition.

556
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
What? You don't know Berklee?

557
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,768
I've heard of it.

558
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,852
Come on!

559
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,563
I grew up in Mexico City,
and even I knew Berklee.

560
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,107
Abe Laboriel,
the famous bassist, went there.

561
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,859
I did too.

562
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
I can't afford school.

563
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,530
They have scholarships.

564
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,207
How do you feel when you sing?

565
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,590
I don't know.

566
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,426
It's hard to explain.

567
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,430
Try.

568
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,650
You would need to sight-read
and learn a classical piece.

569
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,903
I need your nights and weekends.

570
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,656
I do not waste my time.

571
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,616
So if I'm offering,

572
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,411
it's because I hear something.

573
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,891
I joined the choir.

574
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,144
Why?

575
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:26,563
I like to sing.

576
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,572
What?

577
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,536
You're a teenager.

578
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:47,585
If I was blind, would you want to paint?

579
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,755
Why is it always about you?

580
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,551
I'm meeting people. I'm making friends.

581
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,138
You know what?

582
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,474
You should get out in the world too.

583
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,600
Hey!

584
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,499
We should do a co-op.

585
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,752
Look, there's empty warehouses everywhere.

586
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,506
We could organize a business.

587
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,050
Get the other boats on board.

588
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,176
How?

589
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,220
Who's gonna support us?

590
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,973
We're the deaf guys!

591
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,894
They look at us like we're a joke.

592
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,647
Hey! I'm going to Pratty's
for a brew. Who wants to go?

593
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,940
-I'm in!
-I'm in!

594
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,068
I'm gonna go with them.

595
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,321
You want me to text Ruby?

596
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,739
No.

597
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,533
I'm a grown man!

598
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,453
Come on, kid!

599
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,623

Bear hugging it.

602
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,380
But when he does, he loses his pants.

603
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,715
They go down to his knees.

604
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,216
No word of a lie!

605
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,593
There he is hanging

606
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,054
with his milky white,
ginger ass hanging out.

607
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,890
He's still thirty feet from the pole!

608
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,561
But of course, he's shit-faced.

609
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,938

610
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,447

00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,800
Don't, don't!

617
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,979
Take it outside! Take it outside!

618
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,064
Let's get out of here!

619
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,908
Want some, uh, ice for your eye?

620
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,208
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

621
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,540
At least they support you,
right? Your music?

622
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,043
Well, my dad insists
guitar is a waste of time

623
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,295
because it's not a true string instrument.

624
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,047
They suck the fun right out of it.

625
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,678
I'm sorry about all this.
My house is kind of gross.

626
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,221
It's cool.

627
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,648
No way! The Shaggs?

628
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,442
I'm really just here
to steal these ladies.

629
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,735
[chuckling]

630
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,448
God!

631
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,742
I can't believe this actually works!

632
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,202
It sounds like shit.

633
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,912
But so does my stereo.

634
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,790
My mom thought it was a waste of money.

635
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,959
It was $2 from Goodwill.

636
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,044
Do they, like...

637
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,798
Do they, like, even get what music is?

638
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,343
My dad really likes
gangster rap 'cause of the bass.

639
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,436
When we were little,
I used to see you guys in town.

640
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,314
Yeah. We were hard to miss.

641
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,692
There was this one time--
I think it was, like, 3rd grade--

642
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,694
uh, you were at the Seaport Grill,

643
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,196
and you were ordering for your parents.

644
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,534
And you were talking to the waiter
like a total baller.

645
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,203
And then you ordered two beers.

646
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,872
I thought it was so cool.

647
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,415
Really?

648
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,793
Yeah.

649
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,296
My parents wouldn't even
let me ride the bus by myself.

650
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,048
They're weird.

651
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,508
And they hate each other, so there's that.

652
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,601
So, how should we do this?

653
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,311
-Uh...
-Stand?

654
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,314
Yeah, maybe we should, like,

Let's go upstairs.

01:36:17,654 --> 01:36:19,948
What is your first song today?

1447
01:36:20,532 --> 01:36:22,534
Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell.

1448
01:36:22,617 --> 01:36:24,286
Do you have your sheet music?

1449
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:29,624
I don't. I forgot.

1450
01:36:32,336 --> 01:36:34,212
Do you know that song?

1451
01:36:35,797 --> 01:36:38,884
All right. You are just going
to have to sing it a cappella.

1452
01:36:41,553 --> 01:36:42,638
Oh, OK.

1453
01:36:44,556 --> 01:36:46,391
I can accompany her.
