1
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,216
Counselor, l've got him.

2
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,931
Down. Come down.

3
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,980
Down for good.

4
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,905
Forgive the early intrusion.

5
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,365
How are you?

6
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,202
l'm a great fan of yours.
Very pleased to meet you.

7
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,954
May l?

8
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,582
May l use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,210
Your arm, please.

10
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,170
Relax it.

11
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,589
- Your age?
- Forty-three.

12
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,508
Now lean forward.

13
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,264
What are you cooking up for us now?
Another film with no hope?

14
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,100
- First time taking the cure?
- Yes.

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,104
Take a deep breath.

16
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,106
Come in.

17
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,901
Sorry.
l'll come back later.

18
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,194
No, come in.

19
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,446
Breathe.

20
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,992
Deeper.

21
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,287
Good morning.

22
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,247
Mind if l smoke?

23
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,919
Cough.

24
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,964
Breathe in.

25
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,218
- Did you read it?
- Yes.

26
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,470
Breathe.

27
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,641
So what do you think?

28
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,105
l made some notes,
but we'll talk later.

29
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,068
Your system is a bit overworked.
You may get dressed.

30
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,364
Nice-looking girl.
American, right?

31
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,491
You've got some fine
merchandise there.

32
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,244
This treatment will do you good.
You'll see.

33
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,333
Nurse, 300 ml of holy water,

34
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,003
three doses at 1 5-minute intervals
on an empty stomach.

35
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,007
A mud bath every other day,
- What time is it?

36
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,887
followed by ten minutes
in the mineral water as prescribed.

37
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,724
- l'll wait for you at the springs.
- Yes, thank you.

38
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,543
Sir!

39
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,420
Sir, your glass.

40
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,558
Over here.

41
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,561
You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

42
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:27,691
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

43
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,735
Frankly, l wouldn't want
to cause you any trouble.

44
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,530
No, don't worry.
l'm the one who called you in.

45
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,074
On first reading it's evident

46
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,745
that the film lacks a central conflict,
or philosophical premise, if you will...

47
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,205
Shall we sit down?

48
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,459
...making the film a series
of gratuitous episodes,

49
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,423
perhaps even amusing
due to their ambiguous realism.

50
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,968
One wonders
what the authors' point is.

51
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,263
To make us think?
To scare us?

52
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:04,019
From the start, the action reveals
an impoverished poetic inspiration.

53
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:09,024
Forgive me, but this might be
the most pathetic demonstration ever

54
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,279
that cinema is irremediably behind
all other arts by 50 years.

55
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,158
The subject matter doesn't even
have the merits of an avant-garde film,

56
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,077
while possessing
all its shortcomings.

57
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:26,082
Here are my notes.
l doubt they will be helpful.

58
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,296
lt's still a mystery
that you'd think of me

59
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:36,217
for a collaboration that
l frankly don't think could work.

60
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,180
No, on the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

61
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,476
You see, l really want
to make this film.

62
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,647
l only postponed the shoot
for two weeks because -

63
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,154
Mezzabotta!

64
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,073
Excuse me.

65
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,828
Mezzabotta! Mario!
You're here too?

66
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,413
Guido!

67
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,582
Well, well!

68
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,252
Mario, what's wrong?

69
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,839
Guido baby, how are you?

70
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,509
You've sprouted quite a few
white hairs, old Snaporaz!

71
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,718
And you haven't?

72
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,929
Are you drinking that garbage?
lt's bad for you.

73
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,308
They said my liver isn't -
And you, what's your treatment?

74
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,353
Just a second.

75
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,355
Gloria!

76
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,024
Your daughter?
She's all grown up.

77
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,276
- No, she's not my daughter.
- How awful.

78
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,824
The cruel bee has sucked
all the life from these poor flowers.

79
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,368
Darling, this is my friend -

80
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,786
l'm sorry. My shoes.

81
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,748
Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,542
l'm fine, thank you.

83
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,629
l know all about you.
Pupi always tells me.

84
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,633
We even had a big fight
when l was very critical of your last film.

85
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,720
That's not true.
You liked it a lot.

86
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,806
Shall we get something to drink?
Come on.

87
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,810
Are you here alone?
And your wife?

88
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,521
- Yes, l'm alone.
- Better that way.

89
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,982
l mean, better in general.

90
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,985
You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

91
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,738
We're waiting for an annulment.

92
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,074
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

93
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,326
Congratulations.

94
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,705
So, Guido baby,
cooking up something good?

95
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,331
Sure is the ideal place
to do some thinking.

96
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,542
This is the writer Daumier.
This is Miss -

97
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,586
Pardon me,
but your name again?

98
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,965
Nice to meet you.
l'm a great fan of yours.

99
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,884
l'm flattered.

100
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,471
Are you an actress?
Have l seen your picture somewhere?

101
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,222
An actress? Yes.

102
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,100
l have ambitions
along those lines.

103
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,936
Actually, enormous ambitions,

104
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,230
but that's all they are
for the moment.

105
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,776
She has a degree in philosophy.
Allow me - Mario Mezzabotta.

106
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,696
l don't have a degree.
l'm doing my thesis. lt's a little different.

107
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,824
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

108
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,037
The solitude of modern man
in contemporary theater.

109
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,080
lnteresting subject.
Right, Professor?

110
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
And what is the meaning
behind the capricious apparitions

111
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,628
of the girl at the springs?

112
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,380
An offer of purity,
of warmth to the protagonist?

113
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,594
Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst, and -

114
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,854
She didn't come.
Just as well.

115
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,043
- Yak! How are you?
- Not too bad.

116
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,795
- Did anybody recognize you?
- l don't think so.

117
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,755
You brought all that luggage?

118
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,384
lt's just five suitcases.
Gowns take up so much space.

119
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,888
l brought one... you'll see.
Did you get it all?

120
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,182
Carla, people go to bed early here.
There's nothing going on.

121
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,728
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows.

122
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,898
Our hotel probably
has a little nightclub, right?

123
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,983
Have you been a good boy?
- Yes.

124
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,904
Listen, l couldn't actually
get you a room in my hotel.

125
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,947
Besides, it's full of people
who know me.

126
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,577
So l found someplace else.
A wonderful hotel. Very charming.

127
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,621
What do you mean?

128
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,831
And how's this guy?

129
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,709
Sgulp? Great.

130
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,587
You look a little pale.
How come?

131
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,465
See, the hotel's right there.

132
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,135
Signora, guests.

133
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,431
As l said, it's not...
but it's very quiet.

134
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,225
lf you're hungry, l'll have
some sandwiches brought up.

135
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,353
lt's a little gloomy down here.

136
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,438
No, it's picturesque.

137
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,774
And l'm hungry.
You had lunch, but l didn't.

138
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,776
Hello, sir.

139
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,487
How's the solitaire?

140
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,614
Everything's ready -
the room, the bathroom.

141
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,866
Rest assured.
Signora will feel at home.

142
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,661
Thank you.
Would you have anything to eat?

143
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,621
- The bathroom?
- Over there.

144
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,165
l'll see to it personally.

145
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,710
The train is horrible.
lt leaves your hands so black.

146
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,254
Happy l'm here?
- Of course.

147
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,967
- Very happy or a little happy?
- Really happy.

148
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,595
What a nice smell!

149
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,432
l was sure this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

150
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,267
Really? Good.

151
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,354
But not a crease,
even after a three-hour trip.

152
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,321
You didn't even say if you like it.
Don't you like it?

153
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,990
What a beautiful lady!

154
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,911
So elegant.

155
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,080
That thing on her head -
is it ploosh?

156
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,957
That's right. Plush.

157
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,255
lt took forever to find it.
l was quite desperate.

158
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,425
But you know me. When Carla
sets her mind to something -

159
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,510
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

160
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,681
l read a good Donald Duck last week.
There was a dinosaur -

161
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,268
Here they are,
my little sweet buns.

162
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,520
Guido, be good.

163
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,689
What do you have in mind?

164
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,525
Have you really been a good boy?
- Of course.

165
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,029
Anyway, Sweet-buns is hungry.

166
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,864
Oh, my wedding ring.

167
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,117
Listen, Guido, about
that little thing you promised -

168
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,119
What little thing?

169
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,873
Just wait - now she'll
bring up her husband again.

170
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,335
Don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

171
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,506
Poor Luigi
doesn't seem happy at all.

172
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,052
You know,
my husband's not the pushy type.

173
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,387
That sort of thing depresses him.

174
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,891
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very smart.

175
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,477
lt's so hot here.

176
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,897
He knows all
of Roman history by heart.

177
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,566
He just needs a push.

178
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,027
He's still working at the fuel company
for the same salary.

179
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,361
Really?

180
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
Careful with that purse.
You'll break it.

181
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,659
l love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

182
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,872
Why don't you find him a job?

183
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,502
You know so many people.
You've promised so many times.

184
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,922
l even had a dream about it.

185
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,257
l dreamed that
you found him a job,

186
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,302
but he lost his mind
and killed us both.

187
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,930
- Who?
- You and me.

188
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,390
You know where we were?

189
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,354
That little street behind Via della Croce,
where l bought you

190
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,523
the same tie
your wife did, remember?

191
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,652
l never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

192
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,615
There we were on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked...

193
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:42,453
and he came in
and killed us both with a broom.

194
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,127
Make it a little darker.

195
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,380
That's it.

196
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,007
Now go out into the hallway
for a minute,

197
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,678
then pretend you've entered
a stranger's room.

198
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,972
What fun!
We've never done this one.

199
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,349
Hold it there.
Let me look at you.

200
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,645
No, your makeup
has to be more -

201
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,691
More what?

202
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,526
More slutty.

203
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,280
Come here.
Give me your eyeliner.

204
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,495
Nice lamp.

205
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,831
l'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

206
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,834
- What's this hotel called?
- The Railway Hotel.

207
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,795
l'll write my husband to send me
an express letter right away.

208
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,840
He writes such nice letters.
l'll let you read them.

209
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,342
Fine, but keep still.

210
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,428
Make a slutty face.

211
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,640
Go out in the hallway.

212
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,811
So l'm playing a part now, huh?
Think l'm one of your actresses?

213
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,440
Don't think l could do
what they do?

214
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,776
Anyway, l wouldn't want
a life like that.

215
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,945
l like staying home.

216
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,072
Go on.
l'm sleeping now.

217
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,787
Tell me: lf l did something
like this for real,

218
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,581
would you be jealous?

219
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,042
Why? Would you really?

220
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,420
Who knows?

221
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,175
- Do you need something?
- No, l just stepped outside.

222
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,053
- Shall l run you a bath?
- No, l was just -

223
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,681
- A glass of water, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

224
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,018
What did she want?

225
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,064
The innkeeper wanted
to give me a glass of water.

226
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,066
Come here.

227
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,443
Come on.

228
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,738
Open up the sheet.

229
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,159
Guido, do you love me?

230
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,535
Yes, yes.

231
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,607
ls that you, Mama?

232
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,071
So many tears, my son.

233
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,740
Papa, wait! Don't go.

234
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,576
We've talked so little.

235
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,375
Papa, l had so many
questions to ask you.

236
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,672
l can't answer them yet.

237
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,509
See how low this ceiling is?

238
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,972
l would have liked it higher.
lt's ugly, my son.

239
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,349
l'd have wanted
something different.

240
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,519
Couldn't you take care of it?

241
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,522
You used to draw so well.
l'd like -

242
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,067
Oh, the Commendatore.
He shouldn't have taken the trouble.

243
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,614
Hello.

244
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,118
My respects.
He has very little time.

245
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,124
How is he doing,
this son of mine?

246
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,669
Careful. Don't let him
play on your emotions.

247
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,798
What? He isn't doing well?

248
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,927
lt's so hard, realizing that
one has been so mistaken.

249
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,846
But l -

250
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,021
Mother prepared
a little something for you.

251
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,607
Some cheese and two peaches.

252
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,734
Don't worry about me.

253
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,362
Sure, this place
gets a little lonely,

254
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,781
but your mother comes every day.

255
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,408
She keeps me company,
you know.

256
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,285
And she keeps everything
in order.

257
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:55,498
A little decorum is always necessary.
That's how we were brought up.

258
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,085
Everything fine with your wife?
- Yes. Luisa -

259
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,005
You two have been my joy.
Good-bye, son.

260
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,972
What is this place?
Do you like it here?

261
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,601
l haven't figured it out yet.

262
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,895
But it's going better.

263
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,564
Much better.

264
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:25,820
You know, son, at first...

265
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,785
Guido, l do my best.
What more can l do?

266
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,924
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

267
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,219
l'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

268
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,054
What are you thinking about?

269
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:45,608
Good day.

270
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,347
Guido, in a few days,
l'll get you an introduction

271
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,891
so you can get
all the advice you need.

272
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,726
Nice mystical figure, right?

273
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,895
l brought you the three old men.

274
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,022
A Russian, a retired general -

275
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,525
- What old men?
- For the role of the father.

276
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,985
Cover me, Cesarino.

277
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,657
Come here, buffoon.

278
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,744
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

279
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,665
- l've called you six times.
- Yes, about a script for Claudia.

280
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,084
- Well?
- l thought l'd mail it to you.

281
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,253
ln fact, it's practically in the mail.
- Really?

282
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,922
You're young as ever.
Why aren't you still acting?

283
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,051
l was up all night
with an idea for the spaceship -

284
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,720
Conocchia, don't grab my arm!
l hate it!

285
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,973
And put on a jacket!

286
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,392
Now l need tails to talk to you!

287
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,561
How are you?
How was your trip?

288
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,230
Fine. lt's been an hour.

289
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,608
What a dazzling vision!

290
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,819
Bellissima!

291
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,990
- Really?
- Yes.

292
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,075
You're always calling me
bellissima,

293
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,619
but you never tell me
about my part.

294
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,456
How was my screen test?
- Wonderful, or you wouldn't be here.

295
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,502
l still don't know anything.
You said to look motherly

296
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,838
and eat a lot of pasta.

297
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,175
l've gained almost seven pounds.
ls that all?

298
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,595
See? You already know
more than me.

299
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,765
You're the author.
You might tell me a little more.

300
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,102
- What role does this woman play?
- You mean you -

301
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,687
Agostini!

302
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,147
Excuse me.

303
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,065
l don't mean to bother you.

304
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,110
The hotel is grand,
and the whisky is excellent,

305
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,945
but l have three questions.

306
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,031
We'll discuss them later.
What is it?

307
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,074
Ah, yes. Pardon me.

308
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,618
Agostini, we have to -

309
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,954
l just didn't feel
like talking to that guy. What is it?

310
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,540
Claudia has offers
from all over the world.

311
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,501
l can't keep her waiting.
Tell her something.

312
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,546
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

313
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:17,176
Does she realize that this might be
the best role she's ever played?

314
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,261
l'll explain.

315
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,481
- You're going to lose her.
- You want to see the old men?

316
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,149
Are you crazy?
We're ready to go.

317
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,109
- What do you want?
- The old men.

318
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,944
- Where are they?
- Here.

319
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,989
Signora Carla called.
She doesn't want to stay in that hotel.

320
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,367
She says it's awful,
and she's right.

321
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,161
l'll call the old men.

322
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,206
l'd like to introduce the little woman.

323
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,999
Delighted.

324
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,709
A great pleasure.

325
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,586
She writes too.

326
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,880
She works
for some ladies' magazines.

327
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,008
She has a few questions
for you too.

328
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,512
My readers
go crazy for love stories.

329
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:05,474
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

330
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,644
Here they are.
Say hello to the Dottore.

331
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,688
Come forward.

332
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,524
You too, General.
Say hello to the Dottore.

333
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,110
- How old are you?
- Seventy.

334
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,779
- And you?
- Sixty-four.

335
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,282
- And you?
- Sixty-eight.

336
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,121
They aren't old enough.

337
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,789
What? This one's
about to drop dead.

338
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,916
Next time l'll get three corpses.

339
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,043
You asked for a heartrending type.

340
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,671
One look at him
and you wanna cry.

341
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,594
Hello, Commendatore.

342
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,392
lf you kneel for me,
what would l have to do for you?

343
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,853
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.

344
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,354
How are you, my little Guido?

345
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,689
Hello, Commendatore.

346
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,191
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

347
00:28:56,317 --> 00:29:00,070
- Where's the swimming pool?
- We just got here. Be quiet.

348
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,322
Has the treatment helped?
- What's this?

349
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,574
Just a token.

350
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,535
- You're always giving me presents.
- lt never needs winding.

351
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:11,749
Ladies and gentlemen,
observe the little wristwatch.

352
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:16,795
- So are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, l really think so.

353
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,964
We've got the Americans
in the palm of our hand.

354
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,870
l've seen her passport.
She's 52 years old.

355
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,538
Just a young thing.

356
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,832
Good evening, signora.

357
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,460
And who are you, darling?

358
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,363
Mr. Director, may l ask
another little question?

359
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,205
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

360
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,040
Thank you. l got that.

361
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,710
You want to know
which political party l belong to.

362
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:24,047
As an honest man -
which all of you ltalians are -

363
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,050
you should be able
to answer this:

364
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,513
ls ltaly an essentially
Catholic country?

365
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,975
Be quiet
and eat your ice cream.

366
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,895
lt's the estimate for the spaceship.

367
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,357
l'd like to speak
with you privately later.

368
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,820
l'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

369
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,032
Fine, we'll talk later.
What was that about cholesterol?

370
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,432
- Where are our great writers?
- The early Fitzgerald.

371
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,353
Then his writing became an orgy
of pragmatism and brutal realism.

372
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,898
l mean,
what does Left or Right mean?

373
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:27,110
Are you optimistic enough to believe
that in this confused and chaotic world,

374
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,821
some people's ideas
are clear enough

375
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,658
that they belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right?

376
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,662
The Americans have this new
theory about lowering cholesterol...

377
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,873
- ls your asparagus good?
- Very good.

378
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,004
Approximately how many scenes
will there be?

379
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,923
What?

380
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,467
- How many scenes?
- Five.

381
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,387
Just five?

382
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,515
Perhaps six, or even seven.

383
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,433
Good evening, Commendatore.

384
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,310
Hi, Guido.

385
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,188
The ambassador's
giving the signora the eye.

386
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,736
So?

387
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,072
- l thought you'd like to know.
- Fine. Now l know.

388
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,783
- Shall l ask her to dance?
- Yes, do.

389
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:22,833
But l'm so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

390
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,711
l need a long time to live
with my character.

391
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:30,007
The lady says she needs
to get to know her character.

392
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:37,055
l need to get inside her skin,
her ideas, or l just can't do it.

393
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,683
Hasn't our maestro explained
the part yet?

394
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,352
l'm sorry, dear lady.

395
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:46,398
l don't have such information.
l'm only the producer.

396
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,943
Guido, isn't that right?
- You mustn't know a thing.

397
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,038
And now three days of rest.

398
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,542
They look like glass.

399
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,129
The first cherries of spring.

400
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,384
Thanks. And for Guido?

401
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,103
Mario Mezzabotta,
all 200 pounds of him.

402
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,439
Shall we take a little walk?

403
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,403
l know.

404
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,699
Naturally you think
l've gone soft in the head.

405
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,450
Yes.

406
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,119
- l'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- That's fine.

407
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:45,957
l may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

408
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,003
Could you create

409
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,381
something real, important,
and beautiful on demand?

410
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,426
For instance,
if the pope asked you?

411
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,221
Yes, l'll think about it.
Excuse me.

412
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,018
Listen, l'm not deluding myself.

413
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,729
Maybe she's just with me
for the money.

414
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,606
ln fact, l'm sure of it.

415
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,901
But l've never felt closer
to anybody in my life.

416
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,489
Just look at her.
She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

417
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,242
She has it all.
Just for the money?

418
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,953
There are loads of rich
young men around.

419
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,704
She clearly cares for you.

420
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,957
lt's true.

421
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,626
And she hasn't tried
to pressure me.

422
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,462
l made up my mind rationally.

423
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,589
The poor thing has never
even mentioned

424
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,009
my wife, my family.
Never a single reproach.

425
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,137
How did you meet her?

426
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,933
ln London. She was in school
with my daughter.

427
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,352
How long
have you been married?

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,730
- Forever. Thirty-one years.
- What does your wife...?

429
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,693
My wife took it very badly.
She hates her.

430
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,488
Meanwhile,
Gloria is fond of her.

431
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,868
Go ahead and say it:
l'm an ass.

432
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,745
There must be dates,
a shooting schedule.

433
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,541
Otherwise she'll lose a film in Germany.
We have other offers.

434
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,961
Will you leave me
in the dark till the end?

435
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,093
- You look like a lumachina.
- What's that?

436
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,679
Une petite escargot.

437
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,896
Listen to the voice
of the springs.

438
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,193
The Romans called them
"happy waters."

439
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,418
Maya,
let's entertain these bores a bit!

440
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,879
May l, madam?

441
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,343
Ready, Maya?
What am l holding?

442
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,471
A velvet evening bag.

443
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,599
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

444
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,060
A red one.

445
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,064
- No drugs, l hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

446
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,400
- A change purse.
- ls there any money in it?

447
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,737
2,725 lire.

448
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,201
And this lady here -
what is she thinking?

449
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,078
Nothing dirty, l hope.

450
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,705
Think about something.
- Like what?

451
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,416
Whatever you like.
Are you thinking?

452
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,797
"l'd like to live
another 1 00 years."

453
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,092
- Was that right?
- Yes!

454
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,763
And what does this lovely lady
have in her head?

455
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,556
Leave me alone.

456
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,934
May l think about a person?
- Yes!

457
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,644
Go ahead.

458
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,271
ln that case -

459
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,816
No, forget it. l'm too embarrassed.
- What for?

460
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,442
May l really think of a person?

461
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,279
l'd be afraid
to have my thoughts read.

462
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,322
Don't worry, darling.
No risk there.

463
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,743
- A little kiss and a big slap.
- ls that right?

464
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, "What a trickster."

465
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,211
Sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick,

466
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,422
and it's not just coincidence.

467
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,967
lt's an exceptional experiment
in magnetic force and telepathy.

468
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,470
l transmit your thoughts
to Mademoiselle Maya.

469
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,890
Do you think
you can hide your thoughts?

470
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,570
Please, leave her alone.
Don't insist.

471
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,613
Thoughts are sacred.

472
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,074
lt's just a game.

473
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,285
Maya, are you ready?

474
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,495
Just a moment, gentlemen.

475
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,914
May we know
what you're thinking?

476
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,249
You, for instance.

477
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,295
What else? My director.
"My cross and my delight."

478
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,923
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

479
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,428
- lt's been years, hasn't it?
- Yes, sadly, my friend.

480
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,971
l'll be right back.

481
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,349
You're famous now.
- Cut it out.

482
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,394
But tell me: What's the trick?
How do you transmit -

483
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,482
lt's partly a trick, partly real.
l don't know how, but it happens.

484
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,317
Can you transmit anything?

485
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,445
Anything.
Except to tell her to get lost.

486
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,655
- You want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

487
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,367
Watch, with you l'll mess up.

488
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,290
l don't understand.

489
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,293
l can't repeat it.

490
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,612
ls that right?

491
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,700
ls that it?

492
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,703
But what does it mean?

493
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,212
Guido, come here!
Where are you?

494
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,506
Don't be difficult.

495
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,216
l don't want a bath!

496
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,634
Come here.
Let me catch you.

497
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,428
l know what this rascal wants.

498
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,721
He wants his sweetheart
to carry him, doesn't he?

499
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,100
Come here.

500
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,186
He never wants to take
the wine bath, the naughty boy.

501
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,522
Don't you know it makes you
strong like a man?

502
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,025
Guido's afraid!
Guido's afraid!

503
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,426
Hell and tarnation!
The wood's all wet this year.

504
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,595
That cat is just
like your grandfather.

505
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,723
Always out on the prowl
and only comes home to eat.

506
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,309
Shame on you!
Go to bed!

507
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,480
Last time
l slammed the door in his face

508
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,983
and left him outside for two days.

509
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,986
l could have married again
and found a handsome man,

510
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,492
far better than
your grandfather, children.

511
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,869
What an idiot l am!

512
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,624
l thought that if l married again,
my first husband,

513
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,920
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't wait for me.

514
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,840
Quiet!
Go to bed, children!

515
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,218
To bed!

516
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,518
Did you really drink the wine?

517
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,871
Nanny, Claudio wet the bed!

518
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,250
What are you doing?
Go to sleep, all of you.

519
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,800
Little Guido, get under the covers.
lt's cold.

520
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,552
Lie still!

521
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,517
Did you say your prayers?

522
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,063
My beautiful little sticky bun.

523
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,816
Give me a kiss too.
Who do you love best?

524
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,151
Me, right?

525
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,738
l'll spank you all!
Go to sleep now!

526
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,201
You can't fool me.

527
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,329
l know when you're pretending.

528
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,376
Sleep tight, little ones.

529
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,503
Close your eyes!

530
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,148
Guido, tonight's the night
the eyes in the painting will move.

531
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,567
You're not scared, are you?
You have to be quiet.

532
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,653
Uncle Agostino will look in a corner,
and the treasure will be there.

533
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,656
Don't be scared. We'll be rich.
Remember the spell?

534
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:43,453
Asa nisi masa... asa nisi masa.

535
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,699
Sir, you had two or three
calls from Rome.

536
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,326
Your wife, l believe.

537
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,621
Really?
Fine. Get me the line.

538
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,248
Gino, get the gentleman the line.

539
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,167
This is for you.

540
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,169
Good night, sir.

541
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,548
Marcella, that call
from Rome, quickly.

542
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,598
Good night, sir.

543
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,770
No, l'm not offended.

544
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,773
There's only one thing
that offends me.

545
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,859
Oh, you know me well.

546
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,367
l forgive him for everything.

547
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,122
Everything.

548
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,754
Can we have a little chat?

549
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,589
Come sit beside me.

550
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,383
Sorry, but l'm going to bed.

551
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,844
l'm very tired,
and l'm expecting a call.

552
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,348
- Like some?
- No, thanks. l have a bad headache.

553
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,392
Give me your hands.

554
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,853
No, sit down.

555
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,524
l have a healing fluid
in my left hand.

556
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,277
l put it on my tummy
when it aches.

557
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,612
Take off your hat.

558
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,452
Better?

559
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,124
Yes, perhaps.

560
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,256
Why do you look at me that way?

561
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,341
And don't call me bellissima.

562
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,052
You make it sound like an insult.

563
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,888
What's wrong with you?

564
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,224
l don't know.

565
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:16,022
l feel like l've made a mess
of everything in my life

566
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,858
and my work.

567
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,239
Tell me, why do you enjoy
torturing me?

568
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,784
Torturing you? Come now.

569
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,829
Talk to me as you would
an old friend.

570
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,792
l need to feel close
to my director.

571
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,049
Did you see the movie
l shot in Belgrade?

572
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,218
l played a woman marked
by the injustices of time,

573
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,094
yet still desirable.

574
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,640
A hysterical personality -
purely fictional, of course.

575
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,018
- Play "Mystification."
- l don't know it.

576
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,189
ln this woman l played,

577
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,318
people find protection and love.

578
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:09,075
l am this character.
l'm like her in life and love.

579
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,953
That's why l'm so alone.

580
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:18,000
l've always forgiven everything
in the man - the men l love.

581
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,169
Sir, Rome's on the line.

582
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,256
l'm very sensual, and wicked too.

583
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,050
You're getting very close.
l'll be right back.

584
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,765
Rome on the line. Go ahead.

585
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,559
Hello?

586
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,269
Do you want Luisa?

587
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,647
Feeling guilty, you monster?
This is Rossella.

588
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,525
Rossella, how are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

589
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,861
Where were you out so late?

590
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,446
A rest cure! Some excuse.
Here's Luisa.

591
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,532
Thanks.

592
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,993
Guido, l called twice.
Where were you?

593
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,328
l know. l'm sorry.

594
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,707
l was up in the production office.
How are you?

595
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,002
Not bad.
How's the rest cure?

596
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,920
ls it helping?

597
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,716
Maybe. l think so.
l can't really rest much.

598
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,301
Are you having fun?

599
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,137
Oh, the usual, here with
Rossella, Tilde, and Enrico.

600
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,430
They were just leaving.

601
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,849
But are you having a good time?
Have you met anybody?

602
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,853
Hardly. lt's a terrible bore.
But it's better for my work.

603
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:24,734
You haven't run into anyone you know?
Are you always by yourself?

604
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,319
Of course.

605
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,029
Really?

606
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:33,159
Luisa, why don't you come visit?
lt's a quick trip.

607
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,786
When do you start shooting,
you jerk?

608
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,247
l don't know.
Put Luisa back on, please.

609
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,499
So you want me to come?

610
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,462
lf you'd like.
Maybe even bring a friend.

611
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,257
- But would it make you happy?
- Of course, or l wouldn't ask.

612
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,426
- More time, sir?
- No, thanks.

613
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,512
- When should l come?
- Whenever you'd like.

614
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,099
- Watch out, or l might really do it.
- Darling, l wouldn't have asked.

615
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,769
l'd love it. Good night now.

616
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,812
So long, you madman!

617
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,774
Night, Guido.

618
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,659
Monsieur Guido,
my agent thought -

619
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,578
Just a second, madam.
l have to see Agostino.

620
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,580
- Shit!
- lt's important.

621
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,708
We'll discuss everything
tomorrow morning, all right?

622
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,510
Beams for the central structure,
1 0,000.

623
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,554
Planks for steps, 260.

624
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,515
- Evening.
- Do you need something?

625
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,642
No, thanks.
Go on with your work.

626
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,771
What a production!

627
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,818
Hi, Eleonora.

628
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,323
Listen, Dottore, since you're here.

629
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,743
l called the pensione about
the German girl, but she's gone.

630
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,162
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

631
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,789
Really?

632
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,421
What should l do?

633
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,215
What an honor, Dottore!

634
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,634
You caught me
with my pants down!

635
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,055
Listen, Guido.
About that farm -

636
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,475
Ah, here it is.
Where's this place?

637
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,478
There's no address or anything.

638
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,480
lt's on the prince's estate.

639
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,066
Who's in there?
- My little nieces.

640
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,193
Eva and Dina.

641
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,195
Evening.

642
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,699
Come out here, silly.

643
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
He might give you a little part.

644
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,663
- lt's a pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

645
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,624
Where are you from?
- Trieste.

646
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,251
Hurray for ltaly!

647
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,049
- You've settled in, eh?
- Tell him about my cousin.

648
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,343
Guido, she has a female cousin
six feet tall.

649
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,013
She might be good for the movie.

650
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,890
This little minx here -

651
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,894
lt's true. She's as tall as me
when l stand on the bed.

652
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,563
- See?
- She's been Miss Nylon Stockings twice.

653
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,732
ls Guido in there?
l'm coming in.

654
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,567
Conocchia, l'll see you tomorrow.

655
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,279
- May l ask a question?
- Go ahead.

656
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,074
My friend here says

657
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,660
you don't know
how to make a love story.

658
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,287
She's right.

659
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,582
- Shall l wake you in the morning?
- No, thanks.

660
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,751
Pipe down, girls!

661
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,797
Our commander will never
catch us unprepared!

662
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,590
This production crew never sleeps!

663
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:37,676
l've got a splitting headache.
Stop that.

664
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,888
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

665
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:45,267
You need anything, Guido?
Any new ideas to tell me about?

666
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,105
No, Conocchia, l don't need anything.
Go back to bed.

667
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,774
- Anything at all.
- No, thanks. Good night.

668
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,401
Good night my ass!

669
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,614
Who can get to sleep
around here?

670
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,449
Conocchia, don't make a fuss.

671
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,577
Excuse me, but l've worked
in this business for 30 years

672
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,497
on movies none of you
could even imagine,

673
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,290
and l've never been afraid
of anything!

674
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,127
Why are you shouting,
you crazy old man?

675
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,088
Now you've said it.
"Old man."

676
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,883
lt finally came out.
Conocchia's an old man.

677
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,094
What do you want?
Get back inside.

678
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,722
You always keep me in the dark.

679
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,393
l never know what to do,
when to talk or when to shut up.

680
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,063
l'm not trying to pester you.
l don't want to know what it's about.

681
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:35,317
Want to keep it a secret? Go ahead!
- Please go back to bed.

682
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,780
lf l'm to help you,
like you've always appreciated,

683
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,534
you have to tell me something:
"Get rid of the French woman"

684
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,996
or "This is how l want the spaceship"
or "Go hang yourself!"

685
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,582
But tell me something!

686
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,042
You've changed, my friend.

687
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,630
Now you're crying too?

688
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,382
Aren't you ashamed?

689
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,135
l'm quitting tomorrow.

690
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,847
l don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

691
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,599
But be careful.

692
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,059
You're not the man
you used to be either.

693
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,003
A crisis of inspiration?

694
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:39,632
What if it's not just temporary,
my dear friend?

695
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:44,428
What if it's the final downfall
of a big fat no-talent impostor?

696
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,721
Sgulp!

697
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,251
Let's suppose
you're the symbol of purity

698
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,753
and spontaneity.

699
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,423
But what the hell does it mean
to be truly honest?

700
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,300
Didn't you hear
what that big hawk said?

701
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,511
"lt's time to set
all the symbols aside -

702
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,889
the lure of purity,
innocence, escape."

703
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,434
What is it you want?

704
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,910
Yes, this could work.

705
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:54,456
There's a museum in the town,
and you're the custodian's daughter,

706
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,294
who grew up among images
of ancient beauty.

707
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,020
You're right.

708
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,350
l've come to stay and never leave.

709
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,853
l want to bring order.

710
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,647
l want to clean.

711
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,526
l want to bring order,
l want to -

712
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,957
A call for you
from the Railway Hotel.

713
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,876
Put it through.

714
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,669
Hello?

715
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,671
Who's there?

716
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,590
Hello!

717
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,593
Guido, l feel awful.
The mineral water made me sick.

718
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,721
l have a fever.
Come over right away.

719
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,724
At this time of night?
l can't. l'll come tomorrow.

720
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,725
Come.

721
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,813
The poor thing was calling for you.
Here's the ice.

722
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,944
She's burning up.
Her temperature's at least 1 04.

723
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,906
Should l bring the peas?
- What peas?

724
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,701
ln her delirium she asked for peas.
A good sign.

725
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,703
No, forget about the peas.

726
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,997
lf you need anything,
let us know.

727
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,046
Carla.

728
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,009
Have you run a sudden
high fever like this before?

729
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:18,934
Yes, the slightest thing
and it shoots up to 1 04.

730
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,895
Then it passes.
My husband's used to it.

731
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,314
lt doesn't scare him.

732
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,901
No, don't get up.
Stay under the covers.

733
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,028
l'm so hot. l'm thirsty.

734
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,489
Wait, l'll get it for you.
Here.

735
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,870
Drink slowly
or you'll get bloated.

736
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,540
ls it day or night?

737
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,334
Night?
lt's 4:00 in the afternoon.

738
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,296
We'll wait and see
what the doctor has to say.

739
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,257
lt wouldn't be a bad idea
to send your husband a telegram.

740
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:54,887
We can't take responsibility.
Yes, he ought to know.

741
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,433
No, l don't want it to be over.
He'll take me away.

742
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,935
l bought so many
pretty little dresses.

743
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,979
Why did you drink all that water?

744
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,148
That's for sick people.
Are you sick?

745
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,359
Whenever there's something
to gorge on, you always -

746
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:13,572
What am l supposed to do?
You leave me alone all the time.

747
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,871
l drew up a will two years ago.

748
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,708
lt's not like you die sooner
just because you make a will.

749
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,254
You see,
l have a brother and sister,

750
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,925
but l'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

751
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:37,012
lt's mine, but how would
the poor thing manage without it,

752
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,223
even if he does remarry?

753
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,975
Ah, these sheets!

754
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,190
Guido, tell me the truth.

755
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,693
The truth, you hear?

756
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,029
Why are you with me?

757
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,909
What can l say
to the cardinal tomorrow?

758
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:05,249
Yes, l read the brief synopsis
your producer sent us. Very interesting.

759
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,501
However, realistically speaking,

760
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,880
a prince of the church
would never meet your protagonist

761
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,674
during a mud treatment.

762
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,051
l'm sorry,
but it's quite impossible.

763
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,345
A high prelate
has his own private room.

764
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,056
Yes, but l was seeking
an unconventional encounter.

765
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,182
ln what sense?

766
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,102
The protagonist received
a Catholic upbringing -

767
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,397
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

768
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,566
- A pleasure.
- You must be the director.

769
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,236
ls this film of a religious nature?

770
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,612
ln a way.

771
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,074
l was explaining that the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

772
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,243
like all of us,

773
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:46,081
so he has certain complexes,
certain needs he can no longer repress.

774
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,251
A prince of the church seems to him
like the guardian of a truth

775
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,087
he can no longer accept,
although it still fascinates him.

776
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,008
So he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps even a revelation.

777
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,678
- Saul in Damascus, right?
- Don't we all harbor such hopes?

778
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,264
l realize it may sound
a bit superficial, even clumsy.

779
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,932
No, that's not it.

780
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:08,604
l just don't believe cinema
lends itself to certain topics.

781
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,441
You mix sacred
and profane love too casually.

782
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,818
Don't you think?
- lt depends.

783
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,238
Yours is a great responsibility.
You can either educate

784
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,115
or corrupt millions of souls.

785
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,451
ln any case,
His Eminence will listen to you.

786
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,454
You may ask him a few questions.

787
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,628
Your Eminence,
allow me to introduce the director.

788
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,131
Please have a seat.

789
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,470
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence,

790
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,972
but my producer
is beset by doubts,

791
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,476
perhaps with good reason,
and he insisted that l -

792
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,729
- Are you married?
- Yes.

793
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,066
- Any children?
- Yes - l mean no.

794
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,360
- How old are you?
- Forty-three.

795
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,575
- You hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

796
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,994
Do you know what it's called?

797
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,580
lt's called Diomedeo.

798
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,126
Legend has it that
when Diomedes died,

799
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:16,755
all these little birds gathered

800
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:21,176
and sang a funeral chorus
as they accompanied him to his grave.

801
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,930
Hear that?
lt sounds like sobbing.

802
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,550
Guido, let's go see Saraghina.

803
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,268
l'm coming.

804
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,285
Saraghina!

805
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,720
Saraghina, dance the rumba.

806
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,306
Come here.

807
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,602
You should be ashamed!

808
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,396
lt's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

809
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,732
l don't believe it. lt can't be.

810
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,987
Look at your mother!

811
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,573
Stop right there.

812
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,784
Oh God, the shame!

813
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,163
The shame and anguish!

814
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,422
The shame!

815
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,203
"Throughout his whole life,
anywhere he lived,

816
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:45,333
the pious Luigi abhorred most of all
any contact with women,

817
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:48,294
whose presence he so avoided

818
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:52,841
that everyone thought he had
a natural antipathy toward them."

819
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,385
Get down!

820
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,013
"...even with his sister,
the marquise,

821
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:02,267
and if it happened
that while he was speaking to her..."

822
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,876
Don't you know
that Saraghina is the devil?

823
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,087
No, l didn't know.
l really didn't.

824
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,613
So what does it mean?

825
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,869
lt's a character based
on your childhood memories.

826
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:47,997
lt has no connection
with a true critical conscience.

827
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,501
No, if you really wish
to engage in a polemic

828
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:56,214
about Catholic consciousness
in ltaly, my dear friend,

829
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:01,761
you'd need a much
higher degree of culture,

830
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,974
as well as a rigorously
clear-headed logic.

831
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,726
Forgive me...

832
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,814
but your naivete
is a serious failing.

833
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,818
Your little nostalgia-bathed
memories,

834
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,780
your harmless and essentially
sentimental evocations -

835
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,159
"What?" said the parish priest.
"With a communist?"

836
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,994
He didn't say "a man," you see?

837
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,122
Catholic consciousness!

838
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,879
Just think what Suetonius was
in the time of the caesars!

839
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:40,300
No, you set out to denounce,

840
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:45,096
but you end up an accomplice.

841
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:48,308
l'm sure you see
the confusion and ambiguity.

842
01:09:55,816 --> 01:10:00,028
My dear doctor,
l'm very angry with you, you know?

843
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,696
You don't need me anymore.

844
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,323
That's not true.

845
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,910
127: showers and mud baths.

846
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,537
1 29: massages.

847
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:14,000
1 31 : inhalations.

848
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,477
Hello, Commendatore.

849
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,106
l've figured out
what you're trying to get at:

850
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,526
a man's inner confusion.

851
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,404
But you must be clear
and get your point across.

852
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,490
Otherwise what's the use?

853
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,787
Let's go.

854
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,498
Attention.

855
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,752
Dr. Angelis,
please report to the rest area.

856
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:03,424
lf what you have to say is interesting,
it must be so for everybody.

857
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,220
How can you not care
if audiences understand?

858
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,390
l'm sorry, but that's
arrogant and presumptuous.

859
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,725
Commendatore...

860
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,187
let's go over there.
Breathe deeply.

861
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,605
Hi, Guido.

862
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,774
l've saved you
a spot by the steam.

863
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,696
l saw the spaceship this morning.
lt's 1 65 feet tall already.

864
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,590
Mario.

865
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,240
Guido, His Eminence
is waiting for you.

866
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,577
We repeat:

867
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:16,664
His Eminence is waiting.

868
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,918
Get dressed, quickly.

869
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,171
The cardinal is waiting.
Tell him everything.

870
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,465
Confess everything.
Don't hide anything.

871
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:29,177
lf you can,
put in a good word for me too.

872
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,472
This is a golden opportunity.
The cardinal!

873
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,892
You're so lucky.
He can grant anything.

874
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,854
Get me my Mexican divorce.
He won't say no to you.

875
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,940
Above all, be devout.
Fall on your knees,

876
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,985
kiss his ring, cry,
say you've repented.

877
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:52,158
Getting in their good graces means
you can have anything you want in life.

878
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:56,037
l beg of you, Guido.
We're in your hands.

879
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,253
Just five minutes.

880
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,230
Your Eminence, l'm not happy.

881
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,235
Why should you be happy?

882
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,238
That is not your task.

883
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,493
Who told you we come
into this world to be happy?

884
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,663
Origen says in his homilies,

885
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,334
"Extra ecclesiam nulla salus."

886
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,296
There is no salvation
outside the church.

887
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,884
"Extra ecclesiam nemo salvatur."

888
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:56,180
No one will find salvation
outside the church.

889
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,935
"Salus extra ecclesiam

890
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,438
non est."

891
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,692
There is no salvation
outside the church.

892
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,779
"Civitas dei."

893
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,240
He who does not belong
to the City of God

894
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:18,244
belongs to the City of the Devil.

895
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,480
Come see this great human
phenomenon, the fakir Shiva,

896
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,982
who's broken
all previous records.

897
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,693
Our experiment is monitored daily

898
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,321
by European experts.

899
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:21,516
20,000... 22,000... 23,000.
And the lady in the back?

900
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,518
25,000.

901
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,353
The bid is 25,000.

902
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,147
Do l hear 30,000?

903
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:33,069
35,000... 40,000.
Very good.

904
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,697
Any more offers?
l have 50,000.

905
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,764
- When did you get here?
- At 5:00.

906
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,058
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

907
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,561
How are you?
- Fine.

908
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,440
Who did you come with?
- Rossella, Enrico, and Tilde.

909
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,901
- Where's Rossella?
- Over there.

910
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,281
Good girl.
You actually came.

911
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,241
You look good, you know?

912
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,493
Hey, Rossa!

913
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,289
The last time we danced together
was a year ago.

914
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,460
Luisa, darling.
You're such a sweetheart.

915
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,879
l'm so happy you came.

916
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:37,925
lt's always the same.
Whenever you're far away -

917
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,594
You feel lonely.

918
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,846
ls that true?
Did you miss me?

919
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,435
You didn't have the company
of all these lovely ladies?

920
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,270
Ah, so you noticed them.

921
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,689
No flings since you left?

922
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,942
Poor Guido.
And your famous virility?

923
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,777
- You smell so nice.
- You like it?

924
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,571
You're so light.

925
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,366
How's your project going?
Better?

926
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:06,245
Well, l don't think l've made
any great progress.

927
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:10,333
What's it about?
What are you up to this time?

928
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,211
Sorry.

929
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,007
Am l mistaken,
or is Enrico a little in love with you?

930
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,723
Adorable, isn't she?

931
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,814
Wonderful!

932
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,691
Good evening.
So nice to have you here.

933
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:40,655
Maestro, we're at your disposition.
Shall we get going?

934
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:41,822
l'm coming.

935
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:43,991
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

936
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:47,036
the depths of insanity
to which a producer can fall.

937
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,831
Frankly, l'd rather not
shake hands with this lovely lady.

938
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,709
One touch and she knows
what you're thinking.

939
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:57,463
- l knew it! Who else?
- Your guiding spirit.

940
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,840
Haven't you reached
that stage of intimacy yet?

941
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,718
- May l introduce my sister?
- Ah, the beautiful little sister.

942
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,638
You see the kind of women
your director attracts?

943
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,515
How lucky to meet you,
Commendatore.

944
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,184
l just finished a screenplay
about nuclear warfare.

945
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,645
Only a producer of your courage
could get it made.

946
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,147
ls the beautiful sorceress
part of your harem too?

947
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:19,235
Let's just say l'm a sort
of managing supervisor.

948
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,823
So are you any better?
Has the solitude helped?

949
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,659
Actually,
you do look like a new man.

950
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,620
But really, are you better?
l was a little worried.

951
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,666
lt was good of you to invite Luisa.
She was so happy.

952
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,712
l'd rather not go.
You don't really need me.

953
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:41,382
l insist, my friend.
Get in Conocchia's car.

954
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,467
Sweetie, go ride with the others.

955
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,886
Guido, where's your wife?
- She was just here.

956
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,681
Rossella, come with us.
- Sit next to me.

957
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,392
l want to tell you
a strange story.

958
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,562
My sister was a nun who died young.
- Luisa, come on.

959
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,733
One night her portrait
suddenly changes expression -

960
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,860
Rossella, get in -

961
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,237
as if to warn me of some danger.

962
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,406
l'll sit in front.

963
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,576
A few days later my uncle tells me,

964
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,954
"Come to the market with me, kid."
He drove an lsotta-Fraschini.

965
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,166
l was telling about a premonition.

966
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:46,197
What do you think? You gotta be
crazy to listen to this director.

967
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,699
Bundle up. lt's damp.

968
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:54,038
Renato, where are you?

969
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,248
Here, Commendatore.
Good evening.

970
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:58,209
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

971
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,545
Follow me. Careful.
The ground's uneven.

972
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:05,925
lt seems we're a bit behind.
- No, we're already up to 230 feet.

973
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,803
What's wrong with Luisa?
Suddenly she's so nervous and angry.

974
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,181
l don't know.
She was so happy to come see you.

975
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,391
Maybe you said something
that upset her.

976
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:15,935
What's this?

977
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,354
l find this
extraordinarily fascinating.

978
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,565
This model will be
superimposed on the structure

979
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,901
to create the illusion that
the rocket's on the launch pad.

980
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:27,238
Am l right?
- Yes, that's right.

981
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,534
And this is the launch ramp,
for the most important scene.

982
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,744
Come on up.
lt's perfectly safe.

983
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:37,081
No pictures.
- Just one, Commendatore.

984
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,250
What's your husband up to?

985
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:40,876
A science fiction film?

986
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,212
How should l know?
Ask him.

987
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,757
Giancarlo wrote him
such a wonderful story about Martians.

988
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,927
What's this amusement park for?

989
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:54,598
No construction company
wanted to take on this job.

990
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,059
lt rests entirely on sand.

991
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,895
Cesarino, how many pounds
of concrete did it take?

992
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,815
Pounds? Tons!

993
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,692
Four hundred tons.

994
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,486
lf you don't mind,
l'll stop at the first landing.

995
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:09,154
l have vertigo.

996
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,907
With 80 million you could buy
at least ten apartments.

997
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,286
lt's a pompous shack, just like him.
A self-portrait.

998
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,414
The little sister-in-law isn't
exactly tender toward our director.

999
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,583
Maybe she's in love.
- With him?

1000
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,960
l pray day and night
to be spared a husband like him.

1001
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,463
- Still more climbing?
- l'll gladly carry you.

1002
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:31,135
When l think he spent
80 million on this structure.

1003
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,471
Wouldn't a nice painted backdrop
have been better?

1004
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,474
A backdrop! That's from
your grandfather's day.

1005
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:40,352
Besides, are they your millions,
Conocchia?

1006
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,522
Luisa...

1007
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,817
are you cold?
Take my jacket.

1008
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,904
No, thank you. We're going back
to the hotel now anyway.

1009
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:57,244
ls something wrong?
You got sad all of a sudden.

1010
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:00,623
Didn't you?

1011
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,293
No, l'm not sad at all.

1012
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:10,674
The sequence opens
with an image of Earth

1013
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:13,969
completely destroyed
by thermonuclear war.

1014
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:17,765
Guido seemed
really happy to see you.

1015
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:21,894
...and the spaceship, our new
Noah's Ark, flees the atomic plague,

1016
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,855
while the rest of humanity
seeks refuge on another planet.

1017
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:30,110
More than 1 5,000 extras,
a tragic multitude in search of -

1018
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:33,364
We're really going to see
all that in your movie?

1019
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,783
Mamma mia!
The prophet speaks.

1020
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,160
He's decided to scare everybody.

1021
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,705
You mean you like stories
where nothing happens too?

1022
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:46,585
l'm putting all kinds
of things in this film.

1023
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,046
Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1024
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,548
Sailor, come here.

1025
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,134
Show us what you learned in America.
No, l don't want water.

1026
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,303
Dance and l'll give you a part.

1027
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,222
Dance.

1028
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:08,565
Guido, what's going on?

1029
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:12,653
Rossella, cut the big-sister tone.
lt puts me off right away.

1030
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,740
Mr. Director, what part do l play?

1031
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:24,748
What does Luisa think about me?
What does she want?

1032
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:27,751
- What's my part?
- Go away!

1033
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:33,215
Luisa doesn't talk much.
Not even to me, her best friend.

1034
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,802
l really don't know what she wants.
She's lost.

1035
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:40,139
One day she says one thing,
the next day something else.

1036
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,766
Unfortunately,
l think the only thing she'd like

1037
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,643
is for you to be different.

1038
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,562
Why?

1039
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,273
lt's the mistake we all make.

1040
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:55,654
ls that gentle fellow courting her?
ls he in love with her?

1041
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,616
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
No more guilty conscience.

1042
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,286
You're such a scoundrel.

1043
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,288
Poor Enrico.

1044
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,958
He's so clumsy at it
that everyone's noticed.

1045
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:11,211
He hangs around her, listens to her,
keeps her company.

1046
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,422
He's a wonderful friend.

1047
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,928
l thought my ideas were so clear.

1048
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:24,224
l wanted to make an honest film.
No lies whatsoever.

1049
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:29,396
l thought l had something
so simple to say.

1050
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,191
Something useful to everybody.

1051
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,860
A film to help bury forever

1052
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:37,863
all the dead things
we carry around inside.

1053
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:44,369
lnstead, it's me who lacks
the courage to bury anything at all.

1054
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,500
Now l'm utterly confused,

1055
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,877
with this tower on my hands.

1056
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,216
l wonder why things
turned out this way.

1057
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,054
Where did l lose my way?

1058
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:06,850
l really have nothing to say,

1059
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,853
but l want to say it anyway.

1060
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,191
Why don't those spirits of yours
come to my aid?

1061
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,361
You always said they had
lots of messages for me.

1062
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,321
Let them get to work.

1063
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:23,242
l've already told you:
Your attitude is all wrong.

1064
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,203
You're curious in a childish way.

1065
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:28,288
You want too many guarantees.

1066
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:32,709
- Fine, but what do they say?
- The same as always.

1067
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,505
They're very reasonable.
They know you very well.

1068
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,173
Well then?

1069
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:43,929
They say you're free,
but you have to choose.

1070
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,557
And you don't have much time.

1071
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:48,767
You have to hurry.

1072
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,479
Guido!

1073
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,732
Are you two coming up?

1074
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:45,908
- Room 320, please.
- He's still out.

1075
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,784
l see. Thanks.

1076
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,746
Have you got a headache?

1077
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,123
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1078
01:27:35,249 --> 01:27:37,000
You take them often?

1079
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:40,170
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1080
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:45,342
What's worrying you now?

1081
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,742
What?

1082
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:13,203
Nothing.
lf you could only see yourself.

1083
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,414
Why are you laughing?

1084
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,916
l don't think
l could ever cheat on you,

1085
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,627
if only because
l couldn't bear the absurdity,

1086
01:28:20,753 --> 01:28:23,380
the effort of having to hide

1087
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,883
and lie -
but it's obviously easy for you.

1088
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:31,138
Listen, Luisa,
l'm very happy you're here,

1089
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,725
but l'm very tired and sleepy.

1090
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:39,896
Then sleep.

1091
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,066
Good night.

1092
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,908
l don't know what you expect
to discover in my life by reducing it all

1093
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:55,078
to the pettiness of somebody
stealing from the cookie jar.

1094
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:58,582
What do you know about my life,
what l hate and what l don't?

1095
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,751
l only know what you show me.

1096
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:06,923
And what do l show you?

1097
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,593
Tell me what you see.

1098
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,846
Where do you hope to get
with your moral judgments?

1099
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:14,514
Nowhere.

1100
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,309
l know we've been stuck
in the same place for years.

1101
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,728
You're the one who always
asks me to come back,

1102
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,272
who thinks
we can always start over.

1103
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,650
Once and for all,
l don't want to start anything over.

1104
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,110
Just what do you want?

1105
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:30,697
Why did you ask me here?
What good am l to you?

1106
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:33,825
What are you trying to get from me?
What is it you want?

1107
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:55,365
Relax.

1108
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,368
l spotted her last night
as soon as l got in.

1109
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:09,796
l've asked no questions.
l don't want to know.

1110
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:14,092
Just spare me the embarrassment
of hearing you swear to a lie again.

1111
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,515
She must have been born
in March or April.

1112
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:23,226
She's a real Aries type.

1113
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,062
l'll tell you what type she is.

1114
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:30,150
Exactly the type to make

1115
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,570
a good companion
for feeble, spineless,

1116
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,488
confused men.

1117
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,074
Luisa, l didn't know.

1118
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,578
l'm seeing her for the first time,
like you.

1119
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:45,081
Really, everybody
comes to this place.

1120
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:48,251
lt's no surprise
to run into the poor thing here.

1121
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,590
So that's why you've been
tormenting me since last night.

1122
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,218
Why didn't you
just come out and say it?

1123
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,472
What offends me most
is that people could think

1124
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:03,099
l'd go around with somebody
who dresses like that.

1125
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:04,768
Have you seen her getup?

1126
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:08,230
- Let's go for a walk.
- Let's drop this now.

1127
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:11,024
lt's been over for three years.
Finished. Enough.

1128
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,946
He drives me crazy.

1129
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,282
He acts as if he's telling
the god's honest truth.

1130
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:22,452
Look at him.
He thinks he's in the right.

1131
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,664
How can you live this way?

1132
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,459
lt's not right to lie all the time,

1133
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,628
never letting others know
what's true or false.

1134
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,422
ls it really all the same to you?

1135
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:38,051
Forgive me. l know.
l'm being a real pain.

1136
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:43,014
How sad to play the middle-class wife
who doesn't understand.

1137
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:47,602
Tell me what l should do.
l can't laugh about it like you.

1138
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,438
Sweetie, l'm not laughing.

1139
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:55,193
What do you talk to her about?

1140
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,451
What disgusts me most is that
you've mixed her up in our life.

1141
01:33:03,577 --> 01:33:05,954
She knows everything
about you and me.

1142
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:10,208
That whore. Cow!

1143
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:17,007
You're the real pain, you know.

1144
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:25,557
And yet...

1145
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,374
Signora Carla,
you sing so beautifully.

1146
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:53,293
No, l'm just an amateur.

1147
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,337
And how pretty you are.

1148
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:59,215
l've wanted to meet you for so long.
- Same here.

1149
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,223
You're so stylish.

1150
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,059
You're the stylish one.

1151
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:11,394
Frankly, l'm a bit trashy.

1152
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:13,438
Nonsense!
You're very refined.

1153
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:16,149
You like it?
lt's a little outfit l saw in Vogue.

1154
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:18,151
lt took me forever to find it.

1155
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:21,112
But when Carla
gets an idea in her head -

1156
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,586
Here he comes!

1157
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,423
Guido's here!

1158
01:34:41,133 --> 01:34:42,634
Good evening, ladies.

1159
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,470
Close the doors.
There's a blizzard.

1160
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,680
How are you? Well?

1161
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,892
Every package has a name on it.
Don't mix them up.

1162
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,727
This is for Caterina.

1163
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:55,021
He's a darling!

1164
01:34:55,147 --> 01:34:56,856
For my dear sister-in-law,

1165
01:34:56,982 --> 01:35:00,527
who finally likes me
and understands how things should be.

1166
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:02,404
We'll draw your bath right away.

1167
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,280
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1168
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,450
Thank you.
l must speak to you, Guido.

1169
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,161
l know what she wants to tell you.

1170
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:13,164
We'll have to send her away now.
She's acting jealous.

1171
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:15,458
What were you doing upstairs?

1172
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:19,295
l went to see those poor things.
They'd be alone all the time if not for me.

1173
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:21,297
The role doesn't suit her.

1174
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,384
She's just a middle-class woman
with no style.

1175
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,178
Leave him alone now. He's tired.
He has to take his bath.

1176
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:30,140
Guido, it's splendid.
l've always wanted one like it.

1177
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:33,101
Gloria, Carla, Hedy!
Get the buckets.

1178
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:37,772
Guido, my husband wrote.

1179
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:40,984
He wants me home for New Year's,
just for a day.

1180
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:44,195
lf you mind, l'll tell him l can't.
- No, that's fine.

1181
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:46,072
Come on, Carlotta.

1182
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,996
Who's that little black girl?
- A surprise from us. From Hawaii.

1183
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:54,998
Don't you remember her?

1184
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,334
You always talked about her.

1185
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,301
Thank you, Luisa.
You're so kind.

1186
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,344
What a sweet thought.

1187
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:19,230
- That tiara is mine.
- l know. l'll give it back.

1188
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,151
Oh, darling!

1189
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,695
What a thrill to find you here.

1190
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:28,072
- How are you?
- Fine.

1191
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:32,035
But tell me, lovely lady:
Who are you?

1192
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:35,413
The name doesn't matter.
l'm happy to be here.

1193
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:38,082
Don't ask me any questions.
- May l stay?

1194
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,084
Of course, you pretty thing.

1195
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,879
But l'm busy now.

1196
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,714
What about later?

1197
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,135
Rossella?
What are you doing here?

1198
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:51,429
Playing Pinocchio's talking cricket.
You mind?

1199
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:53,181
No, but why are you laughing?

1200
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:56,142
No reason. l just want
to see how you manage.

1201
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,562
You finally have your harem,
King Solomon.

1202
01:36:59,688 --> 01:37:01,439
- Wasn't it about time?
- Sure.

1203
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:07,237
Put me in.

1204
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:11,199
Guido, aren't you a little afraid?

1205
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,660
Of what?
Everything's going fine.

1206
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:15,870
May l stay too? lt's such fun.

1207
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:17,705
l don't want anything.
l'll just watch you.

1208
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,916
Do you know the rule?
lt must be obeyed.

1209
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:21,584
Come help me.

1210
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:27,924
lt's a two-piece outfit with busby
in ostrich feathers. Like it?

1211
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,094
Ah, hello, Hedy.
lt's beautiful.

1212
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,304
What's this rule?

1213
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:36,224
l don't know.
He promised me a part in his movie

1214
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,143
and said there'd be
a lot of costume changes.

1215
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:46,317
That's enough now, girls.
Get me out.

1216
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:51,364
- Gloria, the talcum powder.
- Ah, yes.

1217
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:56,035
She prepared something
just the way you like it.

1218
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:58,204
- Really?
- A cake.

1219
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,873
- Are you happy, girls?
- Of course.

1220
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,750
lsn't this just what
you've always wanted?

1221
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:04,168
lt certainly is.

1222
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,337
lsn't he the best little boy
in the world?

1223
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:08,423
Nadine, hurry up with the powder.

1224
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,926
Nadine! What was it you used
to say in Copenhagen?

1225
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:15,221
We're delighted
to invite our passengers

1226
01:38:15,347 --> 01:38:17,307
to spend the night
in Copenhagen.

1227
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:20,101
Listen to that voice, girls.

1228
01:38:20,477 --> 01:38:23,313
The company will pay all expenses.

1229
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,691
A wonderful night to all of you.

1230
01:38:32,197 --> 01:38:34,324
Madeleine, come help us.

1231
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:35,450
Saraghina.

1232
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,994
Here l am. l'll carry Guido.

1233
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,747
The poor man!
The scalding water turned him all red!

1234
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:45,335
- Such nice thin legs.
- Straight as when he was a boy.

1235
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:48,338
He acts like a little boy,
but he's really very complex.

1236
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,673
Don't be fooled.
He's a hypocrite.

1237
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,175
No, he's not.

1238
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:56,012
Why should he explain to strangers?
He knows how to protect us.

1239
01:38:56,847 --> 01:38:59,265
Guido, help!

1240
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:01,726
- Who's screaming like that?
- Jacqueline.

1241
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:04,270
She refuses to go upstairs
with the older women,

1242
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:06,356
so we put her in the cellar.

1243
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:07,815
This is scandalous!

1244
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:11,152
l don't want to speak to those hags.
They're all older than me.

1245
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,029
l'm 26.

1246
01:39:13,155 --> 01:39:15,531
You can check
with the Paris public registry.

1247
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:18,785
Jacqueline Bonbon, 26,

1248
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:22,038
July 4, 1 938.

1249
01:39:22,164 --> 01:39:24,749
You have no right
to send me upstairs.

1250
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:26,584
lt's not my time yet.

1251
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:29,879
Look how agile l am.
Look at these legs.

1252
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:33,841
Which of you has such a firm
little behind? Look at this bosom.

1253
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:36,928
Guido, don't send me upstairs.

1254
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:39,389
l don't want to go upstairs.

1255
01:39:39,723 --> 01:39:41,307
lt's the rule,

1256
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:44,227
and the rule is the rule.

1257
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,896
Calm down.
lt's nice upstairs too.

1258
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:49,565
- lt's not true!
- Your earring.

1259
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,737
You've always been fond of me.

1260
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:57,573
Please tell him
to give me an extension.

1261
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,326
Guido, couldn't you give
Jacqueline an extension?

1262
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,995
Now you're
breaking my balls too?

1263
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:06,582
l beg you.
Just for a year, Guido.

1264
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:07,959
No extension!

1265
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,128
- l won't go upstairs.
- What's that?

1266
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,338
- l won't go.
- Say that again, if you dare.

1267
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:13,756
l won't go upstairs!

1268
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:17,927
She's crazy. l told you
we should never have taken her in.

1269
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:20,138
Learn the rules, sister.

1270
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:23,349
"Whoever exceeds the age limit
shall go to the upper floor,

1271
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:26,561
where she shall be treated equally well..."
- "... and bask in her memories.

1272
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:30,565
- lt's disgusting and absurd.
- We should never have agreed to it.

1273
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,613
lt's not fair!

1274
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:41,743
A rule laid down by a man
who fails the test himself.

1275
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:44,746
A real man loves women
with no regard to their age.

1276
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:47,707
ln France such a man would be
the shame of the nation.

1277
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:50,001
Are we lemons
to squeeze and toss out?

1278
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,837
- Guido, they're so right.
- You're a monster!

1279
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:57,633
The hour of liberation has come!

1280
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:00,511
Hurray for Jacqueline,
who showed us the way to freedom!

1281
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,389
Down with the tyrant!
Down with Bluebeard!

1282
01:41:03,515 --> 01:41:06,893
We have the right to be loved
until we're 70 years old.

1283
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:11,230
Down with Guido!

1284
01:41:11,356 --> 01:41:13,232
You think you're a young man?

1285
01:41:13,358 --> 01:41:16,068
Let's make this clear:
He doesn't know how to make love.

1286
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:18,070
He's all words and caresses.

1287
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,615
- And he falls asleep right away.
- l'm not sleeping. l'm thinking.

1288
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:23,493
Guido, don't send us upstairs
when we get old.

1289
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,620
That's enough! Down!

1290
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:30,500
Quick!
They're revolting upstairs too.

1291
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:37,507
Oh, delicious!

1292
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,092
Bastard! Liar!

1293
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:42,220
l came all the way from Paris.
What's my -

1294
01:41:43,096 --> 01:41:44,764
What's my part?

1295
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:47,934
What's my role in the film?

1296
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:52,188
You liked when l danced the conga.

1297
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,190
l don't like it anymore.

1298
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,609
Luisa, help!

1299
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:59,028
No, my dear.
This is my husband's business.

1300
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:01,948
lf that's his decision,
that's how it is. lt's the rule.

1301
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,700
Guido, hurry up.
The soup's getting cold.

1302
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,036
Can't you see l'm busy?

1303
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:09,580
What an extraordinary man.

1304
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:13,876
He needs to act this way.
He does it almost every night.

1305
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:19,382
Guido, don't you remember me?

1306
01:42:20,133 --> 01:42:22,468
Darling, you're hurt.
l'll get you some cream.

1307
01:42:22,594 --> 01:42:24,262
- No cream.
- Some balm.

1308
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,847
- No balm.
- Some drops.

1309
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,724
He doesn't toss you out
like squeezed lemons.

1310
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:30,643
He'd like to keep you all forever.

1311
01:42:30,769 --> 01:42:33,521
The truth is he's too good,
too patient.

1312
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,819
No, Guido...

1313
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,755
He doesn't like you!

1314
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:01,757
You're old!

1315
01:43:03,468 --> 01:43:07,597
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy
we had the chance to live with you,

1316
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:10,808
and we wish you
the best of luck upstairs.

1317
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:12,935
We assure you on Guido's behalf

1318
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:15,605
that you were
the first showgirl in his life.

1319
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:20,234
You're now entitled to a last song
and dance of your choice,

1320
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,445
with your very own spotlight.

1321
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:25,990
Thank you, girls.
You're so good to me.

1322
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:28,576
Shall l sing a love song?

1323
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:31,621
No, better something sexy.
That was my specialty.

1324
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:34,540
Guido, remember
the Apollo Theater in Bologna?

1325
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:35,791
l remember.

1326
01:43:35,918 --> 01:43:38,210
No, better a happy song!

1327
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:47,303
l dropped my pearls.

1328
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,273
Again!

1329
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:10,451
You're not even listening.

1330
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:26,676
Farewell, Guido.

1331
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:41,983
Farewell!

1332
01:44:57,416 --> 01:45:00,543
l thought it was
such an amusing situation,

1333
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:04,213
possibly even
the funniest part of my story.

1334
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:08,217
l'd even prepared a little speech
to give at the table.

1335
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,053
lt went like this:

1336
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:15,016
"My darlings, happiness consists
in being able to speak the truth

1337
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:17,643
without ever making anybody suffer."

1338
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,480
Carla would have played the harp,
like every evening,

1339
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:24,442
and we'd have been happy
hidden away here,

1340
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,193
far from the world.

1341
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,529
All of you and me.

1342
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:32,158
What's wrong?

1343
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:35,411
Why this sadness?

1344
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:38,873
See?
We've made him feel guilty.

1345
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:52,219
No, Guido,
it's been a wonderful evening.

1346
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:54,388
You mustn't be sad.

1347
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:57,933
Do you need anything?

1348
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,439
Now they'll all go off to bed...

1349
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:07,276
while l still have lots to do.

1350
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:10,279
There's laundry to do,

1351
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:12,406
the dishes to wash,

1352
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,326
sheets to mend,

1353
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,495
floors to scrub,

1354
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:20,289
and tomorrow's breakfast
to prepare.

1355
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,091
We're happy living all together
like this, aren't we?

1356
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,595
At first l didn't understand

1357
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:38,682
that this is how
things are meant to be.

1358
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:41,060
But now...

1359
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:44,313
aren't l a good girl?
l don't pester you anymore.

1360
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:46,440
l don't ask questions.

1361
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:52,071
l was a little dense, wasn't l?

1362
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:54,824
lt took me 20 years
to understand.

1363
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:56,492
Twenty years...

1364
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,411
since the day we got married...

1365
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:04,416
and you became my husband,
and l your wife.

1366
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:09,505
You remember that day, Guido?

1367
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:15,594
lf you could just be patient
a little longer, Luisa.

1368
01:47:16,638 --> 01:47:18,722
But perhaps you've had it.

1369
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:22,768
Frankly, l wish l could have
offered a word of advice.

1370
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,482
But now l understand
that you're trying to solve a problem

1371
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,067
for which there is no solution:

1372
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:34,738
to find clearly defined faces
for a crowd of characters

1373
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:36,782
who in your script are so rough,

1374
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:38,826
so vague, so ephemeral -

1375
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:42,288
- What are we watching?
- l don't know. Screen tests.

1376
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:46,584
- You're not feeling well.
- l'm perfectly fine.

1377
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:55,551
Agostini, do a little dance
on the ramp.

1378
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,928
l'll accompany you on the piano.

1379
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,890
Listen to this.
"The solitary ego

1380
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:03,517
that revolves around itself
and feeds only upon itself

1381
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:06,729
finally chokes on a great cry
or a great laugh."

1382
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,898
Stendhal wrote that

1383
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,691
during his stay in ltaly.

1384
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:15,404
lf we'd only read those sayings
on chocolate wrappers sometimes,

1385
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:18,115
we'd be spared many an illusion.

1386
01:48:47,562 --> 01:48:48,938
There he is.

1387
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:52,024
By the exit,
always ready to run away, eh?

1388
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:58,239
Good evening to all.
Sorry l'm late.

1389
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,991
What are you doing up there?

1390
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:02,493
Guido, where are you?
- Up here.

1391
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:04,954
- Come down.
- l'd rather stay here.

1392
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:07,623
Evening, ma'am.
Good, you can help us too.

1393
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,416
Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

1394
01:49:09,542 --> 01:49:12,878
They canceled
the variety act tonight just for us.

1395
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,381
Let's go!

1396
01:49:16,549 --> 01:49:18,801
Young man,
it's time to make up your mind.

1397
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,469
l brought all the screen tests -

1398
01:49:20,595 --> 01:49:23,639
Listen, there's no more time
for fooling around.

1399
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:27,393
He had all the time he wanted
for doubts, second thoughts, and whims.

1400
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:29,812
Tonight he has to choose.
- That's why we're here.

1401
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,063
Exactly.

1402
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:34,149
Conocchia got
all the screen tests from Rome,

1403
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:36,277
even the ones
shot five months ago.

1404
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,404
We'll go through them one by one,

1405
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:40,823
and you'll say, "This is the mistress,"
"This is the wife,"

1406
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:43,617
"This is the cardinal,"
"This is Saraghina." Clear?

1407
01:49:44,452 --> 01:49:47,413
l don't want to be the laughingstock
of the ltalian film industry,

1408
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,124
and l especially
don't want you to be.

1409
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,251
They've all got you in their sights.

1410
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:55,045
You have few friends left
on the Left or the Right,

1411
01:49:55,171 --> 01:49:57,673
but l'm here to help you
every way l can.

1412
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:00,676
But we must start shooting
immediately.

1413
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:02,177
Roll the screen tests.

1414
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:07,558
Screen test, Miss Olimpia.

1415
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,561
Come in, Olimpia.

1416
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:14,440
- Should l shut it?
- Yes.

1417
01:50:14,566 --> 01:50:18,360
Sway your hips as you walk.

1418
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,487
Put your things down there.

1419
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:23,490
Now go over to the mirror.

1420
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:26,869
Admire yourself.

1421
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:29,747
More pleased with yourself.

1422
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:32,082
Swell out your chest.

1423
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:35,794
Good. Now go over
to the phone. Slowly.

1424
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:39,173
Why are you running?
- l'm not.

1425
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,550
Go up to that mark on the floor.

1426
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:46,013
May l have the concierge, please?

1427
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:47,264
Speaking.

1428
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:51,602
- l'd like some uncarbonated water.
- Very well. Fiuggi.

1429
01:50:51,728 --> 01:50:55,230
- No, Fiuggi is carbonated.
- No. Look this way.

1430
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:58,067
Fiuggi is the least carbonated.
- Fine, Fiuggi then.

1431
01:50:58,526 --> 01:51:00,319
Will this one do, Guido?

1432
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:03,072
He has to decide.
She's leaving for England.

1433
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:04,907
She leaves next week.

1434
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:06,408
- Who is she?
- Be quiet.

1435
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:08,077
Or do you prefer this one?

1436
01:51:08,453 --> 01:51:10,913
This is an important character.
You have to like her right away.

1437
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,373
Right, Guido?

1438
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,878
Sit down as if exhausted.

1439
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:21,548
This is a woman
who's lost her will to fight.

1440
01:51:21,674 --> 01:51:23,258
Say your lines.

1441
01:51:23,426 --> 01:51:26,303
- Without stopping?
- Yes.

1442
01:51:29,641 --> 01:51:33,060
l'm the one who's offering you
total freedom.

1443
01:51:33,436 --> 01:51:36,939
l'm no good to you this way.
l'm just a nuisance.

1444
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:40,150
Please give it
some serious thought.

1445
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:43,737
Who's she supposed to be?

1446
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:46,073
Didn't you hear?
She's the wife.

1447
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:49,993
Relax. We're all friends here.
You knew the lines before.

1448
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:54,289
Still, she's likable, soulful.
Don't you think?

1449
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:58,293
- Give me a cigarette.
- l'm all out. Enrico, supplies!

1450
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,504
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1451
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,089
You're welcome.

1452
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:06,844
- l can't go on like this.
- Now tell me how l should be.

1453
01:52:07,178 --> 01:52:10,806
Someone who doesn't constantly lie
while swearing he's telling the truth.

1454
01:52:10,932 --> 01:52:14,143
That would be enough.
lt's not the actual things you do.

1455
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:17,104
lt's never knowing the truth,

1456
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,314
even about the smallest things.

1457
01:52:20,191 --> 01:52:22,651
Luisa, l love you.

1458
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:25,904
- Lying is like breathing to you.
- Repeat that.

1459
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:27,823
Lying is like breathing to you.

1460
01:52:29,492 --> 01:52:30,993
The nerve!

1461
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:36,498
- All right out of his life.
- Of course.

1462
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:39,835
This is the princess.
l know her.

1463
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,254
Aren't l alone already?

1464
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:44,882
What do you give me?
What can l look forward to?

1465
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,676
Look this way.
Put on your glasses.

1466
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:51,263
Repeat the last line.
"Aren't l alone already?"

1467
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:53,015
Say it aggressively,

1468
01:52:53,141 --> 01:52:55,476
but also with deep bitterness.

1469
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:56,643
He said,

1470
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:59,605
"You want a separation?

1471
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:01,356
What would you do all alone?"

1472
01:53:01,524 --> 01:53:05,068
And you answer,
"Aren't l alone already?"

1473
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,904
Go ahead.

1474
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:10,699
Guido, there's no doubt
about this one. She's perfect.

1475
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:18,540
We've gone on
like this for five months.

1476
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:20,709
They're all so old.

1477
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:23,879
Fiuggi is carbonated.

1478
01:53:24,047 --> 01:53:27,591
No, it's the least sparkling.
Louder.

1479
01:53:27,717 --> 01:53:29,301
Fine, send up the Fiuggi.

1480
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:31,220
Hang up the phone.

1481
01:53:31,554 --> 01:53:33,847
Screen test, Miss Olimpia.

1482
01:53:34,682 --> 01:53:36,558
What about this one?

1483
01:53:36,726 --> 01:53:38,560
More seductively.

1484
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:41,730
lt's dangerous leaving me alone.

1485
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:45,234
- Why? What do you do?
- Should l repeat the line?

1486
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:47,236
No, put down the phone.

1487
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:50,572
Turn your head this way.
Great. Cut.

1488
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:54,326
Luisa, where are you going?

1489
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:57,788
Back to the hotel. l'm sleepy.
Good night.

1490
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:59,540
Wait a second. Listen.

1491
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,375
What's wrong?
What happened?

1492
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:02,793
Nothing happened.

1493
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:05,212
Nothing ever happens
between you and me.

1494
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:09,633
Did something you saw offend you?
lt's just a movie.

1495
01:54:09,759 --> 01:54:12,261
Oh, l know that better than anyone.

1496
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,680
Another fiction, another lie.

1497
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:17,432
You put all of us in it,
but the way it suits you.

1498
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:21,061
But the truth is something else entirely,
and only l know the truth.

1499
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:23,355
You're lucky l'd never have the nerve

1500
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:25,649
to make it public the way you do.

1501
01:54:25,775 --> 01:54:28,819
Go on - make your movie!
- No, l won't.

1502
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:29,945
lndulge yourself.

1503
01:54:30,113 --> 01:54:32,114
Stroke your ego.

1504
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,950
Make everyone think
you're so wonderful.

1505
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,286
But what could you have
to say to strangers

1506
01:54:37,412 --> 01:54:39,454
when you can't tell the truth
to the one closest to you,

1507
01:54:39,622 --> 01:54:41,456
the woman who's grown old
at your side?

1508
01:54:41,624 --> 01:54:43,875
Luisa, cut the melodrama.

1509
01:54:46,087 --> 01:54:48,589
You were right to ask me to come.

1510
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:51,300
We needed an ending.

1511
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:54,177
l assure you, l won't be coming back.

1512
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:56,096
You can go to hell!

1513
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:12,571
That's it. Run! Faster!

1514
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,823
The man said to run!

1515
01:55:14,949 --> 01:55:16,700
You keep quiet!

1516
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:20,287
Throw that ignoramus out!

1517
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:22,372
Now sing, ma'am.

1518
01:55:22,665 --> 01:55:27,628
You may say l'm losing my marbles,
but the figures are all right here.

1519
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:31,089
No, l'll never pay this!
You are losing your marbles.

1520
01:55:31,215 --> 01:55:34,343
Saraghina, look.
We've got the money.

1521
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:36,928
Saraghina, the rumba!

1522
01:55:37,055 --> 01:55:40,515
Guido, would you please
say something?

1523
01:55:41,893 --> 01:55:43,685
What about this one?

1524
01:55:44,395 --> 01:55:48,190
Frankly, l preferred the one before.
She's from Naples, isn't she?

1525
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:52,694
Can't you see that l'm stammering?

1526
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:56,239
When are you coming?
l'm tired of waiting.

1527
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:57,199
Look at me.

1528
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:59,451
Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous.

1529
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:00,994
Turn around.

1530
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:04,164
Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous, darling.

1531
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,290
Look over here.

1532
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:09,044
Why don't you come right away?
You're making me wait.

1533
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:11,546
You know it's dangerous
when l have to wait.

1534
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:13,507
Louder, louder!

1535
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:15,384
Countess, walk.

1536
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:18,011
l said to walk.

1537
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:20,389
Don't touch me with your hand.

1538
01:56:24,727 --> 01:56:26,561
Screen test one, Miss Grazia.

1539
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:28,230
Bare your shoulders.

1540
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:31,358
Saraghina, we've got the money.

1541
01:56:32,193 --> 01:56:34,945
Cut. Was that all right?

1542
01:56:36,864 --> 01:56:39,241
Signora, what do you think?

1543
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:41,660
Speak up.
This is a democracy.

1544
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:45,747
lf he won't speak up, at least
you might say something. Sacrebleu!

1545
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:50,502
You can't hide. We can find you
anywhere. How are you?

1546
01:56:50,628 --> 01:56:53,672
l'm Coletti,
from Claudia's press agency.

1547
01:56:53,798 --> 01:56:57,259
We met 1 5 years ago.
You remember me?

1548
01:56:57,385 --> 01:56:59,094
Look, she's here.

1549
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:00,429
Where?

1550
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:07,769
Excuse me.

1551
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:18,029
Claudia!

1552
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,824
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

1553
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:24,619
So you finally came.
Let's go outside, shall we?

1554
01:57:25,121 --> 01:57:27,330
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1555
01:57:29,959 --> 01:57:31,960
l'd like to speak to you alone.

1556
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:40,260
- When do we start shooting?
- Very soon.

1557
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:43,430
- What's my part?
- l'll tell you everything later.

1558
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:45,223
l'm very happy
to be working with you.

1559
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:49,311
l hope l'll be of help.
But l want to know everything.

1560
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,147
Where are we going now?

1561
01:58:01,365 --> 01:58:02,949
Well?

1562
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:05,702
That way.

1563
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:24,596
You're so beautiful.
l'm tongue-tied.

1564
01:58:24,722 --> 01:58:26,932
You make my heart beat
like a schoolboy's.

1565
01:58:27,975 --> 01:58:29,768
You don't believe me, do you?

1566
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:32,979
You inspire true and deep respect.

1567
01:58:35,316 --> 01:58:37,776
Who do you love?
Who do you care about?

1568
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:38,735
You.

1569
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:46,535
You've come just in time.
Why do you smile that way?

1570
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:50,580
l never know if you're judging me,
forgiving me, or mocking me.

1571
01:58:50,706 --> 01:58:52,040
l'm listening.

1572
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:54,709
You said you'd tell me
about the film. l know nothing.

1573
01:59:01,175 --> 01:59:05,053
Could you leave everything behind
and start life all over again?

1574
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:09,432
Choose one thing only
and be faithful to it?

1575
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:11,810
Make it the reason
for your existence,

1576
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:14,062
the one thing
that contains everything,

1577
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:17,774
because your dedication to it
makes it infinite? Could you?

1578
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:23,238
lf l said to you, "Claudia..."

1579
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:28,118
Which way are we going?
l don't know the way.

1580
01:59:28,619 --> 01:59:31,454
What about you? Could you?

1581
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:35,834
The springs must be nearby.
Listen. Turn here.

1582
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:40,755
No, this guy here couldn't do it.

1583
01:59:40,965 --> 01:59:43,091
He wants to grab everything
and devour it.

1584
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:45,135
He can't give up a single thing.

1585
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:47,804
He changes direction every day
for fear of missing the right path.

1586
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,432
He's slowly bleeding to death.
- ls this how the film ends?

1587
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,142
No, this is how it starts.

1588
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,935
Then he meets
the girl at the springs,

1589
01:59:54,103 --> 01:59:57,105
one of those girls
who pass out the healing water.

1590
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,858
She's beautiful...

1591
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,611
both young and ancient,

1592
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:06,281
a child and yet already a woman,
authentic and radiant.

1593
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:09,826
There's no doubt
that she's his salvation.

1594
02:00:10,828 --> 02:00:14,789
You'll be all in white,
your hair long, just as it is now.

1595
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,468
Turn off the lights.

1596
02:01:05,132 --> 02:01:06,841
Now what?

1597
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:23,525
Let's leave this place.

1598
02:01:24,986 --> 02:01:27,070
lt makes me uneasy.

1599
02:01:27,196 --> 02:01:28,863
lt doesn't seem real.

1600
02:01:29,031 --> 02:01:31,825
l really like it.
lsn't that odd?

1601
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:38,164
l didn't understand
much of your story.

1602
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:42,335
A guy like your character,
who doesn't love anybody,

1603
02:01:42,461 --> 02:01:44,879
isn't very sympathetic,
you know.

1604
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:47,841
lt's his fault.

1605
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:50,385
What does he expect
from other people?

1606
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:53,221
You think l don't know that?

1607
02:01:54,098 --> 02:01:56,641
You're a pain like the others.

1608
02:01:56,767 --> 02:01:59,853
l see no one
can tell you anything!

1609
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:04,399
You're so funny in that big ugly hat.
You look like an old man.

1610
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:07,902
l don't understand.

1611
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:12,991
He meets a girl who can give him
new life, and he pushes her away?

1612
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:15,577
Because he no longer
believes in it.

1613
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:18,872
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1614
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:21,207
Because it's not true
that a woman can change a man.

1615
02:02:21,333 --> 02:02:23,084
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1616
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,671
Above all because l don't feel
like telling another pile of lies.

1617
02:02:26,797 --> 02:02:29,382
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1618
02:02:30,342 --> 02:02:33,053
l'm sorry for making you
come all the way here.

1619
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,846
Forgive me.

1620
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:37,348
You're such a phony.

1621
02:02:37,475 --> 02:02:39,642
So there's no part in the film.

1622
02:02:40,394 --> 02:02:43,605
You're right. There's no part.

1623
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:45,607
And there's no film.

1624
02:02:45,941 --> 02:02:48,485
There's nothing anywhere.

1625
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:51,696
As far as l'm concerned,
it can all end right here.

1626
02:02:57,328 --> 02:03:00,038
Here they are!

1627
02:03:00,164 --> 02:03:02,957
Where did you go?
We're starting next week.

1628
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:05,210
Your producer had a great idea.

1629
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:09,130
The greatest cocktail party
to ever launch a movie.

1630
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:11,382
The launch pad, tomorrow afternoon.

1631
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:13,093
Radio, television, the foreign press.

1632
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,803
Guido, we're starting for real.

1633
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:42,163
Grab him!

1634
02:03:48,838 --> 02:03:50,588
Come on, walk!

1635
02:03:50,714 --> 02:03:52,465
l want to go home.

1636
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:54,217
Come on!

1637
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:56,511
Here he is!

1638
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:05,395
Guido, where are you going?
lt's over here.

1639
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:13,444
Mr. Guido, l'm sure today
will be a beautiful...

1640
02:04:20,077 --> 02:04:23,288
l'm very curious
to finally hear the story.

1641
02:04:23,831 --> 02:04:27,333
Don't you take yourself
a bit too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1642
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,801
Leave me alone!
l can walk by myself!

1643
02:04:41,849 --> 02:04:44,392
Hello, and good luck!

1644
02:04:47,021 --> 02:04:48,771
Commendatore, here he is!

1645
02:04:52,276 --> 02:04:55,653
We've been waiting
for you for three days.

1646
02:04:55,779 --> 02:04:56,905
lt's winter already.

1647
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:58,698
Attention, please.

1648
02:05:04,246 --> 02:05:07,207
Do you think pornography
is an art form?

1649
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:10,543
ls pornography the most
intense form of entertainment?

1650
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:14,756
Why don't you ever make
a film about love?

1651
02:05:27,144 --> 02:05:29,938
- l wish to announce that -
- Tomorrow, tomorrow.

1652
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,732
What do you think
you can teach us?

1653
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:34,817
Do you really think your life
can be of interest to others?

1654
02:05:34,944 --> 02:05:37,779
Can you honestly admit
you have nothing to say?

1655
02:05:45,454 --> 02:05:48,706
He'll now speak to you directly.

1656
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,126
Answer.

1657
02:05:52,294 --> 02:05:53,962
Go on.

1658
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:56,297
Guido, say something.

1659
02:05:56,465 --> 02:05:59,092
Anything at all. Do it for me.

1660
02:06:02,846 --> 02:06:04,764
l promise you an art film!

1661
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,100
lf this film flops,
what will you live on?

1662
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:10,645
Are you for or against divorce?
Tell me honestly.

1663
02:06:16,151 --> 02:06:18,653
Your questions betray
a certain hostility.

1664
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:21,447
l assure you that my director
is in great form...

1665
02:06:21,573 --> 02:06:23,658
What am l supposed to do?

1666
02:06:23,784 --> 02:06:25,493
...and should be treated with respect.

1667
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,997
Conocchia, forgive me
if l treated you badly.

1668
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:31,833
You were wonderful,
the best of them all.

1669
02:06:31,959 --> 02:06:34,502
He ponders, considers, reflects.

1670
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:36,671
Say something.
l've been paying

1671
02:06:36,839 --> 02:06:39,382
for your confusion
and crises for months.

1672
02:06:39,508 --> 02:06:41,509
Quit this film and l'll ruin you.

1673
02:06:41,677 --> 02:06:44,220
He'll now be at your disposal.

1674
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:49,225
Claudia, where are you?
Rossella, where are your spirits now?

1675
02:06:50,561 --> 02:06:52,854
What should l do?
Leave you? Disappear?

1676
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:55,356
You'll never be what you once were.

1677
02:06:55,482 --> 02:06:58,776
l'll no longer be your wife.
When will you truly marry me?

1678
02:06:58,902 --> 02:07:02,572
Luisa, do you really want
a separation?

1679
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:04,782
How can l go on like this
till the end?

1680
02:07:04,908 --> 02:07:06,743
What does your wife think?

1681
02:07:11,332 --> 02:07:13,416
ln your right-hand pocket.

1682
02:07:14,043 --> 02:07:15,460
So long, Guido.

1683
02:07:15,586 --> 02:07:17,587
l put it in your right-hand pocket.

1684
02:07:26,764 --> 02:07:29,640
No, nobody gets away with that!

1685
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:30,975
Buffoon!

1686
02:07:31,101 --> 02:07:32,435
Lunatic!

1687
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:35,355
Get out here, you coward!

1688
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:38,900
Just a minute.
l'm thinking of what to say.

1689
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,735
That's it!

1690
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:43,154
l'm coming, l'm coming.

1691
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:48,534
He's an incurable romantic.

1692
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,749
Where are you running off to,
you naughty boy?

1693
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:15,770
Take it all down, boys.
The film is off.

1694
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:19,107
lt has to be gone in two days.
Start right away.

1695
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:21,943
Get going. Tear it all down.
Right, Dottore?

1696
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:22,944
Yes, thanks.

1697
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:26,114
So long, boys.
See you on another film.

1698
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:27,740
Let's hope so.

1699
02:08:32,996 --> 02:08:34,539
So long, sailor.

1700
02:08:38,502 --> 02:08:40,169
You did the right thing.

1701
02:08:40,295 --> 02:08:42,713
Believe me,
today is a good day for you.

1702
02:08:43,215 --> 02:08:45,675
These are tough decisions, l know.

1703
02:08:45,801 --> 02:08:49,762
But we intellectuals - and l say "we"
because l consider you one -

1704
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:52,932
must remain clear-headed
right to the end.

1705
02:08:53,058 --> 02:08:56,060
There are so many superfluous
things in the world already.

1706
02:08:56,186 --> 02:08:58,563
No need to add chaos to chaos.

1707
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:03,317
Besides, losing money
is part of a producer's job.

1708
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:07,280
l congratulate you.
You had no choice.

1709
02:09:07,406 --> 02:09:09,407
He got what he deserved

1710
02:09:09,533 --> 02:09:13,453
for embarking on such a frivolous
venture so lightheartedly.

1711
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:17,665
No need for nostalgia or remorse.

1712
02:09:17,791 --> 02:09:19,542
Destroying is better than creating

1713
02:09:19,668 --> 02:09:22,462
when we're not creating
those few truly necessary things.

1714
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:25,882
But is there anything
so just and true in this world

1715
02:09:26,008 --> 02:09:28,134
that it has the right to live?

1716
02:09:28,969 --> 02:09:31,804
For him, a bad film
is merely a financial matter,

1717
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:36,017
but for you, at this point,
it could have been the end.

1718
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:39,145
Better to knock it all down
and strew the ground with salt,

1719
02:09:39,271 --> 02:09:42,690
as the ancients did
to purify the battlefields.

1720
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:44,692
ln the end what we need

1721
02:09:44,818 --> 02:09:48,404
is some hygiene,
cleanliness, disinfection.

1722
02:09:49,323 --> 02:09:53,701
We're smothered
by words, images, and sounds

1723
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,828
that have no right to exist,

1724
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:59,165
that come from the void
and return to the void.

1725
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:02,251
Of any artist
truly deserving of the name

1726
02:10:02,377 --> 02:10:05,213
we should ask nothing
but this act of faith:

1727
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,298
to learn silence.

1728
02:10:07,424 --> 02:10:09,675
Remember Mallarmé's homage
to the white page?

1729
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,844
Guido, wait!

1730
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:16,933
We're ready to begin.
Hello, sir.

1731
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:21,354
All my best wishes!

1732
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:25,483
lf we can't have everything,
nothingness is true perfection.

1733
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:28,736
Forgive me for making
all these references,

1734
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:31,864
but we critics do what we can.

1735
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:35,409
Our true mission is to sweep away
the thousands of miscarriages

1736
02:10:35,577 --> 02:10:37,578
that try every day, obscenely,

1737
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:40,414
to come into this world.

1738
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:45,419
And you would actually leave
behind you a whole film,

1739
02:10:45,587 --> 02:10:47,922
like a cripple leaving behind

1740
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:49,757
his crooked footprint.

1741
02:10:49,883 --> 02:10:54,262
What monstrous presumption
to think that others could benefit

1742
02:10:54,388 --> 02:10:57,348
from the squalid catalog
of your mistakes.

1743
02:10:57,558 --> 02:11:00,101
What do you gain
by stringing together

1744
02:11:00,269 --> 02:11:03,771
the tattered pieces of your life,
your vague memories,

1745
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:07,483
the faces of those
you never could love?

1746
02:11:15,492 --> 02:11:18,035
What is this sudden happiness
that makes me tremble,

1747
02:11:18,161 --> 02:11:20,329
that gives me strength and life?

1748
02:11:21,331 --> 02:11:23,291
Forgive me, sweet creatures.

1749
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:26,085
l didn't understand.
l didn't know.

1750
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:28,963
How right it is to accept you,
love you.

1751
02:11:29,089 --> 02:11:31,132
And how simple.

1752
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:34,635
Luisa, l feel like l've been set free.

1753
02:11:34,803 --> 02:11:36,804
Everything seems so good,
so meaningful.

1754
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:38,347
Everything is true.

1755
02:11:38,473 --> 02:11:40,725
l wish l could explain,

1756
02:11:41,393 --> 02:11:43,519
but l don't know how.

1757
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:48,733
Now everything's all confused
once again, like it was before.

1758
02:11:48,859 --> 02:11:51,319
But this confusion is me,

1759
02:11:51,486 --> 02:11:54,405
as l am, not as l'd like to be.

1760
02:11:54,531 --> 02:11:58,159
l'm no longer afraid of telling the truth

1761
02:11:58,285 --> 02:12:01,996
about what l don't know, what
l'm looking for, what l haven't found.

1762
02:12:02,205 --> 02:12:04,332
Only this way do l feel alive.

1763
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:07,460
Only this way can l look
into your faithful eyes without shame.

1764
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:10,963
Life is a celebration.
Let's live it together.

1765
02:12:11,965 --> 02:12:14,675
That's all l can say, Luisa,
to you or the others.

1766
02:12:14,801 --> 02:12:17,178
Accept me for what l am, if you can.

1767
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:20,264
lt's the only way
we might find each other.

1768
02:12:20,891 --> 02:12:23,601
l don't know
if what you've said is right,

1769
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:26,979
but l can try if you help me.

1770
02:12:44,247 --> 02:12:47,291
Welcome back. Follow me.

1771
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:29,125
Just a minute.
l'll give the signal.

1772
02:13:39,052 --> 02:13:40,553
There.

1773
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:42,513
Now go to the curtain.

1774
02:13:51,773 --> 02:13:53,315
Open it.

1775
02:13:54,943 --> 02:13:56,610
Everyone come down.

1776
02:13:56,987 --> 02:13:59,655
Talk to each other.

1777
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:52,333
Mama.

1778
02:14:57,422 --> 02:14:58,964
Sgulp!

1779
02:14:59,716 --> 02:15:03,344
l understand what you meant:
You can't do without us.

1780
02:15:03,553 --> 02:15:07,014
What time will you call tomorrow?
- Fine, fine. Now join the line.

1781
02:15:07,432 --> 02:15:08,682
Maurice!

1782
02:15:12,646 --> 02:15:15,022
Come quickly!
Stop fooling around.

1783
02:15:15,357 --> 02:15:18,359
Everybody hold hands!

1784
02:15:18,485 --> 02:15:19,860
Spread out!

1785
02:15:19,986 --> 02:15:22,279
All together!

1786
02:15:24,324 --> 02:15:25,699
Maestro!

1787
02:15:26,284 --> 02:15:28,160
Everyone hold hands!
