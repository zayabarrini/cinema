1
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,665 
<i>Bolsonaro will be the 38th president</i>
<i>of Brazil.</i>

2
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:52,297 
<i>PSL’s candidate won 55 percent</i>
<i>of the vote in the election</i>

3
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,924 
<i>against Fernando Haddad</i>
<i>of the Workers' Party.</i>

4
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,095
{\an8}<i>The Workers’ Party's first presidential</i>
<i>defeat since 2002.</i>

5
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,348
{\an8}<i>We're going live</i>
<i>to Barra da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

6
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,271
{\an8}Nina, wake up,
you’re gonna be late.

7
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,649 
Time to get up, come on.

8
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,391 
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Wellington.

9
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,145
{\an8}-Hey, Moisés. You good?
-Yeah. You?

10
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,438
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

11
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,440
{\an8}-This is Flávio.
-Wellington, right?

12
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,525
{\an8}-Yeah. Nice to meet you.
-You too.

13
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,153 
-He'll replace Doriva.
-Right. Welcome.

14
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,449 
-Thank you. Appreciate it.
-Stick with him. He's the oldest in here.

15
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,992 
-For sure.
-Do as he says.

16
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,453 
I could tell he's an OG.

17
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,833 
-Like a griot.
-I'm heading out.

18
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,170 
-Count on me. Get some rest.
-Thanks. Have a good day.

19
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755 
-See you tomorrow.
-See ya.

20
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,048 
There is a divergence here.

21
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:22,929 
CNJ says the prison population
declined to 602,000,

22
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,182 
but Brazil still has

23
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,142 
the world's third-highest
prison population.

24
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,065
{\an8}And now we have to pay
special attention to this.

25
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,320
{\an8}The platform that won the election

26
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,741 
supports the US political view.

27
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,036 
And how does the US
handle their prison population?

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,957 
By privatizing their prisons.

29
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,898 
Tércia!

30
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,775 
-What?
<i>-Come here.</i>

31
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,360 
-What is it?
<i>-</i>Hurry.

32
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,446 
<i>-</i>Hurry.
-God. Wait, wait.

33
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,698 
-Come on.
-What is it?

34
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,035 
Tokinho!

35
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,831 
That's amazing.
I'm friends with a celebrity!

36
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,251 
-I was so straight.
-Yeah, right.

37
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,590 
-Your hair was different.
-Too much beauty.

38
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,136 
-Look!
-Check it!

39
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,514 
My God! Tokinho!

40
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,935 
My jaw just dropped!

41
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,525
{\an8}Magma is the molten material found
beneath the surface of Earth. Right?

42
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,986
{\an8}Well…

43
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:07,283
{\an8}This magma is between the mantle
and the crust.

44
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,536 
It stays there for years.

45
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,334 
Here we have heat, pressure
and intense gas formation.

46
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:22,423 
When the pressure is too much,
this is what happens.

47
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,803 
Volcanic eruption.

48
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,642
{\an8}Leaking lava,
pieces of rock, gases, ashes.

49
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,644 
Cool, right?

50
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,900 
-No, Mom. I already have it.
-Son, you gonna eat the beet today.

51
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,276 
Mom, no.

52
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,906 
You better eat, Deivinho.

53
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,951 
-Remember what we have on Saturday.
-Uh-huh.

54
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,161 
You coming to see him play on Saturday?

55
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,540 
-No, baby. I get too nervous.
-Don't be silly.

56
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,334 
And I can't, I gotta work.
Cleaning at Dona Bia.

57
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,713 
-On Saturday?
-She'll throw a party on Friday,

58
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,092 
and asked me to go on Friday
and on Saturday. I thought it was great.

59
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,886 
-I’ll get paid for both days.
-That's good.

60
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,812 
-Wash this right, girl. Harder.
-Here, I'm washing it.

61
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,150 
You don't know how to wash a bowl,
to scour a pan.

62
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,652 
You know what your grandma
used to do to me?

63
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:29,532 
She'd tell me to wash
all the pans and the cans.

64
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,120 
I couldn't use steel wool, honey.
I had to use sand.

65
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,955 
Mom, that's awful.

66
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,623 
-You know when I could stop?
-When?

67
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,460 
When she could see
her face in the pan lid.

68
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,130 
-Jeez.
-My nails were short as hell.

69
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,179 
-Mom?
-Huh?

70
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,931 
You could tell Deivinho to do more stuff.

71
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,894 
-What do you mean?
-Stuff around the house.

72
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,897 
-Don't be easy on him.
-Right.

73
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,816 
He'll grow to be just like dad.

74
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,945 
Dad doesn't wash a bowl, doesn't cook.

75
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:12,325 
I enjoy doing it.
I like to take care of you guys.

76
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,369 
Mom, Deivinho needs to learn
how to do these things too.

77
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,829 
It's important.

78
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,374 
Now you wanna tell me
what to do, Eunice?

79
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,420 
Okay, then. It's up to you.

80
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,816 
Yeah, but they're taller than him.

81
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,777 
Go, Colo-Colo!

82
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,832 
Come on, Deivinho.

83
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,961 
Come on. Come on. Go. That's it.

84
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,634 
Dribble him! That's it!

85
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,679 
Go, boy! Go!

86
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,057 
Goal!

87
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,726 
I told you he was good.

88
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,235 
Deivinho, dad loves you! Dad loves you!

89
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,333 
-Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
-It's all good.

90
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,335 
People are pushing and shoving.

91
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,962 
-Don't worry.
-Come, I'll get you another one.

92
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,632 
No need. I was almost finished it.
Thanks.

93
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,042 
I see you, girl.

94
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,295 
Go for it.

95
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,898 
It's the orchid I told you about.

96
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,402 
Each one is a different kind.
This one has its roots out

97
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,699 
so it takes nutrients from the air.

98
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,160 
You can help it too.

99
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:53,541 
You mix a cup of eggshell,

100
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,711 
a cup of raw rice and a cup
of used coffee powder, with no sugar.

101
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,215 
You put it in a blender
and then in a plastic bottle,

102
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,302 
with two liters of water.
Cover and leave it for three days.

103
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,556 
After that, you water it
just a little bit.

104
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,935 
Don't use the powder, just the liquid.
Just the liquid.

105
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,562 
Man, the plants love it.

106
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,522 
You know a lot about plants,
Mr. Wellington.

107
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,316 
In general, you throw the seed,
you fertilize the soil, water it,

108
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,111 
and if the sun goes out
the plants will like it.

109
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,445 
-Really?
-Yeah.

110
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,614 
I'll get some plants too.

111
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,368 
What is this medal? What does it mean?

112
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,872 
This is four years
with the Alcoholics Anonymous.

113
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,082 
Really? You drank it a lot?

114
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,043 
-Yeah, I used to get pretty wasted.
-Really, Mr. Wellington?

115
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,962 
But now I'm sober.

116
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,091 
Thank God, because alcohol,
if you can’t handle it…

117
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,551 
It destroys us.

118
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,678 
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

119
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,055 
-Are you Wellington?
-Yes, I am.

120
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,433 
-Nice to meet you, Juan Pablo.
-Nice to meet you.

121
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,810 
-You’re Sorín, right?
-Yes.

122
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,396 
Sorín? Welcome, man.

123
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,023 
-Nice hair.
-You like it?

124
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,319 
-You moving in, right?
-Yes.

125
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,821 
I can't believe you moving in here,
near us, man.

126
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,031 
Cool, man.

127
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,451 
-Moving again.
-Good.

128
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,079 
-You taking care of the plants?
-Yeah, taking care of the orchids.

129
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,123 
-You like orchids?
-I do.

130
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,082 
Yes.

131
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,418 
-Flowers are nice.
-Very beautiful.

132
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,295 
-The view too.
-Yes.

133
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,425 
I look at you and remember
that Cruzeiro game on Sul Minas.

134
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,968 
That was amazing, man. Right?

135
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,220 
-Ow! I was at the stadium.
-Were you at the Mineirão?

136
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,349 
The crowd went crazy. Unforgettable.

137
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,728 
-Forever in my heart.
-In ours too. We love it.

138
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,938 
-It's wonderful.
-Very nice.

139
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,565 
-You coming with your stuff, right?
-Yeah, the truck is here.

140
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,525 
Let's open the gate for them.

141
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,320 
Remember I taught you how to put the liner
on the freight elevator?

142
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,905 
-Yes.
-You do that.

143
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,531 
-To protect his furniture.
-I got it.

144
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,786 
-Be careful with your back.
-Welcome, Sorín. Thanks.

145
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,332 
When you have time,
I'd like to show you a video of my son.

146
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,376 
-Sure.
-He's a star player.

147
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,547 
-He plays soccer? In a team?
-He plays at Colo-Colo,

148
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,468 
it's a nice youth team. I'd like
to show you a video on my phone.

149
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,346 
Sure. I'll see you around
and you can show me.

150
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,101 
-You got it. Welcome.
-See ya. Bye.

151
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,230 
-Let me know if you need anything.
-Thanks. Bye.

152
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,610 
Man!

153
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,822 
Look at that.

154
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,911

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,372 
<i>Mars One is a project that aims</i>

156
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:44,503 
<i>to establish a permanent human</i>
<i>settlement on Mars by 2030.</i>

157
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,344 
<i>The idea is that a manned mission</i>
<i>to Mars is possible nowadays,</i>

158
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:58,392 
<i>as long as there's no return phase.</i>
<i>That is, to make one-way trips.</i>

159
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,984 
<i>Critics don't know how</i>
<i>a 6-billion-dollar colonization mission</i>

160
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,279 
<i>can be funded with sponsorship only.</i>

161
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,992 
<i>Still, Mars One</i>
<i>has strong ambassadors like</i>

<i>Nobel Prize in Physics</i>

<i>Aisha Jordan.</i>

164
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,889 
You watching porn, Deivinho?

165
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,734 
So, do you know what gift
we can get for mom?

166
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,277 
Not really.

167
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,451 
Dad gave us some money,
to buy clothes or something.

168
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,829 
Again? We gave her clothes last year.

169
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,708 
You’re right.

170
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,630 
Just give me a suggestion.

171
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,679 
I saw a Cruzeiro washing machine cover.

172
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,143 
A washing machine cover
as a birthday gift, Deivinho?

173
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,145 
Are you kidding me?

174
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,190 
I won't give anything
for laundry or kitchen.

175
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,361 
Let's do this, I'll choose the gift, okay?

176
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,573 
Okay. I'll write her a letter then.

177
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,578 
Deal.

178
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,044 
Who are you texting?

179
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,296 
A boyfriend?

180
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,301 
Come here.

181
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,446 
A girlfriend?

182
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,826 
Kind of.

183
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,292 
But don't tell mom and dad.

184
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,838 
Do you think it's wrong?

185
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,965 
Why would I think that?

186
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,767 
TÉRCIA, WONDERFUL WIFE,
MOTHER AND FRIEND.

187
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,687 
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR DAY.
YOU'RE A GIFT IN OUR LIVES.

188
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,480 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

189
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,905 
<i>Did you know that the sun</i>
<i>we're seeing now is the sun of the past?</i>

190
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,704 
But how come we're seeing it now?

191
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:16,626 
It's like, it's not happening
now, you know?

192
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,255 
-But why is it there?
-It's an image.

193
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,799 
The sunlight takes
a long time to reach Earth.

194
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:27,387 
So, we see the sun from eight minutes ago,
'cause it's too far.

195
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,931 
That's awesome!

196
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,100 
Don't pretend you got it, Thiago.

197
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,214 
-Come on, you chicken.
-I dare you! No brakes!

198
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,299 
-You chicken.
-You chicken.

199
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,690 
Damn. Things got ugly for me.

200
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,527 
I just lost my job.

201
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,697 
I just lost my job.

202
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:32,077 
Brazil is not for amateurs.
It's fucked up, a whole mess.

203
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,579 
It's fucked up, ma'am. No joke.

204
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,125 
On top of that my wife cheated on me
with my best friend.

205
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,794 
Cuckolded by my best friend.

206
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,215 
Lost my job, don't know what's left.

207
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,676 
Here's the deal.

208
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,720 
I'm gonna kill myself.
I can't take it anymore.

209
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,140 
I'm gonna kill myself.

210
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,059 
No Christian can take this.

211
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:00,230 
-Don't do this, sir.
-Would you take it? You wouldn't.

212
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,650 
The country is in crisis.
You can find another job.

213
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,778 
It's too humiliating.

214
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,739 
Trust God. Jesus loves you.
He has a purpose for you.

215
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,700 
-Yes, Jesus loves me.
-Don't give up on yourself.

216
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,536 
That's why everybody
is going to see him with me.

217
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,748 
-We're all going to meet Jesus.
-Sir, don't do this.

218
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,878 
-Let us all hug Jesus now.
-This man is crazy.

219
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,421 
Let us all go to heaven!

220
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,099 
That's it, guys.

221
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,937 
Ma'am, it was just a prank.
Don't worry. There's the camera.

222
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,899 
-Thanks, Pablito. Congratulations.
-I'll get you some water.

223
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,693 
Good, Pablito. You did it again.

224
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,032 
-What's this petition thing?
-Petition is like a formal letter,

225
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,202 
that you write to explain
everything that happened.

226
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,788 
It has to be written
within the legal terms.

227
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,292 
It needs to be well written
and at the end say that

228
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,420 
if they don't respond you'll sent it
to the Consumer Protection Agency.

229
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,715 
But he won't know
how to write that, me neither.

230
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,010 
I'm not good with words,
to write this petition.

231
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,139 
Tell him I'll go there,
we sit together and write it.

232
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,977 
I'll tell him, he'll appreciate it.
That's great.

233
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,648 
-We'll get it right.
-I'll call him later.

234
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,904 
Baby, you okay?

235
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,324 
Yes.

236
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,078 
You're quiet.

237
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,213 
Today, I…

238
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,842 
I was at a diner in the city center today.

239
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,263 
In… in the city center.

240
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,767 
A man came in…

241
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,481 
-and said he would kill himself.
-Jeez.

242
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,651 
How crazy…

243
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,113 
Mom, you okay?

244
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,325 
Then he…

245
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,702 
he…

246
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,289 
-blew up a bomb.
-A bomb?

247
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,499 
These bombs people take to stadiums?

248
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,877 
*

249
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,463 
-Dynamite.
-Dynamite?

250
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,590 
What? It can't be, Mom.

251
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:18,303 
Dynamite is heavy stuff, to blow up
buildings and things like that.

252
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,138 
Are you hurt?

253
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,517 
No, because in the end…

254
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,188 
it was a prank, you know?

255
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,523 
Like the ones on TV, right?
Lots of people.

256
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,067 
Yes, a prank.

257
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,071 
Yes. It was a mess.

258
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,866 
Did you fall for it, is that it?

259
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,494 
What channel will it be on?

260
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:47,290 
No, It's not funny. Not funny.
I feel bad about it.

261
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:52,045 
-What channel, Mom?
-Let's get together to watch it.

262
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,299 
Guys, stop. It's not funny.

263
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,177 
It's serious. I don't feel good.

264
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,057 
Why, baby? Wasn't it a joke?

265
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,610 
Do you wanna do something crazy?

266
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,835 
Well, there's one here that seems
to be what you're looking for.

267
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,503 
-Around here?
-Yes.

268
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,672 
It's a penthouse
three blocks up the street.

269
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,510 
So you only want to see
the penthouse, right?

270
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,678 
Yes.

271
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,390 
ID, please.

272
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,995 
You're such a smart ass, girl.

273
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,861 
I can't believe this.

274
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,453

00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,690 
<i>Over this whole city</i>

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,819

It must be dope to live
in a flat like this, right?

297
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,183 
Yeah.

298
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,562 
But I don't think one needs all this.

299
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,358 
You're already used to it.

300
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,778 
Big house, a lot of space.

301
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,283 
I always lived in big houses,

302
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,328 
but I think it's a lot for two people.

303
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,630 
I've been wanting to leave
my parents house for a while.

304
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,384 
Tell me about it.

00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,462 
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

312
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,255 
-How are you?
-I'm all right.

313
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,758 
Let's get straight to the point.

314
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,676 
Check it out, Mr. Wellington.
Time to get paid.

315
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,430 
-Sign here, please.
-Nice.

316
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,433 
Wellington, I brought that flour
you liked it, from Tchó Tchó.

317
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,353 
I loved that flour, that's good.
Thank you.

318
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,982 
I wanna thank you for taking care
of Galvão and my flat.

319
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,735 
No problem. And your sister?
Did she get better?

320
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,322 
-She's getting better every day.
-Good.

321
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,573 
That's important.

322
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,949 
Sign here.

323
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,327 
How great.

324
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:44,582 
Look at him peeking.
Calm down, I'll give you yours.

325
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,960 
-Here's your check, Wellington.
-Thank you, Dircinha.

326
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,297 
-Thanks. Bye.
-Bye.

327
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,634 
Let us know if you need anything.

328
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,845 
Mr. Wellington, for real now,

329
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,723 
have you seen how much
we make per month?

330
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,935 
-This salary is a joke.
-Well, isn't it the deal?

331
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:09,065 
Let me tell you something, Mr. Wellington.
Not every deal has to be accepted.

332
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,735 
Imagine if every hardworking employee
who works

333
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,696 
in a condo like this,
full of reactionaries,

334
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,450 
decides to occupy the place,

335
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,537 
how dope that would be. Think about it.

336
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,248 
You're full of revolutionary ideas,
sounds like my daughter.

337
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,876 
I mean it, Mr. Wellington. Think about it.

338
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,090 
We work hard, we carry these people
on our backs our whole lives, man.

339
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,387 
People like you and me,
we're exploited daily.

340
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:44,267 
These folks have all this,
living in a mansion with a pool.

341
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,062 
They don't use a third of it
and we livin' a rough life in the hood.

342
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:52,233 
We work hard as fuck
and these dudes living in La-la land.

343
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,652 
They make millions on our backs,
Mr. Wellington.

344
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,864 
Let's think, let's mobilize
everyone here, Mr. Wellington.

345
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,326 
Let's occupy, take it by storm,
what do you think?

346
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,787 
I think you should
keep on cleaning the pool.

347
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,290 
-It's full of dirt, look at it.
-Come on.

348
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,293 
One day you'll understand it,
Mr. Wellington.

349
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:15,006 
You're not ready yet, you don't get it.
This is way ahead of you.

350
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,551 
You should go ahead
and clean the pool all the way.

351
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,219 
You have to clean it down there too.

352
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,847 
We have to dive in this pool,
Mr. Wellington.

353
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,392 
One day I'll get here crazy
to dive in this pool.

354
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:33,983 
If you could recommend me to someone,
so I wouldn't be that short on money.

355
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,360 
Yeah,

356
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,990 
don't worry, go travel.
I'll figure it out.

357
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,372 
All right then. Have a nice trip.

358
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,792 
Take a lot of pictures, record videos.

359
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,129 
All right. Give Tokinho a hug.

360
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,968 
Fine. Slay at the Champs Elysees.

361
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,974 
Okay. You too. God bless.

362
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,286 
I've always… sometimes I say…

363
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,998 
I never liked…
It's not because I'm vain,

364
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,961 
but I never liked for my kids
to ask others for anything.

365
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,297 
Never let my kids be poorly dressed.

366
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,677 
And I never had people saying
I raised my kids asking

367
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,932 
for the help of others. No, thank God.

368
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,895 
Today they're all graduated, not to brag.

369
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,983 
Geraldo knows my family, my place.

370
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,862 
I have a son who is a teacher,
he teaches three languages.

371
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,032 
All my daughters graduated
from university.

372
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,742 
AVOID THE FIRST SIP.
ATTEND THE MEETINGS.

373
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:11,414 
<i>None of my kids drink alcohol,</i>
<i>only beer once in a while.</i>

374
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,165 
<i>I tell them,</i>

375
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,295 
<i>The day you think</i>
<i>you need help, you know the way.</i>

376
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,671 
TIME TO TALK.

377
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,631 
<i>Every year they come with me…</i>

378
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,757
{\an8}TIME IS UP.

379
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,260 
…to get my medal. I'll wrap it up.

380
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,722 
Thanking once again the higher power.

381
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:32,226 
Thanking the coordinators
and everyone's attention.

382
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,479 
What I wish for myself,
I wish for you all,

383
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,566 
Just 24 hours more.

384
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,366 
Thank you, Comrade Judite.
It's time to talk.

385
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,454 
Comrades. Good evening, everyone.

386
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,040 
For those who don't know me,
my name is Marcelino,

387
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,460 
another recovering alcoholic,
who joined this wonderful work

388
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,296 
in which I proudly carry the number 2725.

389
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,796 
Tércia? Tércia?

390
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,225 
Help!

391
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,212 
Hey, Mr. Daltoni, do you have
any kind of magnifying glass?

392
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,589 
Deivinho, here we have all kinds of stuff,

393
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,384 
I've stored a few pieces,

394
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,679 
I can look at it and see
if I find what you need.

395
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,892 
If not, we keep looking until we find.

396
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,771 
I've found some PVC pipes,
I just need the lenses now.

397
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,774 
The lenses? Well,
we can take a look around,

398
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,111 
there's a lot of stuff in here,
you can find what you need.

399
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,869 
So, can we count on you
to play in our team? At Milanez?

400
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,413 
My dad takes care of this stuff.
I don't know much.

401
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,958 
We waiting for you to play there.

402
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:36,262 
Deivinho, did you know that, Thiago
is in love with your sister?

403
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,807 
Don't listen to her. She's lying.

404
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,142 
He's really into her.

405
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,610 
Eunice,

406
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:56,115 
Jô told me about the apartment,

407
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,119 
if you decide to close the deal,
you can count on us, okay?

408
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,247 
To have a guarantor and all that.

409
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,000 
Okay? You can talk to me.

410
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,426 
So, Dad, Nina is studying law.

411
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,095 
How nice, it's what I studied.

412
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,598 
Joana told me.

413
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,683 
-At the Federal University, right?
-Yes.

414
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,935 
That's really good.

415
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,647 
We need to arrange for us
to meet her parents.

416
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,608 
We'll do that.

417
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,445 
By the way, can you believe
I haven't met her parents yet?

418
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,032 
What? Am I lying?

419
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,411 
All in good time, honey. Right, Eunice?

420
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,415 
Look at him.

421
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,417 
-Nice finishing.
-Yeah.

422
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,628 
That's great.

423
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,297 
-He's a star.
-Very cool.

424
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,883 
Let me tell you.
I'm gonna pause here.

425
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,927 
Usually, the trials happen
at the end of the year,

426
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,765 
but if something comes up
earlier I'll let you know.

427
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,226 
-Appreciate it, Sorín. Thank you.
-I'll let you know.

428
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,479 
-See ya.
-Thanks.

429
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,938 
-No problem.
-Let me see it.

430
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,775 
-The boy is really good, Mr. Wellington.
-Right?

431
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,286 
Besides the headache, Tércia,
what's bothering you?

432
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,080 
So…

433
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,708 
I had a headache for a day

434
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,544 
but the insomnia is all the time.

435
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,923 
Are you taking something
for the insomnia?

436
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,718 
I'm drinking passion fruit tea,

437
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,763 
but it's been a long time since

438
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,057 
I have slept more than
four hours per night.

439
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,811 
Right. Tell me, how are things at work?

440
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,896 
Stressful?

441
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,816 
No, I haven't worked that much.

442
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,278 
-Have you had a fever recently?
-No.

443
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,658 
It's insomnia and sometimes a malaise.

444
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,078 
What kind? Stomach?

445
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:11,333 
No, it's like, something inside,

446
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,171 
like in my bones. Sometimes a chill.

447
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,092 
And I've been a little scared too.

448
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,637 
Got it. Come with me.

449
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,017 
-Thanks.
-You can sit down.

450
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,027 
I'm going to ask for some tests,

451
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,948 
so, we can check what's going on

452
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:48,537 
'cause it's not clear yet.

453
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,709 
Also, I'll ask you to drink
water during the day

454
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,839 
and avoid heavy meals at night.

455
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:03,302 
-To have a salad, right?
-Yes, salad, juice, some vitamins.

456
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,640 
And TV as well, TV shows
at night can get you agitated.

457
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,476 
It's best to avoid it.

458
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,063 
I won't prescribe you
any medication for now.

459
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:20,152 
-Nothing?
-No, we'll wait for the tests.

460
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:25,949 
You'll keep drinking the passion
fruit tea until then.

461
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,746 
Be kind, give me a card.

462
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,044 
-Take it. Take it.
-Look at the card you played, Nina.

463
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:41,006 
-Pay attention, girl.
-Our team thanks you.

464
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,591 
It's a gift for us.

465
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,927 
Come on, give it to me.

466
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,388 
Honey, the game isn't over.

467
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,350 
-You lost.
-Dad, Mom.

468
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,270 
There's no going back,
you've played your card.

469
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,605 
I'm searching for an apartment.

470
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,362 
What do you mean?

471
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:08,158 
I thought I should tell you
before I decide anything.

472
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,622 
Decide what, Nina?

473
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,585 
But, Nina, are you thinking
about living by yourself?

474
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,173 
No, Dad. I'll live with a friend
and we're gonna split the rent.

475
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,179 
-But how's that gonna work?
-I don't know about that.

476
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,101 
That will have a cost.
How much is that?

477
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,270 
Well, Mom.

478
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,898 
-800 reais at most.
-Too expensive, Nina.

479
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,484 
-Dad, don't start.
-Don't start?

480
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:46,613 
I said 800 reais at most.
I'm searching for cheaper places too.

481
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,783 
That's not easy, Nina. Not easy.

482
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,248 
And who is this friend, Nina?

483
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,792 
-Where did you meet?
-It's Joana, Mom.

484
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,086 
We met in college.

485
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,672 
And how are you
gonna pay for this, Nina?

486
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,967 
I'll keep on tutoring.

487
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,138 
I'm also looking for other things to do.
And I'm almost getting an internship.

488
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,557 
Nina, you should be patient, honey.

489
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,518 
-Graduate first.
-I'm almost graduating, Dad.

490
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,103 
Then do it first.

491
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,732 
-Then you get a boyfriend.
-Nonsense, Dad.

492
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,027 
-Then you get married.
-Who said I wanna get married?

493
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,194 
You don't?

494
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,322 
So, for me to leave I have to get married?

495
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,032 
-Why are you leaving?
-I won't get married.

496
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,867 
-You have everything here.
-I want my freedom.

497
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,036 
More freedom than you already have?

498
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,247 
-Dad, it's not like that.
-How come it isn't?

499
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,584 
-I wanna leave, that's all.
-Leaving…

500
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,586 
-you're just a child.
-A child, Dad?

501
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,756 
-How would that work?
-You keep treating me as a child.

502
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,551 
-Two girls living in an apartment.
-What's the problem?

503
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,679 
-And what if something happens?
-What would happen? It's safe.

504
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,098 
-Who would take care of you?
-I can take care of myself.

505
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:59,478 
Enough! Enough! For God's sake.

506
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,690 
You already screwed the game up.
What a fucked-up Tuesday.

507
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,819 
Nina, you find a way
to bring this girl here.

508
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,821 
-What for?
-What for, Nina?

509
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,992 
Girl, you aren't uncared for.
You have a mother, a father, a brother.

510
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,662 
You think you can come in here
and just tell us you're leaving?

511
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,790 
It's important to bring her here,

512
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,416 
-right, Deivinho?
-Yeah.

513
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,501 
Right, Wellington?

514
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,544 
I wanna know about the game,
whose turn is it?

515
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,671 
Your turn.

516
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,560 
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna leave?

517
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,567 
I wasn't sure yet, Deivinho.
I’m still not sure.

518
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,364 
Are you gonna move too far?

519
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,783 
Maybe.

520
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,328 
Downtown or the East Side.

521
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,583 
But we'll see each other
all the time, Deivinho.

522
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,211 
I'll always be with you.

523
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,715 
Seeing you play soccer, becoming a star.

524
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,057 
Nina, do you think dad would be mad
if I didn't play soccer anymore?

525
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,395 
Don't you wanna play?

526
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,944 
I don't know if I wanna become
a professional player.

527
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,159 
Then talk to dad, Deivinho.

528
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,494 
He can't make you do
anything you don't want to.

529
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,291 
It's not that I want to stop playing,
I just think about doing other stuff too.

530
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,962 
Yeah? What stuff?

531
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,925 
What is it?

532
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,513 
You'll think it's stupid,
I can’t tell you.

533
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,766 
Tell me, don't be silly.

534
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,523 
My dream is to become an astrophysicist
and go on the Mars One mission.

535
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,029 
Mars One? What mission is that?

536
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:20,452 
It's a mission that will happen in 2030.
Humans will try to colonize Mars.

537
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,874 
Wow, Deivinho.

538
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,710 
I don't even know what to say.

539
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,339 
Is that what you want?
To go to Mars?

540
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,760 
I'm even building
a telescope to observe better.

541
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,305 
A telescope?

542
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:46,311 
-I knew you'd think it's stupid.
-No, Deivinho. I don't think that.

543
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,106 
It's beautiful. A beautiful dream.

544
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,318 
I laughed because I never
heard you talking like that.

545
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,413 
You wanna go to Mars
and worry about me moving far away?

546
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,046 
Don't forget about me, okay?

547
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,479 
Never, Deivinho.

548
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,117 
Hey, go get the ball, boy.

549
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,244 
Come on, Deivinho,

550
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,290 
You're just walking there.
Don't do that, son.

551
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,051 
Go get it, Deivinho. Come on, boy.

552
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,317 
The right wing was trying
to pass you the ball

553
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,320 
and you didn't pay attention.
You lost the ball twice, Deivinho.

554
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,908 
Man up. Come on.
Pay attention to the game.

555
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,745 
What's wrong, Deivinho?
Are you listening to me?

556
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,122 
You're not paying attention.
Deivinho?

557
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:40,592 
If they disarm the attack,
they're the best in the league.

558
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,094 
-They just have to score, Dad.
-Yeah, but…

559
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,056 
-Dad? Mom?
-Hey honey.

560
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,725 
Hi, young lady.

561
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,603 
-So, you are…
-Joana.

562
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,106 
-This is my mom, Tércia.
-It's a pleasure.

563
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,360 
Welcome.
Our daughter's friend is our friend too.

564
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,861 
Thank you.

565
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,156 
-This is my dad, Wellington.
-How are you? Nice to meet you.

566
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,076 
Nina, if I knew
you were bringing a fan of Atlético,

567
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,953 
I'd have saved on the fireworks.

568
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:12,666 
The girl will be terrified here.

569
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,086 
-Sit down, honey.
-Excuse me.

570
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,422 
And you must be Deivinho.

571
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,426 
Nina talks a lot about you.

572
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,974 
Do you want some water,
coffee, juice, soda?

573
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,143 
-Juice would be fine.
-I'll make you a lemonade.

574
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:36,064 
-No need. It can be a soda then.
-No, it'll take just a minute.

575
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,567 
You eat some pudding now.
It's a family recipe.

576
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,653 
-I think you'll like it. Excuse me.
-Thank you.

577
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,657 
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

578
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:07,053 
Come on. Come on.

579
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,348 
Damn it. Come on.

580
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,392 
What the hell?

581
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,060 
I give up.

582
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,021 
This guy looks like
he's got two right feet.

583
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,481 
What is it, honey?

584
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,612 
-What a shitty game.
-Deivinho seems off.

585
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,343 
Goal! Goal!

586
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,969 
Atlético!

587
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,264 
What about the fireworks, Mr. Wellington?

588
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,395 
-Fuck, Cruzeiro! Motherfucker!
-Hey.

<i>To our beloved audience!</i>

615
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,088 
<i>Meanwhile let's enjoy a song</i>
<i>to warm up our hearts…</i>

616
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:37,263 
The bathroom floor isn't good
but I think it's easy to fix.

617
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,143 
Girl, there's a ceiling fan.

618
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,020 
Oh no.

619
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,108 
-It scares me a little.
-Stop it. It's fancy.

620
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,818 
Yeah, right.

621
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,823 
Did your dad get angry that day?

622
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,663 
Joana, my dad can get
very annoying with soccer.

623
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,669 
-Do you think I should call him?
-No, leave it alone.

624
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,297 
There are other things involved.

625
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,677 
Your mom didn't like it either.

626
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,054 
No, my mom is all right.

627
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,391 
She looked at me
with a strange expression.

628
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,727 
You had the wrong impression.

629
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,111 
So? Should we close the deal?

630
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,032 
Should we?

631
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,871 
-Baby?
-Yeah?

632
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,083 
-Come here real quick, please.
-Just a second.

633
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,260 
-Tell me.
-I'm going over the bills here.

634
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,388 
Things aren't good.

635
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,558 
It really isn't.
I'm coming from the supermarket now,

636
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,768 
-and it cost me a pretty penny.
-Really?

637
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,106 
-What about work? Nothing?
-No, nothing at all.

638
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,026 
I thought it was gonna get better,
but it just got worse.

639
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,236 
The guys will take
two weeks to come back.

640
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,405 
-Beatriz is going on vacation.
-Jeez.

641
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,742 
I asked Claudete for help
but nothing came up.

642
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,744 
It's difficult.

643
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,789 
There's no other way,
we gotta cut some expenses.

644
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:32,545 
I was thinking, where's the cable bill?
It's very expensive.

645
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:37,800 
-We could cut the pay per view.
-But, baby. The soccer games.

646
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,595 
It's just a little something.

647
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:42,930 
A little something?

648
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,099 
The only thing I like
to watch is Cruzeiro's games.

649
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,769 
-And we gonna cut that?
-You need to think about Cruzeiro now?

650
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,772 
Don't mess with Cruzeiro.
Let's think about something else.

651
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:56,986 
One thing I saw here,
the electricity bill, it's absurd.

652
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,030 
But I save on that, honey.

653
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,200 
I know you do,
but everybody gotta help with that.

654
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:06,037 
-Nina takes 2 hours to wash her hair.
-But her hair is beautiful.

655
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,790 
I know, she gotta take care of it.
But we need to save.

656
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:13,544 
That's funny.
When you had your afro, how did you do it?

657
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,089 
Baby, I washed my hair
in the laundry tub,

658
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,175 
and let it dry in the sun.

659
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:24,639 
-She takes two hours with the hairdryer.
-No, we won't mess with Nina.

660
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:28,351 
You know what I think?
You should ask your boss for a raise.

661
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,355 
I've tried. They won't give
me a raise just like that.

662
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:36,109 
Your boss is an ass.
She'll ask you to take care of her cat

663
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,945 
and instead of paying you,
she'll bring you flour from Tchó Tchó.

664
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,738 
Who needs that?

665
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,408 
If I tell you there's no way
it's 'cause there's no way.

666
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,951 
All right, all right.

667
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,038 
But Baby, see…

668
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,000 
Let's just breathe.
It's not the first time, is it?

669
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,712 
-We'll get through this.
-Yes.

670
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,644 
-Thanks, I really liked it.
-Really?

671
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,521 
Then give me a kiss.

672
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,859 
-Merry Christmas.
-To you too.

673
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,612 
I loved it. This one was a star.

674
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,116 
Damn, he could play ball.

675
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:32,665 
-For you to read on your way to work.
-Thank you, honey. I really liked it.

676
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,138 
Here.

677
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,776 
GOOD FOR ONE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON LECTURE.

678
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,528 
-You're kidding?
-No,

679
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:04,989 
I’m serious.

680
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,407 
-You sure?
-Yes.

681
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,910 
-Absolutely? For real?
-Yes. Yes.

682
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,495 
Thank you.

683
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,917 
The card was just to hand you something,

684
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,878 
but I saw the page
for the lecture open on the computer.

685
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,256 
And I noticed you won't stop
watching his videos on YouTube.

686
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,550 
So, I decided to give it to you as a gift.

687
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,843 
Thanks.

688
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,346 
-You really wanna go?
-Of course, I do.

689
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,143 
-But it's not too expensive?
-No,

690
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,813 
I got some money from work.

691
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,900 
-Joana helped as well.
-That's nice.

692
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,319 
She sent you a kiss
and says Merry Christmas.

693
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,574 
-And we'll help you with the trip okay?
-Okay.

694
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:57,083 
-But what if mom and dad won't let me?
-We'll deal with that later.

695
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,127 
-One thing at a time, okay?
-Okay.

696
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,423 
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you, best gift ever!

697
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,870 
Listen.

698
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,999 
Merry Christmas.

699
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,629 
Oh, honey, Merry Christmas.

700
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,387 
All the best. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,474 
For all of us.

702
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,329 
<i>…the vice president Hamilton Mourao</i>

703
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,166 
<i>followed by first lady Michelle Bolsonaro</i>

704
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:26,589 
<i>and Paula Mourao return to the speech</i>
<i>Bolsonaro will give the nation</i>

705
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:32,345 
Hi, good afternoon.
Sorry to interrupt you at lunchtime.

706
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,347 
-You wanna join us?
-No, thank you. Enjoy.

707
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,643 
Wellington, I just came to give
you the key to my apartment,

708
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:43,105 
'cause I'll be traveling, so you take
care of Galvão and my plants, okay?

709
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,440 
Okay, got it.

710
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,109 
-So you’re going on a trip?
-I am.

711
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,946 
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

712
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,574 
-Be careful.
-No need.

713
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,660 
Don't worry, we got it.

714
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,162 
-Don't get crazy.
-Never did.

715
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,468 
Who didn't want to wake up
early, did it like this.

716
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,764 
-What's this for?
-To shave, can you believe it?

717
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,641 
-No way.
-It's true.

718
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:22,812 
You'd put it in the shaving foam,
apply it to your face,

719
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,773 
and then used the razor here.

720
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,566 
It cuts right here.

721
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,193 
Cool.

722
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,656 
-It sounds cool.
-Yeah. It was from your grandpa.

723
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,078 
His watch.

724
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:45,876 
I'm gonna keep this, his glasses,
his documents.

725
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,045 
Here is his musician ID.

726
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,843 
Your grandpa was amazing. Amazing!

727
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,639 
He played the trombone
in the band of Mariana.

728
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,185 
He sang beautifully.
He learned to speak English,

729
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,563 
-and needed no classes.
-Jeez.

730
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:09,233 
-He was that good, huh?
-He was great.

731
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,780 
He did some things, he was like
Gyro Gearloose.

732
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,659 
He had a small room full of stuff.

733
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,663 
He'd build and fix things.

734
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,668 
He made a sewing machine
and gave it to me on my wedding day.

735
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:31,922 
-No way. He made it himself?
-He did. It's true.

736
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,883 
And it worked.

737
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,345 
He got a box,
put the engine and everything.

738
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,015 
He was very smart.

739
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:50,149 
God, look at this, him playing.

740
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,901 
Wow.

741
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,153 
-That's dad, right?
-Yeah.

742
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,740 
-He looks funny.
-No, he looks beautiful.

743
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,950 
That's when we started dating,

744
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:05,581 
we'd go dancing every Saturday.
With money or not.

745
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:09,585 
He loved to go to the Black Mask.
They played Black music there.

746
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,089 
-Your dad was a great dancer.
-He was?

747
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,841 
He'd go with your uncle, Zé Maria.

748
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,096 
Your uncle couldn't dance.
I got the best one, of course.

749
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,889 
I'm not silly.

750
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,016 
So beautiful.

751
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:29,730 
-Dad was already a fan of soccer?
-Yeah, he always loved soccer.

752
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:36,779 
I think everyone has something
that motivates them, you know?

753
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,366 
-Yeah.
-And for your dad,

754
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,410 
-that's soccer, even today.
-Yeah.

755
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:49,291 
-Can I get a few things here, Mom?
-Yes.

756
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,920 
Your dad probably doesn’t remember
these things are still here.

757
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,134 
After you get what you want,
I'll deal with the rest.

758
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,266 
Will you take this? What are you gonna do?

759
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,810 
Something I'm working on, don't worry.

760
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,275 
-Did you take photos, record videos?
-A lot.

761
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,527 
-Did you slay?
-Sure.

762
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:21,031 
This one here complains a lot.

763
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:24,910 
-I hired a guy to take our photos.
-Really?

764
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,997 
I had to complain, he wanted
to bring all of Paris in his suitcase.

765
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,039 
Oh no!

766
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:33,294 
He wanted to buy
all the souvenirs, unbelievable.

767
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,672 
Tell me about the men in Paris.

768
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,259 
Amazing.

769
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:45,431 
You know. If he just complains,
I have to make my moves.

770
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,893 
The window here is really high, okay?

771
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:54,190 
-You let him make his moves?
-I'll show you his moves.

772
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,370 
Look at the expiration date,
I'll see what happen to him, Tércia.

773
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:34,104 
<i>Smoke of caboclo, that smells like Guiné</i>

774
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:39,735 
<i>Let the smoke help this child of faith</i>

775
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:44,949 
<i>Smoke of caboclo, that smells like Guiné</i>

776
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:49,954 
<i>Let the smoke help this child of faith</i>

777
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:55,125 
<i>Smoke of caboclo, that smells like Guiné</i>

778
01:10:55,584 --> 01:11:00,172 
<i>Let the smoke help this child of faith</i>

779
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:05,177 
<i>Smoke of caboclo, that smells like Guiné</i>

780
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:10,599 
<i>Let the smoke help this child of faith</i>

781
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,144 
May this smoke open your path.

782
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:17,648 
Free you from all the danger and evil.

783
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,819 
And may you walk in clean,
clear, open paths.

784
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,947 
With the grace of Almighty God.

785
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:34,081 
-You think this is gonna work?
-It's already working, Deivinho.

786
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,252 
Look,

787
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,047 
we have to start planning
the trip as soon as possible.

788
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,926 
Yeah, but have you talked to mom and dad?

789
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,639 
Yeah, they just asked us
to remind them later,

790
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,892 
-so they can arrange everything.
-Cool.

791
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:00,607 
Don't worry. It'll work.

792
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:10,200 
Here.

793
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:19,084 
-Now will you help me finish packing?
-Let's do it.

794
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,723 
-The books go in this box, okay?
-Okay.

795
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:56,038 
Honey, you arranged everything
so fast that I still…

796
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,709 
can't believe you're leaving.

797
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:06,256 
You deserve all the best.
Congrats, okay?

798
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,719 
-You promise to visit soon?
-Yes.

799
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:15,391 
Sorry I didn't go earlier,
but it was all so fast.

800
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:18,727 
I know, Mom.

801
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,564 
I just want you to know
you'll always be welcome there.

802
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:26,443 
You too, honey. Come visit.

803
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,071 
Come to eat mom's food.

804
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,616 
I'll keep praying and cheering for you.

805
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:35,661 
Take it easy, Mom. Stop with the drama.

806
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,043 
For you and Joana.

807
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:45,754 
That's beautiful, Mom.

808
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,434 
God bless you, honey.

809
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,612 
-Dad?
-Hi.

810
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,573 
We're leaving now.

811
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,075 
All right.

812
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,579 
Eunice,

813
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,844 
this chair has more than 70 years.

814
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,308 
It has been in the family all this time.

815
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,813 
There was a whole set
but this is the only one left.

816
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,275 
I fixed it,

817
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,737 
and I want you to have it.

818
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,533 
It's still good to use it,
but if you don't want it…

819
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:01,121 
you can put it in a corner
with a plant on top.

820
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,789 
It would still look good.

821
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,517 
What's up, Wellington?

822
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,770 
-How are you doing, Sorín?
-You all right?

823
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,148 
-Doing some cleaning?
-Yeah. It's practically done.

824
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,401 
-It's good to use it.
-Swim a little bit.

825
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,195 
It's 32 degrees.
I've measured just now.

826
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:17,364 
-Good.
-It's warm.

827
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:19,199 
I'm passing by, going to an event.

828
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,118 
Remember I talked to you
about the tryouts?

829
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,869 
-I do.
-Here.

830
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,040 
-You kidding?
-On Saturday.

831
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,709 
-Next Saturday?
-Yes.

832
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,837 
-My God. All right.
-Just call this number.

833
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,674 
Deivid will compete
at the same level as the other boys.

834
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,428 
There's a chance. I don't want
him to go to another team.

835
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:43,265 
He should play for Cruzeiro.
Thank you so much.

836
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:47,603 
-Tell him to get ready.
-You bet. He'll do well.

837
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,397 
-I'll let you know.
-Have some fun.

838
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,899 
-Thank you so much.
-Have a nice day.

839
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,359 
Thanks a lot.

840
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,043 
You went to see a doctor, right?

841
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,254 
-Yes, Tércia.
-What about the tests?

842
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,007 
-It's all good.
-Nothing wrong?

843
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:18,216 
No.

844
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:23,805 
And you stopped throwing up?
How are you? I wanna know.

845
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,433 
I'm fine. Flawless.

846
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,061 
-I'm great.
-Headaches stopped?

847
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,732 
Yes, Tércia. Everything is okay.

848
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:34,900 
But tell me,

849
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:39,154 
right now, at this moment,

850
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:45,077 
-are you feeling anything or not?
-Right now, I just wanted… you know.

851
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:48,080 
Toquinho, for God's sake, I'm serious.

852
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,667 
But, Tércia, that's annoying, girl.
I'm fine.

853
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,169 
It's not annoying. I wanna know.
I wanna know everything.

854
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:58,840 
-What? I'm fine, flawless.
-You’ll tell me if you feel anything?

855
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,802 
-Yes, Tércia.
-Okay.

856
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:08,725 
-But make sure to let me know.
-Okay. This girl is crazy.

857
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,347 
Dude?

858
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,606 
Stop the bus!

859
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,029 
Oh, God.

860
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,834 
-You owe me his autograph, Dad.
-I do.

861
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,420 
-Is he a nice guy?
-He's really nice.

862
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:23,216 
You remember I told you I showed him
a video of Deivinho playing?

863
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,470 
The goal you scored in Colo-Colo
was in the video.

864
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,263 
You know what happened?

865
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:32,058 
He gave me a contact to take you
in a closed tryouts for Cruzeiro.

866
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,020 
Can you imagine, son?

867
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:41,651 
Imagine that,
we going to Mineirão to watch you play.

868
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,570 
Recording your games on TV.

869
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,741 
Hey, I know you feel pressured
about this,

870
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:50,494 
but just be calm.
All you have to do is play,

871
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,871 
do what you know and like to do. Okay?

872
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:56,333 
The tryouts are next Saturday,
so I need you to be good.

873
01:19:56,416 --> 01:20:00,545 
Don't need to go to school on Friday.
Just relax.

874
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,672 
-But, Dad, this Saturday?
-This Saturday.

875
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,841 
-You sure? Real sure?
-Absolutely. Yes.

876
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,384 
But I already have something.

877
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,888 
You already have something
on Saturday, Deivinho?

878
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,349 
It's a trip with Nina,
didn't she tell you?

879
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,226 
What trip with Nina?

880
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:20,065 
She said something about it,
but she didn't give details.

881
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,692 
-Is it this Saturday?
-Yeah, Mom.

882
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,861 
-São Paulo, right?
-Yeah.

883
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,531 
-But what is it again?
-It's a science fair.

884
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,616 
Nah. What a science fair
has to do with it?

885
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,619 
No. You're playing ball, don't be crazy.

886
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,746 
But she already paid for the ticket.

887
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,708 
And they accepted me
as a participant in the event.

888
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,210 
You did it wrong.

889
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:43,797 
How do you arrange this without
asking for my permission first?

890
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,424 
And how did you pay for this ticket?

891
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:52,347 
-But she said she talked to you.
-She wasn't clear about it.

892
01:20:55,392 --> 01:21:00,063 
Tryouts for Cruzeiro, boy.
This could be the chance of our lives.

893
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:03,692 
We can try to do both, Wellington.

894
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:07,737 
How am I gonna explain to Sorín,
an idol of our team, that our son

895
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,031 
didn't make it to the tryouts because
he was busy.

896
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:16,329 
How is Sorín gonna explain to the people
that opened the doors for you?

897
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:20,542 
People that trusted you. How is he
gonna tell them you didn't go?

898
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:26,214 
No. You'll go and play your best game.
You'll play like never before.

899
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:35,181 
Everything has a limit, Wellington.

900
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:39,060 
You stop pressuring the boy
the way you're doing.

901
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,689 
It won't do any good.
He'll get there on Saturday

902
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,859 
won't be able to play well.

903
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:48,028 
The boy needs to be educated, baby.

904
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,573 
He needs to understand
that if he wants something in life,

905
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,244 
he'll need discipline, responsibility.
Things aren't easy.

906
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,790 
This way you're not motivating him,
you're putting him off.

907
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:05,670 
-Have you seen his face?
-That was because of the scolding.

908
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,466 
When he gets on that field,
in the green lawn with the ball rolling,

909
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,510 
it'll be the same Deivinho,
putting on a show.

910
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,306 
You trust too much.

911
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,818 
I'll have to get out of here.

912
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,075 
What is it, baby?

913
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,666 
I'll have to get out of here, baby.
I'm attracting a lot of bad things.

914
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,335 
This nonsense again.

915
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:49,839 
If you're not feeling well,
go get some help.

916
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:55,178 
If the people you saw didn't help,
get a different opinion.

917
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,055 
I've tried, it didn't work.

918
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,558 
I can feel I'm attracting bad things.

919
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:04,813 
But baby, if it was like that,
something would happen to me too.

920
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:08,441 
-How come nothing happened?
-Yet. It hasn't happened yet.

921
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,486 
-You're overreacting.
-No.

922
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,533 
I'll find a way to get out.
I won't be near Deivinho.

923
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:20,954 
Saturday is coming, if something happens,

924
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:24,082 
I'll never forgive myself.

925
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,167 
Baby…

926
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,046 
if it'll make you feel better,
I don't know,

927
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,718 
Take care of yourself.
Go for a walk, a trip.

928
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,972 
If you really believe that

929
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:43,351 
you being around can jinx
the tryouts for Deivinho,

930
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:46,396 
then you should travel.

931
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:52,777 
But travel to a place close by,
a place we can afford.

932
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,990 
Only a weekend.

933
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,661 
A place nearby.
I'll go on Friday. It's decided.

934
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:02,954 
Fine.

935
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,667 
-Flávio?
-Yeah, Mr. Wellington.

936
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,962 
-I'll need a favor.
-Sure, Mr. Wellington.

937
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:15,425 
I'll need to go get a medical
certificate for Deivinho.

938
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:19,179 
-For Deivinho? Is he sick?
-No, it's for the tryouts.

939
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:21,639 
-Wow. So it worked?
-It did.

940
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:25,685 
I just need to get a certificate
to prove he's healthy to play.

941
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,270 
-That's great.
-Here's the thing.

942
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:30,982 
I need you to go to Dircinha's apartment.

943
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:36,613 
It's simple. Water the plants,
clean the litter box and feed the cat.

944
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:41,201 
-I'll do it now.
-Not now. There's a schedule.

945
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:43,328 
-You can do it before you leave.
-All right then.

946
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,082 
-Ten minutes before you leave.
-Mr. Wellington, you're the boss.

947
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:50,877 
You'll get in there and you'll see it.
It's in the service area.

948
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:57,842 
-You'll see the cans, the pet food…
-Mr. Wellington, you can go. I got it.

949
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,262 
-Text me if you need anything.
-It's all cool.

950
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,182 
-Here, I'll leave the keys with you.
-Leave it to me.

951
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,101 
-Can I go then?
-Of course, Mr. Wellington.

952
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,062 
-I'll go sort that out.
-Good luck. Go get it done.

953
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:10,355 
Thanks a lot.

954
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,656 
<i>Baby, can you help me</i>
<i>install the new shower?</i>

955
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,117 
Uh-huh.

956
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:36,881 
What is it?

957
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,054 
I don't know.

958
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,517 
Did something happen?

959
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,397 
I'm worried about the trip.

960
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,860 
My parents didn't say anything,
Deivinho neither.

961
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:00,155 
Do you wanna call them?

962
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,782 
I will.

963
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,704 
I'm just upset my parents
haven't come here yet.

964
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:15,044 
I'll go clean outside, okay?

965
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:17,839 
It will be all right.

966
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,115 
My man, Moisés. What's up?

967
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,910 
-Good morning, Wellington.
-Good morning. Is everything okay?

968
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:49,329 
-Okay for who?
-What happened?

969
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,789 
Dircinha wants to talk to you.
Things are bad for you.

970
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,625 
For me? Why?

971
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,878 
-Go look for Dircinha.
-Where's Flávio? Is he here yet?

972
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,505 
Don't know about him.
Go talk to Dircinha.

973
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:20,860 
Dircinha, good morning.

974
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,821 
-Good for who?
-What's happening?

975
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,407 
I'm the one wondering what’s happening.

976
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:30,203 
I traveled, left the keys
to my apartment with you,

977
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,164 
when I got here,
my apartment was robbed.

978
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:38,586 
My wardrobe wide-open,
my living-room TV is gone,

979
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,463 
-even Galvão is missing.
-My God,

980
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:43,716 
-have you talked to Flávio?
-Why would I talk to him?

981
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,806 
-If I left my keys with you.
-I had to leave a bit earlier,

982
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:54,769 
and I asked Flávio to do the favor
to water your plants,

983
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,231 
and feed Galvão.
But it was a quick thing I had to do.

984
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:03,361 
So you left, gave the keys
to some scoundrel. Right?

985
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,739 
-You told anyone you were leaving?
-No. I just talked to Flávio.

986
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,075 
I had done all the work in advance…

987
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,121 
So this Flávio stole everything,
even my jewelry is gone.

988
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:17,292 
You can be sure I'm gonna call
him and find out what happened.

989
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,295 
Look, Wellington. I like you,
I have respect for you,

990
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,381 
-but I'm very disappointed.
-But Dircinha…

991
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:26,217 
I'm the manager here.

992
01:28:26,592 --> 01:28:30,638 
I owe the residents an explanation.
How am I gonna talk to them now?

993
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,099 
-You've known me for years.
-Yes.

994
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:35,685 
And if it was up to me,
I'd give you another chance.

995
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:38,521 
But unfortunately, I can't do that.

996
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:43,693 
You put me in a difficult position,
and I'll have to fire you.

997
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,070 
Don't do that. I have a family.

998
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:51,284 
You should've thought about that before.
Now it's too late.

999
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:55,038 
-It's no use crying over spilled milk.
-I'm gonna work this out.

1000
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,415 
What you did to me,
I could never imagine.

1001
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:00,877 
I feel like you stabbed me in the back.

1002
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,047 
-And it's still hurting.
-Don't say that.

1003
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:09,177 
Next week I'll call you
to make your arrangements.

1004
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:12,597 
-Give me another chance.
-There's nothing else I can do.

1005
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:16,267 
Dircinha, I can work this out.

1006
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:35,495 
-Do you wanna go flying kites?
-I do.

1007
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,999 
-I don't.
-Deivinho, you're so boring.

1008
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,751 
Are you sick?

1009
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:46,172 
I'm gonna go. You're too slow.
Let's go Thiago?

1010
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,548 
Let's.

1011
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,434 
-You chicken.
-You chicken.

1012
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,497 
Miss? Good afternoon.

1013
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,502 
I wanna buy a ticket,
the cheapest one.

1014
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:51,380 
-Any city?
-Yeah.

1015
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:56,385 
There's Juatuba,
it takes an hour and a half

1016
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,138 
and it costs 18 reais 90 cents.

1017
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:02,350 
-It's 18,90? And it's the cheapest?
-Yes.

1018
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,854 
I'm here at this bus station,

1019
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:12,318 
talking to you because I suffered
a horrible accident.

1020
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:18,866 
I ask you for five cents,
ten cents, 25 cents.

1021
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:25,248 
Too little with God is a lot,
too much without God is nothing.

1022
01:32:25,831 --> 01:32:30,002 
Due to this terrible accident,
I'm unable to work.

1023
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,925 
-You son of a bitch.
-For God's sake.

1024
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:38,928 
What have you done?
You ruined my life.

1025
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:41,305 
I'm gonna kill you.

1026
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,182 
-You bastard.
-She's hitting a cripple.

1027
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,563 
-Take your hands off me.
-Ma'am, it's a prank.

1028
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:52,650 
Fuck your TV prank, bitch! Fuck you!

1029
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,360 
-What's this?
-Calm down.

1030
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:07,206 
I didn't know
if I should call your mother,

1031
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:13,587 
Deivinho told me to call you,
so I called you.

1032
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:16,924 
-He's over here.
-Deivinho,

1033
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,510 
what happened?

1034
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:24,348 
He rolled over and hit his leg
on the bike hard. It was crazy.

1035
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:27,310 
And you with these adventures.

1036
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,010 
Hey, honey.

1037
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:06,640 
Guys, what happened?
My goodness.

1038
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:09,852 
Excuse me, honey. Let me see.

1039
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:14,774 
Deivinho, this broken leg, baby!

1040
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,443 
How are you feeling? Your arms…

1041
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:18,778 
-I'm fine.
-Let me see it.

1042
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:24,241 
-Just don't touch it, it's burning.
-Let me see your face. So pretty.

1043
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,078 
-Your back is hurting? Your belly?
-No.

1044
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,622 
-Your head?
-No, I'm fine.

1045
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:33,876 
-And your teeth, honey?
-My braces didn't break,

1046
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:38,130 
-Thank God.
-You won't need to pay for that.

1047
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:41,801 
-Guys, what happened?
-He got hurt.

1048
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:45,054 
What happened, Deivinho?
Have you broken your leg, son?

1049
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,601 
-What happened, guys? For God's sake.
-He fell off his bike, Dad.

1050
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:54,021 
Have you been hit, son?

1051
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:56,524 
Huh?

1052
01:34:58,734 --> 01:34:59,860 
Answer me, Deivinho.

1053
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:04,949 
I was riding my bike, then
I went down the hill and fell.

1054
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,292 
But, Deivid.

1055
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:19,547 
Hadn't we agreed that
you'd stand still at home, son?

1056
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,968 
Didn't I ask you to stay
at home, Deivid?

1057
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,804 
-Huh?
-Wellington, don't yell at him.

1058
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,058 
Damn.

1059
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:34,979 
The only thing I asked
was for him to be quiet at home,

1060
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:38,149 
and you decide to go down
the hill in your bike, Deivid?

1061
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:40,568 
Dad, calm down. There's no need to shout.

1062
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:42,862 
-No need to shout. Calm down.
-Look,

1063
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:46,157 
I don't ask you for anything.
I don't ask for anything in this house.

1064
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:51,662 
The only thing I asked
was for you to stand still.

1065
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,957 
For you not to go out,
to take care of yourself for tomorrow.

1066
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,041 
Wasn't it, Deivid?

1067
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:01,046 
Damn. Then you go down
on a hill with a bike, Deivid?

1068
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:05,259 
Don't yell at the boy. It's over.

1069
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:09,180 
Yeah, it's over.

1070
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:13,017 
The tryouts, my job. It's all over.

1071
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:17,855 
I got fired, baby.

1072
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:22,985 
Baby, damn,

1073
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:26,655 
there was this chance tomorrow.

1074
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:30,993 
There was a chance…

1075
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:36,665 
and this fuckin boy
goes out with his bike.

1076
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:38,667 
Dad, shut up. You're being an asshole.

1077
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:41,128 
-Don't tell me to shut up.
-Stop yelling at my brother.

1078
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,922 
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna hit me?

1079
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:44,298 
Guys, for God's sake!

1080
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:53,766 
We're fucked, baby.

1081
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:01,584 
Wellington, let's go
to the bedroom.

1082
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,337 
Wake up, Wellington.

1083
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,631 
Let's get you in the bedroom.

1084
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:12,386 
Come on, get up.

1085
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,917 
I'll get some water, honey.

1086
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:11,695 
<i>Tragedy at 381</i>

1087
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:15,157 
<i>An accident closed out</i>
<i>the traffic at BR381</i>

1088
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,787 
<i>in the metropolitan region</i>
<i>of Belo Horizonte on Friday afternoon.</i>

1089
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:23,165 
<i>Yesterday afternoon, around 2:00 p.m.,</i>

1090
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:28,045 
<i>a travel bus left Belo Horizonte</i>

1092
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:37,471 
<i>The two vehicles fell off a cliff.</i>
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

1093
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:39,598 
<i>-The passenger list has not been…</i>
-Mom?

1094
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:42,851 
Are you okay?

1095
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:46,689 
What happened, Mom?

1096
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:52,778 
I'm alive.

1097
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,130 
Bye, Mom.

1098
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:15,467 
Bye, guys.

SKY EXPLORER

1100
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,800 
<i>I can and I am building a new time.</i>

1101
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:42,179 
A time of sobriety.
A time of greater understanding.

1102
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:46,642 
A time of making our lives worth it.

1103
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:53,148 
I thank you for allowing me
to live again with joy,

1104
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:59,905 
with enthusiasm
and the desire to do many things.

1105
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:05,911 
Once again, I thank the coordinators,

1106
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:11,667 
Oscar, Judite, Valéria,
may we have a great week

1107
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,503 
and may the higher power enlighten us.

1108
01:42:14,878 --> 01:42:18,090 
Twenty-four hours of sobriety for us all.

1109
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:31,895 
And it's time to talk.

1110
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,702 
-Good evening, comrades.
-Good evening.

1111
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,788 
Good evening, coordinators.

1112
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:58,755 
For those who don't know me,
my name is Wellington.

1113
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:11,727 
Yesterday…

1114
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:15,230 
I broke a four years medal of sobriety.

1115
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,858 
I liked this 24 hours thing.

1116
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:03,153 
Yeah?

1117
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,575 
For people to take it 24 hours at a time.

1118
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,887 
Tell your friend I apologize.

1119
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,143 
She's my girlfriend, Dad.

1120
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:41,858 
And I think you can apologize
to her in person.

1121
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:56,873 
You are a lot like me.

1122
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:02,504 
More than you think.

1123
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:25,110 
Damn.

1124
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:28,488 
You really did it.

1125
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:36,955 
Wow.

1126
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:39,958 
That's crazy, Deivinho.

1127
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,920 
I'm trying to improve it
so we can see it better.

1128
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,048 
But that's it for now.

1129
01:45:53,972 --> 01:45:55,140 
Come see, Mom.

1130
01:45:58,101 --> 01:45:59,227 
It's here, right?

1131
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,485 
Wow.

1132
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:11,114 
-What's this, son?
-It's Mars, Mom.

1133
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,202 
That's cool.

1134
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,247 
-Where did you get all this stuff?
-I made it.

1135
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:22,501 
-You made it, Deivinho?
-Yes, Dad.

1136
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,588 
Remember that day
we were seeing some stuff in the room?

1137
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:32,260 
I took some things from grandpa's box,
things you let me,

1138
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:37,265 
then I got some stuff I already
had and build it.

1139
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,018 
That's so interesting, son.

1140
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:44,731 
He would be very happy, you know.

1141
01:46:45,982 --> 01:46:49,486 
He would be very proud of you two.

1142
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,050 
Son?

1143
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:16,471 
Your dream is to go to Mars, right?

1144
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:19,391 
Yes, Dad.

1145
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:25,814 
Mars must be far as hell.

1146
01:47:26,022 --> 01:47:28,108 
Like a hundred thousand
kilometers, right?

1147
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:32,696 
No, Dad. It's way more.

1148
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,992 
The distance from Earth to Mars

1149
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:40,287 
is approximately
60 million kilometers, Dad.

1150
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:45,709 
Deivinho wants to go on a mission
called "Mars One," dad.

1151
01:47:47,752 --> 01:47:49,379 
To colonize the planet.

1152
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,262 
And how do you get to participate?

1153
01:47:58,722 --> 01:47:59,806 
Is it expensive?

1154
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:05,812 
Millions of dollars, Dad.

1155
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:12,194 
Well,

1156
01:48:14,237 --> 01:48:15,405 
we'll find a way.

1157
01:48:30,086 --> 01:48:31,922 
Mom fell asleep.
