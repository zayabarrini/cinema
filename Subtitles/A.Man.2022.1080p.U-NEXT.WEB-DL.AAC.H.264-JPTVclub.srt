A MAN

00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,817
A MAN

Hello.

00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,190
Thank you.

11
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,780
2,030 yen.

12
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,787
2,030 yen exactly.

13
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,933
Where's the breaker?

14
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,727
Those lights are on.

15
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,537
Sorry.

16
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,251
It's... Sorry, it's there.

17
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,971
Thank you.

18
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,893
Thank you.

19
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,257
'Morning.

20
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,509
'Morning.

21
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,141
Yuto, could you take that
lotus root in for me?

22
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,143
Yuto, could you take that
lotus root in for me?

23
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,070
Mom, breakfast.

24
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,994
We're gonna eat.

25
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,295
This lotus root's good.

26
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,087
Want pickles?

27
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,142
Wait up!

28
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,310
Too slow, Yuto!

29
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,656
Yuto!

30
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,346
I've been thinking lately.

31
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,974
My husband went to Heaven before me,

32
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,478
so little Ryo won't get lonely there.

33
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,687
So little Ryo won't get lonely there.

34
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,024
Masahiro was so selfless.
He always put his grandchild first.

35
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,527
Masahiro was so selfless.
He always put his grandchild first.

36
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,620
I'm home!

37
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,413
Hey there Yuto.

38
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,915
Yuto, hey there.

39
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,001
Mrs. Okumura brought us
cakes from Taiseido.

40
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,127
Mrs. Okumura brought us
cakes from Taiseido.

41
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,004
Strawberry, and Mont Blanc.

42
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,464
No way!

43
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,967
In the fridge.

44
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,307
Mom.

45
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,020
You've got Yuto.
Better toughen up, Hatsue.

46
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,066
It's hardest on Rie, you know.

47
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,361
She came back from Yokohama single.

48
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,115
Thank you.

49
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,452
This is 1,785 yen, and...

50
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,622
Mister, you paint for a hobby?

51
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,419
One of my customers saw you,
on the grass near Kiyose River.

52
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,630
One of my customers saw you,
on the grass near Kiyose River.

53
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,675
Show me sometime!

54
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,635
It's not worth it.

55
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,138
Rie, don't you wanna see?

56
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,142
Mrs. Okumura,
mind your business.

57
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,191
Hatsue, the other day...

58
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,779
Daisuke.

59
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,618
Its balance tells you
where to land it.

60
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,663
This tree'll fall easiest there.
Got it?

61
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,498
This tree'll fall easiest there.
Got it?

62
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
See its balance?

63
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,712
It's on a lean.

64
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,467
So, cut a notch facing
where you want it to fall.

65
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,509
So, cut a notch facing
where you want it to fall.

66
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,679
Kuroki! Quit waffling already!

67
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,639
Shut your trap!

68
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,350
Telling him ain't gonna help.

69
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,727
Watch me.

70
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,899
Daisuke.

71
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,900
Try it.

72
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,573
Where's that Daisuke Taniguchi from?

73
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,911
Ikaho Onsen in Gunma. He's the
second son of an innkeeper there.

74
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,872
Ikaho Onsen in Gunma. He's the
second son of an innkeeper there.

75
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,376
A grand old inn.

76
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,462
So why's a guy like him
out here working the forests?

77
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,629
So why's a guy like him
out here working the forests?

78
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,340
Doesn't it sound fishy to you?

79
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,846
I'll admit,
it doesn't sound normal.

80
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,433
But nobody lives their life
without picking up a few scars.

81
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,268
But nobody lives their life
without picking up a few scars.

82
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,353
Is he an ex-con?

83
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,940
Can't have him starting trouble.
Seems kinda like a downer.

84
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,858
Can't have him starting trouble.
Seems kinda like a downer.

85
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,821
He's not a downer.
He's just quiet.

86
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,449
A fast learner too.

87
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,452
Much more useful than your brother.

88
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,955
Leave Takeshi out of it.

89
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,459
Anyway, he's a good kid.

90
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,836
I like Daisuke.

91
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,573
Hello.

92
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,554
Thank you.
That'll be 200 yen.

93
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,849
Do you need a bag?

94
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,309
I'm fine.

95
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,522
1,000 yen received.

96
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,901
Need a receipt?

97
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,361
I don't.

98
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,742
Here, 800 yen change.

99
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,536
Um...

100
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,375
These are..my paintings.

101
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,545
You brought them for me?

102
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,340
They're not great though.

103
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,051
May 17??

104
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,659
You obviously love painting.

105
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,413
This is great.

106
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,922
This kinda looks like Yuto.

107
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,468
My son plays there a lot.

108
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,684
Is he the boy I saw here before?

109
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,063
I-I think that might actually be him.

110
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,608
Oh, really?
I guess it must be.

111
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,445
That's kinda cool.

112
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,782
Really great...

113
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,827
If it's okay,
could we be friends?

114
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,419
Of course not.
You're married. I'm sorry.

115
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,091
Well, 'm not married.
I...

116
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,636
...have a son,
but I'm divorced.

117
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,640
Oh, is that right...

118
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,143
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

119
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,023
If you knew,
that'd be freaky.

120
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:42,029
Oh yes. You're right.
That would be.

121
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,698
Thank you.

122
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,743
Er, what's your name?

123
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,956
Taniguchi.

124
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,215
Sorry it's crumpled.
I'm Daisuke Taniguchi.

125
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,187
Sorry, I don't have a card.
I'm Rie Takemoto.

126
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,522
Rie.

127
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,695
Come anytime,
and show me your paintings.

128
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,779
Come anytime,
and show me your paintings.

129
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,579
No need to buy anything.

130
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,137
Done it before?

131
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,640
Yuto had a younger brother.

132
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,231
But he died when he was 2.

133
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,071
Mind if I tell you?

134
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,247
A brain disease.

135
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,168
I thought he'd get over it...

136
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,926
...but it turned out to be malignant.

137
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,773
Was that...the reason?

138
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,107
Was that...the reason?

139
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,739
You broke up with your husband.

140
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,877
We disagreed over treatment.

141
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,675
From then on,
nothing went our way.

142
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,803
From then on,
nothing went our way.

143
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,982
If I'd known nothing would work...

144
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,653
I would've let him eat what he wanted,

145
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,200
taken him to his favorite zoo,
as much as he wanted...

146
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,660
taken him to his favorite zoo,
as much as he wanted...

147
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,836
At the very least...

148
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,839
At the very least...

149
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,344
...I wanted him to
feel glad that he lived.

150
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,778
The radiation treatment
was so hard on him...

151
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,368
I'd put him through so much pain...

152
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,672
But...

153
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,969
When I realized it was for nothing...

154
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,892
I felt so...

155
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,368
Your son...
What was his name?

156
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,713
Ryo.

157
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,966
Ryo.

158
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,345
Little Ryo.

159
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,480
Little Ryo.

160
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,363
Here goes.

161
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,166
You're good.

162
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,295
Over here. Go!

163
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,923
Pass to your mom.

164
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,010
To me?

165
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,982
Run!
Run, run! Run!

166
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,446
Hurry! Hurry!

167
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,333
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay!

168
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,085
There there.

169
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,090
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

170
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,327
Finished?

171
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,664
Looks cute!

172
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,627
Did we forget anything?
All okay?

173
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,462
Can you do it?

174
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,101
Look, you got food on you.

175
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,310
Yum.

176
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,317
Eat nicely!

177
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,452
Hey, don't play with food!

178
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,211
You're late for school!

179
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,714
He is.
Go on, get moving.

180
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,011
You didn't eat this?
Want more?

181
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,346
Hey, Dad.

182
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,515
Can I go?

183
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,017
Huh? What?

184
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,353
What? Say that again.

185
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,980
To the mountains.

186
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,231
Huh? What?

187
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,316
The mountains...

188
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,692
Like hell you can.

189
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,444
Sports day training.

190
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,028
So what?

191
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,696
It's no big deal.

192
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,366
- Hana, say "No way.”
- No way!

193
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,202
See? Hana said so.

194
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,078
Hana, say it again.

195
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,123
What did you say?
"No way.”

196
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,374
No way!

197
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,626
You're so late.

198
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,171
Come on!
Come on, go already!

199
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,050
Take care!

200
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,140
Daisuke.

201
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,060
Oh. Sorry, sorry.

202
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,357
Thanks.

203
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,736
Thanks.

204
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,528
See you.

205
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,529
Bye.

206
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,031
Take care.

207
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,094
Get in.

208
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,597
What about school?

209
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,057
Come on.

210
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,492
Busy day today.
Let's do this.

211
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,832
Dad Dad Dad!
Which one?

212
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,585
- Daisuke!
- This one?

213
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,672
We're going further in.
You can finish up here for us.

214
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,423
We're going further in.
You can finish up here for us.

215
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,428
Work hard, kid.

216
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,308
Yuto, what do you wanna do today?

217
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,685
Make a slingshot.

218
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,644
That again?

219
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,298
Daisuke?

220
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,176
You okay?

221
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,178
Daisuke?

222
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,474
Hey... Hey...
Daisuke?

223
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,559
Hey Daisuke!

224
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,688
Hey! Somebody!
Call the office!

225
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,401
Hey! Daisuke!
Daisuke! Hey!

226
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,527
Hey! Daisuke!
Daisuke! Hey!

227
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,320
Ambulance!

228
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,407
Call an ambulance!
Quickly!

229
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,158
Hey! Daisuke!

230
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,705
One year later

231
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,206
One year later

232
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:10,170
First anniversary of Daisuke's death

233
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,327
I'll leave you now.

234
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,458
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

235
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,259
My name's Taniguchi.

236
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,513
Kyoichi Taniguchi.

237
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,266
Thank you for coming so far.

238
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,478
My younger brother caused you trouble.

239
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,898
Not at all. I'm sorry for
not inviting you to the funeral.

240
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,608
Not at all. I'm sorry for
not inviting you to the funeral.

241
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,778
I bet he told you not to.
I get it.

242
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,824
Well, actually...

243
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,952
I know we need to discuss
where he'll be interred, so...

244
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,496
I know we need to discuss
where he'll be interred, so...

245
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,790
Daisuke spoke badly of me,
I presume?

246
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,963
He didn't talk about his past,
but he said he and his family...

247
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,465
He didn't talk about his past,
but he said he and his family...

248
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,635
No need to say it.
I know.

249
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,975
He caused trouble for so many,
right till the end...

250
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,309
He caused trouble for so many,
right till the end...

251
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,439
Why was living right so hard for him?

252
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,777
Dying under a tree in this backwater...
An undutiful son to the end.

253
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,362
Dying under a tree in this backwater...
An undutiful son to the end.

254
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,535
Oh, incense. May 1?

255
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,787
Sure, of course.

256
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,876
Hey, invoice me for
funeral and grave costs.

257
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,586
No, there's no need...

258
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,630
Count on me to pay.

259
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,947
You haven't...
put a photo of him here?

260
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,031
You haven't...
put a photo of him here?

261
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,704
A photo.
Of the deceased.

262
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,871
Sorry?

263
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,001
I have, right there.

264
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,754
Where?

265
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,548
Er, there.

266
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,050
Where?

267
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,804
Excuse me.

268
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,438
That's not him.

269
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,901
That's not Daisuke.

270
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,736
Yes, it is..

271
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,197
No, it's not him.

272
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,074
- It's Daisuke.
- It's not Daisuke.

273
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,997
It's not Daisuke.

274
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,958
Did he change that much?

275
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,087
It's not that.
He's totally different.

276
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,421
It's not that.
He's totally different.

277
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,964
I see...

278
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,758
It's a different guy.

279
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,097
It's Daisuke.

280
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,099
It's not Daisuke.

281
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,478
It is. From lkaho Onsen.
The inn. Tamaki.

282
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,397
It is. From lkaho Onsen.
The inn. Tamaki.

283
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,484
It's not Daisuke.

284
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,620
Then, this man...

285
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,500
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

286
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,633
Sorry to interrupt your rest.

287
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,638
We'll be landing at Miyazaki Airport
in approximately 35 minutes.

288
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,140
We'll be landing at Miyazaki Airport
in approximately 35 minutes.

289
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,936
As the captain mentioned earlier,

290
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,897
in roughly 15 minutes time...

291
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,508
It's been seven years?

292
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,678
Oh, I guess you're right.
Since the divorce proceedings.

293
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,179
Oh, I guess you're right.
Since the divorce proceedings.

294
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,975
Thanks for all you did.

295
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,937
Your son must be big now.

296
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,191
My oldest started junior high.

297
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,817
Your oldest?

298
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,697
Yes, I remarried,
and had a daughter.

299
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,160
Oh, is that so?
How old is she?

300
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,203
She's 4.

301
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,622
Same as mine.

302
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,250
What?
Oh, you too, Mr. Kido?

303
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,544
Me too. I got married.

304
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,838
Oh, is that right...

305
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,133
You've got a daughter?

306
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,551
A son.

307
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,888
Oh, really...

308
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,605
His life insurance...

309
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,275
Repayment is unnecessary.

310
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,616
These forms bear the name
"Daisuke Taniguchi,”

311
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,745
but the subject
of the contract is "Mr. X."

312
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,873
Mr. X kept up with his premiums,
so you can keep the money.

313
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,624
Mr. X kept up with his premiums,
so you can keep the money.

314
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,710
Thank you.

315
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,047
No, it's your undeniable right.

316
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,259
More pressingly, Mr. Taniguchi's death
needs to be retracted.

317
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,302
More pressingly, Mr. Taniguchi's death
needs to be retracted.

318
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,598
The deceased is Mr. X,
not Daisuke Taniguchi.

319
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,729
Then, what about
the real Daisuke Taniguchi?

320
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,148
Then, what about
the real Daisuke Taniguchi?

321
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,982
What happens to him?

322
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,571
Well, he'll be regarded as alive.

323
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,031
We need to find the truth.

324
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,242
Thank you for waiting.

325
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,202
Eel on rice for two.

326
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,312
Yuto?

327
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,067
Will stubble from his shaver do?

328
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,819
It'll be fine.

329
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,028
You're home.

330
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,241
Remember Mr. Kido,
from Yokohama?

331
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,664
He's grown up.

332
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,002
Also, I found a hair on his clothes.

333
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,086
Also, I found a hair on his clothes.

334
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,050
And this is his toothbrush.

335
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,178
And...inside these nail clippers,
a nail...

336
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,346
And...inside these nail clippers,
a nail...

337
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,394
That should be plenty.

338
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,356
How much should I give it?

339
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,692
I'll cover all expenses for now.

340
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,361
I meant, how long?

341
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,697
Oh, how long. Well,
we should give it about a month.

342
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,782
Oh, how long. Well,
we should give it about a month.

343
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,200
A month?

344
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,298
Would those paintings
provide some kind of lead?

345
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,010
Well, that's hard to say.

346
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,722
They're good. As if done by
a man with a boy's heart.

347
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,014
They're good. As if done by
a man with a boy's heart.

348
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,691
That's exactly the kind of man he was.

349
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,090
Do you think...he was involved
in some kind of crime?

350
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,300
Do you think...he was involved
in some kind of crime?

351
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,148
From March 31 to May 1st of 2002,
prior 10 disappearing, Mr. Sakazaki

352
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,775
From March 31 to May 1st of 2002,
prior 10 disappearing, Mr. Sakazaki

353
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,362
worked 190.18 hours of overtime
in 30 days,

354
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,074
over twice the 80-hour
overwork death line. On May 2nd,

355
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,408
over twice the 80-hour
overwork death line. On May 2nd,

356
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,495
he requested leave and
became uncontactable. On the 3rd,

357
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,954
he requested leave and
became uncontactable. On the 3rd,

358
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,917
he supposedly committed suicide
in Takanezawa, Tochigi.

359
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,129
“I'm deeply sorry for
my abrupt decision.

360
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,926
“I'm worn out, body and soul,
and this was my only option.

361
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,011
“I'm worn out, body and soul,
and this was my only option.

362
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,098
"Mom, I caused you nothing but pain.

363
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,185
"Please forgive me for causing you
more pain than ever.

364
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,853
"Please forgive me for causing you
more pain than ever.

365
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,188
But you see...”

366
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,110
Oh, Mr. Kido sir!
Thank you so much.

367
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,319
Oh, Mr. Kido sir!
Thank you so much.

368
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,115
Now our Masaru can rest in peace.

369
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:27,202
We're fortunate you're
such a humane lawyer, sir.

370
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,246
No, I simply did my job.

371
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,956
This isn't much, but...

372
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,376
Oh, you're too kind!
He'll gladly accept it.

373
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,087
Sir, we can't thank you enough...

374
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,133
No need. Ma'am, lift your head.
Please, really.

375
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,552
Hey. Show some appreciation.

376
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,137
Lawyers, huh...

377
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,514
We must be going.

378
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,932
Thank you so much.

379
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,559
Thank you.

380
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,269
Thank you so much.

381
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,221
Kaori, that was great.

382
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,598
A better paella than hers.

383
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,516
Well excuse me!

384
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,144
Sota, are you full already?

385
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,147
Don't overfeed them.

386
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,111
Aren't overwork deaths
actually suicides?

387
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,614
Compensation's still paid?

388
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,951
If a job's that hard,
why not ditch it?

389
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,998
Making logical decisions becomes
impossible under such pressure.

390
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,166
Making logical decisions becomes
impossible under such pressure.

391
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,503
This country
uses tax money all wrong.

392
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,923
Doling out welfare
to people who can still work.

393
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,965
Doling out welfare
to people who can still work.

394
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,302
What do they spend it on?
Pachinko.

395
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,264
The system itself's absurd.

396
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,518
Like they say,
real Japanese don't rely on it.

397
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,313
No more free money for
Koreans and their ilk.

398
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,195
Oh, I didn't mean you, Akira.

399
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,949
Akira is third generation.
After that long, he's Japanese.

400
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,617
Akira is third generation.
After that long, he's Japanese.

401
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,246
You know,
I watch nothing but Korean dramas.

402
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,499
Still, Mom?

403
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,334
Pour some for me.

404
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,710
More?

405
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,030
Look. Dad's connections
will get us a super good deal.

406
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,990
Look. Dad's connections
will get us a super good deal.

407
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,576
Maybe with the deposit too.

408
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,747
Isn't here enough?

409
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,627
I want another child.

410
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,337
What about this place?

411
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,550
We could rent it out.
It'd still be ours.

412
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,726
Hey, was your Miyazaki trip
really for business?

413
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,436
Hey, was your Miyazaki trip
really for business?

414
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,148
Yeah. Why?

415
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,447
Silly. Wanna see my ticket?

416
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,118
No.

417
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,996
I'm going to bed.
Good night.

418
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,414
Good night.

419
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,077
Oh, you made it.
It's about Daisuke?

420
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,293
What do you think is the face
of a hot spring inn?

421
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,752
What do you think is the face
of a hot spring inn?

422
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,213
Its hot spring?

423
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,300
Exactly. Its face is something
you dare not change.

424
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,510
Exactly. Its face is something
you dare not change.

425
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,640
Our spring"s quality is indisputable.
Messing with it is a no-no.

426
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,767
Our spring"s quality is indisputable.
Messing with it is a no-no.

427
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,647
When I took over from my father,
reservations shot up.

428
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,773
When I took over from my father,
reservations shot up.

429
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,692
That was beyond my brother.

430
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,739
I've heard you and Daisuke clashed
regarding who would take over.

431
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,199
I've heard you and Daisuke clashed
regarding who would take over.

432
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,869
No, there was no clash.

433
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,498
Daisuke just thought there was.

434
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,340
This is the real Daisuke Taniguchi?

435
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,802
Before lumber jacking in Miyazaki,
he was in Osaka.

436
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,846
Really? I'll go there.

437
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,806
Oh, I already went.

438
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,186
This is our signature dish.
Try it

439
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,737
I showed that photo to
his landlord in Kita Ward,

440
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,488
I showed that photo to
his landlord in Kita Ward,

441
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,283
who recognized him.

442
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,410
The real Daisuke?

443
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,539
He didn't recognize a photo
of the fake Daisuke though.

444
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,915
He didn't recognize a photo
of the fake Daisuke though.

445
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,544
So, in Osaka,
they hadn't switched places yet.

446
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,296
So, in Osaka,
they hadn't switched places yet.

447
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,383
What do you say?

448
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,927
Well, it's too early...

449
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,637
Tasty, right?

450
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,807
Oh... Yes.

451
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,230
Anyway, do you think
Daisuke's still alive?

452
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,606
Anyway, do you think
Daisuke's still alive?

453
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,819
I mean, well, surely
the other guy killed him?

454
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,404
I mean, well, surely
the other guy killed him?

455
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,493
If the wife is on the level,
she's a victim,

456
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,955
but she got his life insurance,
so I think it should be investigated.

457
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,958
But she got his life insurance,
so I think it should be investigated.

458
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,250
But she got his life insurance,
so I think it should be investigated.

459
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,589
Okay, good luck.

460
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,432
Hello!

461
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,517
Hello!

462
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,437
Kyu! Hello there!

463
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,775
Uh-oh, she's mad.
She won't take to me.

464
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,277
Sorry about that.

465
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,778
See you, Kyu.

466
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,955
Hi boss.

467
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,374
Oh, Misuzu.

468
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,849
This guy passed himself off
as Daisuke?

469
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,475
That's right.

470
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,813
We don't know his name,
so we call him "Mr. X."

471
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,982
That's funny.

472
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,781
Their faces and their heights
are probably different.

473
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,491
Their faces and their heights
are probably different.

474
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,659
Never seen him?

475
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,330
When did you meet Daisuke?

476
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,666
When I was in high school.

477
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,712
We hooked up and broke up,
over and over.

478
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,716
When did you last see him?

479
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,510
When was it...

480
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,934
His father had died, so he
went to the funeral... Around then.

481
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,686
His father had died, so he
went to the funeral... Around then.

482
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,731
This is Daisuke.

483
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,569
These are pretty old.

484
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,407
At this time, were you...

485
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,617
We were together.

486
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,537
But around that time...

487
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,373
The last time...

488
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,793
He never talked about breaking up.
He was just suddenly gone.

489
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,003
He never talked about breaking up.
He was just suddenly gone.

490
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,922
No calls or messages?

491
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,883
Not at all.
I couldn't get through.

492
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,723
But why did that guy
want Daisuke's past?

493
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,562
His background was nothing special.

494
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,566
An inheritance?

495
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,652
I don't know.

496
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,866
Maybe he got abducted by North Korea.

497
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,908
Maybe he got abducted by North Korea.

498
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,747
I've heard about that. They steal
family registers and assume identities.

499
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,499
I've heard about that. They steal
family registers and assume identities.

500
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,130
Mr. X worked in forestry
in a small town in Miyazaki.

501
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,631
Mr. X worked in forestry
in a small town in Miyazaki.

502
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,844
Well, there are still plenty of
North Korean agents around, yeah?

503
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,096
Well, there are still plenty of
North Korean agents around, yeah?

504
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,973
Not that conspiracy crap again.

505
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,895
He thinks the Tohoku quake
was man-made.

506
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,523
Wait a minute, that was...

507
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,650
This is a real manhunt.

508
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,884
Sorry for springing this on you.
Let me know if you...

509
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,428
Sorry for springing this on you.
Let me know if you...

510
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,189
sorry.

511
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,820
Daisuke...

512
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,114
What a dumb-ass.

513
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,952
Such a dumb-ass.

514
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,585
I thought I'd found him,
but this is...

515
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,841
Sorry I blurted that out.

516
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,514
Bye.

517
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,079
The DNA test confirmed that
Mr. X wasn't Daisuke Taniguchi.

518
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,831
The DNA test confirmed that
Mr. X wasn't Daisuke Taniguchi.

519
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,961
I see...

520
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,257
That means you're
neither married, nor a widow.

521
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,718
That means you're
neither married, nor a widow.

522
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,850
Rie?

523
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,897
Are you alright?

524
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,913
I wonder,
whose life was I living with?

525
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,080
I wonder,
whose life was I living with?

526
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,588
"Whose life was I living with?”

527
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,931
I didn't have the faintest idea
how to answer her.

528
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,770
That X guy wanted to
hide his criminal past, no?

529
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,188
That X guy wanted to
hide his criminal past, no?

530
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,107
A majorly nasty one at that.

531
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,945
These sweets kick ass.

532
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,195
I know.

533
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,870
Nothing's riskier than
drawing the law's attention, no?

534
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,746
Nothing's riskier than
drawing the law's attention, no?

535
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,792
That's a natural assumption.

536
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,128
What's that?

537
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,589
Brand fraud.

538
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,176
Some shysters slap vintage stickers
on cheap-ass wines.

539
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,178
Some shysters slap vintage stickers
on cheap-ass wines.

540
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,683
Buyers don't want to look clueless,
soO they keep quiet.

541
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,142
Buyers don't want to look clueless,
soO they keep quiet.

542
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,977
That's ingenious.

543
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,737
Interesting.

544
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,951
Brand fraud reminds me,
I handled an impersonation case once.

545
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,244
Brand fraud reminds me,
I handled an impersonation case once.

546
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,829
Impersonation?

547
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,333
A 55-year-old man switched identities
with a 67-year-old and took his pension.

548
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,836
A 55-year-old man switched identities
with a 67-year-old and took his pension.

549
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,965
Got a guilty charge and it went civil.

550
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:55,927
The switch was pulled off by a broker.

551
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,141
Wait, when was that?

552
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,729
2000 and...what?

553
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,355
"Osaka pension fraud broker..."

554
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,357
"Osaka pension fraud broker..."
Here it is. 2013.

555
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:09,378
"Osaka pension fraud broker..."

556
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,817
"Osaka pension fraud broker..."
Around the time X came to Miyazaki.

557
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:10,838
Around the time X came to Miyazaki.

558
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,741
Seems the broker got paid
pulling off a load of deals.

559
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,200
Seems the broker got paid
pulling off a load of deals.

560
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,954
"Norio Omiura”?

561
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,877
He's in Osaka Prison now.

562
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,255
He was in Osaka when
Daisuke Taniguchi was there too.

563
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,799
He was in Osaka when
Daisuke Taniguchi was there too.

564
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,211
Wow, handsome mister lawyer
has come to see little old me.

565
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,422
Wow, handsome mister lawyer
has come to see little old me.

566
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,761
I'm ugly, ain't I?

567
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,890
No wonder I'm a twisted bastard.

568
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,439
Well, thank you for meeting me.

569
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,859
As I told you, I'm Kido...

570
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,362
You're a Japan-born Korean.

571
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,323
Ain't ya?

572
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,872
Do I have to tell you?

573
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,500
I knew soon as I saw your face.

574
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,007
I'm a naturalized Japanese now.

575
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,803
So, today, as I wrote in my letter,
five years ago...

576
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,095
So, today, as I wrote in my letter,
five years ago...

577
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,806
Mister lawyer.

578
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,143
Some people out there
actually live for 300 years, you know?

579
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,312
Some people out there
actually live for 300 years, you know?

580
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,902
I'm sure you've heard
that 300-year-olds are real.

581
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,111
I'm sure you've heard
that 300-year-olds are real.

582
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,156
I've never heard that.

583
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,827
Maybe they don't exist in
the world you live in, mister lawyer.

584
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,037
Maybe they don't exist in
the world you live in, mister lawyer.

585
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,166
On the down-low, there was one
in here. He got released though.

586
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,501
On the down-low, there was one
in here. He got released though.

587
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,844
That's fascinating, but I'm here
about a five-year-old case.

588
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,305
That's fascinating, but I'm here
about a five-year-old case.

589
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,062
Do you know Daisuke Taniguchi?

590
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,316
A man who went by that name is dead.

591
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:01,195
However, he wasn't the real
Daisuke Taniguchi.

592
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,325
Mr. Omiura, you brokered
identity document switches, correct?

593
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,035
Mr. Omiura, you brokered
identity document switches, correct?

594
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,371
Know anything about this man?

595
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,209
The second son of the
lkaho Onsen innkeeper?

596
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,251
The second son of the
lkaho Onsen innkeeper?

597
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,088
Yes! That's right.
You knew him?

598
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,383
I think we're done here today.

599
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,928
I want to know who he switched with.

600
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,599
It wasn't a switch,
it was identity laundering.

601
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,229
Just like dirty money, plenty of folks
want to wash their pasts clean.

602
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,233
Just like dirty money, plenty of folks
want to wash their pasts clean.

603
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,363
Mister lawyer, I bet you hated
being Korean and wanted to switch.

604
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,032
Mister lawyer, I bet you hated
being Korean and wanted to switch.

605
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,915
You're Korean but you don't
come across as Korean. In a nutshell,

606
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,959
You're Korean but you don't
come across as Korean. In a nutshell,

607
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,546
that's what you
Japan-born Koreans are.

608
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,008
We fraudsters blend in well.

609
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,071
“From Norio Omiura”

610
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,495
"Handsome mister lawyer, are your
eyes piss holes? Shit for brains.”

611
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,997
"Handsome mister lawyer, are your
eyes piss holes? Shit for brains.”

612
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,502
"Handsome" is sweet though.

613
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:25,339
Check out her chest.
Her chest.

614
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,342
Oh yeah, I see it now.

615
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,013
"Taniguchi.” "Sonezaki."

616
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,565
Does it mean this "Yoshihiko Sonezaki”
is Mr. X?

617
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,649
Does it mean this "Yoshihiko Sonezaki”
is Mr. X?

618
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,405
These even kick ass frozen.

619
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,742
What a discovery.

620
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,913
" "Daisuke Taniguchi”
"Sonezaki?"

621
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,166
" "Daisuke Taniguchi”
"Sonezaki?"

622
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,719
Yuto!

623
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,224
What's wrong?

624
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,604
Well?

625
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,444
Remember which tree was Dad's?

626
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,155
Yeah. That one, right?

627
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,242
Third one along.
Branches out, like this.

628
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,244
Third one along.
Branches out, like this.

629
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,581
And this one’s mine.
Yeah, this one. And,

630
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,041
And this one’s mine.
Yeah, this one. And,

631
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,752
that one is Hana's.
And,

632
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:48,089
yours is there. You said
you liked that one, didn't you?

633
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,548
Yours is there. You said
you liked that one, didn't you?

634
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,595
You didn't make a grave for him
on his death day this year either.

635
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,264
You didn't make a grave for him
on his death day this year either.

636
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,693
Will my name change again?

637
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,323
I was born a Yoneda.
After the divorce, Takemoto.

638
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,407
I was born a Yoneda.
After the divorce, Takemoto.

639
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,201
Then Taniguchi, like Dad.

640
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,622
Who should I become next?

641
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,636
Yuto...

642
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,732
There's something I've been
keeping a secret from you.

643
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,692
There's something I've been
keeping a secret from you.

644
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,783
Your stepdad...

645
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,663
His name wasn't really
Daisuke Taniguchi.

646
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,830
His name wasn't really
Daisuke Taniguchi.

647
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,878
Even I didn't know that.

648
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,091
After he died...| found out
it wasn't his real name.

649
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,385
After he died...| found out
it wasn't his real name.

650
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,141
So who was he?

651
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,318
Someone's looking into that now.

652
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,282
He used another man's name,

653
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,579
so I've been talking to
a lawyer about it,

654
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,372
so I've been talking to
a lawyer about it,

655
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,126
who's trying to find out all he can.

656
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,170
So? So who was he?

657
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,300
I don't know yet.

658
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,324
Because I don't know yet,
I can't make a grave for him.

659
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,117
Because I don't know yet,
I can't make a grave for him.

660
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,748
We can't put
"Daisuke Taniguchi” on it.

661
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,545
Then...

662
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,138
My name, Yuto Taniguchi...
What about that?

663
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,849
My name, Yuto Taniguchi...
What about that?

664
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,853
The...Taniguchi part of your name...

665
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,729
The...Taniguchi part of your name...

666
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,570
...belongs to someone we don't know.

667
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,574
Mama!

668
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,243
Yeah?

669
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,329
Papa's tree!

670
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:09,665
Take a photo!

671
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,501
A photo? Okay!

672
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,096
Oh, I'll take it.

673
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,183
Yeah? You sure?
You know how?

674
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,976
Yes, with this.

675
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,478
Right here.
The round button.

676
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,521
Yuto!

677
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,983
Oh, it's okay, Mom.
Leave him be.

678
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,445
Here goes. Cheese!

679
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,574
"Art's greatest potential :
Works by death row inmates”

680
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,576
"Art's greatest potential :
Works by death row inmates”

681
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,731
Everything alright?

682
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,653
Aren't these amazing?

683
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,907
I'm speechless.

684
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,747
Till I saw your post on Facebook,

685
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:36,460
I never thought about
death row inmates' art.

686
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:43,509
Art by criminals is...
How can I put it?

687
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,680
I had a vague image of it
as a kind of excuse,

688
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,351
but I was so wrong.

689
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,734
They're not trying to claim innocence.

690
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,325
They're screaming out,
"I'm not like you think I am.”

691
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,701
They're screaming out,
"I'm not like you think I am.”

692
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,505
By the way,
I wanted you to see this.

693
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,557
Is this...

694
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:32,391
"Daisuke Taniguchi”

695
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,393
"Daisuke Taniguchi”
I set this up.

696
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:34,414
"Daisuke Taniguchi”

697
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,398
I pretend to be Daisuke,
and post now and then.

698
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,028
I know what his hobbies are,
and what he'd say, so I use that.

699
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,739
I know what his hobbies are,
and what he'd say, so I use that.

700
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,743
If he sees it,
he'll get in touch.

701
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,871
Trying to draw him out?

702
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,753
I know it's a stupid thing to do.

703
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,799
I wanted to help you somehow.

704
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,764
Our talk show's about to begin,
so please take your seats.

705
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,974
Our talk show's about to begin,
so please take your seats.

706
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,726
It's starting.

707
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,745
She's a hottie.

708
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,835
But a death row art exhibition
as a date spot?

709
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,088
She said she wanted to see it.
This isn't a date.

710
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,798
She said she wanted to see it.
This isn't a date.

711
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,884
Gimme a break.

712
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,555
Don't worry. I'm famously tightlipped.
Wanna touch them?

713
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,890
Don't worry. I'm famously tightlipped.
Wanna touch them?

714
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,433
Jackass.

715
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,812
If you take the stance that
people are incapable of change,

716
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,565
If you take the stance that
people are incapable of change,

717
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:06,735
you validate capital punishment.

718
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,864
But we don't do that. We take
the stance that people can change,

719
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,866
But we don't do that. We take
the stance that people can change,

720
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,994
and have held these art exhibitions
year after year.

721
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,913
And have held these art exhibitions
year after year.

722
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,334
"Those who commit crimes
are unable to be reformed.”

723
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,336
"Those who commit crimes
are unable to be reformed.”

724
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,422
This nation claims that emphatically,
and executes death sentences.

725
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,134
This nation claims that emphatically,
and executes death sentences.

726
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,679
However, it's possible
to take a different view, that

727
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,306
However, it's possible
to take a different view, that

728
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,644
people can change, no matter
what crimes they commit.

729
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,020
People can change, no matter
what crimes they commit.

730
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,941
If we don't adopt that belief,
our society will never be at peace...

731
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,860
If we don't adopt that belief,
our society will never be at peace...

732
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,921
"Kenkichi Kobayashi”

733
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:03,018
Kenkichi Kobayashi?

734
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,604
What's his story?

735
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,523
A gambling addict in debt who broke
into the home of his boss, a builder.

736
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,777
"Murder-robbery suspect arrested” A gambling addict in
debt who broke into the home of his boss, a builder.

737
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,114
The boss, his wife, and young son
were stabbed and burned.

738
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,907
The boss, his wife, and young son
were stabbed and burned.

739
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,994
Instant death sentence.

740
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:24,248
Well, no lawyer could get him off.

741
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,916
He was executed in 2003.

742
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,214
But X got crushed by a tree
and died in Miyazaki, no?

743
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,965
But X got crushed by a tree
and died in Miyazaki, no?

744
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,886
This guy was old enough
to be X's dad.

745
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,764
Right. Old enough to be X's dad.

746
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,269
No way...

747
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,939
This guy had a son.

748
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,608
Get outta here...

749
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,778
Makoto Hara. He ended up
using his mother's surname.

750
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,237
Makoto Hara. He ended up
using his mother's surname.

751
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,822
Raised in an orphanage in Maebashi,

752
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,243
and became a pro boxer.

753
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:10,085
Then who the hell's
that Sonezaki dude?

754
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:15,382
Anyway, if X really was
that death row inmate's son,

755
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:18,093
Anyway, if X really was
that death row inmate's son,

756
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,097
he might've been on the run
from some crime.

757
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,682
Why?

758
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,645
Criminal tendencies aren't genetic,

759
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,816
but home environments sway futures.
We've seen that as lawyers.

760
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,901
But home environments sway futures.
We've seen that as lawyers.

761
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:37,028
It's not like I gotta tell you.

762
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:15,192
Hey, handsome mister lawyer!
Long time no see.

763
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,694
Hey, handsome mister lawyer!
Long time no see.

764
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,654
You seem well.

765
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,950
Pull the other one.
My life's hanging by a thread.

766
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,284
Pull the other one.
My life's hanging by a thread.

767
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,376
Thank you for this.

768
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,379
Got a kick out of it?

769
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,175
When you get to my age,
young nude bodies do nothing for ya.

770
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,887
When you get to my age,
young nude bodies do nothing for ya.

771
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,140
You got a ways to go yet though.

772
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,062
Today, I'd like to ask you about
Makoto Hara.

773
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,776
You know him?

774
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:01,947
Well, my memory"s fuzzy.

775
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,868
You acted as his broker too?

776
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,245
For what?

777
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:15,127
Daisuke Taniguchi ran away
from his family to Osaka.

778
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,336
Daisuke Taniguchi ran away
from his family to Osaka.

779
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,423
You helped him switch identities
with an executed criminal's son.

780
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:22,175
You helped him switch identities
with an executed criminal's son.

781
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,472
I don't follow you,
but it ain't nothing to do with me.

782
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,348
I don't follow you,
but it ain't nothing to do with me.

783
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,811
It seems he was a pro boxer.

784
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,313
Who was?

785
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,363
What I can't figure out is,
who was "Yoshihiko Sonezaki"?

786
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,907
What I can't figure out is,
who was "Yoshihiko Sonezaki"?

787
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,453
Mister lawyer, you really don't
know shit about shit, do ya?

788
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:52,330
Mister lawyer, you really don't
know shit about shit, do ya?

789
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,457
You think so?

790
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:58,170
Your dick's flapping in the wind.
Ain't you ashamed to be alive?

791
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,380
Your dick's flapping in the wind.
Ain't you ashamed to be alive?

792
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,635
You're Korean trash,
but you look down on me?

793
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,678
You're Korean trash,
but you look down on me?

794
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,808
You think I'm just a fraudster.
You don't believe a word I say.

795
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,811
You think I'm just a fraudster.
You don't believe a word I say.

796
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:14,937
You think I'm just a fraudster.
You don't believe a word I say.

797
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,816
You think I'm a bigot,
but it's you who's prejudiced.

798
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:22,778
You think I'm a bigot,
but it's you who's prejudiced.

799
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,907
Prejudiced about what?
You're locked up for fraud!

800
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,575
Prejudiced about what?
You're locked up for fraud!

801
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,833
Want me to fill you in on
what's stupidest about you?

802
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,960
Want me to fill you in on
what's stupidest about you?

803
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,174
How do you know I'm
really Norio Omiura?

804
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,217
How do you know I'm
really Norio Omiura?

805
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,680
Has my face got "Norio Omiura”
written all over it?

806
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,139
Has my face got "Norio Omiura”
written all over it?

807
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:55,185
Even tattooists don't tattoo others
till they tattoo themselves.

808
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:58,813
Even tattooists don't tattoo others
till they tattoo themselves.

809
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,192
You think I ain't ever changed
my identity? You're dumb as shit.

810
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:05,195
You think I ain't ever changed
my identity? You're dumb as shit.

811
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:06,362
You think I ain't ever changed
my identity? You're dumb as shit.

812
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,409
Since you're dumb as shit,
I'll teach you one last thing.

813
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,203
Since you're dumb as shit,
I'll teach you one last thing.

814
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,189
The man you're so eager
to find out about

815
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,690
The man you're so eager
to find out about

816
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,567
ain't worth shit.

817
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,113
You're getting your hopes up,

818
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,201
but kids born to murderers
amount to nothing.

819
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,745
But kids born to murderers
amount to nothing.

820
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,390
Yasushi!
Let's play baseball!

821
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,016
Yasushi!
Let's play baseball!

822
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,901
Dad...

823
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,283
Oh, Makoto.

824
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,875
Here. Buy whatever you want.

825
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,959
Here. Buy whatever you want.

826
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:45,963
Go on.

827
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,354
Boss.

828
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,064
Boss!

829
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:09,212
Makoto came here in spring of 2001.

830
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:13,341
He seemed kinda creepy at first.

831
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:17,054
Morose, and scary.
Honestly, he made me uneasy.

832
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,056
Morose, and scary.
Honestly, he made me uneasy.

833
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:24,019
Why do you think he took up boxing?

834
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,648
He started out on a whim,
apparently.

835
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:33,737
He often peered in
through the front windows.

836
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,446
"Kosuge Boxing Gym”

837
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,658
"Kosuge Boxing Gym” After
a while, he wandered inside.

838
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:38,680
"Kosuge Boxing Gym”

839
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,245
Then, he showed promise?

840
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,834
He didn't know a thing about boxing,

841
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,505
but he was athletic,
and a quick learner.

842
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,881
But he was athletic,
and a quick learner.

843
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,156
Down!

844
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,414
Okay, use the ring to shadow box.

845
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,419
Makoto! Makoto!
Shadow box! Shadow box!

846
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,795
Makoto! Makoto!
Shadow box! Shadow box!

847
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,108
“Mr. Makoto Hara"

848
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:57,654
"Sender : Kenkichi Kobayashi”

849
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,578
A ring name?

850
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,748
Am I not ready?

851
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,835
Why not? Your pro debut's set.
Give yourself a flashy name.

852
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,878
Why not? Your pro debut's set.
Give yourself a flashy name.

853
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,840
No, something low-key.

854
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,717
Why?

855
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,887
How about "Ogata"?
Like Ken Ogata, the actor.

856
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,472
Ogata...

857
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:27,809
Ogata, huh?

858
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,562
Right, like that...

859
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:35,358
Akane. How does "Ogata” sound?
His ring name.

860
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,445
Ogata...

861
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:44,409
First name "Katsutoshi"?
The characters for "victory.”

862
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:45,535
First name "Katsutoshi"?
The characters for "victory.”

863
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,703
I don't know about that.

864
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,955
- Why?
- It's lame.

865
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,623
No, it's cool.

866
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,000
Nah, it's lame. Right?

867
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,628
No... I like it.

868
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,338
You like it?!

869
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,841
Katsutoshi Ogata.

870
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:02,635
It sounds like a regular name.

871
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,678
It's "Victory.”

872
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,598
"Victory"?
Akane, come on.

873
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,560
If he wins, it'll be
"Victory Ogata"s victory.”

874
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,020
Oh, true.

875
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,523
- But it's cool.
- Rethink. Rethink.

876
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:16,774
Uncool. Uncool.

877
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,747
You got him!

878
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,749
Good, good.
Mouthpiece! Good.

879
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:35,752
Good, okay.

880
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,047
Good, good.
You got this. You got this.

881
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,424
Watch for headbutts.

882
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:46,512
Go end this!

883
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,097
Way to go! Way to go!

884
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,476
You did it!
You did it, kid!

885
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,897
Victory Ogata's victory!

886
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,900
You did it!

887
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,909
He's gonna be great,
but his hands are a worry.

888
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,620
He hits so damn hard.

889
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,167
That counter punch was deliberate?

890
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,712
Combining hooks with straights
was the boss's strategy.

891
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,171
Combining hooks with straights
was the boss's strategy.

892
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:03,798
That hook was nice.

893
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,009
It was phenomenal.

894
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,637
Top Rookie is up next.
Any thoughts?

895
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,475
Making the boss and the team happy
would please me most.

896
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,059
Making the boss and the team happy
would please me most.

897
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,978
One last question...

898
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,647
Sorry, can we wrap this up?

899
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,109
Thank you. Congratulations.

900
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,154
We're rooting for you. Bye.

901
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,782
Finished? Got a minute?

902
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,085
He takes after his dad after all

903
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,899
Did you know,
about Makoto Hara's father?

904
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:50,779
Well, it came as a surprise,

905
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:54,534
but parents and kids...
walk different paths, right?

906
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:56,786
But parents and kids...
walk different paths, right?

907
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:02,125
We found out before Makoto was set
to fight for Top Rookie.

908
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,252
We found out before Makoto was set
to fight for Top Rookie.

909
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,756
He said he wanted to pull out. Yeah.

910
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,092
He told me that too.

911
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:15,179
So, the boss asked him why.

912
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,933
Then he opened up about his father.

913
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:27,734
I'm not sure I should be...
out in the spotlight like that.

914
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,944
I'm not sure I should be...
out in the spotlight like that.

915
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:33,448
You won your way there,
on sheer ability alone.

916
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,243
You won your way there,
on sheer ability alone.

917
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,915
To be honest, I don't care
about winning or losing.

918
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,666
To be honest, I don't care
about winning or losing.

919
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,129
I started boxing...
so I could get hit.

920
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,630
I started boxing...
so I could get hit.

921
01:22:56,096 --> 01:23:00,100
When I wake up,
I look in the mirror.

922
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,813
When I do...

923
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,817
...my father's there.

924
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,741
I'm his spitting image.

925
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:24,290
It feels like my father...
is inside me, and...

926
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,292
It feels like my father...
is inside me, and...

927
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:33,216
...I want to rip away at myself...
and tear off my skin.

928
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:35,092
...I want to rip away at myself...
and tear off my skin.

929
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:40,015
So...for me, boxing is about
torturing my body.

930
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,059
So...for me, boxing is about
torturing my body.

931
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:46,479
My body.
That's all I care about.

932
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,814
My body.
That's all I care about.

933
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:57,740
So kid. Tell me.

934
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:01,911
If you feel pain, will that bring
the murder victims back to life?

935
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,413
If you feel pain, will that bring
the murder victims back to life?

936
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,839
Will they come back to life?!
Answer me!

937
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,842
Fine,

938
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,178
I'll hit you then.

939
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:26,185
Why, Boss?!

940
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:27,854
Hey punk!

941
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,317
Some guys only want
to become Top Rookie!

942
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:35,570
They live for that!
Ever thought how they feel?!

943
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,779
They live for that!
Ever thought how they feel?!

944
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:20,281
You know, the boss
rates your ability highly.

945
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,203
I'm sorry.

946
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:37,506
We're your family now,
ain't we?

947
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,917
Today at 8:15,
Kenkichi Kobayashi was executed.

948
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,128
Today at 8:15,
Kenkichi Kobayashi was executed.

949
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,799
If you wish to claim his body,
as his only kin, and son...

950
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,217
If you wish to claim his body,
as his only kin, and son...

951
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,801
I won't.

952
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,972
I won't claim anything of this.

953
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:54,394
From now on, don't contact me
about this again.

954
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,812
From now on, don't contact me
about this again.

955
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:08,842
Hey, what's wrong?

956
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,519
Soon after that,
he had an accident.

957
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:00,603
Soon after that,
he had an accident.

958
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,272
An accident?

959
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:11,321
Fell from a building.
A mall by the station.

960
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,326
He said it was just a careless slip...

961
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,289
...but off a building?

962
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,298
How is your boss?

963
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,011
It all came as a shock.

964
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,642
He's over it now, but he was
depressed for a long time.

965
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:42,269
He's over it now, but he was
depressed for a long time.

966
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,648
He stepped out before, right?

967
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:52,446
It's too hard for him.
Remembering.

968
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:03,416
Hey... Can I ask you something?

969
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:04,833
Sure.

970
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,051
Was it suicide?
Makoto's death.

971
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:20,640
As far as I'm aware,
that's unlikely.

972
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:25,479
Good.

973
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:31,610
He didn't stick with boxing,
did he?

974
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,614
It seems he didn't.

975
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:43,414
There's so much...

976
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,334
...I want to talk to him about.

977
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:01,265
Foreigners, get out of Japan!

978
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,351
Go to Hell!

979
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:10,358
Racial and ethnic
prejudice and discrimination.

980
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,529
Right now, fierce hatred
is being spread through society.

981
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:15,780
Right now, fierce hatred
is being spread through society.

982
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,280
"Hate speech” Right now, fierce
hatred is being spread through society.

983
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,114
"Hate speech”

984
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,117
Filthy rats!

985
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,410
Cockroaches!

986
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,622
They don't deserve welfare!

987
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,253
Sota, keep it down.

988
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,628
I'm home.

989
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,052
Why do we have to have
our livelihoods threatened?

990
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,720
Why do we have to have
our livelihoods threatened?

991
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:42,931
It's infuriating.

992
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,407
Knock it off!

993
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:03,827
What's going on?

994
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:08,707
What happened?

995
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:13,837
Let's go.

996
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,458
I'm sorry.

997
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,673
You're not yourself lately.

998
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:04,179
You're too caught up in your manhunt.

999
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:08,809
I wish you wouldn't
bring that home with you.

1000
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:10,227
I wish you wouldn't
bring that home with you.

1001
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:20,321
What does that man's life
have to do with yours?

1002
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,614
What does that man's life
have to do with yours?

1003
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:28,412
I don't know.

1004
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,917
It just...helps take my mind
off things, for some reason.

1005
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,586
It just...helps take my mind
off things, for some reason.

1006
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:38,588
Chasing another man's life.

1007
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:42,801
The son of an executed criminal?

1008
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:46,346
I don't understand you.

1009
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:48,933
I don't either.

1010
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,770
Running from reality?

1011
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,606
That's low.

1012
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:57,816
Is it?

1013
01:34:58,651 --> 01:34:59,943
Am I to blame?

1014
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,615
You're running from me?

1015
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,496
Of course not.

1016
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:20,506
Just end it soon,
and go back to your old self.

1017
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:21,924
Just end it soon,
and go back to your old self.

1018
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,793
Sorry to take your time.

1019
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,880
Come on in.

1020
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:44,923
Good to see you.

1021
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,095
"Makoto Hara"?

1022
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:56,936
Cutting to the chase,
the man you married

1023
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:00,939
was a good man
who never committed a crime.

1024
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:06,904
Stealing somebody's identity
isn't a crime?

1025
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,825
He wanted our inheritance.

1026
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:19,082
Why switch with
an executed criminal's son?

1027
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,382
How is your brother any different?

1028
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:33,597
He was given the gift of life,
but he didn't want his.

1029
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:35,849
He was given the gift of life,
but he didn't want his.

1030
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,895
He was desperate to abandon
his identity and become a new man.

1031
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:42,814
He was desperate to abandon
his identity and become a new man.

1032
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:46,109
Isn't that how Mr. Taniguchi felt?

1033
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,447
"Become a new man”?

1034
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:54,493
He never stopped being
an executed criminal's son.

1035
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:55,619
He never stopped being
an executed criminal's son.

1036
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,133
I'm sure Mr. Hara gave his all
for a second chance at life.

1037
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,385
I'm sure Mr. Hara gave his all
for a second chance at life.

1038
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:17,057
Some people have to go to extremes
to start over.

1039
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,641
Some people have to go to extremes
to start over.

1040
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:33,448
Daisuke might not be
alive anymore either.

1041
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:55,720
Hi.

1042
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,599
Hi.

1043
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:06,189
What's up?

1044
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:22,581
Now you're starting to think about
things that are beyond me.

1045
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:25,000
Now you're starting to think about
things that are beyond me.

1046
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,813
Our family name...

1047
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:56,906
We have to change it back
to Takemoto.

1048
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,081
I'm sorry.

1049
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:10,087
We can't be a burden on
the real Taniguchis.

1050
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,129
We can't be a burden on
the real Taniguchis.

1051
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:23,766
You know...

1052
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,773
I was sad when Dad died...

1053
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:31,816
I was sad when Dad died...

1054
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:34,569
...but not anymore.

1055
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,953
I just...

1056
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:57,133
I miss him.

1057
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,640
There's so much
I want to tell him, every day...

1058
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,975
There's so much
I want to tell him, every day...

1059
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:13,941
I know.

1060
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:26,622
You really loved your dad,
didn't you?

1061
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:46,183
You really loved him.

1062
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,366
I'm sorry.

1063
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:27,808
"Akira Kido”

1064
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:53,000
"Misuzu Goto” "Daisuke Taniguchi”

1065
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,209
"Misuzu Goto” "Daisuke Taniguchi”

1066
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:07,139
"This is a warning."

1067
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:14,229
"Delete this fake and
fraudulent account immediately.”

1068
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:17,232
"Delete this fake and
fraudulent account immediately.”

1069
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:25,282
Sonezaki...

1070
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:34,041
Want zunda cakes?
Just got back from Sendai.

1071
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,170
Tea...

1072
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,965
I found the real Daisuke Taniguchi.

1073
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:48,013
So, Sonezaki sent a message
to the fake account?

1074
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,889
So, Sonezaki sent a message
to the fake account?

1075
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:53,977
Omiura was telling me the truth.

1076
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:55,228
The truth?

1077
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:58,065
Makoto Hara changed names twice.

1078
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,403
First, he switched identities
with Yoshihiko Sonezaki.

1079
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:05,405
First, he switched identities
with Yoshihiko Sonezaki.

1080
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,533
Later, he switched names again
with Daisuke Taniguchi.

1081
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:10,451
Later, he switched names again
with Daisuke Taniguchi.

1082
01:44:11,703 --> 01:44:15,707
And this guy went to Miyazaki
as Daisuke Taniguchi?

1083
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:20,086
Rewriting his past,
till it became unreadable.

1084
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:27,135
So, where's this dude now?

1085
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:36,645
Nagoya

1086
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,300
Daisuke.

1087
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:06,234
You dumbass!

1088
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,645
Thank you so much.

1089
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:28,733
Investigation Report”

1090
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:35,781
For Makoto Hara,

1091
01:47:37,492 --> 01:47:40,411
three years and nine months with you

1092
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:44,165
surely meant everything to him.

1093
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:49,087
He wasn't with you long,

1094
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:52,507
but I'm sure he was truly happy.

1095
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:57,637
I hope so.

1096
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:12,527
It might be 20/20 hindsight, but...

1097
01:48:18,533 --> 01:48:21,536
...I get the feeling now that maybe,
I never needed to know the truth.

1098
01:48:21,536 --> 01:48:25,331
...I get the feeling now that maybe,
I never needed to know the truth.

1099
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,839
I mean, we met in this town,
fell in love...

1100
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:35,174
I mean, we met in this town,
fell in love...

1101
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:39,470
...became a family...

1102
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:43,558
...had Hana...

1103
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,238
Those truths are crystal clear.

1104
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:28,520
Read it?

1105
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:30,730
Yeah.

1106
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,274
You okay?

1107
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:53,837
Now I know...
why Dad was so kind, I think.

1108
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:56,297
Now I know...
why Dad was so kind, I think.

1109
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:06,933
Why?

1110
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,439
The things he wanted his father
to do for him, he did for me.

1111
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:14,566
The things he wanted his father
to do for him, he did for me.

1112
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:21,656
I guess so.

1113
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:31,916
But that's not all.

1114
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:37,588
More than anything,
he loved you.

1115
01:50:44,262 --> 01:50:46,305
Will you tell Hana?

1116
01:50:57,108 --> 01:50:58,609
What do you think?

1117
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:05,742
I'll tell her.

1118
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,665
I'll tell Hana sometime,
about what kind of father he was.

1119
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:14,417
I'll tell Hana sometime,
about what kind of father he was.

1120
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:30,076
Rei isn't eating at all.

1121
01:52:30,785 --> 01:52:33,788
No Dad. That one's Roa.
This one's Rei.

1122
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:35,748
No Dad. That one's Roa.
This one's Rei.

1123
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:39,043
Huh? Isn't that one Rei?

1124
01:52:39,627 --> 01:52:41,629
This is the real Rei.

1125
01:52:42,088 --> 01:52:44,548
Yeah? Are you sure?

1126
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:48,677
You're so forgetful,
you forgot!

1127
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:49,763
Did I?

1128
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:50,971
I'm home.

1129
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,765
Hi Mommy!

1130
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:54,517
Hi there.

1131
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:56,519
The party dragged on.

1132
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:57,979
Bath's still warm.

1133
01:52:58,104 --> 01:52:59,146
Thanks.

1134
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:00,982
Been busy today?

1135
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:04,819
Daddy knocked over all of those.

1136
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,946
Daddy did? Oh no.

1137
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:09,991
Actually, I did it with that car.

1138
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:13,453
And they were so weak,
they all fell down.

1139
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:15,455
And they were so weak,
they all fell down.

1140
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:18,624
Okay, let's tidy up later.

1141
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,669
Get ready for bed.

1142
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:26,591
What's up?

1143
01:53:28,927 --> 01:53:29,928
Nothing.

1144
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,602
My manhunt's over now.

1145
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:40,772
It is?

1146
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:44,066
That's great.

1147
01:53:47,987 --> 01:53:51,573
Oh, I told Dad
we won't buy that house.

1148
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,578
We'll look if
it gets too cramped here.

1149
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:14,054
Hey, don't do that, it's cold!

1150
01:54:14,138 --> 01:54:15,973
Try this. It's good.

1151
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:17,516
- It's good.
- It is.

1152
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,393
Mommy, that game.

1153
01:54:19,686 --> 01:54:21,854
That game? Which one?

1154
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:23,731
Racer.

1155
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:29,487
You can play,
but only till your food comes.

1156
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:31,739
I lost.

1157
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:34,158
Restroom.

1158
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,208
A car! Yay!

1159
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,587
Daddy, the screen's weird.

1160
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:51,217
Oh, you must've touched something.

1161
01:54:57,807 --> 01:55:00,810
"Thanks for last night! I'm glad
we met. You're unforgettable...”

1162
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,812
"Thanks for last night! I'm glad
we met. You're unforgettable...”

1163
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:09,693
Mom's not back.

1164
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:15,741
Thank you for waiting.
One kids' meal.

1165
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:18,035
Oh, the food's here.

1166
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:21,331
Get me a spoon. A spoon
and a fork. Get them.

1167
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:22,790
Get me a spoon. A spoon
and a fork. Get them.

1168
01:55:22,874 --> 01:55:24,876
Wow, it's quite fancy.

1169
01:55:24,959 --> 01:55:26,126
It's not fancy.

1170
01:55:26,252 --> 01:55:27,127
It is fancy!

1171
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:42,769
Enjoy.

1172
01:55:47,148 --> 01:55:49,733
How old are the trees?

1173
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:55,615
They cut them down
after about 50 years.

1174
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:01,955
And once they become wood,
it lasts for another 50.

1175
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,289
And once they become wood,
it lasts for another 50.

1176
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:08,544
50 years in the mountains,
50 years with humans.

1177
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:12,131
No kidding...

1178
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,262
So, you can't cut down
what you've planted.

1179
01:56:18,262 --> 01:56:19,972
So, you can't cut down
what you've planted.

1180
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:24,685
I guess...
I liked the sound of it.

1181
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:27,146
Of things being passed on.

1182
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:32,151
What fathers plant,
their sons cut down.

1183
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:36,238
Oh, you have children?

1184
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:37,824
I do.

1185
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:39,575
Grown up?

1186
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:43,120
One's 4,
and the other's 13.

1187
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,247
Two.

1188
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:52,171
You're from a different prefecture?

1189
01:56:52,714 --> 01:56:53,798
Yeah.

1190
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,803
From Gunma originally.
You know, lkaho Onsen?

1191
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:00,137
From Gunma originally.
You know, lkaho Onsen?

1192
01:57:00,304 --> 01:57:02,639
Oh yeah, it's famous.

1193
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,683
My family runs an inn.

1194
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:09,939
But my big brother took over,
so I left.

1195
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:11,607
But my big brother took over,
so I left.

1196
01:57:14,569 --> 01:57:17,572
I would've stayed.
I mean, hot spring baths every day?

1197
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:20,283
I would've stayed.
I mean, hot spring baths every day?

1198
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:25,455
Well, my family and I
never got along anyway,

1199
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:27,081
Well, my family and I
never got along anyway,

1200
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:30,584
and it brought me together
with my wife.

1201
01:57:31,961 --> 01:57:34,338
Living your own way is best.

1202
01:57:35,089 --> 01:57:38,050
It's nobody's life but your own.

1203
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:41,720
That's so true.

1204
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:46,017
I never want to let go
of the life I have now...

1205
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,685
I never want to let go
of the life I have now...

1206
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:54,942
I'd better go.

1207
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:57,194
Hey, check please.

1208
01:57:57,987 --> 01:58:00,698
We talked so much,
for strangers.

1209
01:58:00,823 --> 01:58:02,741
I really enjoyed it.

1210
01:58:02,825 --> 01:58:03,909
Let's swap cards.

1211
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,049
I'm Suzuki.

1212
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:21,052
Sorry, I'm out of cards.

1213
01:58:21,135 --> 01:58:22,219
No problem.

1214
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:23,679
I'm...
