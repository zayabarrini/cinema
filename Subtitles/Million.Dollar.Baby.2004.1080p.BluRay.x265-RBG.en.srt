1
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:47,999
Do it!

2
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,519
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,919
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

4
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,719
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,679
Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,799
<i>When I met him, he was already
the best out man in the business.</i>

7
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,199
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:21,719
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

9
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,479
No.

10
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,879
Let me have a look at him.

11
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,719
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,239
He ain't if you don't
stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,999
I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,079
- Seconds out. Let's go.
- What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,239
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,799
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,839
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

18
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,599
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,519
<i>...or you just can't get
the coagulant deep enough.</i>

20
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,079
- Come on!
- Break. Break.

21
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,919
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

22
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,359
<i>...down in the different layers of meat...</i>

23
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,439
<i>...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

24
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,239
- That's it! Come on!
- What are you doing?

25
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,599
Knock him out, Willie!

26
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,639
Get on him!

27
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,079
<i>People love violence.</i>

28
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,639
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

29
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:46,079
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

30
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,599
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

31
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,279
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

32
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,279
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

33
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,759
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

34
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,159
I'll warm up the car.

35
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,719
Mr. Dunn?

36
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,919
I owe you money?

37
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,319
No, sir.

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,999
I know your mama?

39
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,319
Don't rightly know, sir.

40
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,959
- Then what is it you want?
- I was on the undercard.

41
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,719
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

42
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,439
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

43
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,999
- Did you happen to see it?
- Nope.

44
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,599
I did pretty good.

45
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,239
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

46
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,159
I don't train girls.

47
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,799
Maybe you should.
People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

48
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,839
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

49
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
It's a mistake.

50
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,199
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

51
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
Just push, will you?

52
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,679
- What did Hogan want?
- Offered us a title shot.

53
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,719
About time.

54
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,839
I turned him down flat.

55
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,439
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

56
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,879
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

57
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,479
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

58
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

59
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,639
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

60
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,479
Whatever you say, Frankie.

61
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,479
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

62
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,759
<i>...that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

63
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,999
<i>Sometimes...</i>

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,919
<i>...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

65
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,359
Well, do your best, Lord...

66
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,719
...protect Katy.

67
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,399
Annie too.

68
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,839
Other than that...

69
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,999
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

70
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,039
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

71
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,639
- Bye.
- Bye.

72
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,439
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

73
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,039
What's confusing you this week?

74
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,679
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

75
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,119
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

76
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,759
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

77
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,159
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

78
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,079
The only reason you come to Mass
every day is to wind me up.

79
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,319
- It won't happen this morning.
- I'm confused.

80
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,799
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

81
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,159
There's one God.

82
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,799
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

83
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,799
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- He's an expression of God's love.

84
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,559
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.

85
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,079
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

86
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,639
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

87
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,959
- Did you write your daughter?
- Absolutely.

88
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,679
Now you're lying to a priest.

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,439
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

90
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,999
<i>Some people would say the most
important thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

91
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,999
<i>Frankie would say,
"Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart...</i>

92
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,319
<i>...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating."</i>

93
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,119
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

94
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,999
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

95
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,039
...out of Broward County, Texas!

96
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,559
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

97
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:22,439
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

98
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,639
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

99
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:32,679
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

100
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,599
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

101
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,999
Well, that's nice to hear.

102
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:47,759
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

103
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,559
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

104
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,399
...niggers or not.

105
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,199
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

106
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,639
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

107
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,999
<i>...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

108
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,199
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

109
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,359
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

110
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,239
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

111
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,519
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

112
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,319
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

113
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,319
You gotta have at least one
fight to be ranked.

114
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,799
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

115
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,919
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

116
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,119
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

117
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
- Shawrelle.
- I will.

118
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,519
Leave him alone.

119
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,999
Danger, you go on back to training.

120
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,879
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

121
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:43,999
OW!

122
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,439
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

123
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,679
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

124
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,159
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

125
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,999
Give his mama back her tights.

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,959
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

127
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,159
<i>...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

128
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:05,559
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

129
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,999
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

130
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,759
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

131
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,359
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

132
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,599
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

133
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,359
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

134
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,399
Well, he's hurting me.

135
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,759
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

136
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:31,399
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

137
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:35,199
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

138
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,159
It smells better, Frankie.

139
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,879
Bleach smells like bleach.

140
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,119
- Hey, Scrap.
- Hey, Mr. Willie.

141
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
Hey, nice fight last night.

142
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,519
Nice fight.

143
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,519
- Big Willie.
- Hey, Sally.

144
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,279
- Nice fight.
- Thanks, man.

145
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,119
People are talking.

146
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,799
What the hell kind of language is that?

147
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,759
What do you want?

148
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,239
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

149
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,119
...not talking to another manager.

150
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,639
Not talking to another manager?

151
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,439
And not just any manager.

152
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,239
Mickey Mack.

153
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,359
You came in here to tell me that
Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

154
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,959
Not a word. Neither one of them.

155
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,199
I'm trying to read here.

156
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,639
Well, if you think that's more important.

157
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,479
Who's your new girl?

158
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,399
What?

159
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,999
Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,479
Better hurry up.

161
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,479
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

162
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,679
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

163
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,439
Thought you might change your mind.

164
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,679
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

165
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,359
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

166
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,119
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

167
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,999
- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.

168
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,119
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

169
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,439
No.

170
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,519
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

171
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,839
<i>She came from
southwestern Missouri...</i>

172
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,039
<i>...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

173
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,239
<i>...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

174
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,519
<i>She was trash.</i>

175
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,839
It's for my dog.

176
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,559
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

177
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,319
Working the bag, boss.

178
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,679
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

179
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,639
Give her her money back.

180
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,279
You sure?

181
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,439
- How much did she pay?
- Six months.

182
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,959
- Jesus Christ.
- No, I'll give it back.

183
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,559
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

184
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,359
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

185
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,799
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

186
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,559
- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- Okay.

187
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,559
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

188
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,279
Looks like a bottle of water.

189
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,759
He paid his dues?

190
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:57,479
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

191
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,519
Get out of my office.

192
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,479
Fuck me.

193
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,199
Can't think of it as a bag.

194
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,879
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

195
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,159
Appreciate any help I can get.

196
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,639
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

197
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,079
And he's constantly moving.

198
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:20,719
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

199
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,439
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

200
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:28,919
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

201
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,639
So you watch him real carefully.

202
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,119
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

203
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,039
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

204
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,959
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

205
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,319
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

206
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,399
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

207
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,239
- Good, good, good.
- Like that?

208
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,839
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

209
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,439
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

210
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,439
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

211
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,399
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

212
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,359
You do have a speed bag.

213
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,999
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

214
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,799
All right, you go on home now.

215
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,799
- I'll walk out with you?
- No, I am home.

216
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,159
- Wanna see?
- Yeah.

217
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,479
It's nice.

218
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,479
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

219
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,039
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

220
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,039
Thank you.

221
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,919
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

222
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,719
<i>...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

223
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,159
<i>...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

224
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,159
<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

225
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,879
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

226
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,879
Hey, that's it. That's it.

227
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:53,959
Hands up.

228
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,959
Jab, jab, jab.

229
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,399
Hey, Flip.

230
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,719
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

231
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,479
I think I found somebody you can beat.

232
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,719
I don't fights women.

233
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,239
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

234
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,039
Because she...
Like, you, you could fight to him...

235
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,879
...and then you could kiss to him.

236
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,719
Then you fight to him one more time.

237
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,599
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

238
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,199
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

239
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,919
- Thanks, bro.
- That's a girl, man?

240
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,559
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

241
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,399
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

242
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,199
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

243
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:53,279
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

244
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,199
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

245
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:14,079
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

246
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:19,519
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

247
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,679
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

248
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,559
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

249
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,119
Some titties right there, man.

250
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,199
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

251
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,879
Punk.

252
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,959
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

253
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,479
- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.

254
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:47,679
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

255
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,999
- Something wrong with Gracie's car?
- She hates that car.

256
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,479
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

257
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,319
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

258
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,159
I'd appreciate that.

259
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,679
Okay.

260
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,639
- Thanks.
- See you later.

261
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,839
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

262
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,799
You ever do any work around here?

263
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:21,279
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

264
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,599
Little girl seems to be coming along.

265
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,759
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

266
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:36,719
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

267
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,999
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

268
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,919
I wonder how the hell she got that.

269
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,639
I wonder.

270
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,639
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

271
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,359
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

272
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,359
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

273
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,079
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

274
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:08,239
Yes. Yes, it is.

275
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,559
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

276
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:15,079
- I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
- Yeah.

277
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,879
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

278
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,399
I understand.

279
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:22,679
Yeah.

280
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,439
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

281
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,599
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

282
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,679
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

283
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,919
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

284
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,279
It's the latest freak show out there.

285
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,839
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

286
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,679
...because you're too old.

287
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,359
I don't feel that old.

288
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,079
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

289
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:52,719
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

290
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,999
How old are you?

291
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,039
- Thirty-one until my next birthday.
- Oh, well, there you go.

292
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,759
Thirty-one.

293
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,639
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

294
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,719
Already been working it
for three years.

295
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,599
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

296
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,599
Never had any, boss.

297
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,999
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

298
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,319
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

299
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:21,479
I hate to be the one
to tell you the truth.

300
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,239
Yeah.

301
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,519
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

302
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,439
- You're not gonna cry now, are you?
- No, sir.

303
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,559
Yeah.

304
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,239
Here.

305
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,839
- Keep the goddamn thing.
- No, you need it.

306
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,799
No, take the bag.

307
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,119
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

308
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,679
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

309
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,519
- I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
- Yeah.

310
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,079
Just don't lose it.

311
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,239
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

312
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,199
...your guy's the Champ,
so we don't split 50s...

313
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,119
...but if I don't see 40 percent...

314
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,799
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

315
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,599
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, Frankie.

316
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,359
Something wrong?

317
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,399
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

318
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

319
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,959
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

320
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,959
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

321
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,359
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

322
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,359
Gracie cried when she saw it.

323
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,239
Really?

324
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,319
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

325
00:23:56,479 --> 00:24:00,519
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

326
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,519
Everything but the split.

327
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,559
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

328
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
What?

329
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,759
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

330
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,159
It ain't that, it's...
It's like you said, I got one shot.

331
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,279
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

332
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,239
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

333
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,039
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

334
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:33,599
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

335
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:37,639
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

336
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,079
Only way he'd do it.

337
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,799
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

338
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,439
I wish it could've been with me.

339
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,279
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

340
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,279
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

341
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:05,799
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

342
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,439
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

343
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,919
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

344
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,799
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

345
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,959
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

346
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:37,679
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

347
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,519
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

348
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,919
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit
it hard for you, Mr. Scrap.

349
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,199
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

350
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,519
I heard about Willie.

351
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,879
That's cold. That's dead cold.

352
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,039
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

353
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,119
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

354
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,799
Mm-hmm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

355
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,039
Well, I've got the gym.

356
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:29,639
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

357
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,199
Uh-huh.

358
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,279
Willie tell you why?

359
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:36,359
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

360
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,839
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

361
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,719
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

362
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,879
How's that for not believing in him?

363
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,399
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

364
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,719
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

365
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:54,119
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

366
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,199
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

367
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,719
Not protect him?

368
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:01,239
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

369
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,919
- Yeah.
- Well, now it makes sense.

370
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:08,679
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

371
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,079
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

372
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

373
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:18,199
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

374
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,479
I had my shot.

375
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,279
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

376
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,639
Yeah, well, I remember.

377
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,599
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

378
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,959
- ...cleaning up other people's spit.
- Yeah, right.

379
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,279
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

380
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,439
It's Gaelic.

381
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,799
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

382
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,759
How do you say that in Gaelic?

383
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,279
Oops. Sorry.

384
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:02,879
Thanks.

385
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:07,279
<i>The action continues as the
champ is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

386
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,479
<i>...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

387
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,319
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left...</i>

388
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,959
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

389
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:19,479
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

390
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,399
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

391
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,919
<i>...you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

392
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,559
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

393
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:35,719
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

394
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,319
<i>...you step into it.</i>

395
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,359
<i>But Big Willie comes back.</i>

396
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,839
<i>Oh, my God, he hits the champ
with a right hand.</i>

397
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,399
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

398
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,919
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

399
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,439
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

400
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,279
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

401
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:58,359
<i>...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

402
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,439
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

403
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:20,359
Want a cheeseburger?

404
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,319
- You bought me a Cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

405
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,559
I never see you buy anybody
a Cheeseburger.

406
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:27,759
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

407
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,999
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

408
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,119
- You watch the fight?
- Yeah, I watched it.

409
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,599
Willie did good.

410
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,319
That's what you've got to say?

411
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,119
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

412
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,479
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

413
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,399
You watch it?

414
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:53,759
Yeah, I got HBO.

415
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,079
Now, how can you afford HBO?

416
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:01,079
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

417
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:03,799
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

418
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,119
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

419
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,999
- That true?
- Yeah.

420
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,839
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

421
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,359
Don't you remember nothing?

422
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,959
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

423
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,999
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

424
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:26,679
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

425
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,359
I had to walk back two miles.

426
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,679
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

427
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,039
What the hell's that?

428
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,519
It's her birthday.

429
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,879
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

430
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,879
So it's your birthday, huh?

431
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,319
How old does that make you?

432
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,359
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

433
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,119
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

434
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:20,239
...which is what I been doing since 13.

435
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:25,439
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

436
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,359
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

437
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,759
...I now realize may
be God's simple truth.

438
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,039
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

439
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:36,799
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

440
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:39,559
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

441
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,999
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

442
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:47,599
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

443
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,559
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

444
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,719
If I'm too old for this,
then I got nothing.

445
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,399
That enough truth to suit you?

446
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,879
This your speed bag?

447
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,039
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

448
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,519
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

449
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:12,839
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

450
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,639
No, sorry.

451
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,279
- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir.

452
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:21,479
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

453
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,719
I seen you looking at me.

454
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,799
- Yeah, out of pity.
- Don't you say that.

455
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:30,839
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

456
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,759
I want a trainer.

457
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,799
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

458
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,319
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

459
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,799
Stop, stop, stop.

460
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:52,999
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

461
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,319
Okay.

462
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,079
If I'm gonna take you on...

463
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:03,759
- You won't never regret it.
- Look, just listen to me.

464
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,759
- If I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.

465
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,359
God, this is a mistake already.

466
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,159
Mm-mm.

467
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,919
I'm listening, boss.

468
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,359
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

469
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:22,519
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

470
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,839
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

471
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:27,199
That's all I ask.

472
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,879
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

473
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,679
- Alrighty.
- We got a deal.

474
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,999
No, not quite.

475
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,119
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

476
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:39,999
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

477
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,759
- I hate to argue with you, but...
- Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

478
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,719
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

479
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,799
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

480
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,199
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

481
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,879
It's the only way I'll do it.

482
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,319
All right.

483
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:11,399
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

484
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,919
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

485
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,239
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

486
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,239
So here's what you do.

487
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,879
You get yourself...
Bend your knees a little bit.

488
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:26,919
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

489
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:32,199
- Move them how, boss?
- Just... Go... Hit the bag.

490
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,839
- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?

491
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,199
Okay, you did two things wrong.

492
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,679
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

493
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:46,039
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

494
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,119
...it's how good you hit it. 80 watch me.

495
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,959
You can count with me if you want.

496
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,959
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

497
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
- Can you show me that again?
- I just...

498
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,279
Just say "one," please.

499
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,959
- One.
- Okay.

500
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,959
- One. Okay.
- One.

501
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,279
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

502
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:11,119
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

503
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,479
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

504
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,039
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

505
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,759
And ice pick maneuver again.

506
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,999
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

507
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,319
Don't watch anything but my feet.

508
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:47,239
Just do it like that.
Just keep practicing.

509
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,199
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

510
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,279
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

511
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,919
Rest when you're dead.

512
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,759
Come here.

513
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:43,919
<i>You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

514
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,199
<i>...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

515
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,519
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

516
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,759
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

517
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,159
Move your feet.

518
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,319
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

519
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,599
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

520
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:23,479
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

521
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

522
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:35,119
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

523
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,639
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

524
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,479
<i>Then you gotta show
them all over again.</i>

525
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,799
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

526
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:53,959
<i>...till they think they
were born that way.</i>

527
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,959
Shift.

528
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,039
Shift away.

529
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,279
Okay. That's enough for today.

530
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:06,839
Good work. Good girl.

531
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,799
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

532
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,799
Hey. Hey, come here.

533
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,839
You're not breathing.

534
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,199
Hate to disagree with you.

535
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,639
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

536
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:51,239
- Now, stop doing that.
- Okay.

537
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,679
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

538
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,799
- I mean, for a girl.
- I don't train girls.

539
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,759
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

540
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:06,439
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

541
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,679
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

542
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,319
- Got any family, boss?
- What?

543
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:25,239
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

544
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,479
No.

545
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,519
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

546
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,559
That's family.

547
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,399
We're not exactly close.

548
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,319
How much she weigh?

549
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,919
What?

550
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,239
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

551
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,239
Yeah.

552
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,599
Not very big.

553
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:54,879
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

554
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,439
So, what do you think?

555
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,519
I ready for a fight?

556
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:14,119
Hey, Sally.

557
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,239
Come here for a minute, will you?

558
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,959
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

559
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,959
- Can I see you a minute?
- Sally here's a real good manager.

560
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,079
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

561
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,199
I'm looking for a good one.

562
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,559
Well, see, there you go.

563
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,079
Nice working with you, girlie.

564
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,319
- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

565
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:50,639
I ain't lying, I've been watching
you work. You got a hell of a left.

566
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,399
Thank you.

567
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,999
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

568
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,319
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

569
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,999
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

570
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,719
Break.

571
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,079
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

572
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:26,959
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

573
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,439
- I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
- You're wearing her down.

574
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,919
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

575
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:37,519
- Come on.
- Do it.

576
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,239
Come on, let's do this!

577
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:45,679
That's it!

578
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:54,719
Nice night, eh?

579
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,839
Jesus Christ.

580
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:59,879
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

581
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,839
Hell of a fighter.

582
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,039
11-0.

583
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,199
Your left. Keep your left up.

584
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,039
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

585
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:16,399
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

586
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,079
Yeah.

587
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,239
Your left, damn it.

588
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,839
Wouldn't have been my choice for her
first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

589
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:28,759
- He must think she can take her.
- Jesus H.

590
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:31,519
Your left. Keep your left up.

591
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,959
You think she can hear you
from back here?

592
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,759
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

593
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,919
Might even help him.

594
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,999
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

595
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,759
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

596
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,359
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

597
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:58,919
Hey, what do I know?

598
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,839
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

599
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,599
Mother of God.

600
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:06,959
Okay, break.

601
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,479
Hey. Come here, come here.

602
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,079
Hey. Get over here.

603
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:14,079
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

604
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:16,959
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

605
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,559
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

606
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,639
Dunn.

607
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,279
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking. What are you doing?

608
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,399
- Is this your fighter?
- It's my fighter.

609
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:30,959
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

610
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,279
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

611
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:38,799
- Somebody tell me what's going on.
- I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

612
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:41,439
You telling me this is your fighter?

613
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,999
Yeah, this is my fighter.

614
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,879
Then you got 10 seconds.

615
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,319
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

616
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:53,559
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

617
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,919
She thinks she knows you.

618
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,119
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

619
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,519
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

620
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,679
- When she cocks that right hand... You hear?
- I hear you, boss.

621
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:07,839
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

622
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:09,359
- Got one?
- Got it right here.

623
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,319
- Okay.
- Fight, or I'm calling it.

624
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:15,479
- Go give it to her.
- <i>The body knows What fighters don't.</i>

625
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,839
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

626
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:19,839
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

627
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,199
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

628
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,519
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing."</i>

629
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,519
Neutral corner.

630
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:32,879
- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.

631
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,039
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

632
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,839
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses."</i>

633
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:44,199
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

634
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:48,079
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

635
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,199
Thanks, boss.

636
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:52,919
You... You forgot the rule.

637
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,559
- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?

638
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,679
It's to protect yourself at all times.

639
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,799
Now, what is the rule?

640
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,319
- Protect myself at all times.
- Good, good.

641
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:06,719
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

642
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,559
It wasn't.

643
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,199
It's okay.

644
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:16,759
- I'll work on my left, boss.
- Drink your water.

645
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,519
Other than that, how'd I do?

646
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,839
Fine. You did fine.

647
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,319
You gonna leave me again?

648
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,159
Never.

649
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:33,719
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

650
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:36,879
- Sure.
- Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

651
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,759
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

652
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,279
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

653
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,119
- You gonna argue with me?
- Know better than to do that, boss.

654
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,519
Well, good.

655
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,359
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

656
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,239
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

657
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:04,679
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

658
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:10,119
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

659
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,279
<i>...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

660
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:18,319
<i>...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

661
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:21,759
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
- You sure did, boss.

662
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:23,639
That was last night.

663
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,639
You said not to argue with you.

664
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:40,759
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

665
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,879
You want my advice?

666
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:44,479
What?

667
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:46,959
Where are your shoes?

668
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,319
I'm airing out my feet.

669
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,919
You got big holes in your socks.

670
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:56,959
Oh, they're not that big.

671
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,999
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

672
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:04,359
These are my sleeping socks.

673
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,359
My feet like a little air at night.

674
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,199
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

675
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,359
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

676
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,199
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

677
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,199
Please?

678
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,359
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

679
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,519
Might find its way to the track.

680
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:52,239
It's over. It's over.

681
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,759
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

682
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,639
I got the breathing thing down.

683
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:26,399
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

684
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,119
- Thought that was the point.
- The point is to get good.

685
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:33,319
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

686
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:35,679
How am I gonna get you fights?

687
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:39,759
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

688
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,599
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

689
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,359
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

690
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,759
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

691
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:54,999
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

692
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:58,279
<i>...just to let her know who was boss.</i>

693
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,319
Three, four, five...

694
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:07,639
...six, seven...

695
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,399
Sorry, boss.

696
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,639
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

697
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,799
All right, let's do it.

698
00:50:24,919 --> 00:50:28,919
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

699
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,519
Get up!

700
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:47,359
To your corner.

701
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,679
- Three, four, five...
- Get up.

702
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,079
- ...six, seven...
- Get up.

703
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:56,319
- ...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
- You can do this.

704
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,039
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

705
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:06,359
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

706
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,439
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

707
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,679
<i>...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

708
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,159
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

709
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,439
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

710
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,679
<i>He took a chance.</i>

711
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,199
Box.

712
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,039
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

713
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:51,079
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

714
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,359
Watch the right!

715
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,919
Watch it. Watch it.

716
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:20,679
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

717
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,759
Damn, damn, damn.

718
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,679
Give us two seconds, will you?

719
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,599
- Okay.
- Just two seconds.

720
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:40,639
- Your nose is broke.
- Oh, damn.

721
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:42,559
- Fix it.
- I can't, I can't.

722
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,239
- You can fix it.
- I can't. I've gotta call it.

723
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,279
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

724
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,519
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

725
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:52,239
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

726
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:55,639
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

727
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,959
Bite down on this.

728
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,239
- Inhale.
- What?

729
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:22,359
Breathe in.

730
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:36,359
- Okay, huh?
- Yeah, it's okay.

731
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,679
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

732
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,039
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

733
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,359
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

734
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:46,279
Now get going.

735
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,879
Go to your corner.

736
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,799
Three, four, five...

737
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:08,679
- Come on, breathe. Breathe.
- ...six, seven, eight...

738
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,279
...nine, ten.

739
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:15,839
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

740
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,119
- All right!
- Yeah!

741
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:26,399
Right.

742
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,359
What you reading?

743
00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:34,519
What's she saying?

744
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,399
Wants to know what you're reading.

745
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,479
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

746
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:43,359
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

747
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,159
Show her what a treat that is.

748
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:48,719
When the hell they gonna get to her?

749
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:51,119
I'm okay, Frankie.

750
00:54:51,879 --> 00:54:54,839
- What'd you learn tonight?
- Always protect myself.

751
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:58,079
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

752
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:00,159
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.

753
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,639
I'll be right here.

754
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,079
- How you doing'?
- Me? -

755
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:23,199
- Yeah, you.
- I'm not the one who's hurt.

756
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,879
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

757
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:32,919
Why are you telling me that?

758
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,479
No reason.

759
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,799
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

760
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,639
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

761
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:49,199
- Did you write your daughter?
- Every week.

762
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,719
I've no idea why you come to church.

763
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:29,639
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

764
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:34,799
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

765
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,359
<i>...for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

766
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,079
<i>--Billie "The Blue Bear."</i>

767
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:44,359
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

768
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,759
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

769
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,599
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

770
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,399
<i>...that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

771
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,519
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

772
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:20,399
<i>He turned it down
Without even telling her.</i>

773
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,879
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

774
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,319
<i>- ...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.</i>
- Hello?

775
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,119
Not interested.

776
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:34,559
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

777
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,999
That's a lot of money, boss.

778
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:42,639
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

779
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,519
It's a title match, right?

780
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:47,679
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

781
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,199
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

782
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:54,559
Might still be a good fight.

783
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,279
Yeah, I just... I just brought you up
to welterweight.

784
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:01,919
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

785
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,039
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

786
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:09,039
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

787
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,039
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

788
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:15,759
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

789
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,639
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

790
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,479
No, you can't work
here anymore tonight.

791
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,319
I made us a reservation.

792
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:01,119
You might wanna shower.

793
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:26,639
Here you go.

794
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:28,879
What's this?

795
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,319
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

796
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:34,319
Go on and blow.

797
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,959
Thank you.

798
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,559
Thirty-three ain't so old.

799
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,119
I was still fighting at 39.

800
00:59:52,439 --> 00:59:54,959
Fought for 23 years.

801
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:00,399
How's it going, Scrap?

802
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,239
Doing good, Mickey.

803
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:05,079
Doing good.

804
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:09,039
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

805
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,799
You two not speaking?

806
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,439
Don't hardly know him.

807
01:00:24,439 --> 01:00:28,599
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

808
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:32,239
He was picking up out work.

809
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,879
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

810
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,239
Good man to have in your corner.

811
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,119
Yes, he is.

812
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,879
He stayed with me through
my last fight in San Berdu.

813
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,119
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

814
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,119
...and it was just Frankie and me.

815
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:00,839
I was taking a hellacious beating.

816
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:05,639
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

817
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:09,239
Nobody tells you what that number is.

818
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,839
Mine was 109.

819
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:15,719
I just didn't want to admit it.

820
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,799
Fourth round, this...

821
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,999
...cut opens up.

822
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:25,239
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

823
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:31,119
They should've stopped the fight, but,
he”, I was a black man in San Berdu.

824
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:33,479
Blood was what I was there for.

825
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,919
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

826
01:01:38,479 --> 01:01:40,479
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

827
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:43,999
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

828
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,159
Round after round...

829
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:49,799
...he's arguing with me.

830
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:55,279
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

831
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,679
I go 15 rounds...

832
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,079
...lose by decision.

833
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:04,119
Next morning, I lose the eye.

834
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,159
In 23 years,
he's never said a thing about it.

835
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:15,159
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

836
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,799
Somehow...

837
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:21,439
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

838
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,639
...should've saved my eye.

839
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:30,959
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

840
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:34,719
I wanted to go to 110.

841
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,359
Thing is...

842
01:02:37,959 --> 01:02:39,799
...if you wanna get to the title...

843
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,799
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

844
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,159
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

845
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,559
You go on, eat your cupcake.

846
01:02:56,759 --> 01:02:59,439
No, I got it.

847
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,399
<i>It's the rule.</i>

848
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,959
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

849
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:12,399
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

850
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,599
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

851
01:03:21,919 --> 01:03:23,879
Mr. Mickey Mack?

852
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,399
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

853
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:32,439
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

854
01:03:32,879 --> 01:03:35,959
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

855
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:39,879
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

856
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:44,279
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

857
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:52,199
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

858
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:29,239
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

859
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,639
<i>"Return to sender."</i>

860
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:03,719
I'll make you some coffee.

861
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:07,319
What are you doing with your money?

862
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:10,039
- Saving it.
- Good girl.

863
01:05:11,879 --> 01:05:15,239
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

864
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:16,759
Cash, no mortgage.

865
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:19,519
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

866
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:25,839
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

867
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:28,639
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

868
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,079
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

869
01:05:32,439 --> 01:05:33,879
You understand?

870
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,999
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

871
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,159
Okay, soon as I get the money.

872
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,399
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.
I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.

873
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:46,479
I know, boss.

874
01:05:47,799 --> 01:05:50,239
- I'm not gonna live forever.
- What is it?

875
01:05:50,399 --> 01:05:53,079
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

876
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,599
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to... Hey.

877
01:05:56,759 --> 01:05:59,439
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

878
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,279
- Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

879
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:06,839
You're welcome, darling. Here, just...
Here, let me put this in the machine.

880
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:09,039
What machine?

881
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:11,239
Don't have a TV, huh?

882
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:13,159
No.

883
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,599
Yeah!

884
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:18,759
All right. Okay.

885
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:27,359
- Ten minutes, love.
- Thank you.

886
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:29,119
Man says he loves me.

887
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:31,359
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

888
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:33,799
First since my daddy.

889
01:06:34,399 --> 01:06:36,079
I win, you think he'll propose?

890
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:38,599
You win, I'll propose.

891
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,319
Look, I got you a gift here.

892
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,359
I think they gave you somebody else's.

893
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,479
No, no, this is it.

894
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:55,999
What's it mean?

895
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:59,999
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

896
01:07:00,959 --> 01:07:04,639
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, I thought so.

897
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:06,639
- Yeah.
- Real silk thread.

898
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,599
From the United
States of America, the challenger...

899
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:18,079
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

900
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,959
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>
Did you see what was on her robe?

901
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,399
<i>- Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
- Mo cuishle.</i>

902
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:30,479
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

903
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,319
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

904
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,679
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

905
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:39,839
<i>...they couldn't tell you
who else fought that night.</i>

906
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,639
Box.

907
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:09,719
- Come on!
<i>- Mo cuishle!</i>

908
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:14,559
<i>Mo cuishle!
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

909
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,399
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

910
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:19,799
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

911
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,679
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

912
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,199
She's tough.

913
01:08:36,919 --> 01:08:39,319
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

914
01:08:39,519 --> 01:08:41,959
- You know why that is?
- Why?

915
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:44,319
She's a better fighter than you are,
that's why.

916
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:48,599
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

917
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:50,959
...what are you gonna do about it?

918
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,119
Get in there.

919
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:03,119
Box.

920
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:21,519
Three, four, five, six...

921
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,759
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

922
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:31,119
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

923
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:41,599
<i>- Mo cuishle!
- Mo cuishle!</i>

924
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:50,959
I could ask someone, you know?

925
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,839
Good.

926
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:55,039
You find out, you let me know.

927
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:05,039
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

928
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,799
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

929
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:12,799
<i>It was always</i> mo cuishle.

930
01:10:12,999 --> 01:10:15,359
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

931
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:17,839
<i>...or people who wanna be.</i>

932
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,759
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

933
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:24,679
<i>...Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

934
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:45,039
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

935
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:59,319
<i>After that they got another
offer to fight for the title.</i>

936
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,559
What's the split?

937
01:11:04,119 --> 01:11:06,559
- Sixty-forty.
- Good.

938
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,679
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

939
01:11:10,879 --> 01:11:12,559
That little girl?

940
01:11:12,999 --> 01:11:16,319
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

941
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,279
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

942
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:23,519
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

943
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:26,279
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

944
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,399
There you go.

945
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,479
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

946
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:41,959
How's that girl doing?

947
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,279
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

948
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,399
She be all right?

949
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:51,439
- And if she isn't?
- Maybe I should send her something.

950
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:55,799
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

951
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:02,559
Boss?

952
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:04,639
That little house we talked about?

953
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,439
I bought it.

954
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:09,479
Well, smart girl.

955
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:13,959
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

956
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:16,239
No mortgage, just like you said.

957
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:20,599
You're a good daughter.

958
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,319
She don't know about it yet.

959
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:26,999
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

960
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,159
I know she wants to meet you.

961
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:34,319
Yeah, we could do that.

962
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:54,559
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

963
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,919
Mary M's here.

964
01:13:13,999 --> 01:13:18,039
- This is the Johnsons' old house.
- Not anymore.

965
01:13:21,759 --> 01:13:25,559
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

966
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,559
- Mary M., you bought this for me?
- Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

967
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:31,399
Darling...

968
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,919
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

969
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:36,399
They'll be here before you move in.

970
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:40,039
- How much money did this cost you?
- Never mind that.

971
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,879
- You shouldn't have done this.
- You need a decent place.

972
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:46,399
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

973
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,959
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

974
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:54,999
- Mama, no, they ain't.
- They are. You're fine, you're working...

975
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,039
...but I can't live without my welfare.

976
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,879
Mama, I'll send you money.

977
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:02,399
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

978
01:14:02,559 --> 01:14:06,239
- How am I supposed to get my medicine?
- I'll send you more money.

979
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:08,839
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

980
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:10,239
He's getting out, you know.

981
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:13,439
Why didn't you just give me the money?

982
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:17,079
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

983
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,839
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

984
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:25,159
You want the money, sell it.

985
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:33,359
I don't...

986
01:14:39,919 --> 01:14:41,759
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

987
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,359
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

988
01:14:44,519 --> 01:14:48,079
- That's true, Mama.
- I'll try and keep the house.

989
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:50,919
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

990
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,959
I'll send you some more money.

991
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:04,399
That man hitting you?

992
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,079
It's from the fight.

993
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:09,999
I'm a fighter, Mama.

994
01:15:10,879 --> 01:15:12,839
Find a man, Mary M.

995
01:15:12,999 --> 01:15:14,679
Live proper.

996
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:17,839
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

997
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:21,119
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

998
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:14,599
Hi.

999
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:47,039
You ever own a dog?

1000
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,719
Nope.

1001
01:16:48,919 --> 01:16:53,479
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

1002
01:16:55,519 --> 01:16:59,919
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1003
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:01,759
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1004
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:05,559
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1005
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:08,679
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1006
01:17:08,839 --> 01:17:12,679
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1007
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,919
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1008
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:21,879
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1009
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,439
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1010
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:30,679
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1011
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,479
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1012
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:41,239
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1013
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,719
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1014
01:17:55,959 --> 01:17:57,839
Well, you've got me.

1015
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,479
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1016
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,399
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1017
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:18,479
Yeah.

1018
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:21,959
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1019
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:25,039
None of that canned-filling crap.

1020
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:36,519
Mmm.

1021
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:42,319
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1022
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,159
I used to come here with Daddy.

1023
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:52,879
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1024
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:55,519
I got a little bit of savings.

1025
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,119
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1026
01:19:09,839 --> 01:19:11,919
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1027
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,999
Looks like another bottle of water.

1028
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:17,519
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1029
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:20,719
Watch you suffer
over the nickel slots? Uh-uh.

1030
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,639
My heart can't take
that kind of pounding.

1031
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,399
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1032
01:19:26,559 --> 01:19:28,599
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1033
01:19:28,759 --> 01:19:30,559
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1034
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,359
Well, I could use a good second.

1035
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:34,279
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1036
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,559
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1037
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:41,159
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1038
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:45,079
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1039
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,239
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1040
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,879
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1041
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:54,079
Somebody with young hands.

1042
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:57,359
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1043
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:00,999
I leave this place for one day...

1044
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,999
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1045
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,039
Kind of like it looks right now.

1046
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:07,599
Oh, go to hell.

1047
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:12,519
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1048
01:20:12,959 --> 01:20:14,479
Will do.

1049
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:20,519
- Hey, Mr. Scrap.
- Mm-hm.

1050
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,999
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1051
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,399
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1052
01:20:26,599 --> 01:20:28,359
Okay.

1053
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,719
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1054
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:36,959
I've been thinking on it.

1055
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:38,879
Can't figure it out.

1056
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:40,679
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1057
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:44,239
- You could do that? You could show me?
- I think so. I think so.

1058
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,439
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1059
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,719
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1060
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:58,839
- We're flying?
- Would you rather drive?

1061
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,919
You're asking me?

1062
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,319
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1063
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:08,239
So I finally get to decide something?

1064
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:09,839
That's what I'm saying.

1065
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:11,599
Fine.

1066
01:21:11,759 --> 01:21:13,519
Fly there, drive back.

1067
01:21:13,959 --> 01:21:17,519
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1068
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,479
You said it was up to me.

1069
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:31,839
Give them hell there, Danger.

1070
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:35,079
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1071
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:42,199
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1072
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,959
Jesus.

1073
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,839
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1074
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,399
Oh, God!

1075
01:21:55,839 --> 01:21:57,119
Dumb-ass.

1076
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:59,959
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1077
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,559
Come on. Defense!

1078
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:04,479
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1079
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:07,199
...drinking mai tais...

1080
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:09,559
...looking at naked women.

1081
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:12,999
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1082
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:17,599
Danger, get out of there!

1083
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:26,839
Fight back! Come on!

1084
01:22:26,999 --> 01:22:29,639
- There you go, Danger, there you go!
- Good job, man.

1085
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:31,839
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1086
01:22:31,999 --> 01:22:33,239
Come on.

1087
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:43,879
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1088
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:46,199
- What you doing? Let him go.
- All right. Okay.

1089
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:48,719
I got you. Come on, come on.

1090
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:51,839
It's all right.

1091
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:54,839
We don't need no corner trainer.

1092
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:56,399
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1093
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,439
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1094
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,759
You my man. You rock.

1095
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:02,879
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1096
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:05,799
You ain't even fight good yet.

1097
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:07,919
Anybody can lose one fight.

1098
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:10,519
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1099
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,359
You'll be champion of the world.

1100
01:23:12,519 --> 01:23:14,799
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1101
01:23:15,799 --> 01:23:17,479
I should have knowed.

1102
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:19,159
Come on.
We don't need to be talking.

1103
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:20,319
Let me help you.

1104
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:23,919
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1105
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:25,959
All right.

1106
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,919
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1107
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:35,119
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1108
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,079
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1109
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:40,359
Come on, now.

1110
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:44,479
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1111
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:48,639
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1112
01:23:56,439 --> 01:23:59,599
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1113
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:01,999
Keep going, man.

1114
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,879
All right, man.

1115
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,719
He ain't so tough.

1116
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:14,999
One hundred and ten.

1117
01:24:19,879 --> 01:24:21,559
Get a job, punk.

1118
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:55,999
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1119
01:24:56,999 --> 01:24:59,079
I got you some pipers.

1120
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:16,639
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1121
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:21,079
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1122
01:25:29,919 --> 01:25:31,399
All right, now!

1123
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,639
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1124
01:26:23,799 --> 01:26:25,959
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1125
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:45,479
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

1126
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:47,839
...presentation of the evening.

1127
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:52,599
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1128
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,839
...in the red corner.

1129
01:26:54,999 --> 01:26:56,639
In the blue corner...

1130
01:26:56,799 --> 01:27:01,159
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1131
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:04,199
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1132
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:09,159
Sweet Jesus.

1133
01:27:24,759 --> 01:27:27,119
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing
The Blue Bear around the ring.</i>

1134
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:28,319
<i>She's coming on strong.</i>

1135
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:34,199
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1136
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:36,559
<i>- And a right hook stuns the champ.</i>
- All right.

1137
01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:39,879
Break it up!

1138
01:27:42,839 --> 01:27:44,799
Break it! Break it!

1139
01:27:50,919 --> 01:27:53,719
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1140
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:57,199
Go fight.

1141
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,999
You motherfucker.

1142
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:17,599
Come on. What the fuck?

1143
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:20,519
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1144
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:22,919
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1145
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,119
<i>--Comes back, hits Fitzgerald...</i>

1146
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:27,719
Ref, open your eyes, you...

1147
01:28:45,759 --> 01:28:46,959
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1148
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,439
<i>...the first round is in the books
on this championship match.</i>

1149
01:28:52,999 --> 01:28:55,399
- Hold onto that.
- There you go.

1150
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:02,519
- Looking good.
- You pull that crap one more time...

1151
01:29:02,679 --> 01:29:04,479
...you're disqualified.

1152
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:14,319
It's gonna be all right.

1153
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,199
Got no doubt, boss.

1154
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,639
Okay, just watch yourself.

1155
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:23,199
Stay away from this dame.

1156
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,399
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1157
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:42,719
- Four, five, six...
- Stay down, you bitch.

1158
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:46,319
...seven, eight, nine.

1159
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:00,679
Yeah, yeah!

1160
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:03,879
Break it! Break it!

1161
01:30:10,799 --> 01:30:14,639
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion...</i>

1162
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:30,119
Yes! Come on!

1163
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:31,839
I got it! I got it.

1164
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:39,999
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1165
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,919
- How many eyes you need to finish this?
- One's enough.

1166
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:47,999
- Good.
- Now...

1167
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,719
...what do I do about the Bear?

1168
01:30:49,879 --> 01:30:52,799
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1169
01:30:52,959 --> 01:30:56,599
- I been doing that. She's made of steel.
- I don't want you to go to the liver.

1170
01:30:56,759 --> 01:30:59,679
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1171
01:30:59,839 --> 01:31:02,919
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1172
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:05,159
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1173
01:31:05,519 --> 01:31:08,319
- What about the ref?
- Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1174
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:10,279
...and everything will just be fine.

1175
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:14,279
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1176
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:16,039
You keep it up.

1177
01:31:29,599 --> 01:31:30,959
Oh, yeah!

1178
01:31:41,959 --> 01:31:43,639
Break, break!

1179
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:54,119
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1180
01:32:23,919 --> 01:32:25,359
Doctor.

1181
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:41,359
Come on.

1182
01:32:41,759 --> 01:32:43,279
Breathe.

1183
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:46,039
That's it. Breathe.

1184
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:48,119
Good.

1185
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:49,839
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1186
01:32:50,559 --> 01:32:51,839
Breathe.

1187
01:32:52,519 --> 01:32:54,039
Good.

1188
01:32:54,439 --> 01:32:55,839
That's it.

1189
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:58,399
Breathe.

1190
01:33:46,919 --> 01:33:48,679
How you feeling, darling?

1191
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:59,479
Growing a beard, boss?

1192
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:03,159
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1193
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:07,359
Can't say it does.

1194
01:34:34,759 --> 01:34:37,159
Does it...? Does it hurt much?

1195
01:34:38,959 --> 01:34:41,159
Don't hurt at all.

1196
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:44,679
Well, that's good.

1197
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:51,999
Where's Frankie?

1198
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:55,479
Well, he's...

1199
01:34:55,639 --> 01:34:58,079
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1200
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,319
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1201
01:35:03,599 --> 01:35:07,959
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1202
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:15,879
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1203
01:35:19,519 --> 01:35:23,159
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1204
01:35:28,119 --> 01:35:32,039
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1205
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:42,439
Did you see the fight?

1206
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,719
Of course I did.

1207
01:35:47,759 --> 01:35:49,719
You had her cold, Maggie.

1208
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:54,319
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1209
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,359
I shouldn't have turned.

1210
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:09,199
Always protect myself.

1211
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:12,479
How many times he tell me that?

1212
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:15,079
Yeah...

1213
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:18,319
...he does like to repeat himself.

1214
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:25,399
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1215
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:30,919
No.

1216
01:36:31,639 --> 01:36:33,919
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1217
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:55,599
Damnedest thing.

1218
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,239
So, What's the plan?

1219
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:05,399
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1220
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:07,319
It's your fault.

1221
01:37:07,959 --> 01:37:10,959
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1222
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,079
You kept after me until I trained her.

1223
01:37:13,559 --> 01:37:16,479
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1224
01:37:17,519 --> 01:37:19,959
Everything kept telling me not to.

1225
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:21,919
Everything but you.

1226
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:34,039
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1227
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:36,159
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1228
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:39,319
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1229
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,439
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1230
01:37:42,759 --> 01:37:46,359
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1231
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:51,199
You just rest there, I'll...

1232
01:37:52,999 --> 01:37:54,639
I'm on it.

1233
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,079
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

1234
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:09,079
<i>...looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

1235
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:13,319
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

1236
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,599
<i>...said there was nothing to be done.</i>

1237
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:19,359
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

1238
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:27,159
They got nurses for that, you know.

1239
01:38:28,559 --> 01:38:30,879
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1240
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:47,319
<i>She developed skin ulcers because
she couldn't change positions.</i>

1241
01:38:58,359 --> 01:38:59,959
Thank you.

1242
01:39:09,919 --> 01:39:13,239
<i>They made the six-hour
trip by ambulance.</i>

1243
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,519
Fly there, drive back.

1244
01:39:33,839 --> 01:39:37,319
<i>The rehab center Frankie
found was a nice place.</i>

1245
01:39:37,759 --> 01:39:39,599
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

1246
01:39:39,759 --> 01:39:41,879
<i>She wouldn't have
complained if they hadn't.</i>

1247
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:47,119
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

1248
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:54,639
One, two, three, up.

1249
01:39:56,999 --> 01:39:59,319
<i>Since she couldn't
breathe on her own...</i>

1250
01:39:59,519 --> 01:40:02,119
<i>...her respirators were always on.</i>

1251
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:07,239
<i>Oxygen was pumped into
her 24 hours a day.</i>

1252
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:36,799
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

1253
01:40:36,959 --> 01:40:40,599
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

1254
01:40:41,559 --> 01:40:42,839
Sure.

1255
01:40:42,999 --> 01:40:45,639
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

1256
01:40:45,799 --> 01:40:49,799
<i>Learned they'd checked into
their hotel six days earlier.</i>

1257
01:40:49,959 --> 01:40:53,359
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

1258
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:00,119
You don't have to hang around all day.

1259
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:02,959
Oh...

1260
01:41:03,919 --> 01:41:06,919
I like it here. I don't mind.

1261
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:11,599
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1262
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:17,439
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1263
01:41:17,839 --> 01:41:19,639
Well, it's no burden.

1264
01:41:20,559 --> 01:41:21,999
Here.

1265
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:25,319
Read this.

1266
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:36,559
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1267
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:38,519
That's terrible.

1268
01:41:40,999 --> 01:41:44,039
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1269
01:41:46,919 --> 01:41:48,399
It says:

1270
01:41:48,559 --> 01:41:52,119
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

1271
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:56,839
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

1272
01:41:57,759 --> 01:42:02,119
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

1273
01:42:02,759 --> 01:42:07,439
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

1274
01:42:09,799 --> 01:42:11,199
Not bad, huh?

1275
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,879
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1276
01:42:18,559 --> 01:42:20,399
- Me?
- Yeah.

1277
01:42:22,759 --> 01:42:25,479
You know, when you quit all this.

1278
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:29,119
You mean boxing?

1279
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:32,279
No, I'll never quit.

1280
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:35,799
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1281
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,199
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1282
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:46,759
...with your books and lemon pie.

1283
01:42:48,919 --> 01:42:51,799
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1284
01:42:53,839 --> 01:42:56,119
I could learn how to bake.

1285
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:01,599
Well, then, I'll...

1286
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,919
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1287
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,159
Yeah.

1288
01:43:29,919 --> 01:43:32,359
- Go ahead.
- All right. Okay, sounds good.

1289
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,639
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1290
01:43:38,799 --> 01:43:40,079
Where's my little girl?

1291
01:43:40,279 --> 01:43:43,119
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1292
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:46,039
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1293
01:43:46,199 --> 01:43:49,679
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1294
01:43:49,839 --> 01:43:52,599
<i>Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?</i>

1295
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:54,199
There's some rides you missed.

1296
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:57,039
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1297
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,439
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1298
01:43:59,599 --> 01:44:01,799
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1299
01:44:01,959 --> 01:44:03,639
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1300
01:44:03,799 --> 01:44:06,759
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1301
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:09,519
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1302
01:44:09,959 --> 01:44:11,679
Right down here, 301.

1303
01:44:11,959 --> 01:44:13,679
- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.

1304
01:44:20,199 --> 01:44:22,279
And I saw myself breathing.

1305
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:24,319
Like, my body was going up and down.

1306
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:27,319
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1307
01:44:30,759 --> 01:44:33,639
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1308
01:44:47,759 --> 01:44:49,079
It's just a...

1309
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:52,199
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1310
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:53,719
What is it?

1311
01:44:53,879 --> 01:44:55,919
How we all doing here?

1312
01:44:56,079 --> 01:44:58,639
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1313
01:44:58,799 --> 01:45:02,959
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1314
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:05,759
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1315
01:45:05,919 --> 01:45:07,519
Hey, old man...

1316
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,159
...you part of our family?

1317
01:45:10,119 --> 01:45:11,759
Stay the hell out of this.

1318
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:15,119
Read it to me, Mama.

1319
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:18,839
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1320
01:45:19,599 --> 01:45:21,119
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1321
01:45:21,959 --> 01:45:25,399
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1322
01:45:25,799 --> 01:45:27,919
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1323
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:30,919
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1324
01:45:31,079 --> 01:45:34,239
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1325
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:36,239
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1326
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:40,039
- Nothing.
- Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1327
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:44,079
- Then I'll just read it to her later on...
- With respect, this ain't your business.

1328
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:47,959
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1329
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:56,599
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1330
01:45:58,199 --> 01:45:59,999
You sign that paper...

1331
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:02,479
...it'll take care of your family...

1332
01:46:02,799 --> 01:46:04,999
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1333
01:46:06,999 --> 01:46:08,519
Uh...

1334
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:11,799
How do you make your mark?

1335
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:15,519
Can you hold a pen?

1336
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,039
- She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.
- Huh?

1337
01:46:18,199 --> 01:46:20,319
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1338
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:23,399
Here you go, honey.

1339
01:46:26,519 --> 01:46:28,599
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1340
01:46:28,839 --> 01:46:31,039
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1341
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:34,199
I did pretty good.

1342
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:36,199
You lost, Mary M.

1343
01:46:37,159 --> 01:46:40,879
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1344
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,199
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1345
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:47,199
There you go.

1346
01:46:56,559 --> 01:46:58,439
What happened to you?

1347
01:46:58,759 --> 01:47:00,479
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1348
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:05,719
Mama, you take Mardell and JD.
and get home.

1349
01:47:07,559 --> 01:47:10,879
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1350
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:14,319
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1351
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:19,559
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1352
01:47:19,719 --> 01:47:22,959
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1353
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:28,319
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1354
01:48:09,599 --> 01:48:13,799
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1355
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:29,479
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1356
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:33,959
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1357
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,839
They took my leg, boss.

1358
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,199
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1359
01:50:02,039 --> 01:50:05,399
I always hear your voice, boss.

1360
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:38,719
You need anything?

1361
01:50:42,519 --> 01:50:45,119
I need to know what <i>"mo cuishle"</i> means.

1362
01:50:46,839 --> 01:50:48,639
But you didn't win.

1363
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:51,159
I don't have to tell you.

1364
01:50:54,919 --> 01:50:57,439
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1365
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:59,959
No wonder no one loves you.

1366
01:51:03,519 --> 01:51:05,919
You remind me of my daddy.

1367
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,599
Well, he must have been...

1368
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:14,399
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1369
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,399
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1370
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:24,719
No, I was...

1371
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:29,159
...looking at this catalog
from City College.

1372
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:33,799
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1373
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:37,639
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1374
01:51:38,439 --> 01:51:41,399
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1375
01:51:46,519 --> 01:51:48,879
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1376
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,839
Sure.

1377
01:51:54,199 --> 01:51:56,239
Anything you want.

1378
01:51:57,919 --> 01:52:00,879
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1379
01:52:13,759 --> 01:52:16,239
Don't even think about that.

1380
01:52:20,119 --> 01:52:22,519
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1381
01:52:25,799 --> 01:52:27,559
Not after what I done.

1382
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:29,719
I seen the world.

1383
01:52:32,799 --> 01:52:34,999
People chanted my name.

1384
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:37,159
Well...

1385
01:52:39,079 --> 01:52:42,599
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1386
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:48,079
But they were chanting for me.

1387
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,999
I was in magazines.

1388
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:00,519
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1389
01:53:04,919 --> 01:53:08,599
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1390
01:53:12,039 --> 01:53:15,639
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1391
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:21,359
...and I'd fight my way out.

1392
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:29,239
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1393
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:33,839
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1394
01:53:36,759 --> 01:53:38,199
I got what I needed.

1395
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:44,679
I got it all.

1396
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:51,239
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1397
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:01,319
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1398
01:54:06,279 --> 01:54:08,519
I can't.

1399
01:54:09,239 --> 01:54:11,319
Please.

1400
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:15,839
Please, don't ask me.

1401
01:54:17,999 --> 01:54:20,079
I'm asking.

1402
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:25,519
I can't.

1403
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:11,399
Hello?

1404
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:18,879
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

1405
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:22,039
<i>...Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

1406
01:55:22,599 --> 01:55:24,759
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

1407
01:55:31,879 --> 01:55:34,719
Stop. Stop.

1408
01:55:38,199 --> 01:55:40,799
Look at me. Look at me.

1409
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:58,919
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

1410
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:03,719
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

1411
01:56:03,999 --> 01:56:06,159
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

1412
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:09,559
<i>...padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

1413
01:56:27,879 --> 01:56:30,199
You can't do it, you know that.

1414
01:56:32,039 --> 01:56:33,999
I do, Father.

1415
01:56:34,959 --> 01:56:36,959
But you don't know how thick she is...

1416
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,639
...how hard it was to train her.

1417
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:43,959
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1418
01:56:44,119 --> 01:56:49,599
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1419
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:52,519
How she fought for the title, I...

1420
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:54,239
It wasn't by anything...

1421
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:57,439
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1422
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:08,799
But now she wants to die...

1423
01:57:08,959 --> 01:57:11,159
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1424
01:57:15,479 --> 01:57:19,759
And I swear to God, Father, it's...

1425
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:23,079
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1426
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:26,679
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1427
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:30,079
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1428
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:34,279
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1429
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:36,359
You leave her with God.

1430
01:57:36,999 --> 01:57:40,599
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1431
01:57:40,759 --> 01:57:44,719
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1432
01:57:44,959 --> 01:57:46,959
The only person comes
to Church that much...

1433
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:48,799
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1434
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:51,319
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1435
01:57:51,839 --> 01:57:54,279
...they're nothing compared to this.

1436
01:57:54,679 --> 01:57:58,839
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1437
01:57:58,999 --> 01:58:02,039
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1438
01:58:05,559 --> 01:58:07,799
Somewhere so deep...

1439
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,039
...you'll never find yourself again.

1440
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,639
I think I did it already.

1441
01:58:42,559 --> 01:58:45,879
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1442
01:59:51,079 --> 01:59:53,719
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1443
01:59:55,479 --> 01:59:57,479
You must have been somewhere else.

1444
01:59:58,679 --> 02:00:00,479
Yeah.

1445
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:06,439
You got a fight I don't know about?

1446
02:00:11,839 --> 02:00:14,119
It wasn't your fault.

1447
02:00:14,559 --> 02:00:16,679
I was wrong to say that.

1448
02:00:16,959 --> 02:00:18,879
You're damn right.

1449
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:21,639
I found you a fighter...

1450
02:00:21,799 --> 02:00:25,359
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1451
02:00:27,919 --> 02:00:29,359
I killed her.

1452
02:00:29,519 --> 02:00:31,399
Don't say that.

1453
02:00:31,799 --> 02:00:34,359
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1454
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:37,679
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1455
02:00:37,879 --> 02:00:41,279
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1456
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:42,719
You did that.

1457
02:00:44,919 --> 02:00:47,439
People die every day, Frankie.

1458
02:00:47,639 --> 02:00:49,519
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1459
02:00:49,839 --> 02:00:51,759
And you know what
their last thought is?

1460
02:00:51,919 --> 02:00:54,399
"I never got my shot."

1461
02:00:54,879 --> 02:00:57,199
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1462
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:02,159
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

1463
02:01:02,999 --> 02:01:05,399
"I think I did all right."

1464
02:01:12,999 --> 02:01:15,559
I know I could rest with that.

1465
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:19,279
Yeah.

1466
02:01:19,879 --> 02:01:21,719
Yeah.

1467
02:01:32,759 --> 02:01:34,439
Yeah.

1468
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,119
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1469
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:15,799
Yeah.

1470
02:02:42,679 --> 02:02:44,319
All right.

1471
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:50,999
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1472
02:02:51,839 --> 02:02:54,119
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1473
02:02:58,839 --> 02:03:01,559
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll...

1474
02:03:02,679 --> 02:03:04,279
...stay asleep.

1475
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:11,359
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

1476
02:03:12,919 --> 02:03:16,519
...means "my darling, my blood."

1477
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:27,439
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

1478
02:04:27,759 --> 02:04:31,999
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

1479
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:35,239
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

1480
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:26,759
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

1481
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:30,639
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

1482
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:51,479
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

1483
02:05:51,759 --> 02:05:55,439
<i>Waited, figuring he'd
turn up sooner or later.</i>

1484
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,479
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

1485
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:24,079
I got to thinking what
you said, Mr. Scrap.

1486
02:06:25,159 --> 02:06:26,839
What was that, Danger?

1487
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:31,039
Anybody can lose one fight.

1488
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:34,079
That's the truth.

1489
02:06:34,919 --> 02:06:37,519
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1490
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:41,919
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1491
02:07:00,759 --> 02:07:03,919
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

1492
02:07:18,679 --> 02:07:22,839
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

1493
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:25,719
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

1494
02:07:25,879 --> 02:07:28,919
<i>...and ask you one more
time to forgive him.</i>

1495
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:32,479
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

1496
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:36,039
<i>I just hope he found some place
where he could find a little peace.</i>

1497
02:07:36,519 --> 02:07:39,639
<i>A place set in the
cedars and oak trees.</i>

1498
02:07:39,959 --> 02:07:43,159
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

1499
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:46,919
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>

1500
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:49,439
<i>No matter where he is...</i>

1501
02:07:49,959 --> 02:07:54,679
<i>...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.</i>
