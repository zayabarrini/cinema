00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,192
Some lad at school.

163
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,732
- What's his name?
- Harvey.

And I've come to give you gyp.

My name is Harvey.

to get someone to go in for me.

Pukey's a nutcase. Don't wind him up.

Anyway, Shaun, move.
You're in my seat.

188
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,028
Move.

189
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,074
Gadget, mate, out of all the places to sit,
you want to sit there?

190
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:23,741
- Yeah, I do.
SHAUN: Shall I move?

191
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:26,238
What are you asking him for?
Move, now.

192
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,033
- He don't have to bloody move.
- Fucking does. Get out.

193
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:32,240
Oi, it's a free country.
You sit there if you want to sit there.

Shaun, come back, mate.

- You all right?
- Yeah.

217
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,114
Had a good day at school?

218
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,279
Shaun?

219
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,698

Shaun, come here.

Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

Why?

223
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:48,067
Please, son, I want to talk to you.

224
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,689
What?

225

Nothing.

You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

228
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,072
No, I did it on the way home from school.

229
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:03,448
You didn't. You're lying to me.
How have you done it?

230
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,700
It was a boy at school.

231
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,196
He made a joke about Dad, so I hit him.

232
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,984
Well, what did he say about Dad?

233
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,155
I don't wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.

234
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,156
Shaun, I want to know what he said.

235
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,532
I've been picked on three times today.

236
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:21,981
All because of my trousers.

237
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,740
What's wrong with your trousers?

238
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,775
Look at the fucking size of them!

239
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,397
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.

240
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:31,200
- Your dad bought you them.
- They're too big for me!

241
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,609
If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.

242
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,231
It's non-uniform day, Mum.

243
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,903
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I don't know what to do.

244
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:43,358
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.

245
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,775
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.

246
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,616
I don't like it here, Mum.

247
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:52,818
I liked it better when we were with Dad.

248
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,573
Well, I liked it better when we was with Dad,
but Dad's gone now.

I'll get you a good seat.

320
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,069
Woo!

321
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,072
- Get up them stairs.
(Shaun laughs)

322
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,113
Shaun! Shaun, Shaun, Shaun!

323
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,819
Quick!

324
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,614
Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Ssh!

325
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:09,648
Where the fuck have yous gone?
Come on.

326
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,692
I can't be doing with this, lads.

327
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,734
I'm not in the mood for this.

328
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,656
I know yous are in here, I'm not stupid.

329
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,278
So, come out.

330
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,442
(Barrage of catapult shots)

331
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,069
Fucker!

332
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:25,109
(Laughter)

333
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,444
SHAUN: Classical!

334
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,820
Classical.

335
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:32,783
- Classic.
SHAUN: Classic. Classic.

336
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:35,066
WOOD Y: Gold, mate. Liquid gold. Brilliant.

337
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,689
SHAUN: That was classic! Classic, classic.

338
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:41,653
Oi, oi, oi!
What's all that about, dickhead, eh?

339
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,573
What's the deal with you, eh?

340
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,822
- He shot me.
- I shot you as well.

341
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,030
Come on, Shauny.

342
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,233
- Bloody hell, Gadget.
- What d'you do that for?

343
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:51,820
Look how yous
have been treating me all day.

344
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,657
I had to carry all the bags.

345
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:56,272
All of yous running off on me,
hiding on me.

346
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:59,608
Listen to me. He's a young lad.
He's had a fucking bad week.

347
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,657
So, we're bringing him with us
to show him a bloody good time

348
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,906
and you just backhanded him
round t'head.

349
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:06,574
I'm disappointed, mate.

350
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,822
You're all favouritising him.

351
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,866
I feel like I've gone down in the ranks
since he's come.

352
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,402
ALL: What ranks?

353
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,235
I'm sorry if I've took your place, mate.
I really am.

354
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:19,864
And if you really want me to go
and give you your spot back, I'll just go.

355
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,900
Don't, mate. Please.

356
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,156
- I'll go. He don't like me.
- No, don't.

357
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,192
He don't know what he's saying.

358
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:30,236
It's not that I don't like you, mate.
I think you're great. It's just...

359
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,275
I'm having a shitty time and...

360
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:35,359
- Come on. Shake hands.
- I've been where you are and...

361
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:39,237
Less of this. It's nonsense, this.
We're mates here. Shake his hand.

362
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:42,448
Come on. Good lad.
That's what I'm all about. Yeah.

363
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:45,360
Come here, come here.
Give us a bloody hug, come on.

364
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,491
Bloody hell. Come on, all of yous.
All of yous, get in here.

365
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:51,024
Bloody hell, my arse!
Who's that on my arse?

366
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,067
Who's that? Calm it down.

367
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:54,908
Bloody hell, Gadge. Come on, mate.

368
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:57,321
# AL BARRY & THE CIMARONS:
Morning Sun

369
00:21:57,368 --> 00:22:00,650
# Way out in the morning sun

370
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:04,491
# There lies my baby,
she was waiting so long

371
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,111
# Aah aah-aah-aah

372
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,359
# Oh, she sing for the sweet melody

373
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,696
# Oh, Lord, I could hear the harmony

374
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:15,575
# Aah-aah-aah-aah aah-aah-aah...

375

(Bell)

376
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,650
SHAUN'S MUM: Wait for me, love.

377
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,282
- I'll see you, chicken.
- See ya.

378
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:22,523
Them.

379
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,616
- Which ones?
- The big red ones.

380
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,026
Oh, you're not having them, sweetheart.
Look at the size of 'em.

381
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:32,067
Oh, come on, Mum. You said.

382
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,820
No, Shaun, they look like thug boots.
They're awful.

383
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,444
Come on, Mum. You promised me.

384
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:39,242
Why don't you get some of them
that you've got in blue?

385
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:43,360
Cos I don't like these. I want them ones,
Mum. Come on. You promised.

386
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,324
- They'll rub on your shin.
- They'll only be about that.

387
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,358
Be better in my size.

388
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,400
Come on. Where is she?

389
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,655
- Right.
- Well, that was nice timing.

390
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:54,277
I spoke too soon.

391
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:57,906
I hurt my shoulder back there.
Been ferreting about for ages.

392
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:00,985
- Are you all right, love?
- Pulled something in my shoulder.

393
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,605
Now, then, if I can just have that for a second...

394
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,195
- Let me have that, sweetheart.
- I want to hold it.

395
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:08,696
I'll just have that. Mum, shall I just...?

396
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,781
- Yeah.
- I'll just put that down there.

397
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:13,990
Ducky, darling, the ones
that you're looking at, these boots...

398
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,026
- Yeah?
...now, they're adult sizes

399
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,113
and you're a size four.

400
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,608
But these have just come in from London.

401
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,158
Are you ready for these?

402
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,280
These are fantastic.

403
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,815
- What the...?
- Oh, look at them, Shaun.

404
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,823
They're absolutely lovely.

405
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,190
- Do you want to hold one? There.
- Oh, my God.

406
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,814
- They're nice, aren't they?
- They're lovely, them.

407
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,277
Oh, they look lovely.

408
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:40,613
- Try 'em on.
- Where's the "Doc Marten" sign?

409
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,492
These ones, cos they're special
and they're from London,

410
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:47,031
they don't have the Doc Marten sign
on these - they're too special for that.

411
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:51,283
- It says "Tompkins" in it.
- The ones from London say Tompkins.

412
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:53,317
Everywhere else say "Dr Martens".

413
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,405
- I love them.
- These ones are special.

414
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:58,023
- Do you sell a lot of them?
- Yeah. Go like hot cakes.

415
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,652
Do you want to try one on? Shall we?

416
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,359
I fucking want them.

417
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,863
- If you swear... I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

418
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,196
- Shaun, don't swear.
- I want them ones.

419
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,482
- Listen, you can...
- I don't want them.

420
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:11,236
Chicken, don't upset your mum, eh?
Let's try 'em on.

421
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,489
GIRL: Are you ready, Shaun?
- Yeah.

422
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,992
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

423
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,404
- You don't seem very confident.
- Just do it.

424
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,983
Your mum's not gonna come round,
is she, and whack my door down?

425
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:22,825
No. Just fricking do it.

426
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:25,107
(Switches on razor)
- Right. Here we go.

427
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,192
- Get that mop off.
- It's coming.

428
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,280
- It's coming off.
(Shaun giggles)

429
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:32,317
- Oh, eh.
ALL: Ooh!

430
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:35,991
WOOD Y: Flippin' heck. Eh.

431
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:38,819
- You have a right pink head.
- We're getting going now.

432
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,570
- Stop fidgeting.
- You're doing a good job, mate.

433
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,905
Oh, mate, it looks better already, that.

434
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:46,404
- Don't it, Milk?
- Definitely. Definitely.

435
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,442
- You're looking good.
- Head down.

436
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,987
Oh, there's loads of it.
It's just never-ending.

437
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,950
WOOD Y: Don't be rough with him, Lol.
He's only a baby.

438
00:24:57,034 --> 00:25:00,116
- Put your head up.
- You just told me to put it down, Lol.

439
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,483
And what an hairline, girls, eh?

440
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,324
Don't forget that bit.

441
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,944
I can see it.

442
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:08,404
Honestly, mate, it's sterling.

443
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:10,867
Get it off.

444
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,612
Really smart, in't he? In't he smart, eh?

445
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,326
- He does look good.
- Mate, I'm well impressed.

446
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,815
There we go, mate. That's you done.

447
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,325
Look at that!

448
00:25:21,368 --> 00:25:23,821
WOOD Y: Brush him down. He looks like a Yeti!

449
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:26,439
- Oh, mate, so smart, that.
- That's good, that.

450
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,484
Honestly, mate, you look sterling.

451
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:30,656
- So, am I in the gang now?
- Well, not yet.

452
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:32,941
Get your shirt on.
Let's see your Ben Sherman.

453
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,989
I... I ain't got a Ben Sherman.

454
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,606
- You telling me you've not got a shirt?
- No.

455
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,485
You told me to get jeans and the boots.

456
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:42,651
Are you having a laugh?
You can't go out all nipply, can you?

457
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:46,067
You're gonna have to come back next week.
I'll see you, mate.

458
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:49,649
- Honestly, have I really gotta go?
- Yeah, really, really.

459
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:51,491
Go on. You're gonna have to get off.

460
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,739
Shut t'door behind you,
there's a good lad.

461
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,817
Oh, hang on, I forgot about summat.

462
00:25:56,868 --> 00:25:58,526
I were fucking lying!

463
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:02,063
Come here and give me a big hug.
Come here, fella.

464
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:05,946
I'm really proud of you, mate.
You look brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

465
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,654
Get that body covered up
before t'girls go mad!

466
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:09,696
Ooh!

467
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,314
Amazing. Bang on.

468
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:14,359
Lol picked that for you.

469
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,491
- Look at that.
- It's a good fit, that. It's a good fit.

470
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,157
Let's have a look at you.

471
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,398
Ah, mate.

472
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:22,608
What a transformation!

473
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,318
He looks dead cute.

474
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:25,826
Pleased with it?

475
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,824
- Look at that.
- Ah, mate.

476
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,693
WOOD Y: Bloody hell, here he is.
- Gadget!

477
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:32,278
LOL: Look at this.
- What? Who are you?

478
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,317
Oh-ho-ho, Shaun!

479
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,986
Oh-ho-ho! Look at that. Come here.

480
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:38,658
That's it. Good lad, Gadge.

481
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:40,242
Well done, mate.

Home sweet home.

518
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,823
- It's all right round here, Shaun.
- It's a nice area, mate.

519
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:44,238
Cheers for today.
It's been the best day of my life.

520
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:45,482
ALL: Aw.

521
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,324
Fella, man,
you are more than welcome.

522
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,821
And I mean that
from the bottom of my heart. Any time.

523
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,740
- Tell him.
- Definitely. Any time, mate.

524
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:54,315
- Come here, you.
GADGET: Any time, day or night.

SHAUN: Oh, oh!
WOOD Y: Woo!

526
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,531
- Wa-hey!
- You've been practising!

527
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:00,614
Cheers for the haircut, Lol.

528
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,859
No worries. You make sure you come to
me when it needs redoing.

529
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,943
- Cheers for the shitty tea, Gadget.
- Get you!

530
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:11,697
Shaun?

531
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:13,697
Yeah?

532
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,533
Come here, please.

533
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:19,484
I just want to go straight to bed, Mum.

534
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:22,201
Come here, please.
You're two hours late.

535
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:25,867
- Please, Mum.
- Shaun, just come here!

536
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:36,950
Oh, my God.

537
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,236
Mum, please.

538
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:43,741
Please, Mum.

539
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,817
- Shaun, come on.
- Oh, man.

540
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,321
- Oh, Mum, please.
- I'm not messing around.

541
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:49,908
Now, in.

542
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,611
In you go, you.

543
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,236
- Eh, Shaun!
- Shaun, mate!

544
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:55,741
- Oh.
- Oh.

545
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,403
Who's Lol?

546
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,029
Me.

547
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:04,067
What have you done to his hair?

548
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:09,903
I... I did ask him, before I did it, if...
if you was all right with it.

549
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:11,906
Don't you think
you should have asked me?

550
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:12,946
Yeah.

551
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,611
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,816
Shaun, did I not ask you
if it was all right?

553
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,154
If he said, "Jump off a cliff",
would you do that?

554
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:21,483
No.

555
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:25,363
To be honest, you all look a bit... old
to be hanging around with him.

556
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,657
I'm only in the er... year bel...
above in school.

557
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,071
- Are you joking?
- No.

558
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,491
I've got problems.

559
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:35,813
(Sniggering)

560
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:39,115
Yeah, well, you will have problems
if you touch his hair again.

561
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,234
LOL: I'm really sorry.
- Who's Woody?

562
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:43,273
Behave.

563
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:46,241
- I'm Woody. I'm sorry, love.
- No, it's fine.

564
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:47,612
It's erm...

565
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,653
I just wanted to thank you. He said he's
being bullied and you'd helped him out.

566
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,616
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I really appreciate that.

567
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,321
And the clothes and stuff.
I think he likes 'em. I don't mind that, at all.

568
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:00,158
But the hair is not good.

569
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,611
I'm really sorry.

570
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,357
I am. I wouldn't have done it
if I knew you didn't like it.

571
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,862
Listen, I'm gonna leave him here with you.

572
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,066
I'm gonna trust you, Shaun.

573
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,694
All right? Give us a kiss.

574
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:16,114
- See you later. Nice to meet you.
WOOD Y: What's your name, love?

575
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,234
- Cynthia.
- Nice to meet you, Cynthia.

576
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:19,825
Nice to meet you all.

577
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,905
- See you in a bit, Shaun.
- See you, love.

578
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,942
- See you, later.
- Bye, Mum.

579
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:25,403
You idiot!

580
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,950
You shit yourself.

581
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:28,982
What?

582
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:31,488
- You shit yourself. You did.
- I didn't shit myself.

583
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,405
(Thud of stereo)

584
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,950
Hey, here he is!

585
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:39,653
- Where have you been?
- I've been getting a drink.

586
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,865
- You've been gone an hour.
- Look how pissed he is. Babycham?

587
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:44,699
Have you had it through a straw?

588
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:46,650
Wakey-wakey!

589
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,822
Pissed as a fart. Look at him.

590
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,822
You fancy Smell, don't you?

591
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,147
- Ah!
- No.

592
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,529
Do you like Smell?

593
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:00,486
Listen, I think, Shaun...
I think you've got a great chance.

594
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,857
- Oh, aye, love.
- You ain't got nothing to lose.

595
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,615
- Go on.
- She can only say no, mate.

596
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,650
You wanna give it a crack?

597
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,656
This can be a beautiful thing.

598
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,822
- Oh, my God. Fuckin' hell.
- Boob height.

599
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,823
That might be the perfect height.

600
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,278
Would you...

601
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,483
like to take a turn up the garden with me?

602
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,655
- Oh, that's sweet.
(Pukey snorts)

603
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:20,608
You are, you're a little sweetheart.

604
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:22,614
LOL: I told you. It's making me emotional.

605
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,409
SHAUN: Ladies first.

606
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:26,992
GIRL: Come on, then.
- Watch it.

607
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:29,191
- Ooh, sorry, mate.
- It's all right.

608
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,867
- Look at the sky.
- This is perfect, this is.

609
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,982
SHAUN: Look at the moonlight. It's beautiful.

610
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:40,492
Like you.

611
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,069
That is so cute.

612
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:47,067
You're a real charmer, you are.

613
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:50,486
SHAUN: Careful.

614
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:53,533
WOOD Y: it were just...

615
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,194
(Knock at door)

616
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:58,608
- What the fuck's that?
- (Further knock)

617
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,816
That sounds like the coppers,
that does.

618
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:02,491
- Gary.
- (Thumping on door)

619
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:03,529
Gadget!

620
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,822
It's Gadget's mum and dad.

621
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:08,819
Get the fuck up, Gadge. Listen to me.
I want you to be sober. Yeah?

622
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:09,863
Sober.

623
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,900
- All nice, good, sober.
- (Doorbell)

624
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,942
- I am sober.
- Of course you are.

625
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,605
Fucking hide all the weed an' that, Milk.

626
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:18,650
(Thumping on door)

627
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:20,278
(Doorbell)

628
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,605
Hello?

629
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,650
- Aaargh!
- Get fucking out!

630
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:33,897
Outside now!

631
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:37,033
If you want us to turn
the music down, we'll turn it down.

632
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,695
It's too fucking late for that!

633
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,236
These three.

634
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,406
Now get fucking up! Come on.

635
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:45,691
KES: I'm coming, just...
- Not you. You.

636
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,366
Get outside!

637
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,986
LOL: Woody!
- Now!

638
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,491
Come on!

639
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,241
- It's all right.
- Kes, get up.

640
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:54,276
Yaaah!

641
00:33:54,327 --> 00:33:56,815
(Screaming and shouting)

642
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,652
WOOD Y: Look at him! Fucking hell, Combo!

643
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,656
Fucking hell, look at you!

644
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:05,941
Look at the fucking size of him.

645
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:08,191
Wow! Fucking look at you!

646
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:13,034
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Fucking look at you, man!

647
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:14,866
- Fucking hell.
- I missed you, man.

648
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,991
Fuck off, man. You fucking gave me
a heart attack, you bastard.

649
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:19,491
Who the fuck's he?

650
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:20,944
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

651
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,189
Three and a half years
with this fucking big bastard.

652
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:27,700
You lovely man.

653
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:31,073
Tell you what, there's fuck all
that this man hasn't seen.

654
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:34,318
WOOD Y: Banjo, yeah?
Thanks for looking after him, mate.

655
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,070
- Look at the size of him, mate.
- Always ready to have a go.

656
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,908
Meggy! How are you, lad?

657
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,942
- How are you, mate?
- I'm all right.

658
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,610
Milk, fucking hell.

659
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,650
You shit me up there for a minute.

660
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:46,656
Listen to me now. This dude, here,

661
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:50,281
he spent three years in the pen for me,
he never said nothing.

662
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,862
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be with you guys now.

663
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,149
So, the utmost respect and I mean it.

664
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:56,658
I mean it.

665
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,194
Look at this, eh?

666
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:01,691
Look at you. Fucking hell!
You've blossomed, haven't you, love?

667
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:04,148
- How are you doing?
- Not too bad. How are you?

668
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,069
All right. Easy, easy.
That's my other half, that.

669
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,611
- It's my other half, like.
- Nice one, mate.

670
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,697
I'm happy for yous.

671
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,819
Are you all right?

672
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:16,821
Yeah.

673
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,657
You look a bit nervous.

674
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,273
I'm not gonna do anything
you don't want me to.

675
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,733
Have you ever done this before?

676
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:26,236
Done it once.

677
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:27,658
In Germany.

678
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:29,194
In Germany?

679
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:31,482
Why did you go to Germany?

680
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,028
I was...

681
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,647
in Ger... Germany with my dad.

682
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,273
What did you do in Germany
with this girl?

683
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:39,902
Just kissed her.

684
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,156
Did you? Was she pretty?

685
00:35:43,285 --> 00:35:45,571
Prettier than me?

686
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:47,407
- No way.
- Really?

687
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,192
Well, that's really cute of you.

688
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:54,276
Do you want a kiss?

689
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,025
We'll leave it today.

690
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:13,823
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.

691
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,859
You're dead sensitive.

692
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:18,694
Are you all right?

693
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:21,857
Are you sure?

694
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:24,859
Do you want me to kiss you again?

695
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,449
Do you wanna suck my tits?

696
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,491
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.

697
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:48,822
All right, it took a little bit of time.

698
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,403
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.

699
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,568
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,

700
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:56,988
this fucking wog...

701
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,605
Right? Proper horrible.

702
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,028
Sorry, mate, sorry.

703
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:05,274
Didn't mean nothing by it.

704
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:08,076
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.

705
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:10,689
Sorry. This, you know, this brown gentleman...

706
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,696
...who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.

707
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:17,113
No matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.

708
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,151
- And I hate bullies. Don't I, Wood?
- Yeah.

709
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:21,524
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.

710
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:25,024
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.

711
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,908
What kind of pudding was it?

712
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:28,942
Doesn't matter what pudding it was.

713
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,735
The pudding's not the point.

714
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:34,115
The point is,
he was taking my pudding off me.

715
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,944
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I don't care.

716
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,233
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it."

717
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:42,567
So, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"No, mate, no, you're not having it."

718
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:44,194
He was like...

719
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,363
(Mimics his accent): "White boy...

720
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,483
Give me your pud-pud."

721
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,362
Proper! Do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "No, man."

722
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,566
- (Laughter)
COMBO: Nah, he did, right.

723
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,608
ALL: Eh!

724
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,190
WOOD Y: Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.

725
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,608
And who's been bloody smooching?

726
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,448
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.

727
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:12,366
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.

728
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:15,277
Now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.

729
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,903
Combo, Shaun.

730
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,444
Newest recruit.

731
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:19,986
Shaun. Combo.

732
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,575
What are you doing?

733
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:23,692
Just want to shake your hand.

734
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,319
Did you?

735
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:30,778
Are you a proper little skinhead,
then, yeah?

736
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:32,696
Yeah.

737
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,984
You look like a little Action Man.

738
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:40,945
Like a little Barbie doll.
You're dressed up an' all that. Look.

739
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:42,485
What?

740
00:38:45,952 --> 00:38:48,487
I'm only messing with you, you little fucker.

741
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,525
I'm only messing with you.

742
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:53,030
GADGET: He's all right.
- You're all right.

743
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:55,986
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.

744
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,492
Sit next to Milky.

745
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,482
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?

746
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:06,568
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"

747
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:08,407
stealing your "pud-pud".

748
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:12,361
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
So, I've said, "No, you're not having it."

749
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:15,573
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,

750
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:18,901
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.

751
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:20,693
Weren't I? And I'm fucking starving.

752
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:22,152
# gentle piano

753
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:23,943
You know, like that proper hunger.

754
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:28,117
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my pudding,
just go and eat my pudding."

755
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,193
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,

756
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,443
this big, black, sweaty hand

757
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:37,277
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.

758
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,116
Do you know what I mean?

759
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,283
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...

760
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:46,690
I just thought,
"No, I'm not having it, I don't care.

761
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:49,527
You're not getting my pudding, that's it."

762
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:53,321
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...

763
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,321
(Piano music drowns speech)

764
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,488
(Mouths): Woody.

765
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:32,906
So, last night was good fun, weren't it?

766
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:36,317
- Don't start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.

767
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:39,568
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.

768
00:40:39,618 --> 00:40:42,284
It was er... a little on the tense side.

769
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,317
I know, mate, I'm sorry.

770
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,781
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.

771
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,449
Has to be number one.

772
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:52,823
He were like that before he went in.
Nowt's frigging changed, at all.

773
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,398
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.

774
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,821
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.

775
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,073
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?

776
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,192
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.

777
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:06,028
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.

778
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,073
You asked for a story, he told it you.

779
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,523
I'll tell you a story
if you don't shut your mouth.

780
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:16,909
All right, boys?

781
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,025
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.

782
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,902
- Puke.
- All right, mate.

783
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:23,191
WOOD Y: 'Ey up. What's up?

784
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:26,324
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.

785
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:28,904
- Only be two minutes. Come 'ed.
- Bastard.

786
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,025
Woody, don't be long cos I wanna get off.

787
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,322
- All right, love.
- Be two minutes, Lol.

788
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,778
All right, lad?

789
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:40,575
I said, "All right?"

790
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:43,450
What was that for? That hurt!

791
00:41:43,493 --> 00:41:46,491
- Woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.

792
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:53,032
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.

793
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:55,404
MILKY: Don't worry. I'm more than ready.

794
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:57,905
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.

795
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:59,409
- He's all right.
- He's not.

796
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,446
Kel!

797
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:02,531
MILKY: Kelly, you don't even know him.

798
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:03,571
(Sighs)

799
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,906
- What's up?
PUKEY: You all right, Woods?

800
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:09,942
All right, lad.

801
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:15,570
- Go on, then. What's happened?
- We've to...

802
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,775
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.

803
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:40,945
I tell you, I shouldn't be here, you know.
This don't feel good, at all.

804
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:44,405
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?

805
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,367
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible

806
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,566
little bastard the other day, didn't you?

807
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,573
- A little bit.
- A bit?

808
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,616
Tell the truth, Wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, weren't I?

809
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:03,408
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.

810
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:05,442
Yeah, well, you were a snake.

811
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:09,612
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, weren't you?

812
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:14,026
Do you wanna know why, Wood?
Do you want me to tell you why?

813
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:15,112
Yeah?

814
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:18,404
Cos see that man, there, Milky?

815
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,902
That man there

816
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,574
took abuse off me.

817
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:26,735
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.

818
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:29,485
You let me abuse him.

819
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:32,237
And what did you do?
What did you do, Wood?

820
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:34,571
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.

821
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:37,569
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing. Fuck all.

822
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,194
Neither did any of yous.

823
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:42,525
Not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.

824
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:44,781
And that was fucking wrong.

825
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:49,565
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.

826
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:51,739
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.

827
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:55,906
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.

828
00:43:55,951 --> 00:44:00,775
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.

829
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:02,817
But I've got one question to ask you.

830
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,905
Do you consider yourself

831
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:06,741
English or Jamaican?

832
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:08,858
(Clock ticks)

833
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,402
English.

834
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:32,571
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.

835
00:44:32,618 --> 00:44:35,106
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.

836
00:44:37,618 --> 00:44:39,408
That's what we need, man.

837
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,821
That's what this nation
has been built on.

838
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:45,073
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.

839
00:44:45,118 --> 00:44:49,112
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island

840
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:51,364
has been raped and pillaged

841
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,408
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.

842
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:58,030
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.

843
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,072
For this, and for what?

844
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,689
So we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,

845
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,449
"Yeah, this is England

846
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:07,069
and this is England

847
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,694
and this is England."

848
00:45:10,993 --> 00:45:12,783
And for what?

849
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:14,863
For what now?

850
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,900
Eh, what for?

851
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:21,192
So we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?

852
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:23,115
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.

853
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,241
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?

854
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:29,117
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why don't you build a shop?

855
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,572
Better still, why don't you build a shop
and then build a church?

856
00:45:32,618 --> 00:45:35,569
Follow your own fucking religions.
Do what you want."

857
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:39,825
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat

858
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,905
and they're being given to these...

859
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:45,198
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.

860
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,691
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?

861
00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:53,032
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.

862
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:55,358
Right? We're giving that to them.

863
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:58,491
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.

864
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:01,900
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.

865
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:05,115
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.

866
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,735
Cheap and easy labour.

867
00:46:06,784 --> 00:46:10,197
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.

868
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:12,530
Three and a half fucking million!

869
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:15,029
It's not a joke. It's not a fucking joke.

870
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:19,070
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower

871
00:46:19,118 --> 00:46:21,736
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!

872
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:23,159
The Falklands?

873
00:46:23,201 --> 00:46:24,991
The fucking Falklands?

874
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:27,025
What the fuck's The Falklands?

875
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,069
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.

876
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:33,282
Good soldiers,
real people losing their lives,

877
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:36,360
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.

878
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,194
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?

879
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:41,530
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...

880
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:43,567
Shut up about The Falklands.

881
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,194
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.

882
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:48,241
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.

883
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:50,489
My fucking dad weren't a dickhead!

884
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:51,813
What are you doing?

885
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,900
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?

886
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,357
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?

887
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,945
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...

888
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:00,451
That's it. Go on.

889
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,484
My fucking dad died in that war!

890
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:04,526
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!

891
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:08,575
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!

892
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,075
I'm sorry, mate.

893
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,943
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.

894
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:14,906
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.

895
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,361
Fucking hell.

896
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,400
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,

897
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:21,982
honest, I wouldn't have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.

898
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:25,151
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.

899
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:28,484
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, don't you?

900
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,904
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.

901
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:32,942
We shouldn't have been there.

902
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:35,907
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.

903
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:38,440
But, most importantly, she lied to your dad.

904
00:47:38,493 --> 00:47:43,197
If you don't stand up and fight this fucking fight
that's going on on the streets,

905
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:45,447
your dad died for nothing.

906
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:47,283
He died for nothing.

907
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,447
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.

908
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,190
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.

909
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Fucking hell.

910
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,948
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.

911
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:07,902
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?

912
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,231
Fucking hell.

913
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,742
What a gem.

914
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:12,575
What a fucking gem.

915
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:14,111
All right, look.

916
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:25,526
There's the line, boys.

917
00:48:25,577 --> 00:48:28,361
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave

918
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,692
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.

919
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,491
But if you wanna stay,

920
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:36,324
this is a proper fight.

921
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:40,196
Now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...

922
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:44,034
...or you stay where you are
and you come with me.

923
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:45,990
The choice is yours, boys.

924
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:50,405
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, weren't it?

925
00:48:50,452 --> 00:48:52,904
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.

926
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:55,357
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Void there.

927
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,573
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.

928
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:00,608
Come on, lads, let's have you.

929
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:01,945
Come on, then.

930
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:03,486
Come on, Puke, mate.

931
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:05,324
Sit down.

932
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,151
You what?

933
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,192
Kes, just sit down.

934
00:49:10,243 --> 00:49:14,486
No. No, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.

935
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,193
Kes, just sit down.

936
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:18,731
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?

937
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:20,527
Look, he's fucking right.

938
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,526
What can I do, man? Are you coming?

939
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:24,358
No.

940
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,989
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!

941
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:29,657
I'm sick of you, Woody.

942
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,734
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,

943
00:49:32,784 --> 00:49:34,775
making me feel that fucking big.

944
00:49:34,826 --> 00:49:36,817
He's put things into perspective.

945
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:40,782
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.

946
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,902
Join me.

947
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:56,070
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,

948
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,613
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.

949
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:02,616
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldn't, man.

950
00:50:04,618 --> 00:50:07,189
You're my bro, man. What the fuck?

951
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:21,022
Come on, mate.

952
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,575
(Combo tuts)

953
00:50:28,118 --> 00:50:30,571
WOOD Y: Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.

954
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:32,655
LOL: Come on, Shaun.
- No.

955
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:34,988
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.

956
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,196
Shaun?

957
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:41,029
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.

958
00:50:41,076 --> 00:50:43,281
Woody, I wanna make my dad proud.

959
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,783
Listen, love...

960
00:50:44,826 --> 00:50:46,616
See you later, mate.

961
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,692
See you later, Lol, love.

962
00:50:48,743 --> 00:50:50,733
He's 12. I can't leave him here.

963
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:53,190
- Go.
- Nothing we can do if he wants to stay.

964
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:55,482
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?

965
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:58,023
He can look after himself. He's proved that.

966
00:50:58,076 --> 00:50:59,569
COMBO: See yous later.

967
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:01,608
Come on, love.

968
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,697
Come on, now.

969
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:12,574
See you later, mate.

970
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,569
Don't forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.

971
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,325
You're a good man.

972
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:23,359
A brave good man, man.

973
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:26,074
A really good man.

974
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:29,946
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot Noodles or something.

975
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:32,742
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.

976
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:53,241
Don't worry about it.

977
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:56,234
I'll have a word with Woody.

978
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:58,276
I'll sort it, I promise you.

979
00:51:58,327 --> 00:51:59,902
I just feel really bad.

980
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,907
He looked gutted, Combo.

981
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:04,191
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...

982
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:06,234
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.

983
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:08,276
Woody's not like me and you.

984
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,909
No, he's fucking certainly not like you.

985
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:15,902
No-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.

986
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:17,693
- Really?
- Honest.

987
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:18,773
Honest.

988
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:21,532
It's like looking in the mirror.

989
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:24,820
20 years ago, when I was fucking 12,

990
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,906
taking swings at big men.

991
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:30,317
I don't know, I just don't like
people speaking about my dad,

992
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,158
even in a nice way.

993
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:34,903
I don't even like people
speaking about the war.

994
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:39,025
You loved him, didn't you?

995
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:42,982
Yeah.

996
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,574
And then you lost him.

997
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:53,111
(Whispers): Yeah.

998
00:52:55,493 --> 00:52:57,116
I know what it's like.

999
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:00,483
To have people walk out on you.

1000
00:53:00,534 --> 00:53:03,106
To have people just fucking leave you.

1001
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:08,740
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.

1002
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:11,942
If you ever want anyone to talk to...

1003
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:15,158
...someone to cry with

1004
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:17,487
or just to fucking have a hug

1005
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:19,525
or punch the fuck out of 'em,

1006
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:21,732
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.

1007
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,775
I won't turn my back on you.

1008
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,741
I promise you that.

1009
00:53:31,118 --> 00:53:32,149
Spit.

1010
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:36,530
That's a man's handshake, that.

1011
00:53:36,576 --> 00:53:38,034
I promise you.

1012
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:41,275
I won't let you down.

1013
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:44,573
# Soldiers of Islam
are loading their guns

1014
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:46,608
# They're getting ready

1015
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,489
# But the Russian tanks
are mowing them down

1016
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:53,324
# They're getting ready

1017
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:59,360
# There's children in Africa
with Tommy guns

1018
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,986
# Getting ready

1019
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:05,821
# While the Islam armies
are beckoning on

1020
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,906
# They're getting ready

1021
00:54:09,284 --> 00:54:11,275
# There's a burning sun

1022
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:14,774
# And it sets in the Western world

1023
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,025
# But it rises in the East

1024
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:22,484
# And pretty soon
it's gonna burn your temples down

1025
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:26,566
# While the heads of state
are having their fun

1026
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:28,944
# Are they ready?

1027
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:34,197
# We're looking at the world
through the barrel of a gun

1028
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:35,949
# Are we ready?

1029
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:41,113
# And you stand there
beating on your little war drum

1030
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,949
# Are you ready...

1031
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:46,742
(Dog barks)

1032
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:50,198
- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.

1033
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:52,399
- Just get on with it.
(Growls)

1034
00:54:52,451 --> 00:54:54,821
Excuse me, mate,
is there a toilet here?

1035
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,817
Ah, my arse is killing.

1036
00:54:59,368 --> 00:55:01,358
- All right, boss?
- Round the back.

1037
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,400
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.

1038
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:07,067
(Chatter)

1039
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,658
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.

1040
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,324
Buffet food...

1041
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:19,116
All right, look, yous three,

1042
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,613
yous three, I want yous on your best behaviour.

1043
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,734
Right? Your fucking best behaviour.

1044
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:27,026
SHAUN: Ooh, he's got a nice car!

1045
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,492
Nice car.

1046
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:33,781
Here they are.
Wait there. Hold it back, lads.

1047
00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:35,817
- Just wait there.
- Come on.

1048
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:38,403
Just wait there.
Behave yourself. Wait there.

1049
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,909
ARTHUR: You all right?

1050
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:43,405
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.

1051
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:45,240
All right, Lenny, mate.

1052
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:47,275
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.

1053
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:48,784
SHAUN: All right, mate.

1054
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:53,233
LENNY: Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.

1055
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,528
No.

1056
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:56,318
An almost forbidden word.

1057
00:55:57,326 --> 00:55:59,732
A word that means more to me
than any other.

1058
00:56:00,785 --> 00:56:02,610
That word is "England".

1059
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,034
MEN: Yes!

1060
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:13,739
Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world,
like a banner.

1061
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:15,775
It was a word that stood for power.

1062
00:56:16,785 --> 00:56:19,072
A word that stood for freedom.

1063
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,109
A word that stood for respect.

1064
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:23,611
But today,

1065
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,108
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.

1066
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,652
Gadge, are you honestly...

1067
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:31,984
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,

1068
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,026
the word "Englishman".

1069
00:56:34,077 --> 00:56:35,237
ALL: Yes! Yes!

1070
00:56:35,284 --> 00:56:36,279
Yes!

1071
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:40,859
Now we've been marginalised.

1072
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,901
We've been called "cranks".

1073
00:56:42,952 --> 00:56:44,776
We're not cranks.

1074
00:56:44,827 --> 00:56:47,031
Some people say we're racists.

1075
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:49,316
We're not racists. We're realists.

1076
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:51,821
Some people call us Nazis.

1077
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,859
We're not Nazis.

1078
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,027
No, what we are, we are nationalists.

1079
00:56:57,077 --> 00:57:00,857
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonhole us like this.

1080
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,778
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.

1081
00:57:03,827 --> 00:57:05,817
- Fear.
ALL: Yeah.

1082
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:07,444
They fear us.

1083
00:57:07,493 --> 00:57:11,439
They fear us because we are the true voice
of the people of this country.

1084
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,318
- Yes!
COMBO: Yes, Lenny.

1085
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:15,405
People who work hard,

1086
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:17,109
pay their way,

1087
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:19,862
it don't matter
what their ethnic background is,

1088
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,232
I welcome with open arms in this country.

1089
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:24,987
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.

1090
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:28,033
These are the people that need to go back.

1091
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:29,866
ALL: Yes!

1092
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,486
Send them back!

1093
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:34,070
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!

1094
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:35,492
Send them back!

1095
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,905
An English king on a battlefield once said,

1096
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:41,780
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,

1097
00:57:41,827 --> 00:57:45,523
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers."

1098
00:57:45,576 --> 00:57:47,982
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.

1099
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:50,606
ALL: Yes!
- It is the time for action.

1100
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,611
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.

1101
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,200
ALL: Yes!

1102
00:57:55,243 --> 00:57:57,696
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!

1103
00:57:57,743 --> 00:57:58,940
Yes!

1104
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:01,279
Yes! Go on, Lenny! Go on, Lenny!

1105
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:03,780
Are you ready to return to the fight?

1106
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:04,857
ALL: Yes!

1107
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,480
- Are you ready to shed blood?
ALL: Yes!

1108
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:10,651
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?

1109
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:11,863
ALL: Yes!

1110
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,113
(All chant): Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1111
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,617
Lenny! Lenny...

1112
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,107
Gentlemen, join our band of brothers.
Sign up today.

1113
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:21,114
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1114
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,190
Yes!

1115
00:58:22,243 --> 00:58:24,862
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

1116
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,445
- Amazing that.
- You're dead right.

1117
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:33,613
PUKEY: Fucking, Gadge.
- What?

1118
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,650
Do you not feel bad about Woody?

1119
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:38,368
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.

1120
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:40,442
Look at all these people in here.

1121
00:58:40,493 --> 00:58:42,069
This is right.

1122
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,820
If it wasn't right,
all these wouldn't be here.

1123
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:46,906
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.

1124
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:49,618
Do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?

1125
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,112
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.

1126
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:53,736
I'm still his friend.

1127
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:56,695
MEGGY: Comb...

1128
00:58:56,743 --> 00:59:00,488
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.

1129
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:04,448
Are you gonna fucking report me?

1130
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:06,116
Well, it's illegal.

1131
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:11,064
We're really squashed in the back here.

1132
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:14,442
Can one of us come up the front?

1133
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,067
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

1134
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,282
Don't look, Comb.

1135
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:30,903
What is it, lad?

1136
00:59:35,118 --> 00:59:36,492
(Chuckles)

1137
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,110
Fuck off!

1138
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:40,565
That's my fucking boy! Look at that.

1139
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:44,315
That's why he's in the fucking front,
Meggy, you fucking gobshite.

1140
00:59:44,368 --> 00:59:47,117
- Do you like it?
- It's fucking brilliant, that.

1141
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,569
Fucking brilliant.

1142
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,982
Do you reckon Lenny'll mind
that we nicked it?

1143
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:54,945
No, will he fuck. That's going in
the middle of the wall, back in the flat.

1144
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:56,983
We'll build all our stuff round that.

1145
00:59:57,034 --> 01:00:00,032
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.

1146
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:03,442
- Glad you like it.
- Nice one, son.

1147
01:00:03,493 --> 01:00:05,448
MEGGY: What's it called, that flag?

1148
01:00:05,493 --> 01:00:07,780
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?

1149
01:00:07,827 --> 01:00:10,860
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.

1150
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:13,859
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

1151
01:00:15,493 --> 01:00:17,484
Yeah, I am. I was thinking, mate.

1152
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,525
You seem a bit quiet, lad.

1153
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,033
Yeah.

1154
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:27,281
You got a problem, then, or what?

1155
01:00:27,326 --> 01:00:30,075
No, I've just got things on my mind, Combo.

1156
01:00:30,118 --> 01:00:31,575
Like what?

1157
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:34,985
Well, like...

1158
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:38,025
Well, can I ask you something?

1159
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:42,032
Do you really believe
in all that shit, Combo?

1160
01:00:46,451 --> 01:00:48,109
GADGET: Fucking hell, Comb!

1161
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:50,316
Oi, Gadge, come with me.
He's getting me out.

1162
01:00:50,368 --> 01:00:53,236
Open the fucking door!
Get fucking out now!

1163
01:00:53,285 --> 01:00:56,117
- Get fucking out!
- All right, all right, all right.

1164
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:58,565
Out of the car.
Get out, you little fucking shitbag.

1165
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,608
You...

1166
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,651
- don't you fucking ever...
- (Groans)

1167
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:06,938
...fucking ever, ever undermine me again
in front of my fucking troops.

1168
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:08,983
Do you understand me?

1169
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:11,239
Do you understand me? Eh? Yeah?

1170
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:14,532
Now, fuck off back to Woody,
you little fucking queer.

1171
01:01:14,577 --> 01:01:16,781
Go on, fuck off! Fuck off!

1172
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:19,149
- You little queer.
- Oi, lads.

1173
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,067
- Oi, Shaun, man, come.
- Leave him alone.

1174
01:01:22,118 --> 01:01:24,108
- Oi, come out.
- Sorry, mate.

1175
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:26,364
- I can't.
- Fuck off. Leave him alone. Walk!

1176
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,027
- (Others scream)
- What the fuck?

1177
01:01:28,076 --> 01:01:30,150
Waaaah!

1178
01:02:08,368 --> 01:02:12,362
Right, this is where all the fucking Pakis
go to work in the chicken factory.

1179
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,242
- Fucking do it, boys.
- Can we go to the chicken factory?

1180
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:18,239
- Just fucking do it.
- What shall I put?

1181
01:02:18,285 --> 01:02:20,275
Anything. Put anything you want.

1182
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,775
WOMAN: Fucking bastards!

1183
01:02:32,826 --> 01:02:36,655
Don't fucking come back,
you fucking little whore!

1184
01:02:39,452 --> 01:02:41,442
- Fuck off.
(Combo chuckles)

1185
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,984
Go on. On your own.

1186
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:47,648
Yeah, fuck off, you Paki bastards!

1187
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:49,324
- Fuck off.
- Go on, son!

1188
01:02:50,326 --> 01:02:51,783
Hey-hey!

1189
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:56,527
COMBO: Look at these
little fucking sewer rats. Look.

1190
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,157
Fucking vermin.

1191
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,487
Oi!

1192
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:14,242
COMBO: Now, that's our ball now.
Right? And we're playing here.

1193
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:17,899
So, I suggest you take fucking
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

1194
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,740
and fuck off home.

1195
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,148
If I see you on my streets again...

1196
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:26,444
...I'll slash you.

1197
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:31,731
And it'll be a hundred times
fucking worse.

1198
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,159
- All right?
- Yeah.

1199
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:36,116
Now run home,
cos Mummy's cooking curry. Go on.

1200
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,487
Meggy!

1201
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:41,658
Get in goal, Gadge.

1202
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,652
Have a look in there.

1203
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:48,027
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1204
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,150
We need to fly that with pride.

1205
01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:59,152
See you tonight, Woody.

1206
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:23,907
Hey, Meggy, how do you spell "off"?
Is it one "f" or two?

1207
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:26,824
Meggy, one "f" or two?

1208
01:05:28,868 --> 01:05:30,527
(Bell dings)

1209
01:05:35,452 --> 01:05:37,442
Get me... a hundred fags,

1210
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:41,534
two bottles of wine, a bottle of whisky,
and ten cans of lager now.

1211
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,780
You know what you're gonna have?
Nothing.

1212
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:44,821
What?

1213
01:05:44,868 --> 01:05:47,357
You know you're not supposed
to be here. Go. Out.

1214
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,531
Just fucking get 'em, you Paki bastard!

1215
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:51,991
What did you say?

1216
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:55,151
Get them, you filthy Paki bastard.

1217
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,985
Right, that's it.

1218
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,695
- Just... Wait till I just...
(Shaun laughs)

1219
01:06:03,743 --> 01:06:04,856
Get off!

1220
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,280
- Get out!
- What's going on, mate? Problem?

1221
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:09,116
He's been calling me a Paki bastard.

1222
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,533
Open the door.

1223
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:13,112
Get your fucking hands off him now!

1224
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,985
Fucking hands off him!

1225
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:18,483
Take what you want, kid.
Take the fucking whisky and the ciggies.

1226
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:20,525
Oi, oi!

1227
01:06:21,951 --> 01:06:23,942
Go on, lads, get the gear.

1228
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,984
Come on. Everything.

1229
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:28,653
Come on, hurry up, don't fuck about.

1230
01:06:31,243 --> 01:06:33,234
What are you fucking doing?

1231
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:36,318
- I'm having a shit.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, man!

1232
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,359
- Put your arse away.
SHAUN: You bastard.

1233
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,525
Come on, hurry up. Get the stuff, mate.

1234
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:44,273
For fuck's sake, we need booze
and fags for tonight, lads. Come on.

1235
01:06:44,327 --> 01:06:47,774
Fucking hell, Gadge, could you get
any more fucking sweets, man?

1236
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:49,106
Fucking hell.

1237
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,447
- Put 'em in the car.
- Come on.

1238
01:06:51,492 --> 01:06:52,736
Paki!

1239
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,616
SHAUN: Yeah, Paki.

1240
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:57,983
Picking on a kid, mate? Fucking hell.

1241
01:06:58,035 --> 01:07:00,440
Picking on a fucking kid, was you?

1242
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:02,151
- Eh?
- Take what you want and go.

1243
01:07:02,243 --> 01:07:06,107
Shut up! I'm talking.
I'm your fucking size. Fuck with me.

1244
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,901
You've got what you want. Just go now.

1245
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:09,741
Don't you fucking dare backchat me,

1246
01:07:09,784 --> 01:07:14,074
cos I will slay you now where you fucking
stand, you fucking Paki cunt.

1247
01:07:14,118 --> 01:07:15,232
Right?

1248
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:17,654
You listen to fucking me!

1249
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:20,616
That fucking kid's dad died
for this fucking country.

1250
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:22,531
What have you fucking done for it?

1251
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:25,657
Fuck all, but take fucking jobs
off decent people.

1252
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:27,905
Now, listen, son, listen good.

1253
01:07:27,951 --> 01:07:31,731
We'll be back here whenever we want,
right, cos this is fucking ours now.

1254
01:07:31,784 --> 01:07:34,071
This is ours, this, fucking Sandhu.

1255
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:36,487
Don't forget that. Any fucking time.

1256
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:39,449
And clean the place up.
It fucking stinks of curry.

1257
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:40,950
Fucking stinks.

1258
01:07:40,993 --> 01:07:43,316
Reeks of the fucking shit.

1259
01:07:43,368 --> 01:07:45,654
What yous doing, boys?

1260
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:49,281
Get in the fucking car, will you?
Get in the fucking car!

1261
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:51,116
You've got the fucking keys.

1262
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,486
(Laughter)

1263
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:55,983
Get in the fucking car now.
Look at my fucking arse!

1264
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,439
Get in the fucking car. Hurry up!

1265
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,525
MEGGY: This is a very posh area.

1266
01:08:01,576 --> 01:08:04,657
BANJO: What did you say
her dad did for a living, Gadget?

1267
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:06,905
- Works on the oil rigs.
- Fucking hell.

1268
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:09,949
MEGGY: I fancy some posh totty.
COMBO: Which one is it?

1269
01:08:09,993 --> 01:08:12,280
- The one with the balloons.
BANJO: Here.

1270
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:13,819
Fucking hell.

1271
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:15,859
MEGGY: Put the brakes on.

1272
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,485
COMBO: That'll do us, won't it?

1273
01:08:17,534 --> 01:08:19,525
SHAUN: I can't wait to see Smell.

1274
01:08:19,576 --> 01:08:21,982
- So, Smell, you're finally legal.
- Yeah.

1275
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:24,025
Not that it ever made a difference.

1276
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:25,485
(Laughter)

1277
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,692
- Ready? Three...
- Wait, wait.

1278
01:08:31,743 --> 01:08:33,733
Come on. Wait there. Are we all here?

1279
01:08:33,785 --> 01:08:35,278
COMBO: Right.
(Knocks on door)

1280
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:38,443
- Smell, get us a drink.
MILKY: I've had chronic pains.

1281
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,116
- Strippers!
- Constipation.

1282
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,316
- Someone at the door!
- Stop now, yeah?

1283
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,647
Hi, lad.

1284
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:45,692
- Hello.
- Woody! Woody!

1285
01:08:45,743 --> 01:08:47,070
SHAUN: Hello-o-o.

1286
01:08:47,118 --> 01:08:50,779
- Hello-o-o.
- Hello-o-o.

1287
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,817
Hello-o-o.

1288
01:08:52,868 --> 01:08:54,526
# Happy...
# Happy...

1289
01:08:54,743 --> 01:08:56,449
# Happy...
# Happy...

1290
01:08:56,493 --> 01:08:58,069
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

1291
01:08:58,285 --> 01:09:02,065
# Happy birthday
# Happy birthday

1292
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:04,440
Happy birthday, Smell!

1293
01:09:04,493 --> 01:09:06,318
(Lads laugh)

1294
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:08,442
GADGET: It was better in the car.

1295
01:09:08,493 --> 01:09:10,116
Woo! Well, I'm gonna get off.

1296
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,234
Past my bedtime and there's a...

1297
01:09:12,285 --> 01:09:14,773
I've got to tape summat on aardvarks.

1298
01:09:14,826 --> 01:09:17,150
- You're not going, are you?
SHAUN: Woody, stay.

1299
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:19,239
- Are you coming, Milk?
- Yeah, mate.

1300
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:21,240
Please, Woods, man, don't go.

1301
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:23,820
Oh, no, it's nothing personal
with you, mate.

1302
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,693
I'm just gonna get off.

1303
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:28,776
Come on, Wood. Fucking hell,
I've brought booze and everything.

1304
01:09:28,826 --> 01:09:30,284
Can't we bury the hatchet?

1305
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:33,774
I know what you've come for, man.
I'd rather get off, like.

1306
01:09:33,826 --> 01:09:37,523
It's this thing on aardvarks,
I'm really eager to watch it.

1307
01:09:37,576 --> 01:09:40,942
Come on, then, let's have you.
Come on, let's have you, folks.

1308
01:09:40,993 --> 01:09:43,695
You have a good birthday, you,
all right, lovey?

1309
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:45,650
Sorry to be missioning it off.

1310
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:48,201
Nice one, mate.

1311
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:50,033
You look after yourself, you.

1312
01:09:50,077 --> 01:09:52,067
- Bye, Woody.
- See you, Tubby.

1313
01:09:52,118 --> 01:09:53,445
Bye, Milky.

1314
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,283
- Bye, Pob.
- See you later, folks.

1315
01:09:55,326 --> 01:09:57,862
- Come on, Puke.
- See you later, Puke.

1316
01:09:58,951 --> 01:10:01,275
You're a twat, mate!
You're a fucking w...

1317
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,074
See you later. Have a good night.

1318
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:06,571
- (Laughter)
MEGGY: If only you knew.

1319
01:10:11,701 --> 01:10:13,526
Happy birthday, Smell.

1320
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,531
- Smell!
- What's that?

1321
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:17,034
Porno?

1322
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:19,315
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?

1323
01:10:19,368 --> 01:10:21,691
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.

1324
01:10:21,743 --> 01:10:23,532
I thought she might like it.

1325
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:25,365
Smell, are you ready?

1326
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:27,028
The er... magicians.

1327
01:10:27,077 --> 01:10:28,533
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1328
01:10:28,576 --> 01:10:30,946
SHAUN AND COMBO:
Three... two... one.

1329
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,984
BOTH: Alakazam! Yeah!

1330
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:35,026
- Alaka... Alakazam.
- Alakazam.

1331
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:36,533
Wahey!

1332
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:39,734
Happy birthday, Smell.

1333
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,360
- Happy...
- (Laughter)

1334
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,405
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1335
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:47,532
- Do you want me to put it on the table?
- Yeah, please.

1336
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,273
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.

1337
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:54,029
You don't mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...

1338
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:58,117
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.

1339
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,736
Happy birthday, Smell.

1340
01:11:05,576 --> 01:11:07,567
Do you think my party's going all right?

1341
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,318
It's been all right, yeah.

1342
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:11,358
Better if Woody was here.

1343
01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:14,360
Yeah, I know, man.
I don't know why they left.

1344
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:16,447
They just kind of got up and went.

1345
01:11:16,493 --> 01:11:19,491
I don't think Woody was standing
any of it from Combo.

1346
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:24,237
I mean, I don't know what's going on
with those two,

1347
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:26,239
but there's some real tension.

1348
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:29,069
I can sense some real tension
between them.

1349
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,109
Was you happy when you saw me?

1350
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,439
Yeah.

1351
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:34,649
I liked it when you gave me that cake.

1352
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,491
I thought it was cool.

1353
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:38,158
Did you make it?

1354
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,155
Yeah.

1355
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,115
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

1356
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,700
I didn't think you did.

1357
01:11:44,743 --> 01:11:47,030
Did you buy it?

1358
01:11:47,077 --> 01:11:48,902
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.

1359
01:11:50,534 --> 01:11:52,858
But what did you think to the other night?

1360
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:55,948
Yeah.

1361
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:59,358
Do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.

1362
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:01,028
Yeah, that was...

1363
01:12:01,077 --> 01:12:02,866
It was all right, yeah.

1364
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,817
Did you not think much to it?

1365
01:12:04,868 --> 01:12:06,277
Oh, yeah.

1366
01:12:07,368 --> 01:12:09,158
It was really nice.

1367
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:12,028
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,

1368
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,113
I just thought
that you weren't that into it.

1369
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,774
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.

1370
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:22,488
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.

1371
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:24,739
No, I've seen a pair of tits, but...

1372
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:26,360
I didn't suck 'em.

1373
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:27,481
Oh.

1374
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:30,898
Right.

1375
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:35,197
That's why then, isn't it?
It's not cos you didn't want to or anything?

1376
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:36,700
Yeah, I just...

1377
01:12:36,743 --> 01:12:39,658
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...

1378
01:12:40,618 --> 01:12:43,107
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldn't do it.

1379
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,154
Yeah.

1380
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,862
Not that many people have done it to me.

1381
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:48,901
I just thought it'd be nice, like.

1382
01:12:48,952 --> 01:12:50,942
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.

1383
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,492
I was...

1384
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,276
meaning to ask you.

1385
01:12:57,035 --> 01:13:00,447
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?

1386
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:03,443
Honestly?

1387
01:13:06,701 --> 01:13:08,739
Yeah, I'd love to be.

1388
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,491
It'd be really nice.

1389
01:13:10,535 --> 01:13:14,315
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.

1390
01:13:14,368 --> 01:13:18,907
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.

1391
01:13:18,952 --> 01:13:20,693
Will you be all right for...

1392
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:23,278
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?

1393
01:13:24,284 --> 01:13:26,275
Cos I'm not embarrassed.

1394
01:13:26,326 --> 01:13:27,903
I think you're lovely.

1395
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:38,527
<i>MARGARET THATCHER:to maintain peace,
with freedom and justice is always expensive.</i>

1396

1402

(Sighs)

1406
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:11,988
(Horn)

1407
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:14,653
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.

1408
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,491
Where are you off? Court?

1409
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,732
No. I...

1410
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:19,740
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

1411
01:14:19,785 --> 01:14:21,941
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?

1412
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:24,149
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?

1413
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:25,991
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1414
01:14:26,034 --> 01:14:27,658
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.

1415
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:29,573
For fu... I'm going to work.

1416
01:14:29,618 --> 01:14:32,651
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?

1417
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,407
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

1418
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:37,734
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.

1419
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:40,071
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?

1420
01:14:40,118 --> 01:14:43,151
You've ruined everything?
You've broken Woody's fucking heart?

1421
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:46,649
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.

1422
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:48,573
I want to talk about other stuff.

1423
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:52,065
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?

1424
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:54,274
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?

1425
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:57,359
No, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.

1426
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,526
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- No, don't come back.

1427
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:02,484
I'll come to yours later on.

1428
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:04,858
To mine?
You can have two minutes now.

1429
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,699
You've got two fucking minutes.

1430
01:15:06,743 --> 01:15:08,319
OK. Sound.

1431
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:23,189
Come on, then. I'm late for work.

1432
01:15:28,118 --> 01:15:30,607
There's something for you
in the glove box.

1433
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,402
A box.

1434
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,400
You make this when you was in prison?

1435
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:46,482
Yeah.

1436
01:15:48,993 --> 01:15:50,402
Thanks.

1437
01:15:54,785 --> 01:15:56,158
Lol...

1438
01:15:57,243 --> 01:15:58,238
Erm...

1439
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:03,487
Since that night that we spent together,

1440
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:05,691
before I went inside...

1441
01:16:06,702 --> 01:16:09,569
...I haven't been able to think about
anything else.

1442
01:16:10,785 --> 01:16:12,194
No, I haven't.

1443
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:14,732
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.

1444
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,275
And, to be honest with you, Lol...

1445
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:21,109
...just thinking of you...

1446
01:16:22,201 --> 01:16:24,950
...got me through
them three and a half years inside.

1447
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:27,778
I mean...

1448
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,776
That was the best night of my life.

1449
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:34,776
It was the worst night of my life.

1450
01:16:36,785 --> 01:16:38,063
Why?

1451
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:41,780
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.

1452
01:16:44,285 --> 01:16:46,074
It was... It was beautiful.

1453
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,741
No, I was 16.

1454
01:16:47,785 --> 01:16:49,940
I was pissed off my head.

1455
01:16:50,951 --> 01:16:52,777
It wasn't beautiful.

1456
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,902
I love you, Lol.

1457
01:16:58,993 --> 01:16:59,987
What?

1458
01:17:04,034 --> 01:17:05,314
I've...

1459
01:17:06,702 --> 01:17:08,491
I've always loved you.

1460
01:17:09,577 --> 01:17:11,567
It's never gonna happen, Combo.

1461
01:17:13,785 --> 01:17:15,776
(Factory hooter)

1462
01:17:20,827 --> 01:17:22,449
Are we done?

1463
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:23,488
Yeah.

1464
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,486
There's your box.

1465
01:17:33,743 --> 01:17:35,615
(Sighs)

1466
01:17:58,493 --> 01:18:00,116
(Thumps door)

1467
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,531
# TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS:
Pressure Drop

1468
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:13,741
# Pressure

1469
01:18:13,785 --> 01:18:15,491
# Oh, pressure

1470
01:18:15,535 --> 01:18:17,525
# Pressure's gonna drop on you

1471
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:19,567
Why do they call you Smell?

1472
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:24,066
It's kind of similar to Michelle,
if you think about it.

1473
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:27,116
I don't know, really,
if I'm being honest with you.

1474
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,613
- Ah, that's fine.
- It's not cos I'm smelly.

1475
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,065
It's just Michelle and Smell.

1476
01:18:32,118 --> 01:18:34,108
- Right.
- Purely cos it rhymes.

1477
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,027
Well, it sort of rhymes, doesn't it?
Does it rhyme?

1478
01:18:37,118 --> 01:18:38,576
MEGGY: R for Rectum.

1479
01:18:39,577 --> 01:18:40,950
Rabbit.

1480
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,942
- Rub your rectum.
- (Sniggers)

1481
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:46,564
- Oh, rabbit, you said, yeah?
- Yeah.

1482
01:18:46,618 --> 01:18:48,360
Furry rectum.

1483
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,733
Do you reckon
they've got a cassette player?

1484
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:53,319
- Yeah, probably.
- Really?

1485
01:18:53,368 --> 01:18:55,359
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh, I hope so.

1486
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,531
Let's bang some music into their ears.

1487
01:18:57,577 --> 01:18:59,152
That'll be good.

1488
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:06,106
- Is this it?
- Yeah, I can walk straight in.

1489
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,112
Combo!

1490
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,903
(Pob giggles)

1491
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:11,741
That was nice, that was.

1492
01:19:11,784 --> 01:19:13,740
MILKY: Yeah, well, you know.

1493
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:15,408
I do what I do.

1494
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:17,783
You do!

1495
01:19:17,826 --> 01:19:19,319
MILKY: Oh, fuck.

1496
01:19:20,243 --> 01:19:22,234
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1497
01:19:22,285 --> 01:19:24,571
- All right, Milks?
- What are you saying, mate?

1498
01:19:24,618 --> 01:19:26,111
How are you doing?

1499
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,154
Sound.

1500
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:28,907
What have you two been up to?

1501
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:31,191
You know how it is, having a bit of fun.

1502
01:19:35,742 --> 01:19:37,533
What's up, mate?

1503
01:19:38,535 --> 01:19:39,908
You look down.

1504
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:41,942
One of them days.
You know what I mean?

1505
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,361
Look, man, erm...

1506
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:46,991
Any chance you can get me any weed?

1507
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:50,440
I just want a smoke.
You know what I mean?

1508
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:53,951
I mean, I've only got, like,
one spliff left on me.

1509
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:55,983
I can't really give that away.

1510
01:19:56,034 --> 01:19:58,736
- What were you after?
- About an ounce or summat.

1511
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,242
Fucking hell.

1512
01:20:00,285 --> 01:20:01,741
No, mate, no.

1513
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:04,356
I couldn't get anything like that big, no way.

1514
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:07,739
I mean, I'll give you half, I'll split it.
Give you half of it.

1515
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:10,775
Well, I mean, I might be able to...

1516
01:20:11,784 --> 01:20:13,575
...to get... get like that much.

1517
01:20:13,618 --> 01:20:15,027
What?

1518
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,405
What?

1519
01:20:18,201 --> 01:20:20,192
I thought you were gonna
walk me home.

1520
01:20:20,243 --> 01:20:23,940
You can be there in, like, 15 minutes,
if you get a move on now.

1521
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:27,025
You're only a mile down the road.

1522
01:20:27,076 --> 01:20:28,699
Are you joking?

1523
01:20:28,743 --> 01:20:29,737
What?

1524
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,618
Oh, fuck you, you selfish bastard.

1525
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,782
Fuckin' hell, man.

1526
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:42,907
BOTH: Women!

1527
01:20:44,784 --> 01:20:46,775
SMELL: Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1528
01:20:46,826 --> 01:20:48,450
Watch it.

1529
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,697
- Banjo for a banjo.
- Yeah.

1530
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:54,488
Ah.

1531
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:56,158
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1532
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:58,192
- Come on, Smell.
SMELL: Oh, no.

1533
01:20:58,243 --> 01:21:01,738
- Come on.
- Oh, God! It's gonna keel over!

1534
01:21:01,784 --> 01:21:03,361
Wait for it.

1535
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,617
(All cheer)

1536
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,733
- Kick Donkey!
- Two sugars.

1537
01:21:08,784 --> 01:21:10,194
Kick Donkey.

1538
01:21:10,243 --> 01:21:13,822
SMELL: I'm not making tea.
GADGET: Kick Donkey, Kick Donkey...

1539
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:23,484
Anyone got a problem?

1540
01:21:23,535 --> 01:21:24,992
No problem.

1541
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,608
No. Problem with what, man?

1542
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:34,605
Good to see you, Milk.
Are you all right, mate?

1543
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,110
All right, Tubbs.

1544
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:40,486
Is Woody on his way?

1545
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:42,111
No. Just Milky.

1546
01:21:44,243 --> 01:21:46,945
- All right, Milks?
- Are you all right, mate?

1547
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:06,326
No problem.

1548
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,116
Sit down, Milks.

1549
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:13,992
That's good.

1550
01:22:14,993 --> 01:22:16,984
That means we can all get stoned.

1551
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:19,694

01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:02,606
# You and me...

1566
01:23:04,118 --> 01:23:05,113
Ow!

1567
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,733
# I know time's gonna take its toll...

1568
01:23:10,743 --> 01:23:12,568
Are you all right, Gads?

1569
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:15,107
# We have to pay for the love...

1570
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,778
Take him home, love. He looks fucked.

1571
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:22,523
# It's a sin and we know...

1572
01:23:22,576 --> 01:23:24,283
It's all right, Gadge, lad.

1573
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:27,359
Have you fucking seen how white he is!

1574
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:30,028
I've never seen anyone
look that fucking sick!

1575
01:23:31,035 --> 01:23:33,025
That fucking kid's arse went white!

1576
01:23:34,035 --> 01:23:36,025
#... steal away...

1577
01:23:37,035 --> 01:23:38,314
Come on.

1578
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,738
# To the dark end

1579
01:23:40,784 --> 01:23:42,905
# Of the street...

1580
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,279
Oh, man.

1581
01:23:44,327 --> 01:23:45,819
Here you are.

1582
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,817
No, seriously, Combo, man.

1583
01:23:48,951 --> 01:23:52,234
I've got to tell you, mate,
you're a good geezer, man.

1584
01:23:52,285 --> 01:23:54,690
Seriously. I mean, this... this music,

1585
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:59,945
this sort of music is the sort of stuff
that I listen to, my uncles listen to.

1586
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,825
Yeah, to me, this is good music.

1587
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:07,567
What you've gotta remember, Milks,
right, is... is I'm an original skinhead.

1588
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:09,111
'69, me.

1589
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:14,113
But it was people like your uncle,
your uncle that introduced that stuff to me.

1590
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,360
The soul of that music
just fucking resonated within us,

1591
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,068
do you know what I mean?

1592
01:24:19,118 --> 01:24:23,064
And it's people... it's skinheads, like you,
true skinheads, like you,

1593
01:24:23,118 --> 01:24:24,908
keeping that flame alive.

1594
01:24:24,951 --> 01:24:27,156
Yeah. It was fucking unity.

1595
01:24:27,202 --> 01:24:29,868
It was black and white, together.
Know what I mean?

1596
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:32,399
It should not be forgotten.
It shouldn't die.

1597
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:36,113
You're still flying that flag in that fucking
get-out that you're wearing.

1598
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,569
It's proper.

1599
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:39,075
It's real, man.

1600
01:24:39,118 --> 01:24:40,445
Oh, man.

1601
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:44,118
That's it, man,
we're like brothers now. Yeah?

1602
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,238
Serious.

1603
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,151
- For life.
- Yeah, for life.

1604
01:24:48,202 --> 01:24:49,742
Nice one, Combo.

1605
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,326
Hand the spliff over.

1606
01:24:51,368 --> 01:24:54,153
I haven't had a laugh like this
for fucking years.

1607
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:55,575
- Serious.
- For years.

1608
01:24:55,618 --> 01:24:57,822
Here you are. It's been a long time.

1609
01:25:00,202 --> 01:25:02,192
I want some chocolate.

1610
01:25:06,826 --> 01:25:10,239
- There's biscuits in the cupboard.
- Not in that cupboard.

1611
01:25:12,243 --> 01:25:14,447
No, not in that cupboard. I'm starving!

1612
01:25:14,493 --> 01:25:17,989
How can you fucking live like this?
There's not even a mouldy Twiglet.

1613
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:22,566
I'm really starving, man.
I've got the munchies badly.

1614
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:25,402
- Combo, have you eaten the biscuits?
- No.

1615
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:28,236
- Fucking hell.
MILKY: What a night.

1616
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:32,692
So, how many uncles have you got?

1617
01:25:32,743 --> 01:25:33,987
Erm...

1618
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,489
I've got three uncles and two aunties.

1619
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:40,193
So, a big family, then.

1620
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:41,274
Yeah.

1621
01:25:42,327 --> 01:25:46,155
I've got... What is it? 22 cousins.

1622
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,730
One uncle's got, what, seven kids.

1623
01:25:50,785 --> 01:25:52,775
What, to the same woman, like?

1624
01:25:52,826 --> 01:25:54,106
Nah.

1625
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,648
Spread out
between three different women.

1626
01:25:56,701 --> 01:26:00,944
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.

1627
01:26:00,993 --> 01:26:04,074
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?

1628
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,653
Nah, he still sees 'em.

1629
01:26:06,701 --> 01:26:09,155
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.

1630
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:13,989
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.

1631
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,321
A big party till late in the morning.

1632
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,151
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

1633
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:22,986
It is. It's nice having a big family.

1634
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:24,741
Have you got a mum and dad?

1635
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,155
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.

1636
01:26:28,243 --> 01:26:30,115
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.

1637
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,617
Of course, man.

1638
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:34,485
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.

1639
01:26:35,202 --> 01:26:39,942
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.

1640
01:26:39,993 --> 01:26:43,110
Sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.

1641
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,238
But...

1642
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:49,402
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.

1643
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:50,446
Cos...

1644
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:52,946
there was always food on that table.

1645
01:26:52,993 --> 01:26:55,398
That's what I respect that man for.

1646
01:26:55,451 --> 01:26:56,825
Always.

1647
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:00,817
Lucky you, aren't you?

1648
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,402
I tell you...

1649
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:04,442
you know, any, any time...

1650
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:07,655
...you wanna come round
for something to eat,

1651
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:10,699
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.

1652
01:27:10,743 --> 01:27:12,449
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1653
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,693
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.

1654
01:27:15,743 --> 01:27:17,983
She'll cook some chicken.

1655
01:27:18,035 --> 01:27:20,072
She sounds dead lovely, don't she?

1656
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:23,530
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.

1657
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:26,324
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

1658
01:27:26,368 --> 01:27:28,158
Ah, seriously, man, cos...

1659
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:33,072
I'd love for you to do that.
I'd love for you to do that. That'd be nice.

1660
01:27:33,118 --> 01:27:37,574
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?

1661
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:40,284
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...

1662
01:27:40,326 --> 01:27:42,649
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...

1663
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:45,272
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?

1664
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,152
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.

1665
01:27:48,202 --> 01:27:50,441
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.

1666
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:53,159
Fucking hell.

1667
01:27:54,993 --> 01:27:56,735
Got everything, you, didn't you?

1668
01:27:58,743 --> 01:28:01,149
Fucking hell, man. So...

1669
01:28:02,493 --> 01:28:05,444
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?

1670
01:28:08,035 --> 01:28:10,784
I don't know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?

1671
01:28:12,576 --> 01:28:14,567
I know you had a good dad, like, but,

1672
01:28:14,618 --> 01:28:18,991
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?

1673
01:28:19,035 --> 01:28:20,907
I don't know, man.

1674
01:28:20,952 --> 01:28:22,942
What's with the questions, man?

1675
01:28:22,993 --> 01:28:25,316
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

1676
01:28:28,618 --> 01:28:30,739
What do you reckon?

1677
01:28:31,743 --> 01:28:32,738
Niggers.

1678
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,574
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?

1679
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:41,107
You're a fucking nigger. Aren't you?

1680
01:28:44,326 --> 01:28:45,605
Aren't you?

1681
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:48,907
Fucking coon.

1682
01:28:48,952 --> 01:28:51,274
Combo! Just leave him.

1683
01:28:54,785 --> 01:28:56,158
Go on.

1684
01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:00,775
Don't fucking smile at me.

1685
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:02,449
Don't smile at me.

1686
01:29:02,493 --> 01:29:04,448
Milky, just stop smiling at him, please.

1687
01:29:04,493 --> 01:29:08,902
Don't fucking smile at me, cos I'll wipe
the fucking smile off your fucking face.

1688
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:10,658
Yeah? You fucking cunt!

1689
01:29:11,243 --> 01:29:13,696
SHAUN: No!
- Fucking horrible...

1690
01:29:13,743 --> 01:29:16,492
- Fucking bastard!
(Shaun screams)

1691
01:29:18,368 --> 01:29:20,939
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you!

1692
01:29:20,993 --> 01:29:23,197
- I fucking hate you!
SHAUN: Get off!

1693
01:29:23,243 --> 01:29:24,736
Milky!

1694
01:29:24,785 --> 01:29:27,403
- No, Combo, get off him!
- You fucking black bastard!

1695
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,567
I fucking hate you! I fucking hate you.

1696
01:29:30,618 --> 01:29:32,822
I fucking hate you! You fucking nigger!

1697
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,367
- You fucking nigger!
- Milky!

1698
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:37,158
Fuck off! Fuck off!

1699
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:39,571
(Sobs) Combo!

1700
01:29:39,618 --> 01:29:40,566
Milky!

1701
01:29:40,618 --> 01:29:42,739
Milky, man, are you all right?

1702
01:29:42,785 --> 01:29:44,064
Shut up!

1703
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:46,737
Shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out now!

1704
01:29:46,785 --> 01:29:48,574
You little fucking cunt.

1705
01:29:48,618 --> 01:29:51,024
Fuck off, you little bastard!

1706
01:29:51,117 --> 01:29:54,069
- I thought you was winding us up.
- What are you doing, boys?

1707
01:29:54,117 --> 01:29:57,530
BANJO: Fucking all day
we've sat and listened to him.

1708
01:29:57,576 --> 01:29:59,282
I want some of this. We want our bit.

1709
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:00,736
This man?

1710
01:30:00,785 --> 01:30:02,775
- Aargh!
- You fucking mad cunt!

1711
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:05,694
You knobhead!
You fucking horrible fucking cunt!

1712
01:30:05,743 --> 01:30:08,611
You're fucking mad as a March hare.
What's wrong with you?

1713
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:10,526
Fucking leave them alone!

1714
01:30:10,576 --> 01:30:13,243
- Do you want it, as well?
- You're fucking potty.

1715
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:15,571
What? Fuck off, you fucking dickhead!

1716
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:18,901
I'll fucking throttle you,
you fucking fat piece of shit!

1717
01:30:18,952 --> 01:30:22,447
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking goggle-eyed twat!

1718
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,443
Get out. Get out.

1719
01:30:25,493 --> 01:30:28,195
- You need to fucking see someone.
- Get out.

1720
01:30:28,243 --> 01:30:30,233
(Panting): I said, get out. I said, get out.

1721
01:30:30,284 --> 01:30:31,279
Milky...

1722
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:34,739
Leave them alone, will you?
They haven't done nothing to you.

1723
01:30:34,785 --> 01:30:36,740
Fucking leave them two alone.

1724
01:30:36,785 --> 01:30:38,277
Leave them alone.

1725
01:30:38,326 --> 01:30:40,897
They've done...
They've done nothing to you.

1726
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:42,360
You fuck...

1727
01:30:44,118 --> 01:30:45,065
Ah!

1728
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:46,741
(Groans)

1729
01:30:46,785 --> 01:30:48,574
No-o-o!

1730
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:52,358
- (Sobs)
- (Combo groans)

1731
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,282
COMBO: Fucking hell.

1732
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:58,784
COMBO: I'm sorry.

1733
01:30:58,827 --> 01:31:00,817
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1734
01:31:01,535 --> 01:31:03,276
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1735
01:31:04,368 --> 01:31:06,358
(Combo wails)

1736
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,899
Oh, Combo,
what have you done to him?

1737
01:31:08,952 --> 01:31:10,741
Oh, my God!

1738
01:31:10,785 --> 01:31:12,361
COMBO: No, no, no!

1739
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:16,529
Milky?

1740
01:31:16,576 --> 01:31:18,152
Wake up, Milky!

1741
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:19,659
He's OK.

1742
01:31:19,701 --> 01:31:21,443
Milky, wake up!

1743
01:31:21,493 --> 01:31:23,899
Hey, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1744
01:31:25,284 --> 01:31:27,608
It's not my fault. I didn't mean it.

1745
01:31:28,618 --> 01:31:30,692
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

1746
01:31:31,618 --> 01:31:33,739
- Milky, wake up!
- Help me get him...

1747
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:35,941
- Wake up!
- Help me get him to hospital.

1748
01:31:35,993 --> 01:31:38,564
- Help me get him to hospital.
- Get off! Milky!

1749
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,656
Come on, now. Stop it, now.

1750
01:31:40,702 --> 01:31:43,902
Stop the crying.
The crying stops now. You don't cry.

1751
01:31:43,952 --> 01:31:45,741
Real men don't cry.

1752
01:31:45,785 --> 01:31:48,154
Help me get him to the hospital, OK?

1753
01:31:48,201 --> 01:31:49,778
Come on. Let's go.

1754
01:31:49,827 --> 01:31:51,864
Come on, Shaun. Come on. Let's go.

1755
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:53,486
Come on. Come on.

1756
01:32:07,284 --> 01:32:09,275
OK. Come on. Come on.

1757
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:11,317
Help me. Help me. Stop crying!

1758
01:32:11,368 --> 01:32:13,109
Don't look at his face.

1759
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:15,731
Don't look at his face.
Don't look at his face.

1760
01:32:15,785 --> 01:32:17,574
Don't look at his face.

1761
01:32:21,952 --> 01:32:24,025
(Music continues)

1762
01:34:41,285 --> 01:34:42,315
Shaun?

1763
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:46,492
Can I come in?

1764
01:34:47,618 --> 01:34:48,814
Yeah.

1765
01:35:01,577 --> 01:35:03,567
It's my favourite picture of Dad.

1766
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,694
Me too.

1767
01:35:12,034 --> 01:35:13,528
And that one.

1768
01:35:14,784 --> 01:35:16,740
Mm, yeah, that's really nice.

1769
01:35:16,784 --> 01:35:18,905
You really look alike on that one.

1770
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,908
Do you remember where we were
in that one?

1771
01:35:32,118 --> 01:35:33,148
Where?

1772
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:34,445
Goy Farms.

1773
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,821
That was like the best holiday ever.

1774
01:35:53,702 --> 01:35:56,272
Milky's gonna be all right, Shaun,
I promise.

1775
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:06,491
Shaun, are you OK?

1776
01:36:19,326 --> 01:36:20,606
Yeah.

1777
01:36:26,743 --> 01:36:29,776
# CLAYHILL: Please Please Please

1778
