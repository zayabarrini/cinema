1
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:23,748
MAN FACING SOUTHEAST

2
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,258
To My Father

3
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,642
Mirta... my love...

4
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,211
I fired twice, as we agreed.

5
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,855
There were two bullets left for me.

6
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,721
I put the revolver here

7
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,159
and fired the other two shots...

8
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,726
Then I couldn't see anything.

9
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,637
I could only hear her moan.

10
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,632
She was suffering...

11
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,069
I wanted to help her, but
there were no more bullets.

12
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,940
I couldn't see through the blood.

13
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,982
I heard her, but I didn't know
where she was.

14
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:45,948
The blood gushed from me like water
from a broken pipe...

15
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,057
She was gone.

16
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,157
We'd agreed to die together.

17
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,394
She had bought the gun.

18
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,934
I failed her.

19
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,402
How could it be?

20
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,945
You must help me.

21
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,416
<i>He thinks I can help?</i>

22
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,825
I fired twice...

23
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,850
<i>A priest could help more.</i>

24
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,322
There were two bullets left for me.

25
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,957
<i>He'll never rid himself</i>
<i>of those images.</i>

26
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,329
<i>I'll sedate him.</i>

27
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,937
<i>Soon he'll disappear among the rest.</i>

28
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,342
<i>He'll be on more,</i>

29
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,743
<i>but he'll never be himself.</i>

30
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,748
As we agreed.

31
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,381
<i>How would he react if</i>
<i>I touched his hand?</i>

32
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,286
She was moaning...

33
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,556
<i>It would show affection,</i>

34
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,096
<i>tenderness.</i>

35
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,794
<i>My God... How he must need it.</i>

36
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,799
<i>But he can't expect that from me.</i>

37
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:13,242
I put the revolver here and
fired the other two shots.

38
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,738
<i>Neither do I.</i>

39
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,850
I could only hear her moan.
She was suffering.

40
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,310
<i>Poor fool.</i>

41
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,149
<i>He doesn't realize</i>
<i>he's being punished.</i>

42
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,918
<i>A prolonged agony.</i>

43
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,529
I wanted to help her, but
there were no more bullets.

44
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,857
<i>You didn't save yourself.</i>

45
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,660
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

46
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,729
Don't worry, we'll help you.

47
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,673
Excuse me, Doctor. How
many patients have you?

48
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,647
32, I think. You must know it.

49
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,778
- Check the registry.
- I have checked.

50
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,283
- There should be 32.
- Has someone escaped?

51
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,726
Just the opposite.
There's one too many.

52
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,920
I checked the other wards.
Everything's in order.

53
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,692
Nobody's missing.

54
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,631
No new patients have been admitted.

55
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,702
- When did you discover this?
- This morning.

56
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,106
- Which one?
- He must be outside.

57
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,615
He's in the chapel. He's a good man.

58
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,614
He comes from far away.

59
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,143
It's only a series of vibrations,

60
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,107
but they have a good effect
on the men.

61
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,108
Where does the magic lie?

62
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,111
In the instruments?

63
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,118
In the one that wrote it?

64
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,613
In me?

65
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,821
In those that hear it?

66
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,495
I cannot understand what they feel.

67
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,595
Yes, I can understand.

68
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,198
I just can't feel it.

69
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,540
Do you understand?

70
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,969
Excuse me. I am Rantes.

71
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,852
How did you get here?

72
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,844
To earth?

73
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,113
In a spaceship.

74
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,320
You're a Martian.

75
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,227
Doctor, that is an insult.

76
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,566
You are an intelligent man.

77
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,468
Do you always underestimate
your patients like this?

78
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,396
Are you a patient?

79
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,872
No, but I'm not a Martian.

80
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,967
I come from far away...
from another world.

81
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,373
It's pointless to explain.

82
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,379
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

83
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:16,278
But you came in a spaceship
and landed right here...

84
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,716
in our courtyard.

85
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,718
No.

86
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,390
Coordinates 34 degrees latitude south,
61 longitude west.

87
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,535
In a field, near a place called

88
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,900
Junin, I believe.

89
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,132
I shouldn't reveal so much information.

90
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,644
All right, Rantes, or whoever you are...

91
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,748
We're alone... We're not the police.

92
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,417
You're involved in something shady

93
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,217
and want to hide out here.

94
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,317
You're not the first,
who would look here, right?

95
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,462
Look, I don't care what you've done,

96
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,661
but don't waste my time.

97
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,135
If you stay, I'll have
to contact the police.

98
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,932
You know the best way to protect
my mission?

99
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,341
Telling the truth.

100
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,341
Who's going to believe it?

101
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
And the best place to tell the truth

102
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,954
is this.

103
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,855
Anywhere else, you know
what would happen?

104
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,651
They would bring me here.

105
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,788
I would be back here telling you
the same things.

106
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,398
If you're gone tomorrow,
no one will say anything.

107
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,164
If you stay....

108
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,271
Do you know what you're in for?

109
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,606
I know the methods,

110
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,977
all the methods that you humans use.

111
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,328
I think he's faking.
Tomorrow he may be gone.

112
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,532
If he stays, just in case,
give him a sedative.

113
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,132
- What about his file, Doctor?
- Put...

114
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:23,746
Unidentified Flying Patient,
until we find out his name.

115
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,475
Dr. Denis, this is
Dr. Gimenez's secretary.

116
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,373
I'm confirming the interview
on Tuesday at 3.00.

117
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:04,316
Julio, it's Nolasco. I'm calling about
the clinic. Give me a call.

118
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,754
Ciao, a hug.

119
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,520
Horrible machine, tell my Daddy
when you see him

120
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:17,067
that I called to tell him that
Saturday, when he comes to see us,

121
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,636
to take Consuelo and me
to see the Moscow Circus.

122
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,674
Buy the tickets.
Bye, machine.

123
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,436
A kiss to Daddy.

124
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:55,765
<i>If Rantes was faking it, the lengths</i>
<i>that he went to made him sick.</i>

125
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:02,503
<i>He sat for hours without moving,</i>
<i>without blinking. Totally isolated.</i>

126
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:08,611
<i>Immersed in someplace, I began</i>
<i>to suspect that was too far away,</i>

127
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:14,318
<i>but not outwards, as he said,</i>
<i>but inwards.</i>

128
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,717
Rantes, what do you do in the gardens?

129
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,223
You spend hours without moving.

130
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,520
I receive and transmit information.

131
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,127
I told you I need to learn
your identity.

132
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,032
The police will come to take
your fingerprints.

133
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,733
- I hope it doesn't bother you.
- No.

134
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,534
I would find that amusing.

135
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,739
It's just... if my prints
should match

136
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,179
someone who's dead, don't be scared.

137
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,856
Rantes, do you believe
that could happen?

138
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:56,093
I mean, do you... believe that you
could be dead

139
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,763
and be here, in front of me?

140
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,695
Yes. Not in such simple terms,
of course.

141
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,598
But... in reality most of these men
are dead but they're here...

142
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,603
Sometimes in front of you.

143
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,839
They're dead in what way?

144
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,441
What do you think?

145
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,518
You are a sincere son of a bitch,

146
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,116
a faking son of a bitch,
which is even crazier.

147
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,417
My mother would find
your statements amusing.

148
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,629
What's her name?

149
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:38,126
We have no mother. At least
they never told us.

150
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,563
- You're a robot.
- No.

151
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,265
You are all robots.
You just haven't realized it.

152
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,933
All right.

153
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,673
I'm a robot. What are you?

154
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:54,080
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

155
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,045
You are in the prehistory
of the holograms.

156
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,290
Holograms?

157
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:06,522
Yes. A type of photograph
obtained through a laser beam.

158
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,596
It's an experiment done
in our physics laboratories.

159
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,932
We have been able...
How can I explain?

160
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,205
To have those images
take shape in space

161
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,811
through what you would call
a large projector

162
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,609
programmed with a highly
complex computer

163
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:30,212
to include the vital information
for that image to be alive.

164
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:36,818
Let's see... You're telling me
that you are a projection.

165
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,829
In a way.

166
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:43,968
I... my spaceship... We are as images
projected in space.

167
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,264
I say ''images'' for your benefit,

168
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,035
because, in reality, I could
do without your eyes.

169
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,733
You could close them.
I'd still exist.

170
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:57,347
I breathe. You can touch me,
I can touch you.

171
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,920
We are perfect human replicas.
Except for one detail.

172
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,190
We cannot feel.

173
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,727
<i>''I cannot feel. ''</i>

174
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,834
<i>That was one of the most</i>
<i>moving confessions.</i>

175
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,134
<i>I'd ever heard from a patient.</i>

176
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,899
<i>I hadn't been feeling much</i>
<i>for my profession.</i>

177
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,945
<i>I hadn't been so interested in a patient</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

178
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,912
<i>And I hadn't been happy</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

179
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,287
<i>Soon they would take his fingerprints.</i>

180
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:44,127
<i>I guessed that Rantes had been</i>
<i>a mathematician... maybe a physicist.</i>

181
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,226
<i>He had mentioned a physics laboratory.</i>

182
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,230
This is a hologram.

183
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,238
The laser bounces off the object leaving
its impression on the plate.

184
00:17:55,574 --> 00:18:01,171
Then, to reconstruct the image
we use another laser.

185
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:08,419
- Is this an experiment?
- It's a laboratory experience.

186
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,285
The object is registered indirectly
on the photographic plate. Understand?

187
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,688
The hologram represents
the object in code.

188
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:23,599
Could people be photographed
and projected in space?

189
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,837
For example, projecting a person here
so that person would seem reel?

190
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,803
It could be done with pulsating lasers,

191
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,539
but it would just be the image
of its outward appearance

192
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,113
lacking all the other attributes
of a real person.

193
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,623
<i>Why assume that a person who talks</i>
<i>about physics must be a physicist?</i>

194
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:54,928
<i>He could just know about certain</i>
<i>phenomena and make up a story.</i>

195
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,129
<i>Who'd use such information for</i>
<i>non-scientific purposes? What is he?</i>

196
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,500
A writer.

197
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,401
<i>A writer.</i>

198
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,209
<i>A writer or just a reader.</i>

199
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,677
<i>Reader?</i>

200
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,773
<i>Why did I think that?</i>
<i>Reader of what?</i>

201
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,322
<i>Fiction was not one of my interests, but</i>
<i>in Rantes' description of holograms</i>

202
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,720
<i>had a literary feel to it.</i>

203
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,231
<i>Someplace I had read something similar.</i>

204
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:34,001
<i>That business of projecting human</i>
<i>beings... In some book...</i>

205
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,532
<i>and I had it.</i>

206
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,706
<i>''I began to find unknown waves</i>
<i>and vibrations</i>

207
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,805
<i>and devised instruments to capture</i>
<i>and transmit them. ''</i>

208
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,350
<i>''Here's the machine's first component. ''</i>

209
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,752
<i>''The second records,</i>
<i>the third projects. ''</i>

210
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,654
<i>''It doesn't require screen or papers. ''</i>

211
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,127
<i>''If you open all the receivers,</i>
<i>Madeleine appears, complete,</i>

212
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,324
<i>reproduced, identifiable. ''</i>

213
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:08,129
<i>''Remember that we refer to images</i>
<i>extracted from mirrors... with sounds...</i>

214
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:12,869
<i>resistance to touch, taste, the smells,</i>
<i>the temperature,</i>

215
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,476
<i>perfectly synchronized. ''</i>

216
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:21,853
<i>''Morel's Invention. ''</i>
<i>Adolfo Bioy Casares, 1940.</i>

217
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,452
<i>If Rantes had written his story</i>
<i>instead of telling me,</i>

218
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,355
<i>he could have become a famous writer,</i>

219
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,963
<i>instead of the lunatic</i>
<i>I hoped to unmask.</i>

220
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,966
<i>Okay. Rantes could have been</i>
<i>a physicist</i>

221
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,106
<i>or read ''Morel's Invention. ''</i>

222
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,601
<i>But what would that prove?</i>

223
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,573
Take it easy.

224
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,009
There are only two alternatives.

225
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:58,418
Either Rantes is crazy
or he's from another planet.

226
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,460
<i>No, old man.</i>

227
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,429
<i>There cannot be</i>
<i>two alternatives.</i>

228
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,388
- What is it?
- The report on Rantes' fingerprints.

229
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,368
- I don't understand.
- They're not on file.

230
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,163
He doesn't exist.

231
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,168
- Any explanations?
- A Uruguayan...

232
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,645
who suddenly turned up
here would have no records.

233
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,643
He always looks in
the same direction.

234
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,446
He always orients himself
in the same direction

235
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,142
between the water tank and
Pavillion 6.

236
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,450
What direction is that?

237
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,654
- Which way is north?
- There.

238
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,760
Then he faces towards the south.

239
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,393
South...

240
00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:00,404
- Southeast... right?
- Yes, southeast.

241
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,332
Southeast.

242
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,538
And why not southwest?
Or north?

243
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,705
- Southeast.
- What does he say?

244
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,914
That he receives and
transmits information.

245
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,348
Whatever it is... on that line...

246
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,851
there must be some
clue to his past.

247
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,833
We're changing the medication
for the patient in bed 7, Rantes.

248
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,535
He is delirious and he's not improving.

249
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,541
We'll try to depress him.

250
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,245
I want a daily report, O.K.?

251
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:01,393
He's a good man,
he comes from far away.

252
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,547
Everyone seems to like you.

253
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,325
I thought about what you told me

254
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,318
that you couldn't feel.

255
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,691
What about that?

256
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,093
Can we chat?

257
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,336
How about some coffee?

258
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,819
My projection includes all
the information to do many things.

259
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:36,221
To play Bach... and other things
that would surprise you.

260
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,119
To me, it's only information.

261
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,124
Why do psychiatrists lean back
when they listen?

262
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,532
They think it's contagious?

263
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,868
Forgive me. It's just a habit.

264
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,870
Now, Rantes...

265
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,736
- You gave that patient your coat.
- He was cold.

266
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,145
What compelled you to give him
your coat?

267
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:04,277
- He was cold.
- Stop bullshitting me, Rantes.

268
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,788
You felt something for that man.

269
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,187
No, it's a totally rational reaction.

270
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,393
If someone is cold, I help.

271
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,292
You're programmed for that.

272
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,207
- Do you have hallucinations?
- No, you do.

273
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,212
I'm one of your hallucinations.

274
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,217
You're a complete lunatic.

275
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,351
But you're a very special lunatic.

276
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,022
You worry me.

277
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,824
You really do.

278
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,530
I appreciate your worrying about me.

279
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,226
It's not customary to care about
someone else here.

280
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,229
In this hospital?

281
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,372
On this planet.

282
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,073
What about yours?
Tell me about that.

283
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,315
Where did you live?
In a town?

284
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,308
In a city?

285
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,022
No data found. That information
is unavailable. Ask again.

286
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,386
I don't want to deceive you.

287
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,592
I could describe any town, any city...

288
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,595
That would be deceiving you.

289
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,832
It wouldn't be a town
as you understand it...

290
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,497
nor would it be
the past you're seeking.

291
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,709
You're my past... this moment...
this world.

292
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,614
You want to take me to man's past.

293
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,424
But how could you understand that?

294
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,827
Relax, Doctor.
What's worrying you?

295
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:58,564
If I were a dictator and could command
powerful armies, I could understand.

296
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,373
But I'm not.
I'm in an asylum.

297
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,006
Everyone knows that I'm crazy.

298
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,478
You, too, right?

299
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,278
Rantes, you're sick.

300
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,184
I'm a doctor.

301
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,420
I want to cure you, that's all.

302
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,995
I want you to understand me,
not cure me.

303
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:39,910
<i>Even though he didn't believe it,</i>
<i>I tried to understand.</i>

304
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:47,847
<i>In fact, it was becoming my life's main</i>
<i>objective to understand Rantes.</i>

305
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,816
<i>He passed every test, as expected.</i>

306
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:59,224
<i>Sticking to his crazy beliefs, each time</i>
<i>more complex, more perfect.</i>

307
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,631
<i>The intelligence test rated him</i>
<i>as a genius.</i>

308
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:18,281
<i>No analysis showed any</i>
<i>physical abnormality,</i>

309
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,478
<i>all the results indicated</i>
<i>he was healthy.</i>

310
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:29,153
<i>Except for one detail... he claimed</i>
<i>to come from another world.</i>

311
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,457
- We're seeing the circus?
- No.

312
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,652
I didn't have time to buy tickets.

313
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,558
- Where are we going?
- To the zoo.

314
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,162
Again?

315
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,518
What are you doing?
Keep still.

316
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,459
Sit straight. Leave that alone.

317
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,960
Waiter!

318
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,761
Here.

319
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,156
One steak!

320
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,141
- The steak!
- What?

321
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,754
- My steak?
- I put it there.

322
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,752
- Where?
- I left it there.

323
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,686
People are waiting!

324
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,725
- Did you take it?
- Where?

325
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,964
<i>Time went by.</i>

326
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,565
<i>Rantes became just another shadow.</i>
<i>One of many...</i>

327
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:56,745
<i>acknowledged only by the priest,</i>
<i>who now had an incredible organist.</i>

328
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,219
<i>Rantes didn't exist,</i>
<i>except for me.</i>

329
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,522
<i>No other doctor acknowledged him.</i>

330
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:19,634
<i>At that time I was the only witness</i>
<i>to his existence.</i>

331
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:25,308
<i>If Rantes was crazy,</i>
<i>he was crazy only for me.</i>

332
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,210
<i>His delirium didn't diminish.</i>

333
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,515
<i>Apparently, he had avoided</i>
<i>taking the anti-psychotics.</i>

334
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,113
<i>I could have injected him.</i>

335
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:40,217
For some reason, I chose not to.

336
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:46,761
<i>Rantes' delirium was harmless</i>
<i>and for the moment, perfect.</i>

337
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,365
<i>I just had to wait.</i>

338
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,935
<i>I was sure that, at any moment,</i>

339
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,967
<i>he would make a mistake.</i>

340
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,270
I want to ask a favor.

341
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,980
Would you arrange for me
to work in Pathology?

342
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,983
In Pathology? What would
you do in Pathology?

343
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,313
Let's say... cleaning... maintenance.

344
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:18,621
I see, you're bored.
You want to use your hands.

345
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:22,693
- What about the handicraft workshop?
- No, Doctor.

346
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,662
What would you have me make?

347
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,103
Wooden boxes that read
''Souvenir from Nuthouse''?

348
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:33,103
I'm not bored. I want to work
in Pathology.

349
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:38,106
You're my only friend
with any power here.

350
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:43,612
<i>Sending a lunatic to work in Pathology</i>
<i>would make you a lunatic.</i>

351
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,122
<i>The cleaning story is a good pretext.</i>

352
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,726
That's the pretext.
What's the real motive?

353
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,726
To investigate.

354
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,066
- Investigate what?
- Man's brain.

355
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,461
- Your brain?
- No, your brain.

356
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,265
I hate to disappoint you.

357
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:07,968
All signs indicate your brain is exactly
like mine or any other human's.

358
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,571
Then why are you considered sane
and I'm considered insane?

359
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,006
He sure seems like he's
from another planet.

360
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,208
He is a good man. Gentle.

361
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,218
O.K. Leave him with me.
On a conditional basis.

362
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,720
If he behaves, he stays.

363
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,718
He'll be useful.

364
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,727
It's the only way to get an assistant.

365
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,466
There's not even money for coffins.

366
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,472
The other day I sent out two corpse
in the same box.

367
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,436
Behold... a genius.

368
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,372
I wonder what made him go nuts.

369
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,776
When he dies, I get the autopsy.

370
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,479
You're a son of a bitch.

371
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,189
Yes, it's mine.

372
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,550
- All these clippings...
- It's information.

373
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,629
- About what?
- About the world's deadliest weapon.

374
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,161
We know how to defend against
your other weapons.

375
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,862
Not this one. It baffles us.

376
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,437
- What weapon, Rantes?
- Stupidity. Human stupidity.

377
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,141
Why do you say ''us''?

378
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,180
I'm not the only inhabitant
of my planet

379
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,454
nor am I the only one here.

380
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:37,650
For God's sake, Rantes, don't tell me
there are others. You're plenty.

381
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:42,395
This same scene is happening
all over the world.

382
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:47,804
Other Rantes facing other doctors
like you in other nuthouses,

383
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:52,168
having the same discussion
at this very moment.

384
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,973
And we're all saying exactly
the same thing.

385
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,381
Check it out. Call them.

386
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:04,511
Dr. de la Fuente, Madrid.
223-4563.

387
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:10,120
Dr. Lamarque, Lima.
42-6126.

388
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,926
You speak English? French?

389
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:21,237
If one of you would call, you could
change history, but we know you won't.

390
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,331
It is beyond the limits
of what you can accept.

391
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,738
We are beyond those limits.

392
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:36,076
O.K., if I accept all those doctors
are talking to all the Rantes,

393
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,788
what do these clippings mean?

394
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,154
The daily crimes.

395
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,688
If God is within you,
you assassinate God every day.

396
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,792
How does this concern you?

397
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,561
We are preparing the rescue.

398
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,773
Do you see why a nuthouse is
the safest place?

399
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,102
I can tell you this confidential
information

400
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,242
because nobody will believe it.

401
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,911
- What rescue?
- The rescue of the victims,

402
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,114
those who cannot survive
amidst the terror.

403
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,458
Those broken by the horror,

404
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,355
those who are without hope...
here.

405
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,730
It will not be robbery.

406
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:31,234
All you've left out are the words
''Blessed are the Meek''.

407
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,836
You made a mistake in assuming
your role.

408
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,344
You say you are from another planet.

409
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,743
You should have said
you were Christ.

410
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:45,344
My story might've been different
but not your reaction.

411
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:51,085
Rantes, did you have children?

412
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,267
Why do you keep this?

413
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,608
They also cannot live with horror...

414
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,447
and they die like ants.

415
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,125
International Operator,
one moment, please.

416
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,226
International Operator,
one moment, please.

417
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,534
<i>An invasion of Christs</i>
<i>was an amusing idea.</i>

418
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:37,068
<i>God forgive me. The absurdity</i>
<i>of it amused me.</i>

419
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:42,135
<i>The old, official version of one Christ</i>
<i>always seemed absurd,</i>

420
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,146
<i>but it never amused me.</i>

421
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:50,443
<i>I didn't know why, but it was impossible</i>
<i>to get the thought out of my mind.</i>

422
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:55,682
<i>I wondered, if this were true,</i>
<i>why was that Christ a social being,</i>

423
00:44:55,959 --> 00:45:03,593
<i>one with a political approach while</i>
<i>this one isolated himself completely?</i>

424
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,529
<i>Things had not gone well that time.</i>

425
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:11,097
<i>Perhaps this time they decided</i>
<i>to change their tactics.</i>

426
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:17,303
<i>My God! Rantes was probably right</i>
<i>in saying that psychiatrists lean back</i>

427
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,508
<i>to avoid being infected.</i>

428
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:25,017
<i>In his case, I had committed</i>
<i>the indiscretion of not doing it.</i>

429
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,306
Sometimes a perfumed breeze
comes through a window.

430
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,645
Does it call up some old memories?

431
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:27,511
I don't have memories that can be
activated that way...

432
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:35,123
but if I had them, certain smells,
certain perfumes would harm me.

433
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,521
We have lost many agents that way.

434
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,123
- How's that?
- Agents... like me.

435
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,436
They feel things they are not
programmed for

436
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,936
and separate themselves
from the beam.

437
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,638
They have deserted, why?

438
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,337
For things that you
would consider stupid.

439
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,841
Perfume coming through a window,
for example,

440
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:04,220
a woman's fragrance,
a catchy saxophone melody.

441
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:08,486
- A saxophone? Did you know I play
the saxophone? - No.

442
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,820
But, please, Doctor, don't take me
literally.

443
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:19,191
Don't show up with a saxophone
to try to destroy me.

444
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,602
I don't understand something.

445
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,999
You talk about sensations...

446
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,611
sensations that seriously upset
the people of your planet.

447
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:34,606
Combinations are produced which make
our computerized memory

448
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:37,653
begins to malfunction.

449
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,150
We still do not know why.

450
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:48,424
That's why I asked to work in Pathology.
To investigate.

451
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,733
Why don't you stop bullshitting?

452
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,465
I will help you, I really will.

453
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:03,311
I know that you're afraid to see
yourself as merely a man,

454
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:08,180
as a sick man, but don't worry,
I will not abandon you.

455
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:13,987
But you have to help me.
You're a great guy, Rantes.

456
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,985
It's a pity.

457
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,636
You're a great guy, too,
but you're not happy.

458
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,340
You know it, and it doesn't bother you.

459
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:40,005
Human beings resign themselves
to so many destructive things.

460
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,643
They do nothing to change things.

461
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:48,018
Is it stupidity or are you paying
for your sins?

462
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,479
Home again.

463
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:16,510
Rantes, it's still early.

464
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,080
How about some coffee?

465
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,084
Why should I be cured?

466
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,787
Can you give me a serious reason
we can discuss here?

467
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,600
Rantes, if you're not a lunatic,

468
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,704
I would concede that
you are an extraterrestrial.

469
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:39,236
That would mean that I'm a lunatic.

470
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,802
Nature allows only for
very slow change

471
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:49,013
accepting a change of species
before a change of conscience.

472
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,115
I'm more rational than you.

473
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,214
I respond rationally to stimulus.

474
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,221
If someone suffers, I console him.

475
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:04,128
If someone needs my help, I give it.
Why do you think I'm crazy?

476
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:09,928
If someone looks at me, I respond.
If someone talks, I listen.

477
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:16,638
You have slowly gone crazy
by ignoring those stimuli,

478
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,148
simply for having ignored them.

479
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,379
Someone dies. You let him die.

480
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:32,252
Someone asks for help.
You look the other way.

481
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:39,198
Someone is hungry. You squander
what you have.

482
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,794
Someone is dying of sorrow.

483
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,464
You lock him up so as
not to see him.

484
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,873
One who systematically
adopts this conduct,

485
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,874
who walks among the victims,
ignoring them,

486
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:57,879
may dress well, may pay taxes,
go to Mass,

487
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,114
but you cannot deny he is sick.

488
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,429
Your reality is terrifying, Doctor.

489
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,833
Why don't you look at the real
madness for once?

490
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:22,470
Stop persecuting the sad ones,
the meek,

491
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:30,753
those who don't want to buy, or cannot
buy that shit you would gladly sell me.

492
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,452
That is, if you could.

493
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:53,169
<i>Rantes had just made a move that</i>
<i>surprised me.</i>

494
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,173
<i>It seemed unprogrammed.</i>

495
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:59,315
<i>Unexpectedly, a rage</i>
<i>had surfaced in him.</i>

496
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,749
<i>He claimed to be a ''Cybernetic Christ'',</i>

497
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:16,331
<i>but his rage made him resemble</i>
<i>the other Christ, the old Christ.</i>

498
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:32,381
<i>At this stage, my thoughts were</i>
<i>confused somewhat by shame,</i>

499
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:36,245
<i>somewhat by anger.</i>

500
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:41,847
<i>Since Rantes was becoming more</i>
<i>Christ-like, his end would be the same.</i>

501
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,768
<i>I wouldn't admit it, but I wanted Rantes</i>
<i>to disappear completely.</i>

502
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,632
<i>Even though history would see me,</i>
<i>if this were true,</i>

503
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,504
<i>as the Pilate of the galaxies.</i>

504
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:08,316
<i>Even so, I would prefer,</i>
<i>as had many Romans,</i>

505
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:15,151
<i>to risk a resurrection rather than have</i>
<i>him here saying what he was saying.</i>

506
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,834
Hey, Rantes has a visitor.

507
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,001
- Beatriz...
- Dick.

508
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:15,501
Rantes had been here for a while
and he's made no progress.

509
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,347
We don't know his identity.

510
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,514
In the register, he's listed as N.N.

511
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,821
So your presence may be very useful.

512
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,319
That's why I intercepted you.

513
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,355
Now I'd like to ask you
some questions.

514
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:43,234
They may seem indiscreet,
but I think you'll understand.

515
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,934
- Are you related?
- No.

516
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,941
A friend?

517
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,948
We met a while ago.
I'm an evangelist.

518
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,978
I work in a church.

519
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:01,821
We do relief work in a village.

520
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,185
- That's where we met.
- In a church?

521
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:10,992
- Why was Rantes at the church?
- He showed up offering to help out.

522
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,698
At first, we didn't realize
his importance.

523
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,701
Importance?

524
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,605
He knows everything.
He teaches the kids music.

525
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,737
He's delivered several babies
very professionally.

526
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:30,646
He's assembling a machine using parts
of radios and calculators.

527
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,456
He says it will be a computer.

528
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,922
From the beginning we found him

529
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,428
a little strange, but a good man.

530
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,067
He told me his story.

531
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,873
- It was very moving.
- He explained why he's here?

532
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,873
He described his problems with alcohol.

533
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,272
Problems with alcohol?

534
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,241
What problems with alcohol?

535
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,383
He didn't tell me why.
I didn't ask.

536
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,217
He said he'd been an alcoholic.

537
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,980
He sought help to avoid
harming anybody.

538
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,021
He said he was improving.

539
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,991
He spoke highly of you.

540
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:21,034
- He never mentioned coming from
another planet? - No.

541
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:26,100
Ranted may have problems, but
he doesn't seem crazy to me.

542
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,403
Excuse me.

543
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,851
Excuse me, Doctor,
but it is late.

544
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,953
Yes, of course.

545
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,420
Will you be visiting again?
I'd like to talk more.

546
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,461
Anything he said may help me.

547
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,531
- And him.
- Yes, of course.

548
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,673
Can I have your phone number?

549
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,776
I don't have a phone.

550
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,768
I'll give you my numbers.

551
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,106
You can call me here

552
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,084
or at home.

553
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:17,283
Rantes deserves our help.
He's a valuable man.

554
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,425
You told me everything, eh?

555
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,427
The Saint?

556
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,968
She's a very interesting woman.

557
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,572
Why do you call her the ''Saint''?

558
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,177
Because she's a very special woman.

559
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,651
Her mechanisms are unlike other humans.

560
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,548
- What mechanisms?
- This is confidential...

561
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,881
but I can trust you.

562
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,190
Uncommon connections between
the emotional and the physical.

563
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,201
When a human being feels something

564
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,003
what are the external
physical reactions?

565
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:48,075
You can cry, or tremble,

566
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,374
or pretend you don't feel a thing.

567
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,872
The Saint could never hide anything.

568
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,520
When she feels, when...

569
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:03,652
she becomes deeply moved
or feels love, I suppose,

570
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,127
she regurgitates a blue liquid.

571
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,121
A blue liquid?

572
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:12,127
Yes. It's a very interesting case.

573
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:18,931
Searching for ways of decoding feelings
and transforming them into information,

574
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,771
it's truly an exceptional case.

575
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,243
Why the need to expel the liquid?

576
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,651
Why blue?
What produces it?

577
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:35,049
Perhaps she's epileptic and
you imagined the liquid was blue.

578
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,954
What's wrong, Doctor?

579
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:44,455
Have you found yourself at the limits?

580
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,398
Crazy trees grow in nuthouses.

581
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,741
Why did you tell her
you were an alcoholic?

582
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,545
An alcoholic?

583
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,819
I didn't want to frighten her.

584
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,928
I am interested in working
with those people.

585
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,322
Telling the truth would ruin everything.

586
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:08,910
Horrible machine, tell Dad
I would like to go to fishing.

587
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,020
I deserve it since I got an A
in school.

588
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,915
Bye, machine. I don't like
to talking to you.

589
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,117
Have Daddy call me.

590
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:11,241
Dr. Denis, this is Beatriz Dick,
Rantes' friend.

591
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,013
Please tell him that
I haven't abandoned him.

592
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,649
I had important reasons
for not visiting him.

593
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,220
I'll visit him again
next Sunday at 5:00 p.m.

594
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,527
I called because I know
you care about him.

595
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:27,923
Thank you, Doctor.

596
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:34,228
Listen Doctor, I've been
cheating on you.

597
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,175
Hi, how are you?

598
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,545
I've finished seeing my patients.

599
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,954
Would you like some coffee?

600
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:05,684
I want to know how
Rantes seemed to you.

601
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,333
Excuse me for a minute.

602
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,508
I'll wait in the car. It's outside.

603
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:58,675
Beatriz, I don't want
to alarm you, but...

604
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,317
Rantes did not explain his case fully.

605
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,716
He hides things.

606
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,984
A man always hides something
in his soul

607
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,690
that's why he's not happy.

608
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,727
Of course, but these are
serious things.

609
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,695
Rantes is not an alcoholic.

610
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,292
He thinks he is from another planet.

611
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:25,005
- What's your opinion?
- About another planet?

612
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,836
No. Do you think it's serious?
Can he be cured?

613
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,205
The truth is, I don't know.

614
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:36,713
- I haven't made any progress.
- He seems well.

615
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:43,123
He feels well, but that place
is not exactly a summer camp.

616
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,124
I know it.

617
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,828
I though you would be able to help me.

618
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:56,261
I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

619
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:01,307
I'm searching for some human trace.

620
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:06,013
I can't find any trace of his past,
of his origins.

621
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:10,979
I can say he's sick, but I don't really
know what's wrong with him.

622
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,282
This happens often in psychiatry.

623
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:19,550
A man lives his life without
leaving some imprint.

624
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:25,131
I know the real story of Rantes
must exist somewhere.

625
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,003
I think you can help.

626
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:33,007
Why do you think I could help?
He lied to me, too.

627
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:41,642
You never heard him mention a place,
a town where he might have lived?

628
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,911
- He never mentioned Uruguay?
- No.

629
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,916
As far as I remember, no.

630
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,087
Once he mentioned a trip.

631
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:56,555
There is a boy Rantes teaches music.
He's very impressed with him.

632
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:01,194
Rantes thinks he's a genius.
He admires him.

633
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:06,971
It bothers him because he believes that
the boy's genius will be wasted.

634
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,867
Once, he mentioned taking the boy
on a trip.

635
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:16,577
I asked about the trip. He just said,
''That boy will travel.''

636
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,113
Rantes can go out.

637
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,982
He comes and goes when he pleases.

638
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,120
Why doesn't he go out with you
for a walk or a drink?

639
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,489
He doesn't want to.

640
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,995
He says he's too busy at the hospital.

641
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:35,133
- He's investigating something.
- Oh, yes...

642
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,634
Are you suggesting I don't do enough
with him?

643
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,540
No, no. You do plenty by visiting him.

644
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,710
I better go.

645
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,011
Need a ride?

646
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:54,019
No, thanks.
I'm not going far. I like to walk.

647
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,023
So long, Doctor.

648
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,582
Thank you for your concern.

649
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:07,930
Next week I'll take him to a concert.
Would you like to come with us?

650
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,640
A REAL LOONEY CONCERT
MADMAN CONDUCTS IT

651
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:41,215
It would've been fine in
the entertainment section, but...

652
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:45,614
it made the Crime section, and
I look like a fool.

653
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,221
''How did the patient escape?''
He didn't escape.

654
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,925
He was out with one of our doctors.

655
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:57,255
You're right, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

656
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:02,770
I thought it would be good for him
to get out.

657
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:07,406
He loves music. Besides, he's harmless.

658
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,409
So I see.

659
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:13,812
It's lucky you didn't take him
to a military parade.

660
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:18,612
Instead of the Crime section
we'd be front page news.

661
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,681
''Nut Orders Military Attack''

662
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:26,224
That's already happened,
and Rantes wasn't involved.

663
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:31,925
Dr. Denis, this man is a delirious
paranoid

664
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,392
and you're treating him
as a mere neurotic.

665
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,504
I don't have to remind you

666
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:41,906
that a man who persists in such delirium
is potentially dangerous.

667
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:47,412
Today he's a Martian, tomorrow
he hears voices and kills someone.

668
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,247
You put him to work in Pathology,

669
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,745
take him to concerts.

670
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:58,850
Perhaps you're experimenting
with new healing technique.

671
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,761
We don't cure anybody.

672
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,360
If you've lost faith in your profession,
you know what to do.

673
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:12,330
I come here every day because I believe
that, despite the difficulties,

674
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,339
we do serve.

675
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,840
Curing even one patient
gives our work meaning.

676
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:23,377
One in 1500 patients.
That's a pretty low average.

677
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:28,990
Dr. Denis, regarding yourself,
the subject is not closed.

678
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,358
Regarding the patient,
I want no more confusion.

679
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,958
Alpidol injectable, and that's final.

680
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:37,957
He'll fall apart.

681
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:41,467
It's the only way to shake the delirium.

682
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:46,266
Yes, but the delirium is all that
keeps Rantes going.

683
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,567
He may become catatonic.

684
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,171
If he becomes catatonic,
give him electroshock.

685
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,509
You have 15 years' experience.

686
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:56,511
This can't go on.

687
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,824
This... Rantes...

688
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,268
was with you the whole time yesterday?

689
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:18,935
Yes, I picked him up and
brought him back.

690
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,977
The other patients say that he led
last night's activity.

691
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:01,305
<i>The sentence was handed down</i>
<i>and would be carried out.</i>

692
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,715
<i>I had my orders.</i>

693
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:08,652
After all, in this story
I was only Pilate.

694
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:35,573
<i>I felt guilty, not about hoping</i>
<i>that Rantes would slip up,</i>

695
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:40,346
<i>but about how little</i>
<i>his future troubles bothered me.</i>

696
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:50,361
<i>The Saint, as was her custom,</i>
<i>had disappeared,</i>

697
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:54,763
<i>vaguely promising to visit soon.</i>

698
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,943
Oh, Doctor.

699
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,714
I was worried.

700
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,312
I didn't mean any harm.

701
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:15,715
Please forgive me if my behavior
yesterday caused you problems.

702
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:20,320
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

703
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:26,024
I understand storing information,

704
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,360
but what makes them function?

705
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:32,733
What keeps them going?

706
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,641
What makes them feel?

707
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,478
Is that what you call the ''soul''?

708
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,751
You did nothing wrong except
making yourself conspicuous.

709
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:49,346
You made the papers and
the Director looks like a fool.

710
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:54,656
There are torturers who
love Beethoven,

711
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,956
who love their children,

712
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,092
who go to Mass.

713
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,638
Man allows that.

714
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:09,543
At the time of killing,
animals are more honest.

715
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:14,311
Don't say that. We're not talking about
torturing or killing you,

716
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,441
I just have to give you medicine.

717
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,654
I cannot work here anymore.

718
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:29,662
For a while.

719
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:58,148
Where is that afternoon in which
he first felt love?

720
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:10,431
What traces of the moments of pain
and pleasure this man felt?

721
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,909
You may be feeling some changes,

722
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,442
but don't worry.

723
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:22,448
It's for your own good.

724
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,416
And I won't abandon you.

725
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,329
There goes Einstein,

726
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:38,758
there goes Bach,

727
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,758
Mr. Nobody,

728
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,970
a madman, an assassin...

729
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,638
What do you think, Doctor?

730
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,343
Will this drain lead to heaven or hell?

731
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:33,553
<i>The first results were unexpected.</i>

732
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:36,823
<i>Rantes' delirium seemed to persist.</i>

733
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:39,225
<i>Only I noticed a change.</i>

734
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:43,156
<i>His position, where he claimed</i>
<i>to receive information,</i>

735
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,162
<i>it had changed.</i>

736
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:50,564
<i>He wouldn't admit it, but these</i>
<i>transmissions had been affected.</i>

737
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,135
<i>The medication had damaged</i>
<i>his antennae.</i>

738
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:03,777
<i>More in touch with reality, Rantes</i>
<i>concentrated on concrete problems.</i>

739
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:08,285
<i>I considered this progress,</i>
<i>but it led to new problems.</i>

740
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:15,226
<i>Outraged by the hospital food,</i>
<i>he spoke for the patients</i>

741
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:18,925
<i>demanding that the Director</i>
<i>sample the food.</i>

742
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,807
<i>The Director refused to see him.</i>

743
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:36,244
<i>Rantes would not leave</i>
<i>until he was heard.</i>

744
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,648
<i>The next day, he changed his tactics.</i>

745
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,952
<i>He went to the newspaper</i>
<i>office to plead his case.</i>

746
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:52,356
<i>They showed interest,</i>
<i>but Rantes refused to leave,</i>

747
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:55,627
<i>unless the Director came to taste</i>
<i>the food.</i>

748
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:03,003
<i>He fared no better than he did</i>
<i>leading the orchestra.</i>

749
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:11,475
<i>There was the imbecile</i>
<i>asking for help,</i>

750
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:15,688
<i>claiming by his gestures that</i>
<i>he spoke for others.</i>

751
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,782
<i>How could he be helped?</i>

752
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,794
<i>How could one penetrate that robot</i>
<i>driven by a mechanism so fragile</i>

753
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:28,194
<i>that he needed to protect himself</i>
<i>with such strong armor?</i>

754
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:35,308
<i>I was beginning to doubt</i>
<i>I would ever find out why.</i>

755
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:21,883
Doctor...

756
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,088
Doctor...

757
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,588
Why have you forsaken me?

758
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,569
- Yes.
- Doctor, Rantes is dying.

759
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:25,244
So am I. I want to see you.

760
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,742
I don't think it would be right.

761
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,779
Beatriz,

762
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,054
don't make me make a scene.

763
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,255
I need to see you.

764
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,509
Why did you abandon him?

765
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,212
I didn't.

766
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:04,142
Perhaps he had been abandoned before.

767
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,953
- We'll cure him.
- You should leave him alone.

768
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:12,658
At least he was happy.

769
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,232
He'll get better.

770
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,836
I know it won't be easy...

771
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,868
Don't disappear again, Beatriz.

772
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,505
Rantes needs me.

773
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,945
I need you more.

774
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,218
I love you.

775
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:34,359
There will be a price to pay.

776
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,731
For sleeping with me?

777
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:41,869
No, for my betrayal.

778
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:45,075
Of whom?

779
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,145
Rantes.

780
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:55,083
- You have slept with Rantes?
- No...

781
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,749
not because of that.

782
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,755
Then what?

783
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:05,831
I'm not what you think, Doctor.

784
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:11,832
You're incredible. We make love
and you still call me Doctor.

785
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:17,334
I don't think anything, Beatriz.

786
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,237
I haven't felt this way
in a long time.

787
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:24,015
What?

788
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:27,145
I'm happy.

789
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:32,049
- No matter what?
- No matter what.

790
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:36,760
I came with Rantes.

791
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:42,735
I'm one of those lost agents
he spoke about,

792
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:49,973
corrupted by sunsets,
by certain fragrances.

793
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:53,143
I mean it.

794
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:04,920
All right. I lied to you.

795
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:08,288
I'm not an evangelist.

796
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:13,089
I didn't meet Rantes in church,

797
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:17,226
but we do work with people
in the village.

798
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:22,337
There is a boy Rantes wants to take.

799
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:27,838
It is also true we cannot feel...

800
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:31,209
except some traitors like me.

801
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,114
Get out!

802
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:38,057
Get out, you goddamn nut!

803
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:39,658
Don't abandon us!

804
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:43,322
Who do you think I am?
I'm not stupid!

805
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:48,026
- Don't leave us!
- Get out!

806
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:52,529
- Please, please!
- Get out!

807
01:36:57,378 --> 01:37:00,211
I could have loved you, too.

808
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:22,619
She is your sister?

809
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:31,395
In this photo... you were both
15 years younger.

810
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,638
Maybe 10.

811
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:44,210
Who was in the missing part?

812
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:47,551
Mom?

813
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,518
Dad?

814
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,363
Who was he?

815
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,466
An alcoholic?

816
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,867
Everything will work out, Rantes,

817
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:14,513
but you must help me.

818
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:22,484
Was this... the garden of your house?

819
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:27,991
Was your house big?

820
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:34,194
Rantes...

821
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:38,800
I must know who you are.

822
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:45,607
And Beatriz?

823
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:50,113
Who is Beatriz?

824
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:53,815
Your sister?

825
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,851
Was she your wife?

826
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:09,530
<i>February 9, 1985, was a Saturday.</i>

827
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:13,129
<i>I went fishing with my children.</i>

828
01:40:13,874 --> 01:40:16,968
<i>Rantes had reached rock bottom.</i>

829
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:21,079
<i>His vital signs were weak.</i>

830
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:24,742
<i>The on-duty doctor ordered</i>
<i>the usual treatment,</i>

831
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:30,250
<i>electroshock to bring the patient out</i>
<i>of the catatonic state.</i>

832
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:35,293
<i>Rantes suffered a heart attack</i>
<i>from the anesthetic.</i>

833
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:46,563
<i>When I returned to the hospital, Rantes'</i>
<i>body had been sent to the University.</i>

834
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:52,974
<i>I wondered if some student,</i>
<i>some professor</i>

835
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,276
<i>upon opening his body, would sense</i>
<i>the mystery it had contained.</i>

836
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,912
<i>The patients didn't accept</i>
<i>Rantes' death.</i>

837
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:08,820
<i>They said he had gone, but that</i>
<i>he would return in a spaceship.</i>

838
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:13,131
<i>They would be there... waiting.</i>

839
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,442
<i>I waited for her.</i>

840
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:36,887
<i>If they were brother and sister,</i>
<i>God would be, for me, from then on</i>

841
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:41,355
<i>an unknown alcoholic who has fathered</i>
<i>these children,</i>

842
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,560
<i>these opposite sides of one coin.</i>

843
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:05,218
<i>Perhaps that's all we are, the foolish</i>
<i>or crazy children of a father,</i>

844
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:10,252
<i>who, at any rate,</i>
<i>was too difficult to forget.</i>
