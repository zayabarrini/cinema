1
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:42,793
I gave myself to God
and I think he has a place for me

2
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,960
In the eternity of Heaven

3
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,793
With the martyrs and the pure,
I will always be there

4
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:53,918
I raised my heart
with the light of faith

5
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:58,793
And my patience, when I am lost,
guides me to the right path again

6
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,168
Stop!

7
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,626
Stand in your places!

8
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,085
Let's try it again.

9
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:16,293
I gave myself to God
and I think he has a place for me

10
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,543
In the eternity of Heaven

11
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,876
With the martyrs and the pure,
I will always be there

12
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:27,085
I raised my heart
with the light of faith...

13
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:29,001
Wadjda!

14
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,043
Come here.

15
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,626
Repeat the first two verses.

16
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:05,710
Don't you want us
to hear your voice? Move! Move!

17
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,960
Again.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,460
I gave myself to God
and I think he has a place for me

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,501
In the eternity of Heaven

20
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,918
With the martyrs and the pure,
I will always be there

21
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:25,460
I raised my heart
with the light of faith

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,293
And my patience, when I am lost,
guides me to the right path again...

23
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:59,751
Don't forget your keys.
Don't lock the top lock.

24
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:03,001
Your father might be
late from his shift. OK?

25
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,585
God willing.

26
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:32,251
Long way ahead.
You every day late.

27
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:36,585
Must drive other teachers.
Next time you late, I not wait.

28
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:41,835
- My mum no late, you just arrive.
- Ignore him!

29
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:46,251
I not talk to you, child.
I talk mama, she every day late.

30
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,501
Look!

31
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,793
Soon you'll be a pro!

32
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,626
Where have you been all week?

33
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,376
I've got something for you.

34
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,501
A volcanic stone from the Empty Quarter.

35
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,751
It's magnetic.

36
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:11,918
Dad!

37
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,293
Mum's been waiting all week for you.

38
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,168
The top lock is unlocked.

39
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:56,376
What a moustache!
It'd suit an advert for shaving soap.

40
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,376
This is a real moustache.
A falcon could sit on it.

41
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,501
I'd say an aeroplane!

42
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,460
Thanks for breakfast!

43
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,876
Got my sandwich back at last!

44
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,085
Did you really think
you could catch up with me?

45
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,876
If I had a bike, you'd see.

46
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:44,585
Girls, stop.
Why are you laughing out loud?

47
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,710
You forget that women's voices
shouldn't be heard by men outside.

48
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:54,710
How often must I repeat this?
A woman's voice is her nakedness.

49
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,710
- Hello.
- We're sorry, it won't happen again.

50
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,876
Wadjda!

51
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,710
Where's your headscarf?

52
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,876
Did you come
with your head uncovered?

53
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,168
Stop it, girls. Don't laugh.

54
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:36,043
Hey! Come up and play with us!
Let me touch those little apples.

55
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,960
- Don't talk to me!
- Just a second.

56
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,960
I've brought you something.

57
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,585
We're not even yet.

58
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:19,710
When I get my bike and I win the race,
then we'll be even.

59
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,793
Don't you know
that girls don't ride bikes?

60
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:25,793
Losing to a girl will be a double loss.

61
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:32,168
Move, boy. Play somewhere else.

62
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,793
800 riyals.

63
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:09,710
Too expensive for you.

64
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,168
I'll make you some lunch.

65
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,918
We were in a car without
air conditioning for three hours.

66
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:52,501
That trip to the end of the world
is killing me.

67
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,126
I don't like that look.
What's on your mind?

68
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,501
I want to buy a bike
so I can race Abdullah.

69
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,126
Have you ever seen a girl on a bike?

70
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:10,460
I'd rather sell fruit at the hospital
than do my daily commute.

71
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,210
And I come home
and you tell me, "I want a bike."

72
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:58,835
Where are the bracelets?

73
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,585
I only made ten.
I worked my fingers to the bone.

74
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,085
Each one costs an extra two riyals.

75
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:08,001
I told you,
I worked my fingers to the bone.

76
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:14,293
Here you go.

77
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,085
It's your turn.

78
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:39,418
Let's move, the men can see us.

79
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:42,960
Why? Are they supermen?

80
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,793
If you can see them, they can see you.

81
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,376
Respectable girls go inside.

82
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:52,793
The rest stay
where the men can see them.

83
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,876
What are you doing here?

84
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,793
Go to your class.
Can't you see the men on the roof?

85
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:57,793
Girls, did you hear?
A thief got into Ms Hussa's house.

86
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:00,460
It was her lover, not a thief!

87
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,376
Her father thought it was a thief
and called the police!

88
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,835
If she said it was a thief,
then it was a thief.

89
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,460
You would say that, Salma.

90
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,293
The only man that would ever
speak to you would have to be a thief.

91
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,126
Can you take this to my brother?

92
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,918
It's my permission to exit card.

93
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:43,085
- I'll give you ten riyals.
- 20.

94
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,501
God, you...

95
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:53,710
He's waiting behind the school
in a white pickup truck.

96
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,001
Wadjda.

97
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,001
Come tomorrow
with your head covered,

98
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:10,293
or I'll reserve
a place in the sun for you.

99
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:13,335
I will, God willing.

100
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,668
Cover your face.

101
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,793
- Are you Abeer's brother?
- Of course I'm her brother.

102
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,960
Got the card?

103
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:05,418
Here it is.
Abeer said you'd give me 20 riyals.

104
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,543
' Really?
" Yes!

105
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:15,251
OK, just take it.

106
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:25,210
What? Even your cash
reeks of cologne.

107
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:02,835
Did you know they invented
a new thing called a tape player?

108
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,085
- Buying today?
- How would I know?

109
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,251
People need to browse, don't they?

110
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:24,335
You won't find any tapes back there.
We only have CDs.

111
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:25,710
Thanks! See you tomorrow.

112
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:58,293
Do you believe me,
or do I need to take an oath?

113
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:02,043
I cannot find the words
to describe you!

114
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,418
Do you believe me,
or do I need to take an oath?

115
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:09,001
I cannot find the words
to describe you!

116
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:13,751
The paradise of love
is in your nature

117
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,876
Don't you wish you were a singer?

118
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,626
Me, a singer! God forbid!

119
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:26,418
I've saved up 87 riyals already.

120
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,376
I only need 713.
Couldn't you lend me the money?

121
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:35,626
Oh no! Not that bike again? Stop it!

122
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,293
Ms Hussa said I have to wear
the full abaya to school.

123
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:52,251
Wow! The full abaya?
Maybe it's time to marry you off!

124
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,126
Very funny!

125
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,251
Come with me.

126
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,751
Try this.

127
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,793
Oh, Mum, it's too long.

128
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:23,335
Hold it like that.

129
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:31,001
Oh, no, a thief, a thief!

130
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,960
A thief jumped over
Ms Hussa's fence to see her.

131
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,085
We don't know that.
Maybe it was really a thief.

132
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,168
Shame on you
for saying such things.

133
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,168
A thief.

134
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,168
A thief! A thief!

135
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:56,001
I have to buy something really nice
for your uncle's wedding,

136
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,585
so all the other women
think a hundred times

137
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,585
before they look at your father.

138
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm so sorry, Leila. I really am.

139
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,876
Our driver Iqbal is so rude.

140
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,335
He shouted at poor Aiesha today.

141
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:27,543
I felt so sorry for her.
She cried for three whole hours.

142
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,418
Abeer, Mariam's daughter?

143
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,668
She was caught with a man?

144
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,710
Do you know who he is?

145
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:44,668
Oh, I know who he is now!

146
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,960
A playboy like his father.

147
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,793
Is he good-looking like his father?

148
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:59,168
You have to admit,
his father is good-looking.

149
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,543
The religious police?

150
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,626
Mariam must be devastated!

151
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:10,460
They should have married her off
ages ago.

152
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,168
Girls like that are nothing but trouble.

153
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,876
I have to go, Father's just arrived.

154
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,543
Keep me in the loop
on this Abeer scandal.

155
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:27,835
Take care. Bye.

156
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:34,960
What's the matter?

157
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:40,251
Don't worry, we won't marry you off.
Go and say hello to your father.

158
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,376
I'm losing.

159
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,126
I should have stayed
with my usual fighter.

160
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:19,585
Is that a real school report or a fake
like the one you made last year?

161
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:23,835
It's real. I'm great at maths.
Shall I prove it?

162
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:26,168
Pythagoras' theorem
is a miracle of God.

163
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:28,585
The triangle always
stays the same!

164
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:32,335
Sounds like you know
what you're talking about.

165
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:36,043
I'm saving to buy a bike.

166
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,085
I lost.

167
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,376
Where's the margoog?

168
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,460
What a beauty!

169
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,251
A superstar is here!

170
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:58,210
Stop it! Superstar, eh?

171
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,626
Then why is your mother checking
all over town for available women for you?

172
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:05,585
I don't think she's trying that hard.

173
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:12,293
Come and play with me!

174
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,793
I can't play.

175
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:16,251
Let me play!

176
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:47,793
Tapes with love songs...

177
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,751
Bracelets for football clubs...

178
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:57,418
Are you running a football fan club?

179
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:03,001
Don't you know
that these items are forbidden?

180
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,501
Abeer was always a good girl.

181
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,751
She never caused any trouble.

182
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:19,918
Did you hear that she was caught
with a young man who isn't family?

183
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:30,043
Did you arrange the rendezvous
between Abeer and the man?

184
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:33,251
- No, I didn't!
- Don't lie.

185
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,251
I'm certain you were involved.

186
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:39,168
I just don't know in what way.

187
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:44,918
What should we do with you now?
Expel you?

188
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,876
Just a moment, please.
I'm not finished with her.

189
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,085
You may go back to your class.

190
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:04,168
We'll finish this discussion later.

191
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:22,626
And Wadjda,
stop wearing those torn-up shoes.

192
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:25,626
Wear normal black shoes,
like the other girls.

193
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:30,043
What's this?

194
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:34,418
The proposal for the Koran competition
in the religious club.

195
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:51,418
I really don't know what to say, Principal!

196
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,251
All this because of a bike?

197
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:03,543
As long as I live, you won't get one.

198
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:05,918
Should I wait until you get expelled?

199
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,793
And turn off that damn radio
and those evil songs!

200
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:19,168
Those songs
have brought us nothing but evil.

201
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,251
You're no better than Abeer.

202
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:25,751
She's staying at home
and her parents are marrying her off.

203
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:53,668
I should pay for it?
Why can't you pay for once?

204
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,626
I pay for your driver!

205
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:59,335
All your cash
is in your woman's saving fund.

206
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:02,835
Yeah, and what about the bride price,
you handsome groom?

207
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:07,835
Do you think
I want to support two families?

208
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:12,376
Bear me a son
and everything will be fine.

209
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:16,210
But we know
that's not going to happen.

210
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,001
Forget it. And don't count on me
coming at all next week!

211
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:27,960
Don't come back!

212
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,710
Go to your mother's house
and discuss potential brides.

213
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:05,085
Madam, only one hour I wait.

214
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:08,418
I have no time wait for you.

215
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:12,460
- You late, I go. You find taxi.
- Enough, Iqbal, I get it.

216
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:17,376
Who's that girl, Iqbal?

217
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,293
My daughter.
I haven't seen her for three years now.

218
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,751
She go school now.

219
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,626
I no go to school.

220
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:32,460
That's obvious,
because you don't have any manners.

221
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,085
Shame on you.

222
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,376
You too have no manners.

223
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,335
I make better bracelets than these.

224
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:13,626
- Wm you
- No! n per pie“?

225
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:16,293
I buy them from China,
I can get 10,000 for ten riyals.

226
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:19,793
- China won't do the national colours.
- You mean like these?

227
00:32:57,668 --> 00:33:01,460
- Can I try on that dress?
- Of course.

228
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:07,085
There's a women's bathroom
at the end of the corridor.

229
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,793
If it's too big, we can alter it for you.

230
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,751
Thanks.

231
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:47,501
What do you think?

232
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,543
Would your dad like it?

233
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:02,835
Let's take the dress back
to the salesman so he can take it in.

234
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,918
Then let's go, before Iqbal
gets angry and leaves us.

235
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,251
Don't worry, he won't leave.

236
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,626
Hand me my dress.

237
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:39,835
Who were you talking to
about the bike yesterday?

238
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,418
What are you talking about?

239
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,460
I don't want you selling my bike
to anyone else.

240
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,460
Here.

241
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,210
I made you a mix tape,
since we're friends now.

242
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,126
But don't sell my bike.

243
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,960
God willing.

244
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:15,001
Ms Hussa will explain
the rules of the Koran competition.

245
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,210
It's only five weeks away.

246
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,751
I'll pass around a sign-up sheet.

247
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,835
- Ms Hussa...
- Thanks.

248
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:27,376
First of all,
we've increased the prize money.

249
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,126
It's now 1,000 instead of 800 riyals.

250
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:32,876
You'll have to learn the first five suras.

251
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:37,751
The competition has two parts.

252
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:42,418
The first involves vocabulary
and God's revelation of the verses.

253
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:47,126
The second part is recitation.

254
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:49,918
The recitation has to be flawless.

255
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,835
I repeat,
correct pronunciation is a must.

256
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:58,585
Good luck with your efforts.

257
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:00,418
Thanks.

258
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:15,543
Yes?

259
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:18,835
What do you want?

260
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,043
I thought about what you said.
I was wrong and I'm ready to change.

261
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:33,543
Praise God! All of a sudden?

262
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:39,835
I'd like to join the religious club.

263
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:53,251
How much?

264
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:56,918
Only 80 riyals. Cheaper than a bike.

265
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,376
How about 62?

266
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:14,543
Select the right answer!
Who are the Sabians?

267
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:23,585
Wrong! Please try again.
Who are the Sabians?

268
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:24,960
What?

269
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:35,085
Wrong! Please try again.
Who are the Sabians?

270
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,668
- How am I supposed to know?
- Iqbal!

271
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:42,960
You get your monthly salary
whether you drive me around or not.

272
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,710
Why do you talk to me like this?
Have you no shame?

273
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,960
Why?

274
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,251
You think you're the only driver around?

275
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:58,085
Tomorrow
I'll find myself a better driver.

276
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,126
Guys, I'm late for school,
I have to go!

277
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:55,460
Abdullah, how do I get to Derah?

278
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,001
Let's go.

279
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:02,085
Cover your face.
I'll say you're my sister.

280
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,251
Your sister?
No one will believe you.

281
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:08,043
I'm too good-looking
to be related to you!

282
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:13,543
I can't arrange the commute.
Can't it count as emergency leave?

283
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,460
I lost my driver.

284
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,543
I'll open up the school
for the entire month if I have to.

285
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,460
That's very kind of you.

286
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,626
Take care.

287
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,960
Do you know
where Iqbal the driver lives?

288
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,126
Do you know how many drivers
called Iqbal live here?

289
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:30,585
I hope we're following the right lead.

290
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,668
This could be his car.

291
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,293
That's it.

292
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,001
- What do you want?
- Iqbal?

293
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:32,876
It's not my business, it's yours.

294
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:36,251
OK.

295
00:41:48,293 --> 00:41:50,293
You? What do you want?

296
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,626
Iqbal, why did you do that?

297
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:54,251
Go away!

298
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:59,626
- Where's your residency permit?
- What do you want with it?

299
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:05,001
It's a good job. Go back to driving
Wadjda's mother and you'll be fine.

300
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:07,710
You know my uncle,
the guy with the moustache?

301
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,543
I'm sure he'd be interested to look
further into your legal status.

302
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:24,710
"You know my uncle,
the guy with the moustache?"

303
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,918
He knew him, right? That moustache
is a registered trademark!

304
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,793
Their son put explosives around his waist
and boom, he died.

305
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,793
He's crazy! That must hurt!

306
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:43,751
If you die for God, it's like a pin prick.

307
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:46,876
And then you fly up
and you have 70 brides!

308
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,960
Really?

309
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,543
Boom! 70 bikes!

310
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,876
You've got it all wrong.
That's not how it works.

311
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,376
Come on, don't you miss us?

312
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,376
It's been almost two weeks.

313
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:24,668
Do you think about us?
Or is someone else on your mind?

314
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,168
If I'm the original brand,
why are you looking for an imitation?

315
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,501
OK. Take care.

316
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:49,293
Carry on studying.

317
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:53,251
Hello, Leila!

318
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,418
Are you coming round?

319
00:43:57,751 --> 00:44:01,210
Could you bring me
the money you borrowed?

320
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,835
Really?

321
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,293
You're working in the hospital
across the road?

322
00:44:07,293 --> 00:44:09,835
Your husband
doesn't mind you working with men?

323
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:19,918
What do you want?

324
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:25,043
My uncle wants me to string some lights
across the street from your roof.

325
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:28,876
Ask the neighbours.
We don't care about your uncle.

326
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:33,085
They don't have a pole to hang them on.
Yours is the only roof that'll work.

327
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:37,126
Wait a minute.

328
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:45,918
Mum?

329
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:54,293
Thanks, honey. When you want to be,
you're such a sweetheart.

330
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:57,710
Abdullah wants to string up lights
for the election

331
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,460
so his uncle with the moustache
will win.

332
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,460
Tell him no. His uncle isn't from our tribe
and we won't vote for him.

333
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:09,501
I'll let you onto the roof
on one condition.

334
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,668
You have to bring your bike.

335
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:27,043
Hello, Wadjda.

336
00:45:27,043 --> 00:45:30,001
You look so grown up and cute!

337
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:32,126
- Where's your mother?
- She's coming.

338
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:34,418
How's school?

339
00:45:35,585 --> 00:45:37,793
- I don't like it, but it's OK.
- Leila!

340
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,460
Traitor! Working so close to my house
without telling me.

341
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,001
Finally, I'm done with Iqbal.

342
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:55,626
Three hours in the car with him
every day was about to kill me.

343
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:59,293
The hospital provides transport,
and the pay and hours are good.

344
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,460
And the driver waits for me.

345
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,293
When's the party?

346
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:07,126
Next month.

347
00:46:07,126 --> 00:46:10,043
I want to buy a nice dress
for her uncle's engagement.

348
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:13,376
The potential wives will be
at his brother's wedding as well.

349
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:17,876
God be with the one he chooses.
You might rip her heart out that night!

350
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:24,918
Oh, before I forget.
They're hiring at the hospital.

351
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:28,335
- It's closer and we can chat all day!
- Leila! My husband's so jealous.

352
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,918
He can't stand the thought
of men looking at me.

353
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:34,793
Stop it! You blame
everything on your husband.

354
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:10,418
What's this?

355
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:14,710
It'll help you learn. I need to work
on the lights. I can't push you all day.

356
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:17,710
You think I'm a little girl.

357
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,293
Here, I took them off.

358
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:12,376
I'll give you five riyals if you stop crying.

359
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,210
Now, girls, let's start.

360
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:08,460
Does each girl have her Koran?

361
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:11,585
Before we start...

362
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:16,210
If you're having a period,
you're not allowed to touch the Koran.

363
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,710
This isn't a laughing matter.
You're young ladies now.

364
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:22,793
I said stop.

365
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:28,043
You should touch it with a tissue,
not with your fingers.

366
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,376
Page 87.

367
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:35,626
Start with Surat An-Nisa', from Ayat 59.

368
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:41,168
Let's start with the new face. Wadjda.

369
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,501
Wadjda, go ahead.

370
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:48,043
- O you who have believed...
- Louder.

371
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:50,751
O you who have believed...

372
00:49:55,335 --> 00:49:58,376
- Obey...
- Obey Allah and...

373
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:01,710
obey the Messenger...

374
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:11,335
- And those in authority...
- And those in authority,

375
00:50:11,335 --> 00:50:15,543
and if you disagree over anything...

376
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:17,876
You're mispronouncing the words.

377
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:26,043
- And if you disagree...
- And if you disagree over anything...

378
00:50:26,043 --> 00:50:31,918
And if you disagree over anything,
refer it to Allah and the Messenger...

379
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:42,585
If you should...
Stop, please. Noura, continue.

380
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:46,543
O you who have believed,

381
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:51,418
obey Allah and obey the Messenger,
and those in authority.

382
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:56,001
And if you disagree over anything,
refer it to Allah.

383
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,876
Refer it to Allah and the Prophet.

384
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:17,876
All that fuss for a bike
and you don't even know how to ride?

385
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:19,918
I have a plan.

386
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,543
What's that?

387
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,793
It's an antenna
that gets all the radio stations.

388
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:36,335
My uncle's going to speak on the radio
with famous Koran readers.

389
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:38,418
"It makes your heart melt," he says.

390
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:42,835
He should hear my mother sing!
She should have a channel of her own.

391
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:25,918
Oh...

392
00:52:42,168 --> 00:52:44,543
We'll talk about this later.

393
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,751
Where's the nail polish?

394
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:38,293
I hid it under there the other day.

395
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,001
What are you doing here?

396
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:47,418
Why were your hands under her skirt?

397
00:53:52,335 --> 00:53:54,376
In my office, now!

398
00:54:23,585 --> 00:54:28,043
Wadjda? Wake up, honey.

399
00:54:28,043 --> 00:54:30,626
Let's get up and say the dawn prayer.

400
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:45,918
I saw some girls on TV riding bikes.
Give me the money to buy one.

401
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:48,751
I know you have money.
I saw it in the drawer.

402
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:51,668
Here, girls don't ride bikes.

403
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:55,168
You won't be able to have children
if you ride a bike!

404
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,335
You don't ride a bike
and you can't have children!

405
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,501
How could you say that?
I almost died having you!

406
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:09,626
Wash for prayer!

407
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:38,710
Girls.

408
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,626
Who can find a tajwid
on this page? Page 92.

409
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,918
- Which verse?
- Verse 88?

410
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:46,460
Yes.

411
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,085
"Who does..."

412
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:51,501
- What kind of tajwid?
- ldgham?

413
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:52,918
- What type?
- Moughana.

414
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:54,626
Excellent!

415
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:57,585
What do you think, Wadjda?

416
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:02,751
I think this competition
is very difficult for me.

417
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,376
I heard on the Koran channel yesterday,

418
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:13,835
if learning the Koran is difficult for you,
God will reward you doubly.

419
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:17,335
I want you all
to take Wadjda as an example

420
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:22,626
of a person who tries hard
and is devoted to God.

421
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:26,168
- You're doing well!
- Thank you, Miss.

422
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:30,918
Excuse me.

423
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,335
Wadjda, Ms Hussa says
she needs to see you.

424
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,210
Put your Koran aside.

425
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:00,626
You may not believe it,

426
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,460
but by God, you remind me
of myself at your age.

427
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:08,168
And look at me now.

428
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,085
Close the door.

429
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:25,335
You still insist that you weren't
doing anything behind the school?

430
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:34,918
We were reading magazines,
that's all. Ask her.

431
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:48,043
I'm not sure.
I was standing far away.

432
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:56,376
Thank you, Wadjda.
You may return to your class.

433
00:57:56,376 --> 00:57:59,585
Give this file to Aunt Jamila.

434
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,668
Close the door.

435
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,210
This is a pledge.

436
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:22,001
You'll sign it and you'll be able
to stay in school.

437
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:40,960
In the name of God,
gracious and merciful,

438
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,043
I salute all you girls
for your efforts this term.

439
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:52,543
I want to remind you that school is
a place of learning and a place of morals.

440
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:55,835
Listen carefully.

441
00:58:57,043 --> 00:59:01,918
Two students were caught
in the back yard committing a sin.

442
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:05,043
The two are...

443
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,585
Faten Khaled and Fatima Abdullah.

444
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:18,543
To avoid similar situations,

445
00:59:18,543 --> 00:59:23,876
you're no longer allowed
to bring flowers to school

446
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,251
or to give each other
letters of love and admiration.

447
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,835
And no one is allowed to hold hands.

448
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:38,001
Do you understand?

449
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,168
You may go to your classes now.
Thank you.

450
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,168
Your bags are over there.

451
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:08,918
Don't touch me!

452
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:43,626
I wish I could cut my hair shorter,
like Lobna Abdel Aziz's.

453
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:45,668
Do it.

454
01:00:45,668 --> 01:00:49,626
Your father loves my hair
long and smooth.

455
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:18,418
My mother saw the lights
but forgot to ask me about them again.

456
01:01:18,418 --> 01:01:21,501
She doesn't know?
What about your father?

457
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,793
I think they like your uncle,

458
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,626
since he was on Koran Radio.

459
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:37,668
I'm bleeding...

460
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:41,376
Where's the blood coming from?
Your virginity!

461
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:43,876
From my knee!

462
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:49,043
Your knee?
Bikes are dangerous for girls!

463
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,835
You think you can act like a boy?

464
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:54,710
And you!
Why did you let her ride the bike?

465
01:01:55,335 --> 01:01:58,460
Come back!
Take that bike with you!

466
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:03,585
I'll tell your uncle
to teach you some manners.

467
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,626
Get up.

468
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:15,626
Shame on you, bringing
a boy upstairs with no one home!

469
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:17,793
If your father knew, he'd kill you!

470
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,668
Do you want the men to hear you?
Take the bread out of the oven.

471
01:03:14,668 --> 01:03:16,418
Wow! All this food!

472
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:19,585
They'll be really impressed.
You make me so proud!

473
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:21,626
Obviously not proud enough.

474
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:53,751
Turki, Saleh, Ali, Abdurahman,

475
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:57,543
Abulazziz, Rashed, Abdullah...

476
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,585
My father!

477
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:10,001
Interested in your father's
glorious family tree?

478
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:14,376
You aren't on it.
It only includes men's names.

479
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,418
Clean up when you've finished.

480
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,460
Hide the traces of your crime.

481
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,501
I don't want
to make him upset with us again.

482
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:12,376
WADJDA

483
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:17,710
Give me the picture!

484
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,043
I said give me the picture!

485
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:22,210
What's going on?

486
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,668
Salma just got married
and brought pictures of her wedding.

487
01:05:27,668 --> 01:05:30,460
Congratulations!
Can I see the pictures?

488
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:34,793
Are these of your wedding?

489
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,460
Is this your husband?

490
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:44,793
- How old is he?
- 20.

491
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,501
It's not funny.

492
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:53,251
Pictures are forbidden at school.
Let's get started.

493
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:58,043
Surat An-Nisa', page 97.

494
01:05:59,043 --> 01:06:01,960
Wadjda, start with verse 115.

495
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,043
- I'll try to recite the verses.
- Really?

496
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:09,001
Close the Koran and go ahead.

497
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:14,835
Whoever opposes the Messenger, after
guidance has become clear to him,

498
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:17,585
and follows the path of the non-believer,

499
01:06:17,585 --> 01:06:20,126
- we will give him what he has taken...
- We will give him...

500
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:22,085
We will give him what he has taken...

501
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:28,335
and drive him into hell,
that most evil destination.

502
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:29,918
Terrific!

503
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:32,710
You need to work on your tarteel
and your tajwid.

504
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:36,210
If you aim to win,
you must recite like Salma.

505
01:06:37,168 --> 01:06:39,335
Salma, please read verse 115 again.

506
01:06:39,335 --> 01:06:43,710
In the name of God,
the most gracious, the most merciful

507
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:50,793
Whoever opposes the Messenger
after guidance has become clear to him

508
01:06:50,793 --> 01:06:55,418
And follows the path of the non-believer

509
01:06:55,418 --> 01:07:00,793
We will give him what he has taken

510
01:07:00,793 --> 01:07:06,460
And drive him into hell,
that most evil destination

511
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:11,460
Indeed, Allah does not forgive
association with him

512
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,751
But he forgives what is less
than that for whom he wills

513
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:22,168
And he who associates others with Allah
has certainly gone far astray

514
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:23,293
Great!

515
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,293
Are you cross with me?

516
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:40,210
I've got homework to do.

517
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:42,543
Wait a second.

518
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:46,543
Here, I got you a helmet,
like the ones on TV.

519
01:07:51,918 --> 01:07:53,876
Wanna ride in the empty lot'?

520
01:07:53,876 --> 01:07:56,460
We've got a few minutes
before people come.

521
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,585
Abdullah! Look!

522
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:23,085
The toy shop owner told Khalid and his dad
someone had reserved the bike.

523
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:27,418
He must be holding it for me!

524
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,543
Right answer!

525
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,710
Select the right answer!

526
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,043
Who are the Sabians?

527
01:08:38,043 --> 01:08:40,460
I know the answer!

528
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,918
Correct!

529
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,168
At last!

530
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:52,835
Well, if you won't listen to me,
I don't know why I should listen to you!

531
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:02,126
Get ready, we're going out.

532
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:05,668
Don't leave the Koran open.
The devil might spit into it.

533
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:11,710
Are you going to work here with Leila?

534
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,626
Those lab coats are cool,
like The Matrix but white!

535
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:17,418
I just want to give her something.

536
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,293
Wadjda!

537
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,668
Hello and welcome!

538
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:32,460
Leila, why isn't your face covered?

539
01:09:33,876 --> 01:09:37,085
Wait, let me get you
the application form.

540
01:09:41,793 --> 01:09:45,293
Welcome! How are you?

541
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:47,335
Fine, thank you.

542
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:02,126
It's a good job, and the vacancies
are filling up quickly. You should...

543
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,960
Leila! Stop it.

544
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:10,126
I just came by to say hello.
I'll call you later, you look busy.

545
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:12,751
- Take care.
- Why are you going?

546
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,835
Take care.

547
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:19,251
I thought you were going to apply.

548
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:32,751
And among His signs is this. He created
for you helpmeats from yourselves

549
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:36,793
so that you may find rest in them...

550
01:10:36,793 --> 01:10:41,001
No, honey, give it a tone like this.

551
01:10:42,168 --> 01:10:47,126
And among his signs is this. He created
for you helpmeats from yourselves

552
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:50,251
So that you may find rest in them

553
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:57,376
And he ordained between you
love and mercy

554
01:10:57,376 --> 01:11:00,751
Verily in that are signs
for those who reflect

555
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:04,043
I feel shy! I can't recite like that
in front of everyone.

556
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,418
You, shy? Ha! I only wish it were true!

557
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:24,460
Look! There's my father!

558
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,501
- Where?
- There!

559
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:57,251
So do you love him?

560
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:01,126
Who?

561
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:03,876
- Your father?
- No, the neighbour's boy!

562
01:12:05,168 --> 01:12:08,585
I don't think I'm the one
in love with the neighbour's boy!

563
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:10,626
That's not funny.

564
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:14,835
You didn't answer. Do you love him?

565
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:23,335
I was at secondary school
when he asked for my hand.

566
01:12:23,335 --> 01:12:26,501
All the girls went crazy
when they saw his picture.

567
01:12:26,501 --> 01:12:28,335
They were so jealous.

568
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:32,460
He was the first man in my life

569
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,085
and will hopefully be the last.

570
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:41,293
You're the prettiest woman
I've ever seen.

571
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:44,835
You'll give him a heart attack
with your red dress.

572
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:48,126
Don't worry.

573
01:12:48,126 --> 01:12:51,293
He would never burn my heart
with a second wife.

574
01:12:52,376 --> 01:12:55,751
Let's practise reciting
for the competition tomorrow.

575
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:57,543
Go on.

576
01:12:57,543 --> 01:13:03,668
And among his signs is this. He created
for you helpmates from yourselves

577
01:13:03,668 --> 01:13:07,126
So that you may find rest in them

578
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:12,876
And he ordained between you
love and mercy

579
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,126
The words need to come
from your heart.

580
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:20,501
Ignore your surroundings.
Read from your heart.

581
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:25,335
I'd love to be there tomorrow
and see you win.

582
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:31,668
But I have to commute
to the end of the world again.

583
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,001
Benevolence?

584
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:24,918
Wrong answer. Thank you.

585
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:30,126
Next, please.

586
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:38,043
What is the meaning
of "sadakatouhen"?

587
01:15:38,043 --> 01:15:40,960
- Bride price?
- Correct.

588
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:43,793
Salma.

589
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:50,793
What is "furkan"?

590
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:57,876
- The Koran?
- Correct.

591
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:01,543
Wadjda!

592
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,710
What does "da'ab" mean?

593
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:18,335
Habit?

594
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:21,376
Correct.

595
01:16:25,418 --> 01:16:27,001
Noura.

596
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,210
What is "zaygh"?

597
01:16:36,668 --> 01:16:38,293
Weakness.

598
01:16:39,626 --> 01:16:41,210
Correct.

599
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,668
Next.

600
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,460
What is "hoban kabiran"?

601
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,876
I'm sorry, Yasmin. Back to your seat.

602
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:13,043
What is "hoban kabiran"?

603
01:17:16,751 --> 01:17:18,543
A big something?

604
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:25,710
Wrong. Back to your seat, please.

605
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,710
What is "hoban kabiran"?

606
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:38,001
- Great injustice.
- Correct.

607
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,293
Thank you, Salma.
God bless you!

608
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:41,501
Wadjda.

609
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:50,418
Please start with verse seven
of Surat Al-Baqarah.

610
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:53,126
Begin at "God sealed their hearts".

611
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:02,626
Allah hath set
a seal on their hearts...

612
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:13,335
Allah hath set a seal on their hearts

613
01:19:13,335 --> 01:19:17,293
And their hearing and sight
are veiled

614
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:21,376
Great is the penalty they incur

615
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:24,793
Of the people there are some who say

616
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:29,210
"We believe in Allah and the Last Day"

617
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:32,751
But they do not really believe

618
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:39,418
They would deceive Allah
and those who believe

619
01:19:39,418 --> 01:19:45,543
But they only deceive themselves
and don't realise it

620
01:19:46,543 --> 01:19:48,918
In their hearts is a disease

621
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:51,876
And Allah has increased their disease

622
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:55,918
And grievous is the penalty they incur

623
01:19:55,918 --> 01:19:59,335
Because they are false to themselves

624
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:02,585
When it is said to them,
"Make not mischief on the earth"

625
01:20:02,585 --> 01:20:09,585
They say, "Why, we only
want to make peace"

626
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:14,543
Certainly, they are
the ones who make mischief

627
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:18,376
But they don't realise it

628
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:27,501
That was wonderful, Wadjda!
God bless you!

629
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:37,918
Are you sure
you want to pray next to us?

630
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:39,626
Congratulations!

631
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,918
The winner hasn't been announced yet.

632
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:44,126
You won! You're their favourite convert.

633
01:20:44,126 --> 01:20:46,543
I'm sure they were all on your side.

634
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,710
Come here!

635
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,460
We saved you a place in the first row.

636
01:20:53,418 --> 01:20:55,043
Coward.

637
01:20:58,418 --> 01:20:59,501
Get in line.

638
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:07,293
Move closer.
Don't leave a gap for the devil.

639
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:10,251
God is great.

640
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,918
God is great.

641
01:21:31,668 --> 01:21:33,626
Allah listens to he who praises him.

642
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:38,418
God is great.

643
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,001
Be quiet, girls. Silence!

644
01:21:57,418 --> 01:22:00,501
The competition finalists are...

645
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:04,710
Noura Saleh, Salma Abdel Azziz,

646
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,960
and Wadjda Al Saffan.

647
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,335
And now, the third prize goes to...

648
01:22:12,335 --> 01:22:13,710
Salma Abdul Azziz.

649
01:22:16,085 --> 01:22:17,710
Congratulations!

650
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:22,501
The winner of the second prize is...

651
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:26,501
Noura Saleh.

652
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:30,293
Congratulations, Noura!

653
01:22:34,793 --> 01:22:38,085
Wadjda, you're our champion.
Congratulations!

654
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:42,543
You've won because
of your devotion and perseverance.

655
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:46,418
I hope all the girls here today
learn from your example.

656
01:22:46,418 --> 01:22:48,001
Congratulations!

657
01:22:53,376 --> 01:22:57,001
And what are your plans
regarding the prize money?

658
01:22:58,376 --> 01:23:02,585
I'm going to buy a bike
from the shop down the street.

659
01:23:02,585 --> 01:23:04,335
What?

660
01:23:05,376 --> 01:23:07,210
I'm buying a bike.

661
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:10,335
With no training wheels,
since I know how to ride one.

662
01:23:23,793 --> 01:23:29,751
Wouldn't it be better if we donated
the money to our brethren in Palestine?

663
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:36,751
You know, a bike isn't a toy for girls.

664
01:23:36,751 --> 01:23:39,543
Especially not
for well-behaved, devout girls

665
01:23:39,543 --> 01:23:42,376
who protect their soul and honour.

666
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:45,001
I'm sure your family won't allow it.

667
01:23:47,543 --> 01:23:49,376
We'll donate the money,

668
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,918
and God willing,
you'll be rewarded for your generosity.

669
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:56,085
Please go back to your seat.

670
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,751
That's all, girls, you can leave now.

671
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,335
So nothing has changed after all.

672
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:15,168
You think you can act however you want
and people won't notice?

673
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:19,918
Your stupid behaviour
will haunt you forever.

674
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,543
You mean like your "handsome" thief?

675
01:24:55,585 --> 01:24:58,668
Didn't you win? Where's the money?

676
01:24:59,543 --> 01:25:01,126
In Palestine!

677
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,710
I'll give you my bike!

678
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:26,751
Then how will we race?

679
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,001
I want to marry you when we're older.

680
01:26:14,376 --> 01:26:16,710
Hey, you're home at last.

681
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,751
What's with the new hairstyle?

682
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:23,793
Your mother won't answer my calls.

683
01:26:25,585 --> 01:26:27,418
Can I have a look?

684
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,501
You won? I can't believe it.
You're my little darling!

685
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:39,751
Why are you crying?
You're the winner.

686
01:26:41,585 --> 01:26:43,043
Just a second.

687
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,918
Are you ready?

688
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:00,418
I'm so proud of you, my little champ.

689
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:05,751
I've been trying
to call your mother all day.

690
01:27:06,626 --> 01:27:08,835
When she gets back,
tell her I love her.

691
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,501
Hello? Hi, Aunt Leila.

692
01:27:32,543 --> 01:27:34,543
No, I don't know where she is.

693
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,335
Yeah, she's usually home by now.

694
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:44,793
OK, I'll let her know.

695
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,501
Bye.

696
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:05,293
Congratulations, I heard the news.

697
01:29:05,293 --> 01:29:08,543
They said you won.
I couldn't believe it.

698
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:14,168
If you set your mind to something,
no one can stop you.

699
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,251
They didn't give me the money.

700
01:29:20,251 --> 01:29:23,835
I couldn't believe you told them
you wanted to buy a bike.

701
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:29,126
You don't need them or their money.

702
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:39,293
What's going on at Grandma's?

703
01:29:39,293 --> 01:29:42,501
I thought my uncle's wedding
wasn't until next month.

704
01:29:43,751 --> 01:29:45,835
It's not your uncle's wedding.

705
01:29:58,293 --> 01:30:00,960
It's all right. He made his decision.

706
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,293
It'll just be you and me now.

707
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,460
Let's buy the red dress...

708
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:28,001
and go over there and get him!

709
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:30,668
There's no need
for the red dress any more.

710
01:30:30,668 --> 01:30:33,126
Besides, I already spent the money.

711
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:59,001
I hope it's the right one.

712
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:02,876
The man at the shop
had been holding it for weeks.

713
01:31:02,876 --> 01:31:04,876
For some spunky little girl.

714
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,168
I want you to be
the happiest person in the world.

715
01:31:08,168 --> 01:31:10,626
You're all I have left in this world.

716
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,251
Abdullah. Goal!

717
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:12,085
Catch me if you can!

717
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:32,085
