2
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,958
To travel is useful,
it exercises the imagination.

3
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,125
All the rest
is disappointment and fatigue.

4
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,000
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.

5
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,958
It goes from life to death.

6
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,458
People, animals, cities, things,
all are imagined.

7
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,958
It's a novel,
just a fictitious narrative.

8
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,917
Littrè says so, and he's never wrong.
And besides, anyone can do as much.

9
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,000
You just have to close your eyes.
It's on the other side of life.

10
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,375
Louis-Ferdinand Céline
Journey to the End of the Night

11
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,208
Fire!

12
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,417
You're a real pain in the ass!

13
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,667
Enough!

14
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,750
They even have cocktails
with cherries. Remember?

15
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,333
Hey, jerks!

16
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,083
I'd screw you!

17
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,625
I'd screw you!

18
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,958
Have you seen Ermanno?

19
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,417
- I'd screw you! Now!
- Get lost!

20
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,958
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,083
My phone's been stolen!

22
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,125
I'm starring in two TV dramas...

23
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,375
I'm playing a Pope in one,

24
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,750
and a junkie on the road to recovery
in the other.

25
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,750
Impressive!
No theatre work?

26
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,083
I'm supposed to do
Shakespeare with Pietro, but...

27
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,333
it has to be at least
three hours long,

28
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,333
be an ambitious project,
and no more small cities!

29
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,667
I'm trying to write a piece
for theatre, and the concept is...

30
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:51,917
- What about you?
- I might give up acting.

31
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,458
In this shitty country there are
never any good female roles.

32
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,708
I'll write my first novel,
a Proust-style piece.

33
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,625
Really?
Proust is my favourite writer!

34
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,958
Along with Ammaniti...

35
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,458
What a coincidence.

36
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,958
Who is that woman?

37
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,250
Don't you recognise her?
It's Lorena.

38
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,833
Who?

39
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,208
An ex TV showgirl, now in
full physical and mental decline.

40
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,542
Never seen her! But then
I've never had a television.

41
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:33,333
Viola, I know you don't have one.
You tell me all the time.

42
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
- What does she do now?
- Nothing, of course.

43
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,875
Happy birthday, Jep!

44
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,292
Happy birthday, Rome!

45
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,958
La Colita!

46
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:56,750
To this question, as kids,

47
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,375
my friends always gave
the same answer...

48
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,708
"pussy".

49
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,042
Whereas I answered...

50
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,083
"the smell of old
people's houses".

51
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,583
The question was:

52
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,458
"What do you like most, really,
in life?"

53
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,792
I was destined for sensibility.

54
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,125
I was destined to become a writer.

55
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:29,708
I was destined to become
Jep Gambardella.

56
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,917
You paid no attention
to me tonight!

57
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,833
Romano, don't start moaning,
we're not an item.

58
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,125
- You liked that guy?
- I like everyone and no one.

59
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,250
But I wonder why you're always
with me when it's no one's turn.

60
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,208
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure. What time are you leaving?

61
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
- In three hours.
- Three hours?

62
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,083
Then I should crash on your sofa...

63
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,625
Go home, I need to pack
and I don't want anyone around.

64
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,792
- But I live miles away.
- See you at 8:00.

65
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,167
Goodnight.

66
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,792
Guys?

67
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,000
Guys?

68
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,333
Children!

69
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,750
Run along!

70
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
Catellani?

71
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,375
The best, of course.

72
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:56,292
Did Catellani the tailor
make your suit?

73
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,208
There was no doubt
about Malagna's shady intentions.

74
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,000
The girl should be rescued
at any cost, without loss of time.

75
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
Sir, you drank!

76
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,583
Just enough to forget
my birthday.

77
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,625
- You want infusion?
- Heavens, no!

78
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,917
- I got you a present.
- How sweet!

79
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,875
This is a lucky charm
from my country.

80
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,792
Good thing it's lucky,
because it's pretty ugly.

81
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,750
Keep it on your bedside
and stop complaining!

82
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,792
I will! And thanks.
Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.

83
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,792
You're funny when you call me that!

84
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,458
I don't love you!

85
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,083
Brilliant!

86
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,625
Did you enjoy the performance?

87
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,458
Parts of it.

88
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,208
That violent head-butt
made me understand many things.

89
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,375
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Or the end?

90
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,375
You know, Talia Concept
loves to provoke.

91
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,167
Don't bother, there are more
important things than provoking me.

92
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,167
And this habit of speaking
in the third person is unbearable.

93
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,750
What are you reading?

94
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,417
I don't need to read, I live
on vibrations, extra-sensory ones.

95
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:41,750
Extra-sensoriality aside,
what do you mean by vibrations?

96
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,375
The poetry of vibrations cannot
be described

97
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,250
with the vulgarity of words.

98
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,167
Well, try at least.

99
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,375
I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain jack shit.

100
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:57,292
So I'll write: "Lives on vibrations,
but she doesn't know what they are."

101
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,667
I'm starting to dislike
this interview,

102
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,792
I sense conflictuality in you.

103
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,375
- Conflictuality as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.

104
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,333
Let's talk about my mom's
abusive boyfriend.

105
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:12,167
No! I want to know
what a vibration is.

106
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,875
It's my radar to intercept
the world.

107
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,125
Your radar... meaning?

108
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,292
You're a pain in the ass.

109
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,458
We got off to a bad start...

110
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,458
Talia Concept wants to be
interviewed by your paper,

111
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,542
it has many readers.
But you're biased.

112
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,542
Write about how she has sex
with her fiancÃ© 11 times a day,

113
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,542
he's a talented conceptual artist,

114
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,833
he covers basketballs with confetti!
He's sensational!

115
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,292
Talia Concept is talking about
things that are meaningless to me.

116
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,875
All I've heard
is unpublishable fluff.

117
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,500
You can't charm me
with things like:

118
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,500
"I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain".

119
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,208
Our paper has a core
of cultured readers

120
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,958
that don't want to be taken
for fools. I work for that core.

121
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,750
So let me talk about my eventful,

122
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,708
difficult but necessary
journey as an artist!

123
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,542
Necessary for who?

124
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,958
For heaven's sake, madam,
what is a vibration?

125
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,875
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

126
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,500
You are an obsessive jerk!

127
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:20,500
I'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of a higher stature.

128
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,875
A piece of advice:
when you speak to my editor,

129
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,833
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf, you know.

130
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,375
Jep, this interview is a hoot!

131
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,667
Maybe, but don't send me

132
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,625
to interview someone
who head-butts walls again.

133
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,833
- You know what the trick is?
- Foam rubber.

134
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,625
Amateur dramatics isn't dead.

135
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:47,042
Did you get offended
about the stature comment?

136
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,833
Don't be silly!
That's the funniest bit!

137
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,250
I'm a dwarf, it's no secret.

138
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,417
It's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.

139
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,083
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.

140
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,750
But you haven't had the career
you deserve.

141
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,458
Maybe I don't have much to say...

142
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,333
Bullshit, you're lazy.
You never leave Rome.

143
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,167
Go to Giglio to do that report
on the Concordia

144
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,083
I've asked you to do 50 times.

145
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,125
Re-heated rice is always tastier
than freshly cooked rice.

146
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,708
The old is better than the new.

147
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,375
Plans tonight, chÃ¨rie?

148
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:32,250
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, said:

149
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:36,250
"Tonight I'll do two things,
eat soup and have a shag."

150
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:38,833
Two things that contradict
each other.

151
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,083
That's what I'd say too,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone:

152
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,542
"No, Dadina, they don't,
because they're both hot."

153
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:52,292
There's a publishing house
in Ancona, it's not that small,

154
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,542
they want an interview book
about you.

155
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,708
Another interview book?
We're obsessed with interviews!

156
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,083
Can't you hear them?
"As I always say"... to who?

157
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,708
Forget it!

158
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,542
And honestly,
who'll buy a book called:

159
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,875
"Visions and revisions.
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy"?

160
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,875
It's a serious title!

161
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,875
Unfortunately in this country,
in order to be taken seriously,

162
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,208
you have to take yourself seriously.

163
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,875
I only wrote one novel, 40 years ago.
Impossible to find too...

164
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:25,000
Bullshit, "The Human Apparatus"
was a masterpiece!

165
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,167
It even won the... what was it?

166
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,000
- The Bancarella prize.
- Shit, the Bancarella prize!

167
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,625
You're very kind, but forget it...
it'd be too pompous.

168
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,292
I can't, you'll put me
in an awkward position.

169
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,708
I've agreed and I've even accepted
an advance...

170
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,333
- How much?
- 1,500 euros.

171
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,083
Give it back,
I'll give you 1,500 euros.

172
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,542
By the way,
I spoke to the theatre people.

173
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,875
They'll give you three nights
but you pay for the lights.

174
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,875
Who cares about that!

175
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,083
Jep, this is great news.

176
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,292
It's really great news.
Thank you!

177
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:09,250
Are you still up?
It's time to go to bed.

178
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,500
That's Viola Bartoli,
Bartoli's widow.

179
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,292
The guy who was killed,
the actual Bartoli.

180
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,750
Viola has a 50 metre yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the Nazi.

181
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,083
You know what I call Viola?

182
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,875
- No, what?
- "To-good-to-poo".

183
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,667
- I don't understand.
- Because she's pernickety.

184
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:30,208
Usually pernickety people don't poo.

185
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,542
When I introduced Trumeau
to my family, my father said:

186
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:37,292
"Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poo?"

187
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,875
- How gross!
- It's not as bad as you think.

188
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:44,708
Actually, my wife and I are the only
couple in Italy who are in love.

189
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,875
Orietta, watch out for Lello.

190
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,667
Yes, I know.

191
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,708
He's the world's greatest salesman,
he cons everyone.

192
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,792
In no time he'll get you to spend
every penny

193
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,083
on whatever he's selling.

194
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,583
You always flatter me.

195
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,542
Just because I express myself well
doesn't mean I'm always working!

196
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,750
- What do you do?
- I sell toys.

197
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,833
Not just in a shop,

198
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,500
he's a wholesaler on a global scale,
he even sells to the Chinese!

199
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,917
What about him?

200
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:14,375
Don't you know him? Sebastiano Paf,
perhaps Italy's greatest poet.

201
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:20,083
He wrote: "Up with life,
down with reminiscence."

202
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,917
He's on the Dukan Diet,
so Dadina won't leave him.

203
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,125
Is he with her?

204
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,083
- He is, but she...
- Like at high school.

205
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,083
Why doesn't he ever talk?

206
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,292
Because he listens.

207
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:38,625
- Stop sniffing up with your nose?
- Bugger off.

208
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,333
Jep's found a theatre for me.
Do you want the lead role?

209
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I'm no longer an actress,
I'm a writer now.

210
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,583
Maybe...

211
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,417
Maybe I'll direct a film.

212
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:55,667
- Viola, darling!
- Help me, I'm worried about my son.

213
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,875
- What can I do?
- Why don't you talk to him?

214
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,500
You always say you're good
with strangers...

215
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,667
That's the problem, I'm too good.

216
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:08,250
- Is he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.

217
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:13,042
Take him to a psychiatrist, they're
pragmatic: Ativan, Prozac and so on.

218
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,042
That stuff makes him feel worse.

219
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:18,917
Relax, he's always been odd,
he is what he is.

220
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:22,250
By the way, have you tried
this rascal's endive quiche?

221
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:26,042
It's the first time she's made it
and it's better than my mom's,

222
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,667
please, you must try some!

223
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,167
You changed your hair colour.

224
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,333
I feel Pirandello-esque lately...

225
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:45,875
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.

226
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,667
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only
interesting one today.

227
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:54,167
I'm from Milan, to be honest...
I find Romans...

228
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,917
unbearable!

229
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,833
The best people in Rome
are the tourists.

230
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,417
Take Italy...

231
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:04,000
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.

232
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,667
A country of weavers and grocers.

233
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,875
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,

234
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,250
be such a pessimist
and a defeatist? You're dark.

235
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,042
- Dark?
- Yes.

236
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,042
I heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loans sharks

237
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,958
to pay her hairdressing debts.

238
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,792
Jep says I'm dark!

239
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,542
Gisella's really sunk that low?

240
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:29,917
Rome is the only city in the world
where Marxism has truly existed.

241
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,083
You can't excel over others
for more than a week,

242
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,500
you're immediately brought back
to mediocrity.

243
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,875
Rome is pure collectivism.

244
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:43,417
Pure collectivism.
Stefania, what utter nonsense!

245
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:47,000
Do you know that Flaubert wanted
to write a book about nothing?

246
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:50,542
If he'd met you, we'd have had
a great book, what a shame!

247
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,417
You're a misogynist.

248
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,667
It's not all about you, I'm not
a misogynist, I'm a misanthropist.

249
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,042
When hate's involved,
one must aim high.

250
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:03,167
You're a dark man.

251
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,708
I'm a transparent person,
without a doubt!

252
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,583
Lello!

253
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,667
Aren't you stopping tonight?

254
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,708
Mom!
When I see you I blush!

255
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,500
Andrea...

256
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,417
- You're crazy.
- No, mom, I'm not crazy!

257
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,625
I've got problems.

258
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:29,250
"As the light flashed,
love sat down in the corner.

259
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,250
Shy and distracted as it was.

260
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,500
This is why
we could tolerate life no longer."

261
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,500
Gosh,
no one's quoted me for years!

262
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,542
I read your book as a teenager,
I've never forgotten the end.

263
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:45,958
Stop right there, you're stroking
my ego in a dangerous way.

264
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,917
You must've been deeply in love
when you wrote it.

265
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,500
Moravia made the same comment,
more or less.

266
00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:00,042
Even though he worded it
a bit better.

267
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,333
I once saw Piazza Navona
covered in snow.

268
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,917
Really? What was it like?

269
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,542
White!

270
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,083
When I come to Rome I live there.

271
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,667
Deep in the outskirts...

272
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,167
What job you do?

273
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,542
Me? I'm rich.

274
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,708
Great job.

275
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,667
You didn't enjoy it.

276
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,250
I know I'm not very good.

277
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,250
Why do you say that?

278
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,917
Plus it's so sad being good,
you risk becoming deft.

279
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:07,167
It didn't seem like you cared much.

280
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:13,000
You're very beautiful, Orietta,
very, very, very beautiful.

281
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,000
I take photos, you know.
Of myself.

282
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,167
At all times of the day,
to get to know myself.

283
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,000
- With the self-timer,
with my phone... - Interesting.

284
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,542
My Facebook friends say
I take great photos.

285
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,292
I bet there are some of you naked...

286
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,375
- A few.
- I knew it!

287
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:36,083
Do you want to see them?

288
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:39,125
- Of course.
- I'll get my computer.

289
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:58,000
The most important thing I discovered
a few days after turning 65

290
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:03,083
is that I can't waste any more time
doing things I don't want to do.

291
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:36,833
When I came to Rome,
at the age of 26,

292
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:43,208
I fell pretty swiftly,
almost without realizing it,

293
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:48,417
into what might be defined
as the whirlpool of the high life.

294
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:54,833
But I didn't just want to live
the high life.

295
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,208
Sacconi should be in charge.

296
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,250
Antonini's a fucking pain
in the ass!

297
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:07,208
I wanted to be
the king of the high life.

298
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,000
And I succeeded.

299
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:19,417
I didn't just want
to go to parties.

300
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:25,833
I wanted to have
the power to make them a failure.

301
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,292
Gambardella?

302
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:01,208
Sorry for showing up like this,
without warning...

303
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,792
I'm Alfredo Marti.

304
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,167
Nice to meet you, I'm Jep,
but my house is this one.

305
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,417
I don't want to bother you.

306
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,750
How can I help you?

307
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,583
I'm Elisa De Santis' husband.

308
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Did you have children?

309
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,833
No.

310
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,500
I couldn't.

311
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,333
But I could.

312
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,167
I could.

313
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,708
I'm sorry.

314
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,208
Forgive me.

315
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,750
She could too.

316
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,958
Elisa died.

317
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,042
Yesterday.

318
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,750
Alfredo, if you need anything,
you know where I live.

319
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,958
Don't leave me alone, please.
Don't leave me.

320
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,792
We were married for 35 years...

321
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,625
but Elisa always loved you.

322
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,833
What are you saying?

323
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,625
Elisa and I went out together
when we were kids.

324
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,250
She left me, I think,
it was so long ago I don't remember.

325
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,667
Yes, she left you.
On September 8th, 1970.

326
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,375
Exactly...

327
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,542
You're distraught now,
that's normal.

328
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,708
I'm not distraught.

329
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:24,208
Elisa only ever loved one man.

330
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,250
- You.
- How can you say that?

331
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,375
I never saw Elisa again,
you were together for a lifetime!

332
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,958
I found a diary of hers,
with a lock.

333
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,250
And I broke the lock off.

334
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,125
I write for a living, believe me...

335
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:49,667
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies...

336
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:53,333
I was only a good companion.

337
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,625
That's all she wrote about me.

338
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:02,500
35 years together...

339
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:07,125
and I'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.

340
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,875
Here, Alfredo.

341
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,375
What'll you do now?

342
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,083
What I've always done.

343
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,583
I'll live in adoration of her.

344
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,708
What's he doing?

345
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,458
Stop!

346
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,375
Jep!

347
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,292
Well done!

348
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,583
He made it!

349
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:06,167
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.

350
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,000
Francesca!

351
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,667
Who are you?

352
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,542
Who am I?

353
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,958
- I am...
- No, you're nobody.

354
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,375
Nobody?

355
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,875
But I...

356
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,167
Francesca, where on earth are you?

357
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,417
I've been looking for you
for over an hour!

358
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:32,250
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.

359
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,000
Sir is strange.

360
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:38,125
I don't like that,
I prefer you to be sad.

361
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:42,708
- Are you going to bed?
- Last night I went to bed at 22:30.

362
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,458
Now I don't know what to do.

363
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,667
Morning is an unknown object to me.

364
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:49,792
Unknown.

365
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:53,333
Sir can help me clean
the house then.

366
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,708
- Sir can't, sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.

367
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:01,458
"Is there a new nation struggling
within the walls of the city?

368
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,167
From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapour ascends like smoke

369
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,542
and works like a magic philtre
in the blood of some men

370
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:16,625
producing a form of heroic madness
unlike any other."

371
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,333
What do you think? Shit,
it's powerful, don't you think?

372
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,333
Why the hell do an adaptation
of D'Annunzio for the stage?

373
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,375
D'Annunzio has always been
paradigmatic...

374
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,958
You think that certain
intellectual feats give you dignity,

375
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:38,042
and that others are better than you,
but you're wrong!

376
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:42,333
Try and write something of your own,
like...

377
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,083
a feeling, or sorrow...

378
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,917
I've known you ages
but you've never been here.

379
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,417
Don't get big-headed, you've got
a room in a student flat...

380
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,917
Are you going out with that
gloomy girl you're always with?

381
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,583
I wish!
I've tried it on 7,000 times.

382
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,083
I've never even had a kiss,
not one!

383
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,958
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.

384
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,417
- She's complicated.
- She's a bitch.

385
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,458
Trust me, you're too kind.

386
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:12,625
I can tell her type from a mile off,
I don't even need to meet them.

387
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:16,042
- What are you doing with that hat?
- My morning exercise.

388
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,500
- That's exercise?
- Yes!

389
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,458
Do you know how many women
you've been with?

390
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,583
No, I'm rubbish at maths.

391
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,958
I've always been good at maths.

392
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,792
It's six, I introduced you to them.

393
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,583
Seven.

394
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,375
- Seven?
- Seven.

395
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,708
- When did number seven happen?
- Last summer.

396
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:41,125
A friend of my sister's back home
when I went to see my folks.

397
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,250
She runs a shop...

398
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,208
- She's nice.
- That means she's a dog.

399
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,042
What about you and Orietta?

400
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,500
- Who's Orietta?
- Don't you know?

401
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,875
She was at your house...
A real beauty.

402
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,833
At my age, a beauty isn't enough.

403
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,375
I might take up writing again.

404
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:20,042
That's great news!

405
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,375
Has something happened?

406
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,667
Why?

407
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:33,750
You want to write again after all
these years, something's happened.

408
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,250
Something always happens in Rome.
Nothing's happened.

409
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,542
What are you looking at?

410
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,000
Come here.

411
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,042
They met at university
10 days ago.

412
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:05,792
They haven't stopped kissing
for 10 days.

413
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:17,750
This generation of youths
horrifies me.

414
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:22,167
Supported by this state for years,
when they realise they're smart,

415
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,292
they go study or work in America
or London,

416
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,958
forgetting about the support.

417
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,167
They have no civil vocation.

418
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,333
As a young girl,
in the occupied arts department,

419
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,833
I oozed civil vocation.

420
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,750
- Is that so?
- Yes, why?

421
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,125
- Come off it...
- What do you know?

422
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:40,833
In those years you were in Naples
being a loafer with posh girls

423
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,958
and writing your only novelette.

424
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,000
I didn't notice that history
was being made.

425
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:50,042
Novelette? It was a masterpiece
of Italian literature!

426
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,250
I confirm that Jep and civil
vocation never got along,

427
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,583
he was lazy and the other
hyperactive.

428
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:59,458
Romano, stop sucking up to your
idol, you're pathetic!

429
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,125
"The Human Apparatus"
was a narrow-minded, frivolous book

430
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:06,375
and pretentious too, like its title.
Jep knows that.

431
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,625
- That's why he stopped there.
- Sorry, what about you then?

432
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,833
I tried changing things
with literature.

433
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:17,208
I wrote 11 novels, and a book about
the Party's official history.

434
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,667
You're forgetting your contribution
to that reality show...

435
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:23,292
"Girl Farm".

436
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:26,292
Television can be
a very formative experience!

437
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,458
I always go when I'm invited.

438
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:31,292
I get my hands dirty,
I try things...

439
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:33,542
I don't spend my life being a snob.

440
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:38,292
Are you saying that a socially
committed writer is advantaged,

441
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:41,375
and safeguarded,
compared to a novelist

442
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:44,042
who deals with, how can I say...
with feelings?

443
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,917
Of course she is!

444
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:49,167
The cause someone commits
their life to isn't secondary.

445
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,417
Like creating a family,

446
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:53,458
dedicating oneself with sacrifice

447
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:56,375
to raising one's children day
after day.

448
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:00,458
Eusebio and I have four children,
we plan the future together.

449
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:03,167
I work hard
to be both a mother and a woman,

450
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:07,875
but at the end of the day I feel
I've done something important.

451
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:09,292
So if we don't have children

452
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:12,917
we should contemplate
the idea of suicide?

453
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:15,958
- I don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.

454
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:20,333
Dadina, I admire you greatly.
You're a badass.

455
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:23,250
Do you use "badass"
in any of your 11 novels?

456
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,750
Yes, I do, I try to be modern.

457
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,042
- Modernity is badass.
- De gustibus.

458
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:34,375
What great conviction!
Should I envy you or be repelled?

459
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,917
Yes, I have convictions.
I'm 53...

460
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,042
- You'd never know.
- Never.

461
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,958
I'm 53, I've suffered,
I bounced back,

462
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:45,167
and learned lots about life.

463
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,917
Well, I can see you have nothing
to say, at last.

464
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:51,333
I was drinking...

465
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:55,542
As we care about you,
we don't want to embarrass you.

466
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,542
You know, all this boastful talk,

467
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,875
all this serious ostentatiousness,
all this ego...

468
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,833
These harsh damning judgments
of yours

469
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,500
hide a certain fragility,
a feeling of inadequacy

470
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:13,167
and above all a series of untruths.
We care about you, we know you.

471
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:17,333
We also know our untruths
and for this, unlike you,

472
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,417
we end up talking about nonsense,
about trivial matters,

473
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,708
because we don't want
to revel in our pettiness.

474
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,958
What untruths
are you talking about?

475
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,875
Everything I said is true,
it's what I am, what I believe in.

476
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:33,167
Please, I'm a gentleman.
Don't destroy my only certainty.

477
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,500
Tell me exactly what my lies are
and what my fragility is!

478
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,625
I'm a woman with balls, tell me!

479
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:46,625
"Woman with balls" would be too much
for any gentleman.

480
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,208
All right, Stefania,
you asked for it. In random order:

481
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:54,458
Your civil vocation during
your student days went unnoticed.

482
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:58,625
But another vocation of yours
is remembered by many,

483
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:02,708
the one practiced by you then,
in the university toilets.

484
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,667
You wrote about the Party because
you were its leader's mistress.

485
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,833
And your 11 novels,

486
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:13,542
published by a small publishing
house subsidized by the Party,

487
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:17,000
reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
newspapers,

488
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:20,167
are insignificant,
everyone says so.

489
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:23,583
I'm not saying my novelette
was any better,

490
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:26,125
I agree with you there.

491
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:29,042
Your relationship with Eusebio...

492
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:32,958
What relationship? Eusebio
loves Giordano, everyone knows.

493
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,083
He has for years.

494
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:39,458
They lunch every day
at Arnaldo's, under the coat rack,

495
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:43,458
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
You all know but turn a blind eye.

496
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:48,542
Your dedication to your children,
with all the sacrifices entailed...

497
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,417
You work all week in TV,
you go out every night,

498
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:55,958
even on Mondays, when popper
dealers don't even venture out.

499
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,708
You're never with your children,

500
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,542
not even on the
long holidays you take.

501
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:04,542
And plus you have a butler,
a waiter,

502
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,875
a cook, a chauffeur
who drives the kids to school,

503
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,792
three babysitters, so...

504
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:16,375
how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?

505
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,083
These are the untruths and fragility
I'm talking about.

506
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,208
Stefania, mother and woman.

507
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:30,292
You're 53, with a life in tatters,
like the rest of us.

508
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:35,292
Instead of acting superior
and treating us with contempt,

509
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:38,583
you should look at us
with affection.

510
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,333
We're all on the brink of despair,

511
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:44,125
all we can do
is look each other in the face,

512
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:48,333
keep each other company,
joke a little...

513
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,667
Don't you agree?

514
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,958
Son of a bitch!

515
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,417
Egidio, old chap!

516
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,958
Bastard!
I haven't seen you in 30 years!

517
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:59,667
- I need to talk to you.
- Later! I'm busy, can't you see?

518
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:02,875
- Is this still your place?
- Luckily not, I sold it.

519
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,625
I'm still the manager though.

520
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:09,042
You're famous! You're always
in the gossip rags.

521
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,875
You're at all the VIP parties,
always with a girl!

522
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,917
You never come here...

523
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:17,583
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk!

524
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:20,208
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.

525
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:24,125
- I've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?

526
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,500
You artists are all the same!

527
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:29,750
I tell you I have a daughter
and you complain about her name!

528
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:31,833
What's wrong with "Ramona"?

529
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,875
Nothing, it's a name that implies
ambitions...

530
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,083
There's my daughter, you see?

531
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:52,292
She makes me so mad,
I've told her a million times!

532
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,417
You're too old for this!

533
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:58,042
Now these hot young Polish girls
rule the scene.

534
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,750
They're experts at turning tricks.

535
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,042
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.

536
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:06,792
But the world's no longer
sophisticated. Right, Jep?

537
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:09,500
I know, only you and I are.

538
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,375
That's right, goddammit!

539
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:15,208
But she wants to keep doing
this job, for the money.

540
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,125
I don't know why
she always needs money

541
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,667
and what she fucking
does with it.

542
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,708
- For drugs? - I wish,
we'd have a common interest.

543
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,583
She doesn't even drink beer.

544
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,875
I don't know what she spends
her money on, she's always broke.

545
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,708
- Do I seem like a loser?
- No, why?

546
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:35,083
Because I can hear myself talk,
I sound like a loser.

547
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:39,042
I'm nearly 70 and I have to work
till 6 in the morning every day.

548
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,708
I swapped cocaine for heroin
15 years ago.

549
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:46,667
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!

550
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,583
Could I be more of a loser?

551
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:53,458
But I'm not important,
it's her I worry about, I love her.

552
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:56,250
And I'm no loser there,
I'm a father.

553
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,500
And like all fathers, I'm worried.

554
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,458
What'll she do in a few years?

555
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,750
She can't be a stripper at 50!

556
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,708
- Why don't you fix her up?
- Me?

557
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:12,458
Don't you know any rich guys
who want a beautiful wife?

558
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:15,333
We could change her name,
that's no problem.

559
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,208
You'd do me a big favour.

560
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:22,292
- I'm a writer, not a pimp.
- Sorry, I was a bit vulgar.

561
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:26,292
Daddy's little girl, this is
my good friend, Jep Gambardella.

562
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:29,458
I'll leave you to it,
I need the toilet.

563
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,167
Be right back!

564
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:34,750
- Hi, I'm Jep.
- Ramona.

565
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:53,458
- If you want a girl, get a Pole.
- Are you kidding?

566
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,583
Who wants a girl?
Not me.

567
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,292
I really am an old friend
of your father's.

568
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,750
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.

569
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:06,375
When I came to Rome, I'd wait for
my friends to leave to come here.

570
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,375
Your father was a nice guy.

571
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:11,750
He taught me loads of things,
such as: vodka is uncouth.

572
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,208
How useful!

573
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,167
He asked me to find you a husband.

574
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:21,958
He's obsessed.
I'm not looking for a husband.

575
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,333
Well, you should be.

576
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:27,750
- A family's a beautiful thing.
- I know.

577
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:30,375
But I'm not cut out
for beautiful things.

578
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:48,083
What's wrong?

579
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:52,375
- I feel old.
- You're no spring chicken.

580
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:41,625
One.

581
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,667
- How are you?
- Very well.

582
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,792
Just got back from India,
I had amazing dysentery.

583
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:54,667
Come to my divorce party,
I'll have burlesque dancers there.

584
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:57,917
Of course.
What present would you like?

585
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:01,250
One big wish: for the wars
in the Middle East to end.

586
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,042
- I'll do my best.
- Two

587
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:04,750
700 euros.

588
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,250
Thank you.

589
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,792
Tell me, darling.

590
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:12,792
Perhaps...
I was thinking, my mouth...

591
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,208
I'm scared, I've never
done it before, professor.

592
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:21,542
Don't call me professor.
Call me "my friend" or "my love".

593
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,542
We all need love.

594
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,458
What star sign are you,
deeply intense lady?

595
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,375
- Aquarius.
- I knew it!

596
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,083
Want to go back 30 years, to when
it rained at the end of August?

597
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:35,917
- Done.
- That's 700 euros.

598
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,375
Three.

599
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:47,208
- You've been to see Casagrande!
- No, I don't even know him.

600
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,333
You betrayed me, darling!

601
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:52,542
We're undergoing a journey,
and you've interrupted it.

602
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,208
This is the last time.

603
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:01,917
Go, go.

604
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,708
Bye then.

605
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:06,208
- Full price.
- Five.

606
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:07,708
1,200 euros.

607
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,250
- How's your mom?
- She's fine, thank you.

608
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:13,500
- Seven.
- 700 euros.

609
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:14,958
Have you filled out, darling?

610
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,667
You're always in my heart.

611
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:18,083
700 euros.

612
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,917
- As handsome as ever.
- Ten.

613
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,875
- You're my pride.
- Thanks.

614
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,708
Eleven.

615
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:34,250
Professor, I'm here about
my hyperthyroidism.

616
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,750
Where does this undesired
perspiration happen?

617
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,167
On my hands.

618
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,583
- Pray for me, sister.
- You don't need my prayers.

619
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:51,875
You don't know how much of my income
I must surrender to the tax man.

620
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:53,917
Go, sister, go.

621
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,458
That's 700, sister.

622
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,292
Fourteen.

623
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:29,458
- Spying on me?
- No, I was going to knock.

624
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:32,083
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.

625
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:49,958
- What brings you here?
- Nothing, I'm just curious.

626
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,792
- I told you what I think.
- I've no hidden agenda.

627
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:59,583
Do you think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?

628
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,083
Perhaps they just want to talk,

629
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,667
driven by simple
and harmless curiosity.

630
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:08,083
- That's never happened to me.
- It has now.

631
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,208
Wouldn't armbands be more
comfortable?

632
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:15,167
Yes, but they irritate my armpits.

633
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:19,375
Any plans for lunch?

634
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,542
I'm going to my mum's with my dad.

635
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,875
So where's the dog?

636
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:26,250
What dog?

637
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:29,542
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.

638
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:34,375
I had a Labrador, but 9 years ago
he got fed up and left me.

639
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,083
Labradors are dumb.

640
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,125
And Cooker Spaniels are dumb too.

641
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,333
Hi, Jep.

642
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:51,792
Hi, Antonello.

643
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:56,083
- You know Venditti?
- I know everyone.

644
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:59,958
It must be very satisfying
knowing so many people!

645
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:03,833
- You're guaranteed to be unhappy.
- Have people let you down?

646
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,958
I've let them down.

647
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,750
Andrea! Are you with your mom?

648
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,708
- She's parking.
- How are you?

649
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,500
Not well.

650
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:17,750
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.

651
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,333
Proust is scary.

652
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,625
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this afternoon.

653
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,750
But it's evening already
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.

654
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:29,792
Turgenev said: "Death looked at me,
noticing me."

655
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,583
Don't take these writers
so seriously!

656
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,875
Who should I take seriously then?

657
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,458
Nothing, apart from the menu,
of course.

658
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,250
Things are too complicated to be
understood by one individual.

659
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,667
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.

660
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,083
<i>- Your reply?
_ My reply?</i>

661
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,292
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.

662
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,542
- Good evening.
- Viola.

663
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:05,958
Darling, why don't you
get a table for us?

664
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,667
How did you find him?

665
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,167
- He's better.
- Good, very good.

666
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:16,917
He's much better, I'm so happy!

667
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:19,375
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course!

668
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,042
On Thursday I'm inexplicably free.

669
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:26,708
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?
She's dating her personal trainer.

670
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,000
Really? It doesn't show.

671
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:32,458
- I invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?

672
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:36,250
She's nasty, you know.
She's like the devil!

673
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,333
Really? You think so?

674
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:41,917
I see her at yoga twice a week.

675
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,000
- You'll come?
- Of course.

676
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,708
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.

677
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,833
Goodbye.

678
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:56,417
Watch that table carefully, but
don't let them notice you looking.

679
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,958
Waiter? Champagne, please.
Cristal.

680
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,833
You can't imagine
how much one learns

681
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:08,708
by living alongside
a cluster of religious institutes.

682
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:26,042
So that was your first time?

683
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:31,208
Yes, he didn't think he'd been good,
too quick, he said.

684
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,625
So, out of anger or to let off
steam, I'm not sure which,

685
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,458
he got a football
and played with it furiously!

686
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:40,250
And you?

687
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,417
I didn't enjoy making love with him,

688
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,250
but seeing him with a football
was an unforgettable thing!

689
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:53,417
He became really good,
he played on the national team.

690
01:07:57,417 --> 01:08:00,083
Your dad said you spend everything
you earn.

691
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,083
What on? You can tell me.

692
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:08,000
Maybe one day. But why didn't you
write another book?

693
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,417
Because I went out too much
at night.

694
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:15,250
Rome makes you waste a lot of time.

695
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:20,500
It's distracting.
Writing requires focus and peace.

696
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,208
That's not much of an answer.

697
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:26,833
You have plenty of peace here,
it's like being in the country.

698
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,250
I wrote in short spurts.
I was a sprint-style writer.

699
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,667
I told you about my first time...

700
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,917
but you've told me nothing.
It's your turn now.

701
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:55,417
On an island... one summer.

702
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,250
I was...

703
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,708
18, she was 20.

704
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,625
At the lighthouse, at night.

705
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,667
I went to kiss her,
she turned away.

706
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,208
I was disappointed.

707
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,250
But then she turned to look at me.

708
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,167
She brushed me with her lips...

709
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:23,417
she smelled of flowers.

710
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:29,458
I didn't move,
I wasn't able to move.

711
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:37,500
Then she took a step back...
and said...

712
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:45,875
She took a step back.

713
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,625
And said...

714
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,417
I'm going home, it's late.

715
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:13,583
Want to come to a party
tomorrow night?

716
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,417
Outstanding!

717
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,708
Did you want us to die tonight?

718
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,292
You won't believe it,
but I love knife throwers.

719
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:14,167
A true likeness,
especially the hips.

720
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,833
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
It'll look great on the mantelpiece.

721
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,583
God bless you, Jep!

722
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,417
This is Ramona.

723
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:23,417
What a unique and marvelous
creature.

724
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,417
- Is he taking the piss?
- It's hard to know.

725
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,208
I was being honest.

726
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,625
I'm just sorry you missed
Geronimo D.

727
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,042
- What a tragedy!
- Come in, make yourselves at home.

728
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:38,000
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio.

729
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,417
The greatest modern art collector
in this debauched country.

730
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:46,167
- What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?
- I don't know.

731
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:49,625
Jep's proving to be
a disappointment.

732
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:52,958
- Good evening, countess.
- Hello, you're looking well.

733
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:57,542
I wish I could say that same
about the count. Hello, ladies!

734
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,958
Are you stupid?
You're distracting my artist.

735
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,542
Dad, we're having fun.

736
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,292
Carmelina, come and do some work.

737
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,292
Mom, I want to play here.

738
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:10,625
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll sort it out.

739
01:13:10,792 --> 01:13:14,125
- I'm not coming, I'm staying here.
- You don't mean that.

740
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:16,542
Europe's greatest gallery owners
are outside.

741
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:20,625
If you show them what you can do
then ours will be a happy family.

742
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,625
But I'm already happy,
I want to be a vet one day.

743
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:28,875
Get to bed, you two!
My kids are going to bed.

744
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:30,000
Come.

745
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,667
I'll go to bed too.
I'm a kid too.

746
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,250
She blushes and says:

747
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:44,792
"Forgive me, I didn't know
you loved me so much.

748
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:48,292
My ignorance is obscene."

749
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,125
He looks at her, reassuringly,
and says:

750
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,667
"Let me defend our love".

751
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,667
How's that for the start
of the second act?

752
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:59,875
You've written a pile of shit.

753
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,625
That girl was crying.

754
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,500
Nonsense!
That girl earns millions!

755
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,583
Excuse me a moment.

756
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:11,625
- Hi, Stefano.
- Hi.

757
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:16,125
- The catering's gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.

758
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:17,667
Steeply downhill!

759
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:23,542
Do you have the case with you?

760
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,000
- I always do.
- You up for it?

761
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:37,042
See that?

762
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:46,792
Stefano has the keys to Rome's
most beautiful buildings.

763
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,042
Is he a doorman?

764
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:54,250
No, he's not a doorman.

765
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:57,125
He's friends with princesses.

766
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:01,708
Are you ready?

767
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,167
Come with me.

768
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,292
Good evening, Princesses.

769
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:13,667
Good evening.

770
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:28,750
How come you have all these keys?

771
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,458
Because...

772
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:35,958
I'm a trustworthy person.

773
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:55,917
Did you see? It looked huge,
but it's tiny.

774
01:21:57,667 --> 01:22:01,000
Stay still, I'll take a photo of you.
Don't move.

775
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,083
That's no good.
Laugh.

776
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,042
Got it?

777
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,708
Yes, that's good.

778
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:10,250
Many think that a funeral,

779
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,667
is a fortuitous event,
without any rules.

780
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,917
That's not true.

781
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,292
A funeral is a high-society event
par excellence.

782
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:25,250
You must never forget
that at a funeral

783
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:28,333
you are appearing on stage.

784
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,292
Nice.

785
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,958
Nice, but try the other one.

786
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:44,000
You must patiently wait
for the relatives to disperse.

787
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:49,583
Once you are sure
that all the guests are seated...

788
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:53,583
only at that point, may you offer
your condolences to the family.

789
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:58,208
In this way, everyone will see you.

790
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,958
You take the mourner's hands,

791
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:04,917
and rest yours on their arms.

792
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:09,125
You whisper something to them,
a comforting phrase,

793
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,417
said with authority.

794
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:14,000
For example:

795
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:18,917
"In the days to come,
when you feel the void,

796
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:24,250
I want you to know
that you can always count on me."

797
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:27,750
The public will ask...

798
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:32,458
"What's Jep Gambardella saying?"

799
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,750
This is definitely the right dress.

800
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:57,667
You're allowed to retire
to a corner by yourself,

801
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:01,500
as if contemplating your sorrow.

802
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:07,625
However, another matter
must be approached with shrewdness.

803
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:12,917
The chosen place needs
to be isolated

804
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:15,167
but clearly visible
to the public.

805
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:22,292
Besides, a performance is good when
it is devoid of any superfluity.

806
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,583
So, the fundamental rule:

807
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,750
one must never cry at a funeral.

808
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:35,042
You must never steal the show
from the family's sorrow.

809
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:38,375
That is forbidden.

810
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,250
Because it is immoral.

811
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:23,125
Viola.

812
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:36,500
In the days to come,
when you feel the void,

813
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,167
you can always count on me.

814
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:36,042
Now I ask Andrea's friends
to come forward,

815
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,958
so that the coffin
may be carried outside.

816
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:04,500
Your back!

817
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,625
It was nice not making love.

818
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,417
It was nice loving each other.

819
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,042
I'd forgotten what loving someone
was about, I'd forgotten that.

820
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,708
I spend all my money to cure myself.

821
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,917
Your breakfast.

822
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:52,208
Come on, I'm taking you to see
a sea monster today.

823
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:15,500
Your breakfast.

824
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,833
Five more minutes.

825
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,083
Can you see the sea?

826
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,917
Where?

827
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:39,833
On the ceiling.

828
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,292
Yes, I can see it.

829
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:25,583
Who's going to look after you now?

830
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:44,625
I'm sorry about your daughter.
My condolences.

831
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:17,042
I spent all my summers
making plans for September.

832
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:18,833
Not any longer.

833
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:24,625
Now I spend the summer
remembering the good intentions

834
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:27,167
which vanished.

835
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:31,792
In part because of laziness,
in part because of carelessness.

836
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:38,083
What's wrong
with feeling nostalgic?

837
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:41,833
It's the only distraction left
for those

838
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,583
who've no faith
in the future!

839
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,250
Without rain...

840
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:55,292
August is coming to an end
and September isn't arriving.

841
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,125
And I'm so ordinary!

842
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,250
But there's no need to worry.

843
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,750
It's all right, it's okay.

844
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:15,042
Bravo!

845
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:32,292
Thank you.

846
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:22,250
What are you doing here?

847
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:26,708
Arturo!
Why are you here?

848
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:30,333
Don't you see?
I'm rehearsing my magic show.

849
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:34,583
This is tomorrow's special number:
the vanishing giraffe.

850
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:37,167
You can make this giraffe vanish?

851
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:40,375
Of course I can make
the giraffe vanish!

852
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:44,458
Then make me vanish too.

853
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:51,917
Jep, do you think that if I could
really make people vanish

854
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:56,333
I'd still be here at my age
playing these circus games?

855
01:35:57,625 --> 01:35:59,250
It's just a trick.

856
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,458
It's just a trick!

857
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,292
Romano, how did it go?

858
01:36:17,542 --> 01:36:19,542
Well, they clapped.

859
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:21,708
I'm glad.

860
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,833
- So why are you so sad?
- I'm not sad.

861
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,708
What's with the giraffe?

862
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:29,750
For a magic show.
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

863
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:31,833
I'm not doing the show tomorrow.

864
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,500
Why not? You said it went well.

865
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:39,583
I'm leaving, I'm going back
to my home town, for good.

866
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:43,458
I won't even pack up my things,
I'll leave it all.

867
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:49,333
I've lived in this city
for 40 years.

868
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:52,458
And in the end I thought...

869
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,833
the only person
who deserved a goodbye

870
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,167
was you.

871
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,417
So you're leaving?

872
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,792
Romano... why are you leaving?

873
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:11,833
Rome has really disappointed me.

874
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,375
Bye, Jep.

875
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:41,042
See?

876
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:13,792
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. I know you're busy.

877
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,708
I need to ask you something.

878
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,792
Go ahead.

879
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:24,458
Why did Elisa leave me?

880
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:29,417
I don't know.

881
01:38:29,542 --> 01:38:33,583
Didn't she say anything about it
in her diary?

882
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,375
No, I don't think so.

883
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,375
Would you be offended
if I asked to read it?

884
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:46,333
No, I wouldn't.

885
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:49,333
In fact, I'd understand.

886
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:53,542
But I'm afraid I can't
let you read it.

887
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:54,750
Why not?

888
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:58,583
Because a few days after the
funeral, I threw it away.

889
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:06,583
May I introduce you
to my girlfriend?

890
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,542
Hello, my name's Polina.

891
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:16,417
Like Polina in "The Gambler"
by Dostoyevsky.

892
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,667
What are you doing tonight?

893
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,417
Nothing.

894
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,958
Polina's going to finish ironing...

895
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:34,208
then we'll drink a glass
of red wine.

896
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:38,708
We'll watch some television
and go to bed.

897
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:40,917
What about you?

898
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:47,292
I'll have a lot of drinks, but not
so many as to become unruly.

899
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:50,333
And then...

900
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:55,958
when you'll be getting up
I'll be going to bed.

901
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:06,167
What lovely people you are!

902
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:18,750
I love doing the train!

903
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:24,833
I'll screw you.

904
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:29,375
"Who am I?"

905
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:34,250
That's how
one of Breton's novels began.

906
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:38,375
And of course in the book
there's no reply.

907
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:41,833
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?

908
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,625
She's donating everything
to the church.

909
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:49,208
She works in the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.

910
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:54,375
The trains at our parties
are the best ones in Rome!

911
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,333
- You think so?
- I do.

912
01:40:58,917 --> 01:41:02,583
They're the best because
they go nowhere.

913
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:16,250
- Well?
- It's wonderful, thank you.

914
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:19,042
Come on, it's all gone.

915
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:22,750
Tell me why you left me, please.

916
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,292
I want an explanation, please!

917
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:29,333
Go away!
Get out! Get out!

918
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:57,125
You see all these people?

919
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:00,292
They can't do anything.

920
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:03,625
But I know how to do something.

921
01:42:04,417 --> 01:42:07,208
We know how to do something.

922
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,375
How sweet!

923
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:58,917
They've been asking me for years
why I don't write another novel.

924
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:02,208
But look at these people.

925
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,458
This Wildlife!

926
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:09,667
This is my life
and it's nothing.

927
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:15,917
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but he failed,

928
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:18,292
so could I do it?

929
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,000
It's nice.
Thanks, rascal.

930
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,333
What inspired this exhibition?

931
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:48,583
It wasn't my idea
to do this photo exhibition.

932
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:50,958
It was my father's idea.

933
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:55,208
When I was born, he starting taking
photos of me, every day.

934
01:43:55,417 --> 01:43:57,375
One photo per day.

935
01:43:57,958 --> 01:44:00,375
He never forgot, not even once.

936
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:04,958
From the age of 14 upwards,
I continued.

937
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:08,917
I photographed myself every day.

938
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:15,042
Go ahead.

939
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:01,375
- Cardinal!
- Your Eminence!

940
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:07,083
Cardinal,
when will The Saint arrive in Rome?

941
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:10,625
On Thursday,
but please don't call her The Saint.

942
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:14,917
She is a Saint but not technically.

943
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:18,792
Tell me something,
who is that cardinal?

944
01:46:18,917 --> 01:46:21,333
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?

945
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,292
- The one in line to be...
- Exactly.

946
01:46:23,417 --> 01:46:25,500
The papal throne awaits him.

947
01:46:25,708 --> 01:46:28,417
I met him at Giada Ricci's
carnival party.

948
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:31,792
Rumour has it that he used to be
Europe's best exorcist.

949
01:46:31,917 --> 01:46:33,708
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No.

950
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:36,417
I never joke about the devil.

951
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:40,292
Do you know I'm very, very bored.

952
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:44,458
We're having a great, great time.

953
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:46,958
You cut up the duck.

954
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:52,458
Cook it on a high flame
for 15 minutes.

955
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:54,333
At that point...

956
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,417
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.

957
01:46:57,542 --> 01:47:01,625
We met at Giada Ricci's party.
I was dressed as an escort.

958
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,708
Come, they're starting
to serve lunch.

959
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,583
I'd like you meet my writer friend,
Jep Gambardella.

960
01:47:09,292 --> 01:47:13,917
A writer!
This country needs writers.

961
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:16,250
Actually I thought it was more
in need of priests.

962
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,250
Help.

963
01:47:17,375 --> 01:47:20,667
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.

964
01:47:20,792 --> 01:47:23,833
Well, for some time now...

965
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:32,667
from a spiritual point of view...

966
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:38,208
- Skunk hunt?
- Of course, I'll lead the way!

967
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:41,708
I know the Tebaldi grounds well.

968
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:52,000
Jep Gambardella, the king
of socialites! You're losing it.

969
01:47:52,125 --> 01:47:57,542
I've been losing it for 40 years.
It's a steady decline.

970
01:48:01,792 --> 01:48:07,583
Tell me something, Stefania.
Have we ever slept with each other?

971
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:10,750
Of course not!

972
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:19,667
That's an awfully big mistake!
We must make amends, immediately.

973
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,750
Idiot.

974
01:48:25,417 --> 01:48:27,333
Thank goodness.

975
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:31,833
We still have something nice
to do together.

976
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:38,083
The future is marvelous, Stefania.

977
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:16,667
To be honest, Catellani
hasn't had many brushed fabrics

978
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:19,042
in recent years.

979
01:49:19,167 --> 01:49:22,583
In my opinion, Rebecchi's still
the best tailor in Rome.

980
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:29,208
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man.

981
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:34,333
One who, while you play the artist
and have fun with your friends,

982
01:49:34,458 --> 01:49:36,833
keeps this country going.

983
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:39,667
I keep this country going,

984
01:49:39,792 --> 01:49:42,583
but many people
haven't understood that yet.

985
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:50,083
Imagine that, Dadina,
Giulio Moneta was my neighbour.

986
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:55,792
One of the world's 10 most wanted
men and I never noticed.

987
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:58,792
You've changed,
you're always thinking.

988
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:03,708
Maybe I should do what Romano did.

989
01:50:04,625 --> 01:50:06,917
I'm not fit for this life
or this city.

990
01:50:07,042 --> 01:50:11,708
Nobody's fit for shit, dammit.
Take it from the queen of misfits.

991
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,667
Everything around me is dying.

992
01:50:16,667 --> 01:50:19,917
People who are younger than me,
things...

993
01:50:20,792 --> 01:50:22,042
All before my eyes and I...

994
01:50:22,167 --> 01:50:25,750
And you're suffering.
And you don't understand.

995
01:50:33,792 --> 01:50:36,333
How's the soup, Little Jep?

996
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,792
The soup's good.

997
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:47,083
Why did you call me Little Jep? No
one's called me that for centuries.

998
01:50:47,208 --> 01:50:49,583
Because a friend,
every now and again,

999
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:53,333
needs to make their friend
feel like they did as a child.

1000
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:58,000
How can I make you feel
like a little girl?

1001
01:50:58,125 --> 01:51:01,083
You don't need to, I feel
like a little girl every day!

1002
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:04,917
I've seen the world from
their viewpoint for 60 years.

1003
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,500
You know Sister Maria,
the missionary,

1004
01:51:09,167 --> 01:51:10,708
the one they call the Saint?

1005
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:14,833
Yes, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honour.

1006
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:18,375
Exactly. In all her life,
she's only given three interviews.

1007
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:22,167
- Yours will be memorable.
- Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!

1008
01:51:22,292 --> 01:51:26,250
This is different.
She studied in Italy

1009
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:29,417
and speaks Italian.
She read your book and loved it.

1010
01:51:30,042 --> 01:51:31,417
She wants to meet you

1011
01:51:31,542 --> 01:51:33,833
so I organized a dinner party
at your house tomorrow.

1012
01:51:33,958 --> 01:51:37,583
- Did I do well?
- You did very well.

1013
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:44,333
Tomorrow I'll have the honour
of dining with her.

1014
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:47,000
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.

1015
01:53:47,167 --> 01:53:48,750
No, at Jep Gambardella's.

1016
01:53:49,542 --> 01:53:55,542
You see, the Pope even invited
the enclosed nuns.

1017
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:33,333
Sisters, sisters, sisters!

1018
01:54:34,292 --> 01:54:36,208
Sisters, sisters...
Yes, perfect!

1019
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:41,125
Ah, the Red Cross nurses!
Well-toned!

1020
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:44,208
Okay, great...
What handsome young men!

1021
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,083
Great!

1022
01:54:46,667 --> 01:54:48,125
Let's go!

1023
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:54,000
The Saint's assistant called me.

1024
01:54:54,125 --> 01:54:58,042
The Saint would like Count and
Countess Odescalchi to come too,

1025
01:54:58,167 --> 01:55:00,333
as they treated her like a sister
when she lived in Italy.

1026
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:03,875
- Do you know them? - Of course,
but they are not in Rome.

1027
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,417
All the nobles are in London,
at Philip's great-niece's wedding.

1028
01:55:07,542 --> 01:55:10,667
Let's call the Colonnas of Reggio.

1029
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:12,667
The nobles for hire?
They're dead.

1030
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:15,375
Nonsense, they're immortal.

1031
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:19,167
The Saint won't even notice,
70 years have gone by!

1032
01:55:19,917 --> 01:55:22,083
This piece of furniture
looks great...

1033
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:27,042
- Who would've thought!
-It looks great, like a new bathroom!

1034
01:55:31,667 --> 01:55:33,833
Count Colonna speaking.

1035
01:55:34,458 --> 01:55:36,875
Yes, we are available.

1036
01:55:37,917 --> 01:55:39,542
For tonight.

1037
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:43,417
Our rate is 250 euros per person
for the evening.

1038
01:55:44,167 --> 01:55:47,417
Plus the cost of the car hire.

1039
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:53,167
This would be somewhat
humiliating for us...

1040
01:55:53,917 --> 01:55:58,458
We are willing to be hired
as the Colonnas of Reggio.

1041
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:03,458
But as for pretending to be
the Odescalchis...

1042
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:05,083
I don't know...

1043
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:09,208
We were at war for two centuries.

1044
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,875
I feel it's immoral.

1045
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:16,708
Cut at least twelve pieces
of rabbit!

1046
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:20,667
Set aside the kidneys, liver,
headâ.

1047
01:56:20,875 --> 01:56:22,833
Gently brown.

1048
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:26,417
Don't forget thyme,
laurel leaves, rosemary...

1049
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:30,917
Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
pine nuts.

1050
01:56:31,833 --> 01:56:34,917
And after an hour,
you have Ligurian-style rabbit!

1051
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:38,042
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?

1052
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:42,125
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel
at the Spanish Steps.

1053
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:45,833
To be honest, Sister Maria
finds it uncomfortable.

1054
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:48,542
Never heard the Hassler
described as uncomfortable!

1055
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:50,667
It's very comfortable

1056
01:56:50,792 --> 01:56:54,083
but Sister Maria isn't used
to sleeping in a bed.

1057
01:56:54,667 --> 01:56:57,917
She sleeps on the floor,
in a cardboard bed.

1058
01:56:58,042 --> 01:57:00,125
Do you have any visits planned?

1059
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:02,167
Sister Maria will climb

1060
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:04,542
St John's Basilica's Scala Sancta
on her knees.

1061
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:07,458
- Have you?
- I'd have liked to, but...

1062
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:10,542
I have a bad knee...

1063
01:57:10,667 --> 01:57:13,250
Orthopedic problems
are unimportant,

1064
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:18,250
compared to the partial indulgence
granted by the Scala Sancta.

1065
01:57:18,375 --> 01:57:23,083
That's true! Another specialty
of mine is lamb with...

1066
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:26,292
Does Sister Maria still help
the sick?

1067
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:29,667
22 hours a day, every day.

1068
01:57:29,833 --> 01:57:33,333
She washes them, feeds them...
You ought to see her.

1069
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:36,083
Despite her age,
she doesn't walk, she runs.

1070
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:42,458
Now she's tired, but that's because
she's not with her patients.

1071
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:44,208
How old is she?

1072
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:46,333
She'll be 104 in October.

1073
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,750
- That's impressive.
- I thought she was older!

1074
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:53,875
Longevity too, like all things,
is not accidental.

1075
01:57:54,042 --> 01:57:56,667
About Sister Maria's interview
with Jep...

1076
01:57:56,792 --> 01:58:01,958
Her interview?
There must be a mix-up...

1077
01:58:02,083 --> 01:58:05,000
Sister Maria hasn't given
any interviews since 1971,

1078
01:58:05,125 --> 01:58:07,875
after the reason
for her mission in Chad,

1079
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,750
was misunderstood by some.

1080
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:14,375
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work...

1081
01:58:14,542 --> 01:58:16,917
You told me she enjoyed
"The Human Apparatus".

1082
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:20,333
She found it beautiful and fierce.

1083
01:58:20,458 --> 01:58:22,458
Like the world of men.

1084
01:58:22,583 --> 01:58:25,292
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,

1085
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:27,375
Sister Maria can review the text...

1086
01:58:27,583 --> 01:58:30,708
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't insist.

1087
01:58:30,875 --> 01:58:34,292
I don't wish to raise
any false hopes,

1088
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:38,000
there's absolutely
no question of any interview.

1089
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:41,083
Sorry, but why do
you always answer?

1090
01:58:41,208 --> 01:58:43,333
Why not let Sister Maria talk?

1091
01:59:02,542 --> 01:59:04,958
Madam...

1092
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:11,917
I took a vow of poverty.

1093
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:18,250
And you can't talk about poverty...

1094
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:21,708
you have to live it.

1095
01:59:33,042 --> 01:59:37,042
Such true and real words!
Powerful words!

1096
01:59:41,167 --> 01:59:43,250
Do you need anything, madam?

1097
01:59:43,917 --> 01:59:46,292
- She needs the bathroom.
- It's on the left.

1098
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:49,250
The change of diet
isn't good for her.

1099
01:59:49,375 --> 01:59:55,833
Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
40 grams of plant roots a day.

1100
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:59,542
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,

1101
01:59:59,667 --> 02:00:03,250
I have some splendid
roots with lemon.

1102
02:00:03,375 --> 02:00:06,625
You clean the roots
by scraping them with a knife

1103
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:10,292
and you cut them into small
chunksâ.

1104
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:13,833
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?

1105
02:00:14,042 --> 02:00:15,792
You were there too...

1106
02:00:17,333 --> 02:00:22,583
I felt the need to ask you
about matters close to my heart.

1107
02:00:22,833 --> 02:00:25,417
Matters regarding faith...

1108
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:29,583
regarding the strength
of spirituality...

1109
02:00:29,917 --> 02:00:32,000
But then you got distracted.

1110
02:00:32,167 --> 02:00:33,625
You can ask me now.

1111
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:39,292
- No, I don't see the point.
- Why?

1112
02:00:39,417 --> 02:00:45,250
I'd be very disappointed to discover
that you have no answers.

1113
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,458
I'm only saying
it's a possibility...

1114
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:50,542
I think that...

1115
02:00:56,958 --> 02:00:58,125
Never mind...

1116
02:01:03,625 --> 02:01:05,333
I apologize for earlier.

1117
02:01:05,542 --> 02:01:09,208
There is one question
I really want to ask you.

1118
02:01:10,333 --> 02:01:13,000
Are the rumors about you true?

1119
02:01:14,083 --> 02:01:16,042
That you were a truly great...

1120
02:01:18,167 --> 02:01:19,917
exorcist?

1121
02:01:48,917 --> 02:01:50,833
Sister Maria...

1122
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:52,917
Sister Maria!

1123
02:01:54,958 --> 02:01:56,583
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1124
02:01:56,708 --> 02:01:58,625
- Have you seen her?
- No, she's not there.

1125
02:02:01,083 --> 02:02:02,875
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1126
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,292
Sister Maria!

1127
02:02:04,417 --> 02:02:05,500
Saint!

1128
02:02:05,625 --> 02:02:08,417
She's called Sister Maria.

1129
02:02:08,542 --> 02:02:10,250
Sister Maria...

1130
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:13,292
Where has that bitch got to?

1131
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:40,250
Sister Maria!

1132
02:02:43,167 --> 02:02:45,208
Sister Maria!

1133
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:49,167
My goodness!

1134
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:52,417
My goodness!

1135
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:27,708
Come, Elisabetta, let's go to bed.

1136
02:03:27,875 --> 02:03:30,875
You go ahead, I'm going upstairs
for a moment.

1137
02:03:32,167 --> 02:03:34,333
Don't be late.

1138
02:04:48,875 --> 02:04:51,792
In this room, in 1930,

1139
02:04:51,917 --> 02:04:55,458
Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,

1140
02:04:55,583 --> 02:04:57,875
Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.

1141
02:04:58,250 --> 02:05:01,417
The princess died
after giving birth.

1142
02:05:01,542 --> 02:05:04,542
Young Elisabetta,
in these opulent rooms,

1143
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:07,542
had a happy and carefree
childhood.

1144
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:12,583
But shortly after, the financial
hardship endured by Prince Erminio,

1145
02:05:13,208 --> 02:05:16,083
forced him to sell the property.

1146
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,125
They're migrating west...

1147
02:05:55,292 --> 02:05:59,375
but now they are resting.

1148
02:06:13,208 --> 02:06:14,917
Did you know

1149
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:20,333
that I know the Christian names...

1150
02:06:20,958 --> 02:06:25,083
of all of these birds?

1151
02:06:32,792 --> 02:06:33,958
Why...

1152
02:06:35,792 --> 02:06:39,375
did you never write another book?

1153
02:06:45,792 --> 02:06:47,625
I was looking for the great beauty,

1154
02:06:49,792 --> 02:06:51,500
but...

1155
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:56,000
I didn't find it.

1156
02:06:57,917 --> 02:06:59,708
Do you know...

1157
02:07:00,542 --> 02:07:02,125
<i>Why...</i>

1158
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:05,875
I only eat roots?

1159
02:07:11,417 --> 02:07:13,083
No, why?

1160
02:07:20,292 --> 02:07:24,875
Because roots are important.

1161
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:04,167
Now there's something
I want to show you.

1162
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:09,083
This is how it always ends.
With death.

1163
02:11:10,333 --> 02:11:13,708
But first there was life.

1164
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:18,250
Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.

1165
02:11:20,708 --> 02:11:25,667
It is all settled beneath
the chitter chatter and the noise.

1166
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:30,000
Silence and sentiment.

1167
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,625
Emotion and fear.

1168
02:11:34,875 --> 02:11:40,417
The haggard, inconstant
flashes of beauty.

1169
02:11:41,167 --> 02:11:46,458
And then the wretched squalor
and miserable humanity.

1170
02:11:47,625 --> 02:11:52,208
All buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world.

1171
02:11:57,625 --> 02:12:01,292
Beyond there is what lies beyond.

1172
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:05,875
I don't deal
with what lies beyond.

1173
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Therefore...
let this novel begin.

1174
02:12:12,875 --> 02:12:16,875
After all... it's just a trick.

1175
02:12:17,875 --> 02:12:21,708
Yes, it's just a trick.
