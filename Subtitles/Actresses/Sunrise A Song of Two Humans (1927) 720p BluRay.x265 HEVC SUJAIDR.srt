Sunrise
A Song of Two Humans

2
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:50,235
This song of the Man and his Wife
is of no place and every place:

3
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:57,534
you might hear it anywhere at any time.

4
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,999
For wherever the sun rises
and sets in the city's turmoil or

5
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:11,089
under the open sky on the farm

6
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:20,307
life is much the same:
sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet

7
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:31,735
Summertime... vacation time

8
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,129
Among the vacationists was
a Woman of the City.

9
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,883
Several weeks had passed since her coming
and still she lingered.

10
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:19,434
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing..."

11
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,593
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing..."

12
00:09:54,928 --> 00:10:03,645
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city -
Money-lenders strip the farm - "

13
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:26,793
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city -
Money-lenders strip the farm -

14
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,796
and his wife sits alone."

15
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,290
"Tell me!
You are all mine?"

16
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,685
"Sell your farm...
come with me to the City."

17
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,320
"...and my wife?"

18
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,207
"Couldn't she get

19
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,795
"Couldn't she get drowned?

20
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:14,730
"...then overturn the boat...
it will look like an accident."

21
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:45,886
"Leave this behind...
come to the City!"

22
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,597
"COME TO THE CITY!"

23
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:37,372
"...after the boat has capsized,
save yourself with these bulrushes."

24
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,295
"The rushes will hold you up.

25
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:48,759
Scatter them before you reach the shore
and tell everyone she drowned by accident."

26
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,214
"We're going for a trip across the water.

27
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:46,051
I may not be back for quite a while."

28
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:40,473
"Don't be afraid of me!"

29
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,394
"Don't be afraid of me!"

30
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:30,646
"God is giving you,
in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.

31
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:33,566
She is young... and inexperienced.
Guide her and love her..."

32
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:40,072
"...keep and protect her from all harm."

33
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,804
"Wilt thou LOVE her?"

34
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:56,357
"Forgive me!"

35
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:29,952
"Manicure?"

36
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:08,198
"You'd look grand
with a high polish!"

37
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,961
"Come again!"

38
00:53:12,216 --> 00:53:17,179
"Thank you!
And you must come and see us some time."

39
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:34,632
"Congratulations! She is the sweetest bride
I've seen this year."

40
00:59:02,483 --> 00:59:03,734
"FARMERS!

41
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:06,654
If you want to sell your home
and move to the city--- We Pay Cash!"

42
01:01:03,608 --> 01:01:07,028
"Hit the hole...
make the little piggy roll!"

43
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:36,093
"We'll sail home by moonlight...
another honeymoon."

44
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:46,606
"...I couldn't give up hope.

45
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:50,777
I know the tides...
I went around the Point..."
