1
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,313
Boy, stop here.
Might as well get us a ball.

2
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,391
Julie will have plenty
to drink at the party.

3
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,915
Party liquor. Messed up
with cherries and such. Come on.

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,878
- Wait right here.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Cantrell, sir.

5
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,079
Man, you talk crazy.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,357
I say that horse is
out of the Truxton strain.

7
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,919
- Gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,753
- How are you, General Bogardus, sir?
- How are you, Buck? Ted?

9
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,512
- Going to the party?
- Yes, indeed.

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,954
- See you later then, sir.
- Yes.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,588
The Truxton strain's
the best horse blood in this state.

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,910
Here's somebody
that really knows bloodlines.

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,833
Hi, Buck Cantrell.
Come here and help us decide a bet.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,036
Got no time, Huger.
Ted and I were just shifting.

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,633
Won't take any time at all, Buck.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,234
You heard him, Huger.
Buck got no time.

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Gentlemen, Buck Cantrell got no time.

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,997
Five-to-four, he doesn't know the day.

19
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,357
I'll do better. Even money,
he doesn't know what month.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,799
Know what time of day it is, anyhow.
Must be getting on towards 3:00.

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,679
If it was any later,
De Lautruc would be a lot drunker.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,678
Is it not admirable Monsieur Cantrell
can joke so cleverly...

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,718
...when he has just lost
the lady of his heart?

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,793
- Better not, Rene.
- Yes, gentlemen.

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Monsieur Cantrell
has just lost his lady.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,352
I wouldn't go on, De Lautruc.

27
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,478
See, gentlemen,
Monsieur Cantrell is in bad humor...

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,189
...because Julie Marsden is marrying...
- De Lautruc.

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,476
I thought I heard you mention
a lady's name.

30
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,055
Must have misunderstood you, sir.

31
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,871
And if I did mention
the name of a lady?

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,112
Why, just that a gentleman doesn't
mention a lady's name in a barroom.

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,555
Are you trying
to teach me manners, my friend?

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,551
Wouldn't think of trying, De Lautruc.

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,792
But I somehow don't like your hat
or your ears or anything between them.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,477
- Plain enough?
- Amply, sir. Pierre?

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,392
I've the honor to ask you
to name a friend.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,754
- I'm acting as...
- Shoot, Ted.

39
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,638
You're too young
for this sort of thing.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,028
Gentlemen, a moment.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,668
Buck, I ought to get De Lautruc myself.

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,512
It's my brother that's gonna marry her.

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,910
That makes it much more
my quarrel than yours.

44
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,073
- Let me act for you, Buck.
- Well, if you feel that bad about it.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,111
I've the honor
to be acting for Mr. Cantrell.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,475
- Sunrise at the Oaks satisfactory?
- Perfectly, sir.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,551
Why do you wanna make it
so confounded early?

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,836
Make it 10:00. De Lautruc ain't wild.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,514
We don't have to sneak up
on him in the dark.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,954
Your servant, gentlemen.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,634
Come on, youngster.
We gotta get on to the party.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,435
Gentlemen, let's have another drink.

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,669
Buck, listen...

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,876
Here's something
I've been aiming to get all day.

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,508
- Must have trimmings for the party.
- Cantrell, one minute.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,636
- You riding along with us?
- I have my carriage.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,519
Cantrell, I don't like this.
Miss Julie's name was mentioned.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,148
As her guardian,
I don't like her mixed up in this.

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,471
Miss Julie's name was mentioned?
Why, sir, if it was, I never heard it.

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,949
It's just that I don't
like De Lautruc, is all. May I?

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,317
Cantrell, you're a fool. De Lautruc's
an old hand. Been out a dozen times.

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,550
Thirteen's liable to be
unlucky for De Lautruc.

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,678
You know these French. They shoot
for the head and like as not, miss.

64
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,035
I'm gonna shoot for the body
and bust his tripes.

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,395
General Bogardus, sir, your servant.

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,234
Mrs. Kendrick. Miss Kendrick, ma'am.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,749
- Keep in the shade, Albert.
- Yes, Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,229
I won't have the horses
standing in the sun, you hear?

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,913
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
- Stay in your seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,032
- Keep your hat and gloves on.
- Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,760
- And your coat buttoned.
- Yes, ma'am.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,477
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,997
- Mrs. Kendrick, ma'am.
- Good evening, Cato.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,149
Miss Kendrick.

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,118
- Honoria, how good of you to come.
- Sweet of you to ask us, Belle.

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,077
And, Stephanie,
how pretty you look, child.

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,639
Oh, thank you, Miss Massie.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,631
Stephanie, your manners.

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,031
- I do hope we aren't late, Belle.
- Late? Julie isn't here herself yet.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,316
- What?
- At her own party in her own house.

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,471
Really, I don't know
what to do with that girl.

83
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,551
Well, I always say,
"Better late than never."

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,994
Excuse me, please, Honoria.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,477
Mother, please don't fault me
like that before people.

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,993
Girls don't curtsey anymore.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,310
- I read it in <i>Godey's</i>.
- They do in New Orleans.

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,436
You've no call to take up
with Yankee manners.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
- How do you find yourself, Mrs. Petion?
- Honoria, Stephanie.

90
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,279
Belle just told me Julie is late
for her own party in her own house.

91
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,079
But I always say,
"Punctuality is the politeness of kings."

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,390
Politeness was never
one of Julie's virtues.

93
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,709
Ted, isn't it exciting?

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,235
I think your brother Pres
is the luckiest man.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,470
Providing he keeps
a short reign on her.

96
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,473
Oh, you're just trying to talk
like Buck Cantrell.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,756
I wish Julie would come.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,036
So does Aunt Belle.
She's having a fit.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,953
Tell me, wasn't Mr. Cantrell
just crushed?

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,078
Crushed? Buck Cantrell?

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,073
Hounds all over him. Tom with
his knife, high-tailing with a bear.

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,834
The only way you could tell
which was which, he had a hat on.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,592
Laugh, I thought I...

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,399
- Yes, Miss Belle?
- Theophilus, that child isn't here yet.

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,676
You're her guardian.
You'll have to speak to her.

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,637
You're her aunt, Miss Belle.
Why don't you?

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,519
- Girl never was on time in her life.
- It's outrageous of her.

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,511
Oh, time ain't so important, Miss Belle.

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,797
Seems like the longer I live,
the more there is of it.

110
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,952
And I don't know
what to say to people.

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,711
Evening, Miss Julie.

112
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,872
Thank you, Gros Bat.
Take him around, Ti Bat.

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,190
Now, Ti Bat, don't stand there
with your eyes bulging out like that.

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,591
- He knows you're scared.
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie, but he bite.

115
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,320
Well, then you just plain
bite him back.

116
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,476
- Good evening, Uncle Cato.
- Praise be, Miss Julie.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,030
- Miss Belle's been nigh on to a fit.
- I know, I'm late.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,668
Miss Julie, I done laid out
your party dress.

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,637
Thanks. No time.
Got to go in to my guests.

120
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,519
- Miss Julie, in them horse clothes?
- They won't mind.

121
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,793
Good evening, everybody.

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,635
Terribly sorry to be late.
I had trouble with the colt.

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,916
- Hello, dumpling.
- Julie, your riding habit.

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,275
No time to change, darling. Stephanie.

125
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,317
- I think it looks lovely.
- Thank you, honey.

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,118
- How are you, Ted?
- Fine as frog's hair.

127
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,191
Good evening. Good evening.
How do you do?

128
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,271
So sorry, but when a colt
gets high-headed...

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,998
...teach him his manners
or ruin him.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,596
- Yes, that's so important, isn't it?
- Hello, Molly. Excuse me, will you?

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,593
I declare. I hope I'm broad-minded,
but I must say...

132
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,797
I know what Stephanie would get
if she did such a thing, big as she is.

133
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,316
I always say, "Spare the rod
and you spoil the child."

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,233
It sounds so thrilling, darling,
living way up North in New York.

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,391
Julie, I wish you and Pres
all the happiness...

136
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,869
...the best of health...
- And the most of prosperity.

137
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,109
Sherry, ma'am?

138
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,158
You said the very same thing
the last time Pres and I were engaged.

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,880
We'll keep right on saying it
until you finally get married.

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,634
My dear, the toddies
are for the gentlemen.

141
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,358
- Whiskey, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, ma'am.

142
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,192
- The very best of Bourbon.
- That's fine.

143
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,715
To the very good health
of the future Mrs. Dillard.

144
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,154
Buck.

145
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,478
Aren't you gonna wish me
happiness too?

146
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,916
What's the use? You won't get it
marrying a trader and going up North.

147
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,470
Pres is a banker, not a trader.
I'll thank you to remember that.

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,312
I keep forgetting there's a difference.

149
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,119
But you won't like it in the North,
Miss Julie, tell you what.

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,514
- I'll be happy anywhere Pres is.
- You won't like it at the North.

151
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,470
You know those little old white beans?
Horse-feed beans?

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,437
You know what they
do with them in Boston?

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,593
They eat them. Ladies and gentlemen
eat them, what I hear.

154
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,992
- Buck, you're...
- My dear.

155
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,071
Isn't Preston Dillard
ever going to arrive?

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,549
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kendrick,
I tried to persuade him...

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,632
...but he found it important
to meet with the directors of his bank.

158
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,873
Of course.
"Business before pleasure," I always say.

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a toast.

160
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,552
To the firm of Dillard and Sons,
a venerable institution...

161
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,269
...a financial colossus
with branches in New York...

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,399
...Boston, London and Paris.

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,192
I guess the one railroad we got
is not enough, huh?

164
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,794
Let's see what it does
before we finance another.

165
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,951
It's losing money by the fistful,
that's what.

166
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,953
Steam cars. Ten million dollars
to mess with another railroad.

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,314
Who's gonna ride on them?

168
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,835
All joggled up with any kind
of rag-tagging bobtail?

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,797
What's a gentleman
keep a carriage for?

170
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,678
What if a gentleman
ain't got a carriage?

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,751
He can borrow one.
What's he got friends for?

172
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,148
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,390
We are here to listen
to Mr. Dillard's plans...

174
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,118
...to finance the Nashville Pacific.

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,316
Pacific, and build it east.

176
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,994
When they gonna ask you
to build a railroad to California?

177
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,469
Gentlemen, I'm a banker,
not a conjure man.

178
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,834
But I can tell you this:

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,833
New York and Boston are steadily
laying in rails to the Northwest.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,752
They're tapping
the trade of that country.

181
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,992
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati,
the whole Great Lakes country...

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,912
...beginning to ship east by rail.

183
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,152
- And New Orleans is missing the parade.
- The river's still there.

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,754
I reckon even those
Yankee sharpers aren't smart enough...

185
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,319
...to turn the Mississippi around.

186
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,074
Yankees sharpers are smart enough
to turn the traffic around.

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,514
The railroads are getting it.

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,558
Cussed, snorting, tin teakettles.
Scaring my horses.

189
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,713
Every time we get a colt, I look for him
to be foaled with a whale-oil headlight.

190
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,872
I do not think they're so healthy too.
All that smoke and...

191
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,998
Since when have you become so suddenly
concerned about what's healthy?

192
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,149
He's off again.

193
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,959
You're old enough to remember
the epidemic of '30.

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,998
- Or are you so old you've forgotten it?
- I knew it.

195
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,639
Quick as anybody said "health"...

196
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,190
...Doc Livingstone come surging out of
the cane-break, hollering, "Yellow jack."

197
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,510
And I'll keep on hollering
till you do something...

198
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,513
...about cleaning up this town,
getting the filth off the streets.

199
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,478
I've been trying to pound sense
into your knotheads for years.

200
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,757
Just the same as Pres is trying to do
right now, and with no better luck.

201
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,354
But I'm warning you,
and you, Jean La Cour...

202
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,159
...member of the City Counsel,
and all of you...

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,437
...if we get us another dose of
yellow fever like we had back in '30...

204
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,989
...when there wasn't enough men alive
to bury the dead...

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,879
...there just isn't going to be any town
to run a railroad into.

206
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,393
I'm telling you what's a fact.

207
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,551
Dr. Livingstone,
let us not confuse the issue.

208
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,757
We are here to discuss a railroad.
Mr. Dillard.

209
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,912
Gentlemen, I have here the figures
on the declining river freight.

210
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,629
These figures don't lie.
Last year, our riverboat...

211
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,916
- Yes?
- It's Miss Julie's boy, sir.

212
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,514
- He insists to see you, sir.
- What does he want?

213
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,116
He insists that Miss Julie told him
to see you personally, sir.

214
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,631
One moment, please, gentlemen.

215
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,714
The lady's waiting, sir.

216
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,075
- Is the party over?
- Yes, Mr. Pres.

217
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,878
Miss Julie tell me to ask you...

218
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,679
...would you most politely drop
what you're doing and come?

219
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,149
You tell her I'm in the middle
of something important.

220
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Directors' meeting. I can't leave now.
She'll understand.

221
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,918
Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.
She'll understand, all right.

222
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,833
But liking it is gonna be different.

223
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,875
And expecting a man
to go to a dressmaker's with you.

224
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,598
I declare, I hope Pres doesn't come.

225
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,995
- He will.
- But, Julie...

226
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,754
Now, don't fret about Pres.
I've been training him for years.

227
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,717
Not with that man-killing
horse you bought.

228
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,218
Pres was outrageous.

229
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,156
He'd no right to tell me
what I could ride and couldn't.

230
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,799
Horse showed you
what you couldn't.

231
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,951
You broke your collarbone
and your engagement.

232
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,032
And they both mended,
so I was right after all.

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,589
- Miss Julie, ma'am.
- Ti Bat, did you tell him to hurry?

234
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,320
Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie. I tell him.
But he ain't come.

235
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,516
That is, not just exactly.

236
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,672
That is, he say,
will you please go along?

237
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,150
In the middle of some directions.
Causes some problems.

238
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,878
He can't see you later.

239
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,833
Did Mr. Pres say that?

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,549
Yes, ma'am, those his very words.
He says you'll understand.

241
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,271
- Yes. Yes, I understand perfectly.
- Julie.

242
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,592
Julie, in a bank.

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,236
I'll get him, Miss Julie. I'll get him.

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,516
- Thank you.
- Just a moment.

245
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,069
I'm not putting the bank
in a $ 10 million proposition...

246
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,992
...without knowing
what I'm talking about.

247
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,879
I haven't spent six months getting
these figures for my album.

248
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,792
- Give me a little...
- Mr. Dillard, sir.

249
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,556
- Yes, what is it?
- It's Miss Julie, sir. She's waiting.

250
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,712
- I'm sorry.
- Certainly, my boy.

251
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,757
Everything waits
where beauty's concerned.

252
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,956
- You shouldn't...
- Are you coming or aren't you?

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,554
- Try to understand.
- I only understand that you promised.

254
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,234
- But this is important.
- I don't suppose it's important...

255
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,755
...that I spent a whole month
having my ball dress made.

256
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,592
You promised to come and see it fitted.

257
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,797
I don't suppose it's important to you
what I wear to the Olympus ball.

258
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,678
It's only you that's so important.

259
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,991
I suppose Mr. La Cour and the others
couldn't possibly get on without you.

260
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,354
They'd love to, permanently.

261
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,556
- Now, Julie, you've got good sense.
- Thank you.

262
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,359
I'm having the fight of my life in there.
I've gotta get back.

263
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,033
Just run along, I'll see you later.

264
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,055
Don't trouble.

265
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,510
I'm sure you'll be too exhausted
from your terrific struggle.

266
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,148
- Julie, you must realize...
- I realize only too well.

267
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,869
Good day, Mr. Dillard.
I'm so sorry to have troubled you.

268
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,636
To Madame Poulard's.

269
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,831
- Julie, it's perfectly lovely.
- I don't like the color.

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,592
And does it have to be so tight here?

271
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,116
- It binds. And the skirt...
- But it's adorable, Julie. It really is.

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,115
- Pres has always loved you in white.
- Yes.

273
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,475
If he isn't bowled over,
I won't know what to think.

274
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,837
Wait a minute.
Bring that over here.

275
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,871
- Saucy, isn't it?
- And vulgar.

276
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,792
Yes, isn't it?

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,472
- Come on. Get me out of this.
- Julie, what are you doing?

278
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,870
If it fits me, I'm gonna wear it
to the Olympus ball.

279
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,112
A red dress to the Olympus ball?
Why, you're out of your senses.

280
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,758
That creature, Julie.
You heard what Madame Poulard said.

281
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,230
- That infamous Vickers woman.
- Marie Vickers couldn't do it justice.

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,719
Child, you're out of your mind.

283
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,916
You know you can't wear red
to the Olympus ball.

284
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,672
Can't I? I'm going to.

285
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,153
This is 1852, dumpling.
1852, not the Dark Ages.

286
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,357
Girls don't have to simper around
in white because they're not married.

287
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,873
In New Orleans, they do.

288
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,110
Julie, you'd insult every woman
on the floor.

289
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,317
Mademoiselle, your aunt, she's right.
Look how beautiful this dress is.

290
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,038
Will you kindly get me out of this?

291
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,953
Julie, you can't be serious.

292
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,751
Never more serious in my life.

293
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,858
But, Julie, think of Pres.

294
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:30,597
That's just exactly
what I am thinking of.

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,197
Preston, I'm not convinced,
but I consider, I think.

296
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,999
- Gentlemen, <i>bon soir</i>.
- Evening, La Cour.

297
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,993
Well, cheer up, son.
You've got La Cour to thinking anyhow.

298
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,276
That, my boy, is as good
as starting a balky mule.

299
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,510
- It took your support, doctor.
- Nonsense.

300
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,910
I'd always be with Tom Dillard's son,
right or wrong.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,594
Best man I ever knew.
Don't breed men like that nowadays.

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,671
You measured right up to him
this afternoon.

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,558
I'm afraid not, doctor.

304
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,678
You been having you
some little fuss with Miss Julie?

305
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,917
- If you don't mind, sir.
- Certainly, my boy.

306
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,832
None of my business anyhow.

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,470
But speaking abstractly,
and nothing personal intended...

308
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,835
...your generation
don't understand the darlings.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,037
- Why, maybe not.
- Absolutely not, my boy.

310
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,474
Woman, sir, is a chalice...

311
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,996
...a frail, delicate chalice,
to be cherished and protected.

312
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,551
But nowadays, no proper respect
for our Southern womanhood.

313
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,356
Think your father would
have allowed his lady...

314
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,431
...to come surging
into his place of business?

315
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,079
What would he have done, sir?

316
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,595
He'd have cut him a hickory, sir.
A hickory.

317
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,955
He'd have flailed
the living daylights out of her...

318
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,476
...and then helped put lard on her welts
and bought her a diamond brooch.

319
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,950
That's what he'd have done, sir,
and she'd have loved it.

320
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,517
Good evening, my boy.

321
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,395
Thank you, doctor. Good evening, sir.

322
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,349
- Evening, Mr. Preston.
- Hello, Cato. Is Miss Julie about?

323
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,750
She's up to her room, sir.
I'll tell her you're here.

324
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,538
Just rest yourself in there
with the folks.

325
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,356
Thanks, Uncle Cato.

326
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,431
- Evening.
- Pres, I'm so glad you've come.

327
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,192
I thought you...

328
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,952
Julie said you'd quarreled again.

329
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,554
It's time we all stopped
hanging on every word she says.

330
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,597
Most times,
she only half means them.

331
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,990
I was telling your aunt
the same thing. That girl...

332
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,913
She just had a little fuss with Pres.
That's all, isn't it, Pres?

333
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,718
If you can call it a fuss, Miss Belle.

334
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,916
- You see, Theophilus?
- I'm going to speak out.

335
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,672
That girl is high-headed and willful.

336
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,991
Son, if you just come to realize it,
what she needs is a firm hand.

337
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,720
I appreciate your interest,
but I believe I can handle this.

338
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,670
Mr. Preston, Miss Julie say,
will you most politely excuse her?

339
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,869
- Is she ill?
- Why, no, Pres.

340
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,429
She's sound as a nut.

341
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,152
- Excuse me a moment.
- Take your own good time, my boy.

342
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,269
Now, Belle.

343
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,754
Julie?

344
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,069
Julie, it's Pres.

345
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,549
Open the door. I want to talk to you.

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,632
Julie, why don't you answer?

347
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,833
Look here, Julie, you and I
have got to straighten things out.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,831
There's no sense to all this.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,197
I'm here because I love you
and because I know you love me...

350
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,828
...but there are some things
we've got to see straight.

351
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,118
Julie, I couldn't leave the bank today,
you know that.

352
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,919
I was just as disappointed
as you were.

353
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,231
Now, please, Julie.
We've always had these silly quarrels.

354
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,197
Can't we stop?

355
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,555
Julie? Why don't you answer?

356
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,395
Darling, if you'll just open the door,
I'm sure I could...

357
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,358
Julie!

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,191
Open this door.

359
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,199
Julie!

360
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,432
Julie!

361
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,072
Who is it?

362
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,556
Open this door.

363
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,157
Why, Pres. Banging on a lady's door.

364
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,914
I'm scandalized at you.

365
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,358
Well, did you come up here
just to stand there?

366
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,416
Julie, how long must
we go on like this?

367
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,359
Like what, Pres?

368
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,594
Fighting, fussing all the time
like a couple of children.

369
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,075
Why do you treat me like a child?

370
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,991
Because you act like one.
A spoiled one.

371
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,675
You used to say
you liked me like that, once.

372
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,796
You never wanted me to change.

373
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,713
Remember?

374
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,758
Julie.

375
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,310
Why, Pres. In a lady's bedroom.

376
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,756
- Now you'll have to marry me.
- What do you figure I aim to do?

377
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,277
Then kiss me again.

378
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,312
- Would you like to see my new dress?
- That's what I wanted to do all day.

379
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,596
Well... Well, let me go, then.

380
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,239
There it is.

381
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,474
- For the Olympus ball?
- Isn't it lovely?

382
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,279
- Julie, it's red.
- It's gorgeously red.

383
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,000
- You can't wear red to the Olympus ball.
- Why not?

384
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,958
You never saw an unmarried girl
in anything but white.

385
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,758
And you're gonna see one
tomorrow night.

386
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,191
Julie, you can't be serious.

387
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,158
You afraid somebody will take me
for a girl from Gallatin Street?

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,912
- Julie!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

389
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,433
I forgot, I'm a child.

390
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,068
I'm not supposed to know about
things like Gallatin Street.

391
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,992
I'm supposed
to flutter around in white.

392
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,675
You're supposed to know better
than to scandalize the whole town.

393
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,470
It might be bad for the bank.

394
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,153
Of course.

395
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,949
Will you please hold another meeting
and ask them to decide what I can wear?

396
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,872
For heaven's sake,
will you be reasonable?

397
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,237
- Were you reasonable this afternoon?
- So that's it.

398
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
You're just nursing a spite.
Well, I'm not gonna let you.

399
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,588
You've made your point.
For once, you're gonna do as I say.

400
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,637
I'm calling for you
tomorrow night at 10...

401
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,109
...and you're gonna be dressed
properly in white.

402
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,713
Am I?

403
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,757
Oh, but, of course, Preston,
if you say so.

404
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,956
Don't be absurd.
Your own good sense will say so.

405
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,314
And if it doesn't?

406
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,837
Then, my sweet, you and I will sit
at home quietly with our embroidery.

407
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,389
Good night.

408
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,437
Tomorrow night at 10.

409
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,669
Oh, Preston, you forgot your stick.

410
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,871
So I did. I forgot to use it too.

411
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,712
So you did.

412
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,398
- Did you call me, Miss Julie?
- Yes, Zette. I've got an errand for you.

413
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,869
- I'd rather not trust the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,749
Miss Julie, this sure
is the most elegant dress.

415
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,990
You can have it after tomorrow.

416
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,277
- Me, Miss Julie?
- If you can keep a secret.

417
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,476
It's just like
you ain't never said nothing.

418
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,713
Zette, I want this delivered right away
to Mr. Buck Cantrell on Chartres Street.

419
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,519
And, Zette, remember,
not a word to anyone, understand?

420
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,318
I sure do understand, Miss Julie.

421
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,517
It's just like I was struck stone dumb
in both my ears.

422
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,113
Well, go on.

423
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,068
Zette. Zette, when Mr. Pres comes,
give him this.

424
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,794
Give him this, Miss Julie?

425
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,190
Just give it to him. He'll understand.

426
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,318
Yes, Miss Julie, ma'am.

427
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,679
- Good evening.
- Evening, Miss Julie.

428
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,688
You're late.

429
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:47,434
Sorry, I had a little business
to attend to.

430
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,591
Is it true about Mr. De Lautruc?

431
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,955
Don't you suppose
I know about the meeting?

432
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,759
- I don't know what you mean.
- Is it true you killed him?

433
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,353
Sure. I never did him that bad.

434
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,715
Dr. Livingstone,
he had him an elegant name for it:

435
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,359
A fractured...

436
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,398
Well, anyway, it just looked
like a busted hip to me.

437
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,199
My zing, Miss Julie,
you all dressed up for a hog killing?

438
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,559
I hoped you'd like it.

439
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,558
Well, makes me feel kind of all-overish.

440
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,995
Well, your note said 10:00,
side entrance, Miss Julie.

441
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,354
What you up to?

442
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,750
Buck, you're taking me
to the Olympus ball.

443
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,795
- You do me a great honor.
- Then we'd better hurry.

444
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,712
Just a minute.
You had a set-to with Pres?

445
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,917
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- We'd better. Pres isn't gonna like it.

446
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,389
What's the matter, Buck?
Afraid Pres will call you out?

447
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,471
He'd do that.
Can't say I'd blame him much.

448
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,312
Where do I stand, carrying his lady?

449
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,278
- If I ask you to, isn't that enough?
- Not this time, Miss Julie.

450
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,908
I think too much of you
to help do something you'll regret.

451
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,038
- I know exactly what I'm doing.
- Most likely you do, but you're wrong.

452
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,872
That dress can cause
no end of trouble.

453
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,031
Folks will resent you
coming to the ball in it.

454
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,475
Well, let them. They're just petty
and narrow-minded.

455
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,076
No, ma'am, it's just that they got rules
and they go by them. Same as you and I.

456
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,279
- And do you prefer to go by your rules?
- I always have, Miss Julie.

457
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,835
Then I'm sorry I troubled you.

458
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,116
- Good night, Mr. Cantrell.
- Good night, Miss Julie.

459
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,591
- Good evening, Uncle Cato.
- Evening, Mr. Pres.

460
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,911
- Evening, Pres.
- Evening. Julie dressed?

461
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,799
Zette, tell Miss Julie Mr. Pres is here.
We're ready to go.

462
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,917
Well, don't stand there like a bump
on a log. Go along and tell her.

463
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,118
Yes, Miss Belle, ma'am.

464
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,232
Zette.

465
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,117
Good evening.

466
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,158
Well, shall we go, Pres?

467
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,556
Not till you're properly dressed.

468
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,399
You're sure it's the dress?
It couldn't be that you're afraid?

469
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,752
Afraid somebody will insult me and
you'll find it necessary to defend me?

470
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,918
May I?

471
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,877
- Ready, Aunt Belle?
- Pres, please...

472
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,393
We're ready, my boy.

473
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,632
...that dress.

474
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,989
Hello, Molly.
Mrs. Kendrick. Hello, Dick.

475
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,832
- Miss Julie.
- Evening, Julie.

476
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,718
Stephanie, we must pay our respects
to Mrs. Zemal. You'll excuse us, please.

477
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,114
Gentlemen, you all have the privilege
of Miss Marsden's acquaintance, I think.

478
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,350
- Gentlemen.
- Good evening, Miss Marsden.

479
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,918
- Respects, ma'am.
- Good evening, Buck.

480
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,790
We were just fixing
to pour us a little libation.

481
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,279
That's right.

482
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,477
- Shall we see you later?
- Excuse me.

483
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,918
Oh, there's my partner now.

484
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,550
Excuse me, please.

485
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,795
You haven't a partner
you have to meet, Cantrell.

486
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,634
Why, no. Came alone.

487
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,916
A pleasant evening, isn't it?

488
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,197
Mighty pleasant.

489
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,592
Nice and cool.

490
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,149
Do you find it cool in here?

491
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,160
I don't find it particularly cool.

492
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,915
- Do you, Julie?
- Why... Why, no.

493
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,355
I don't find it particularly cool.

494
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,556
Miss Julie doesn't find it so.

495
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,312
Why, no.

496
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,393
Now you speak of it,
it's just about right.

497
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,196
It seems so to me.

498
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,672
Your servant.

499
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,989
Yours, Miss Julie.

500
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,231
Pres, I wanna leave.

501
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,998
Why? We haven't danced yet.

502
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,469
- Shall we?
- No.

503
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,799
Pres, let me go.

504
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,599
Take me out of here.

505
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,356
Go on and play.

506
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,190
Go on and play.

507
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,195
Pres, let me go.
Please take me out of here.

508
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,358
Good night, Aunt Belle.

509
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,312
Goodbye, Julie.

510
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,230
Is that all you've got to say to me?

511
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,356
There's nothing more to say.

512
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,837
Evidently you've made up your mind.

513
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,549
No, Julie. You've made up my mind.

514
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,231
Goodbye, Pres.

515
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,518
Goodbye, Julie.

516
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,355
Julie, don't let him go. Call him back.

517
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,756
Julie, you're a fool.

518
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,951
Not such a fool.

519
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,993
- He'll come back.
- He won't.

520
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,879
Not this time, he won't. Believe me.

521
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,276
Julie, honey, let me send for him.

522
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,592
No, he'll come back. Wait and see.

523
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,870
Yet tonight, I think.

524
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,429
If he does, say I've retired.

525
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,040
And that I'm sleeping late
in the morning.

526
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,398
Not to come around
till afternoon tomorrow.

527
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,872
Tell him to...

528
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,400
Huger's got himself a brand-new reason
for getting liquored.

529
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,516
Straight bourbon and lots of it.
That's a fact.

530
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,035
Ever hear of a man
and his liquor getting yellow fever?

531
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,273
I aim to carry all I can hold, and I
advise you gentlemen to do likewise.

532
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,830
Huger aims not to be carried off
by anything but drink.

533
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,156
It's no joking matter.
Looks mighty serious.

534
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,673
More cases than you hear about.

535
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,798
Doctors call it by another name,
any name but yellow fever.

536
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,396
Every time I see old dead wagon,
I pour me four fingers of bourbon.

537
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,312
Yesterday, I drunk
nigh on to two quarts.

538
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,675
Ain't any more yellow fever
than this time last year.

539
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,751
You never hear of fever talk
in racing season.

540
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,638
Folks got something better
to talk about.

541
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,835
- Hello.
- Hello, Dillard.

542
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,989
How you, Ted?

543
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,594
- Something working on your mind.
- Pres is coming back.

544
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,034
Why, now, folks generally do.

545
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,589
- When did you hear this?
- Just now, from Dr. Livingstone.

546
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,354
He's bringing something rare
and precious from the North.

547
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,830
- What could it be, I wonder?
- A stem-winding watch, maybe.

548
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,593
And give yourselves a breathing spell
up there on the plantation.

549
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,672
Only a matter of a few weeks, I say,
until the scare blows over.

550
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,877
You'll be back in time
for the Mardi Gras and Olympus ball.

551
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,317
Is there really cause for alarm?

552
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,870
Well, I wouldn't go so far as that, but
the city's not going to be so pleasant.

553
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,874
No parties. Theater's liable to be closed
as a precautionary measure.

554
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,553
The theater.

555
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,517
I haven't been since...

556
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,478
- When was the last time, Aunt Belle?
- <i>Camille</i>.

557
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,552
I hated it. I wouldn't mind
if I never saw another play.

558
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,751
I strongly urge you go.

559
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,639
Who knows? Maybe we are in
for another time like '30.

560
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,994
Heaven forbid.

561
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,357
Dr. Livingstone's only looking after
our best interests, I'm sure, my dear.

562
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,839
I am indeed.

563
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,197
May I send instructions
to have the house made ready?

564
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,598
I'll try to persuade her,
Dr. Livingstone.

565
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,717
Julie don't look
as well as I've seen her.

566
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,110
It's all I can do to get her
to step from this house.

567
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,033
Won't go outside except to ride
that crazy thoroughbred of hers.

568
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,270
I'm in fear and trembling
she'll break her neck.

569
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,238
Won't go anyplace where there's
company. Won't have company in.

570
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,551
Young Mr. Cantrell and the others,
she hasn't received them in months.

571
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,314
They've stopped calling.
Only leave cards.

572
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,072
What does she do all day long?

573
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,959
Tends the house as no house
has ever been tended.

574
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,157
She's so particular, if an article
is half an inch out of place...

575
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,039
...or if there's a speck of dust
on anything, she notices it.

576
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,270
Makes me uneasy.

577
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,000
You might be interested
in a bit of news I got today.

578
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,995
Preston Dillard's coming back.

579
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,472
Arrives Friday on the packet.

580
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,154
- What brings him?
- This yellow-fever business.

581
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,709
We two stand together
on what ought to be done about it.

582
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,836
Now it's busted loose,
he's coming back.

583
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,676
It's high time.

584
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,750
I suspect I know Julie
like nobody ever will...

585
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,399
...every crook and cranny of her.

586
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,358
You ought to, Miss Belle.
She's more like you than you ever were.

587
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,753
Maybe I love her most
when she's her meanest...

588
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,196
...because I know
that's when she's loving most.

589
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,036
I'll let you know about the plantation
just as soon as I can.

590
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,395
Do that, Miss Belle,
if you please, ma'am.

591
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,471
Don't bother, Miss Belle.

592
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,516
- Goodbye, Cato.
- Evening, Dr. Livingstone, sir.

593
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,155
I do believe Dr. Livingstone
takes pleasure in frightening people.

594
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,153
- Particularly women.
- You don't remember the last outbreak.

595
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,151
It was dreadful.

596
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,151
I guess it's pretty serious.

597
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,392
Pres Dillard's coming home
on account of it.

598
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,070
Pres is coming home.

599
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,112
Of course.

600
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,237
Did you know it?

601
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,471
Certainly, I knew it.

602
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,559
I knew all along.

603
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,232
He had to come back to me.

604
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,516
He couldn't help himself.

605
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,958
He wouldn't know
how to fight as hard as I have...

606
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,595
...to keep from going to him.

607
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,794
We'll be married.

608
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,509
I'm gonna beg his forgiveness.

609
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,118
I was vicious, mean and selfish.

610
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,594
And I'm gonna tell him I hated myself
for being like I was, even then.

611
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,276
<i>I'll humble myself before him</i>.

612
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,036
And everything that ever stood
between us will be gone...

613
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,915
...when he takes me in his arms.

614
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,992
Darling.

615
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,480
Perhaps we'd better go
to the plantation.

616
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,915
Of course, that's the place
for our meeting.

617
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,229
We'd better start packing.

618
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,797
Uncle Cato. Zette.

619
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,834
We'll give a party, dumpling.
We'll invite everybody.

620
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,911
A party to celebrate.

621
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,640
Uncle Cato, get the trunks
out of the attic.

622
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,756
And, Zette, lay out my dresses.

623
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,956
And have Gros Bat
polish up the big carriage.

624
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,473
Have Mammy Teel pack a basket.

625
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,108
And get the furniture covers out,
we're closing the house.

626
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,432
What are you standing there for?
Get a move on. We're going to Halcyon.

627
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,153
- You guess that's plenty, Uncle Cato?
- I guess so, Miss Julie.

628
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,437
If all that mint sticks in the juleps,
it's bound to be a powerful night.

629
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,955
Now, don't you forget a hard frost
on the glasses.

630
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,635
Miss Julie, when I ever serve
a gentleman a julep without the frost?

631
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,678
Mr. Pres sure gonna know
he's back home, all right.

632
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,836
You finish it, will you?

633
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,639
Zette, run a damp cloth over my mirror
and lay out my dress.

634
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,872
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.

635
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,114
- Zette.
- Yes?

636
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,794
- Is Gros Bat on the lookout?
- Yes, Miss Julie.

637
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,197
You're gonna wear those flowers out
with fixing and fussing.

638
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,920
Everything's got to be right, dumpling.
Just right.

639
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,513
Well, I guess everything is.

640
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,399
And you most of anything, honey.

641
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,151
- Excited?
- Feel my heart jumping?

642
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,835
Well, I guess I better go and dress.

643
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,478
Zette. Zette, help me out of this.

644
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,393
Did you hear a carriage?

645
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,915
Go on, Zette, see. Hurry.

646
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,152
Do you see any carriages just yet?

647
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,358
- No carriage coming yet.
- Nope, no carriages coming yet.

648
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,634
- Yes?
- No carriages yet.

649
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,593
Well, then hook me up, Zette.

650
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,069
Why you ain't never wear
this dress before, Miss Julie?

651
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,958
It's the most prettiest dress you own.

652
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,236
- I've been saving it for today.
- Yeah.

653
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,472
I don't never have no hopes
of falling heir to this dress, I don't.

654
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,358
No, not this one, Zette.

655
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,509
Carriages coming!

656
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,910
- Where?
- Carriages coming, down yonder.

657
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,116
- Carriages coming!
- Carriages coming!

658
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,510
- Carriages coming!
- Zette.

659
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,955
- Man on horseback too.
- Zette, yes.

660
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,036
- Carriages coming.
- Carriages coming.

661
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,156
- Carriages coming.
- Carriages coming.

662
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,554
Carriages coming.

663
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,631
Carriages coming.

664
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,470
- Glad to see you.
- I'm so glad to see you.

665
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,111
Mr. Buck and Mr. Dick
are on horseback.

666
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,589
- Keep an eye out for Mr. Pres.
- Yes, ma'am.

667
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,239
- Buck, I'm glad to see you.
- Hello.

668
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,914
Will you all go in
and just sort of carry on, right?

669
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,832
Go on and make yourselves at home.

670
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,274
Dick, I'm so glad.

671
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,876
Before it was a pleasure to be here,
but this time it's a blessing.

672
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,674
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure glad
to see you all back again.

673
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,751
I guess there's no use
my telling you folks...

674
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,433
...how glad we are to have you here.

675
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,876
Miss Belle, I reckon none of us ever
could forget the hospitality of Halcyon.

676
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,439
Now, you stay out of my kitchen.

677
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,034
I haven't forgotten the time
you ate my party pompano.

678
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,270
Sure. Miss Julie and me,
we'd been bird hunting.

679
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,795
We were hungry,
and there was an elegant pompano.

680
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,996
Well, you were both of you
mighty reprehensible.

681
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,879
- Have you heard from Preston?
- No, but I had a note from Ted.

682
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,190
He said Pres would arrive
on the packet about noon.

683
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,112
He'd be responsible
for bringing him over.

684
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,554
They ought to be here by now.

685
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,553
Have to wait for the sheriff
to pass them through the parish line.

686
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,709
Pass them through?

687
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,440
Armed guards are patrolling the road
as far up as Riverview.

688
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,272
Stopping everybody
coming from the city.

689
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,431
It's mighty bad in the city,
mighty bad.

690
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,797
- We're all very fortunate to be up here.
- Are any gentlefolk taken down?

691
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,757
Major Crandall's dead with it, for one.

692
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,275
Ned Warrington's got it.
No telling how many others.

693
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,590
Where there's sickness
they're keeping it a secret.

694
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,557
There's talk of shipping
those who have it...

695
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:28,355
...to Lazarette Island
where the lepers are.

696
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,038
"Lazarette Island
where the lepers are"?

697
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:31,557
Like in '30.

698
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,078
Why, it ain't civilized to condemn
Christian people to Lazarette Island.

699
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,912
Well, they won't have a chance at all.

700
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,709
No chance at all, Miss Belle.
But maybe the rest of us will.

701
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,518
Theophilus, we are safe up here?

702
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,069
This parish always has been
above the fever line.

703
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,356
They aim to keep it that way.

704
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,711
Excuse me for keeping you all standing.

705
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,393
Come on in and freshen up a bit.

706
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,916
- Carriage coming!
- That must be Pres and Ted now.

707
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,832
Carriage coming!

708
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,197
- Pres, my dear boy.
- Aunt Belle.

709
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,238
And Ted.

710
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,515
Aunt Belle, everybody,
this is Amy, my wife.

711
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,232
Pres, your wife?

712
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,391
You could have knocked me
over with a feather.

713
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,994
Hey, Buck, there's your stem-winder.

714
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,198
Oh, my dear...

715
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,558
Pres' wife would
naturally be welcome here...

716
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,632
...but you are for your own sake.
- Thank you.

717
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,795
Pres' brother has been so gracious
in his welcome.

718
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,110
I hoped that the others he loves
would be the same.

719
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,794
Of course we will, my dear.

720
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,559
May I present our friends.

721
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,910
- May I present General Bogardus?
- How do you do?

722
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,308
- Mr. Cantrell.
- How do you do?

723
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,232
- Mr. Allen.
- How do you do?

724
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,630
My dear, will you come with me?

725
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,152
Howdy, ma'am.

726
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,193
Mighty nice to have you back
with us again, Pres.

727
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,325
See that the gentlemen get their juleps.

728
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:07,158
Yes, Miss Belle.

729
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,959
- Cato. I'm glad to see you again.
- Praise be, Master Pres.

730
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,473
Sure glad to see you back home.

731
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,993
- How are you?
- Fine and dandy.

732
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,752
My dear. Excuse us, please.

733
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,433
- You got some mint juleps?
- Yes, sir.

734
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,352
You just follow me now,
and I'll show you.

735
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,193
It's kind of you to have us. Tell you
the truth, I'd have come anyhow.

736
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,555
- I hope so.
- I've got to go back tomorrow.

737
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,994
Back to the city? But, Pres...

738
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,152
Things are at sixes and sevens.
The fever's left us short-handed.

739
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,232
But I want to ask if Amy may stay.
I want her out of the city.

740
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,756
- But perhaps it isn't convenient.
- My dear, Halcyon belongs to its guests.

741
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,150
And Pres' wife is, of course,
an honored one.

742
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,072
Come, my dear.

743
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,714
Is this your first visit south?

744
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,308
Yes, it's beautiful.
Strange and beautiful.

745
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,913
- A little frightening.
- Frightening?

746
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,310
Because of its strangeness
and beauty, I suppose.

747
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,516
This way, my dear.

748
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,155
- You haven't forgotten how.
- Me, sir?

749
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,709
The head might forget,
but the hand remembers.

750
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,713
Anyhow, Miss Julie, she's right in
behind me all day to fix them...

751
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,518
...just the way you used to like them.

752
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,392
Uncle Cato, how is Miss Julie?

753
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,439
- Miss Julie? Why, she's just Miss Julie.
- Just the same?

754
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,991
I reckon princesses, they just naturally
grows up to be queens, that's all.

755
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,874
Uncle Cato, we've known
each other a long time.

756
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,759
I'm back now. Home.

757
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,350
It's a special occasion.
Will you join me in one?

758
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,753
Why... Why, Mr. Pres,
it ain't hardly proper.

759
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,755
But I'll kindly take
one out in the pantry...

760
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,270
...and bless you and Miss Julie.

761
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,878
Pres.

762
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,437
Are you remembering the time
you wanted me to wear white?

763
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,678
Are you?

764
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,434
Well, until now, I never have.

765
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,273
Cat got your tongue, Pres?

766
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,312
Julie...

767
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,230
You said that plain enough.

768
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,990
Pres, what fools we were.

769
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,518
Julie, you're lovely.
Lovelier than ever.

770
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,598
Pres, I can't believe it's you here.

771
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,751
I dreamed about it so long. A lifetime.

772
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,553
No.

773
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,756
Longer than that.

774
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,758
I put on this white dress for you...

775
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,033
...to help me tell you how humbly
I ask you to forgive me.

776
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,550
Pres, I'm kneeling to you.

777
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,474
Julie, don't.

778
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,879
To ask you to forgive me
and love me...

779
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,437
...as I love you.
- Julie, please.

780
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,393
Julie...

781
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,111
...this is Amy, my wife.

782
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,553
Your wife?

783
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,915
And you're... May I say "Julie"?

784
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,872
Pres' wife?

785
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,989
- You're funning.
- Hardly.

786
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,993
Married.

787
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,514
My felicitations, Pres.

788
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,150
Julie? Julie?

789
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,759
Yes, Aunt Belle, in here.

790
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,837
I was just congratulating Pres
on his marriage.

791
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,515
- You from the North, Mrs. Dillard?
- New York.

792
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,757
She was a Miss Bradford.
Isn't that what you told me, my dear?

793
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,114
Yes.

794
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,872
Bradford.

795
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,237
Amy Bradford...

796
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,232
...from New York.

797
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,712
I'm very happy to welcome you
to Halcyon.

798
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,032
Thank you.

799
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,392
You have such charming customs here.

800
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,120
You may find our customs,
as you call them...

801
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,952
...different from those
of your country.

802
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,159
I did want to meet you.
Pres had told me so much about you.

803
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,231
Everything, I suppose.

804
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,112
Are you very surprised
about our getting...?

805
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,236
We Louisianans are very impulsive.

806
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,311
I wouldn't be surprised
at whatever Pres did.

807
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,552
- Julie, the others will be coming down.
- Oh, yes, Aunt Belle, of course.

808
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,472
Would you excuse us a moment?

809
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,638
Julie...

810
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,958
Julie, child, I'm so sorry.

811
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,759
For heaven's sakes,
don't be gentle with me now.

812
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,229
Do you think I wanna be wept over?

813
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,198
I've gotta think, to plan, to fight.

814
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,828
- But you can't fight marriage.
- Marriage, is it?

815
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,949
To that washed-out little Yankee?

816
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,795
Pres is mine. He's always been mine.
And if I can't have him...

817
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,309
- Why, Buck.
- Miss Julie.

818
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,516
You don't know
how glad I am to see you.

819
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,638
And I am most pointedly delighted
to see you, Miss Julie.

820
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,473
Most pointedly delighted.

821
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,957
William Lloyd Garrison is a fanatic.
Wendell Phillips is another.

822
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,758
They've made a mighty
touchy situation.

823
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,115
But I can't believe
the intelligent men up North...

824
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,919
...plot to destroy our sovereign rights.
- You sound calm now.

825
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,595
You were raring to go when you joined up
with Andrew Jackson to fight the British.

826
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,876
I was a lot younger then,
and a lot foolisher.

827
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,349
What Buck's been saying
doesn't sound so foolish to me.

828
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,398
Most of it makes sense.
And I'll take the rest on faith.

829
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,279
Why, that's the first time
you ever said I talked sense.

830
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,159
Well, you don't much.

831
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,959
But it's refreshing to see a man
who knows his own mind.

832
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,314
Don't you think so, Pres?

833
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,516
It's hard to know your mind sometimes.

834
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,274
If only we could put away
this stale old quarrel.

835
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,989
Exactly. I always say,
"Let sleeping dogs lie."

836
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,754
Trouble is, those abolitionists
don't act like sleeping dogs.

837
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,638
They're scratching their fleas all over.

838
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,473
Looks to me like we'll have
to hang a few to get us any peace.

839
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,995
This William Lloyd Garrison
would look elegant that way.

840
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,072
I'm afraid your problems wouldn't
be solved by hanging Mr. Garrison.

841
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,389
Why, there's plenty more.

842
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,028
I named Garrison because
he's a traitor by his own say-so.

843
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,556
And there's such meanness in a traitor.
Don't you think so, Pres?

844
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,631
Julie spoke to you, Pres.

845
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,109
- Excuse me.
- Oh, just small talk. Don't trouble.

846
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,635
I'm sorry. It's... Tonight I'm haunted.

847
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,476
- Haunted?
- Only by memories, Uncle Cato.

848
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,995
It's just coming back here.
All my childhood summers.

849
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,388
There's so much to remember.

850
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,233
Remembering?
A forward-looking young banker?

851
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,879
Even a banker has memories.

852
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,679
Well, he ought to kill them, then,
or laugh at them.

853
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,638
I interrupted you. You were
about to hang somebody for a traitor.

854
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,472
Why, for an abolitionist, Miss Julie.

855
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,872
I think it was Voltaire who said,
"I disagree with everything you say...

856
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,435
...and I will defend to the death
your right to say it."

857
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,803
Pres, that don't make sense.

858
00:55:46,904 --> 00:55:48,910
Maybe Pres got a little beyond us, Buck.

859
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,590
We ignorant Southerners simply expect
a gentleman to go by his raising.

860
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,273
I think we're all agreed on that.

861
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,317
Here's how I see it. Cotton is king.

862
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,277
Folks are bound to ship cotton
down river.

863
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,021
So how can New Orleans keep from
being the greatest city in America,...

864
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:02,149
...fever or no fever?

865
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,550
I'm afraid there's more than
fever the matter.

866
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,790
Being up North changed
your point of view.

867
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,669
I hate to say this, but in a war
of commerce, the North must win.

868
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,990
That's a curious thing
for a Southerner to say.

869
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,593
It strikes me that way.

870
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,320
But maybe Pres
has learned why. Up North.

871
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,270
If you must have it, it will be a victory
of machines over unskilled slave labor.

872
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,477
- Preston!
- I don't know that I like that, Dillard.

873
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,337
You're not expected to like it.

874
00:56:27,338 --> 00:56:29,235
You'll like it a lot less
when it happens.

875
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,630
And you talk mighty
like a black abolitionist.

876
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,708
I think you know I'm no abolitionist.
I believe the tide has turned against us.

877
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,111
But I'll swim against that tide
just as far as you will, Cantrell.

878
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,157
Sure, we're all of one mind here.

879
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,390
We hate an abolitionist
as we hate the devil.

880
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,279
Naturally, we claim the right
to the customs we were born to.

881
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,079
Even some of us who question
the value of those customs.

882
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,516
I like my convictions undiluted,
same as I do my bourbon.

883
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,636
Frankly, I'm not impressed
by Pres' nightmares.

884
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,995
I've had dreams myself,
but they never come to much.

885
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,357
They slip away from you, and you
wonder how you could've been so silly.

886
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,839
Sure is a fact, Miss Julie.

887
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,398
- There was one very curious one I had.
- I'd certainly admire to hear it.

888
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,313
Oh, heavens, I wouldn't think
of boring our guests.

889
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,232
Shall we go into
the drawing room, ladies?

890
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,358
- It wouldn't bore me, Miss Julie.
- Perhaps to you later.

891
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,272
To you alone.

892
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,676
We'll be in the drawing room.
You can find us.

893
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,512
You can lay 10-1 on me,
Miss Julie.

894
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,193
Gentlemen.

895
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,672
Stephanie,
what you giggling about now?

896
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,239
Oh, nothing, Mother.

897
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,192
- Your health, sir?
- Thank you.

898
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,839
Mighty good to have you back, Pres.

899
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,309
Times are so unsettled
we need our good men about us.

900
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,516
Looks like it.
If the Yankees don't let us be...

901
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,193
...we'll have to teach them manners.

902
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,828
I'm afraid facts are against
you doing it as easy as that.

903
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,389
Your facts are to scare women
and sell Northern bonds.

904
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,152
- Cantrell.
- I don't like to hear that.

905
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,676
One fact you can't deny: That we're
the guests of a charming hostess.

906
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,755
Sorry, general.
Most likely I misunderstood you, sir.

907
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,514
I don't think you misunderstood, sir.
I expressed an opinion.

908
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,069
There was nothing personal about it.
Take it as you like.

909
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,038
Why, if it wasn't personal,
I'm satisfied.

910
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:06,437
Just understand, Cantrell...

911
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,990
...the question of being satisfied about
my opinions is of no importance to me.

912
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,354
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

913
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,988
Don't look like we're in the mood
for political discussion.

914
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,993
- Come. Shall we go in to the ladies?
- I'm with you there, general.

915
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,549
Shucks, Buck, we're all friends here.
Old friends.

916
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,109
Naturally, we are. Come along.

917
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,190
Buck seems dead set
to pick a quarrel with you.

918
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,952
That's nothing new for Buck.

919
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,271
And Julie, she's set herself up
to fascinate Buck...

920
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,158
...like a Gallatin Street girl.

921
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,518
Great ladies and Gallatin Street girls,
my dear brother, have a lot in common.

922
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,439
Look here, has Julie been...?

923
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,117
The less you crack your teeth,
the longer you'll have them, youngster.

924
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,669
Ted, Pres, Julie wants you both
right away.

925
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,150
- Miss Massie is gonna play for us.
- Thanks, Stephanie.

926
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,710
- Coming, Pres?
- Yes, of course.

927
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,278
- Uncle Cato.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Pres?

928
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,432
How's Miss Julie been?
Has she seen lots of people? I mean...

929
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,591
No, sir, she ain't.
She ain't seen nobody much.

930
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,274
Just stay in the house
or ride the horse.

931
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,753
Mr. Pres, your lady take tea
or coffee in the morning?

932
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,195
I hear folks
eats mighty curious up North.

933
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,234
Coffee.

934
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,676
Uncle Cato, has Mr. Cantrell
been up here? I mean, before today?

935
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,400
No, sir, he ain't. No company at all.

936
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,160
- Thanks, Uncle Cato.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Pres.

937
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,799
Pres, why did you do it?

938
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,632
Why, Pres?

939
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,037
Because I love her.

940
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,229
- But you had my love.
- And lost it.

941
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,434
Wasn't that memory more real
than anything she had to give to you?

942
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,433
Oh, don't be cross with me, Pres.
Just tell me.

943
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,394
- You must.
- Please don't, Julie.

944
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,396
Shall I cry for you?

945
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,154
Nobody ever made me cry but you...

946
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,835
...and that was only twice.

947
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,710
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

948
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,115
How much do you remember?

949
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,919
Everything you ever said or did.

950
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,311
But that's passed now, Julie.
Done, finished.

951
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,235
I ought to have come to you.
I wanted to so terribly.

952
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,233
It was because I wanted to so much
that I couldn't.

953
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,911
You do understand that,
don't you, Pres?

954
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,593
I didn't understand.
I just knew what you did.

955
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,751
But you had to come home,
didn't you?

956
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,559
You had to come back to the country
and the things you know...

957
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,073
...because you belong here.

958
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,231
Nothing can change that.

959
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,598
Pres, listen.

960
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,353
Can you hear them?

961
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,476
The night noises?

962
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,148
The mockingbird in the magnolia?

963
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,198
See the moss hanging
from the moonlight?

964
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,513
You can fairly taste
the night, can't you?

965
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,631
You're part of it, Pres.

966
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,956
And it's part of you...

967
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,277
...like I am.

968
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,238
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

969
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,949
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

970
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,112
Your country, Pres.
Amy wouldn't understand.

971
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,748
- She'd think there'd be snakes.
- Julie, please.

972
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,157
Oh, it isn't tame
and easy like the North.

973
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,595
It's quick and dangerous,
but you trust it.

974
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,070
Remember how the fever mist
smells in the bottoms, rank and rotten?

975
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,118
But you trust that too
because it's part of you...

976
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,398
...just as I'm part of you,
and we'll never let you go.

977
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,994
Pres, you're afraid.

978
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,913
Miss Julie, I thought we'd lost you.

979
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,594
That's a right nice little Yankee.
Pretty as a red wagon.

980
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,034
But trying to talk to her...

981
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,509
- That must've been something.
- I tried her on horses.

982
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,797
She told me about a policeman's horse
she'd feed sugar to back North.

983
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,997
I tried her on hound dogs. She thinks
a Walker Hound is one that walks.

984
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,311
My zing, don't they educate women
up North? She's just plain ignorant.

985
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,391
Northern girls are just
educated differently.

986
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,596
- She probably knows calculus.
- Sure, Miss Julie.

987
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,398
Any flower wench knows calculus.

988
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,235
By Calculation, out of Siderial Maid.
Won the Ranger Stakes in '47.

989
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,709
What's the matter?
Do you ache anywhere?

990
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,189
- Oh, it's nothing.
- It is.

991
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,909
Look here, Miss Julie, you were out here
a mighty long time with Pres Dillard.

992
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,479
Oh, please, Buck.

993
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,676
Pres had just been
punishing the brandy and...

994
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,114
My back teeth.

995
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,999
Did he lose his capacity to drink
like a gentleman in the North?

996
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,197
What does he think a lady's house is?
A riverboat bar? What did he do?

997
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,319
Buck, I wouldn't have some silly thing
I said be the cause of anything.

998
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,638
Miss Julie, you won't be
the cause of anything.

999
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,950
Depend on me.

1000
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,397
Thank you, Buck.

1001
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,637
Oh, that's the cannon
from New Orleans.

1002
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,712
- You can hear it when the wind's right.
- There it goes again.

1003
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,992
- Wind has shifted to the south.
- I can't bear loud and sudden noises.

1004
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,720
Even firecrackers give me palpitations.

1005
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,553
- What is it?
- It's the fever cannon down in the city.

1006
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,709
- Fever cannon?
- Yes.

1007
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,269
At night they set tar barrels
blazing on every corner.

1008
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,398
And the Washington artillery
fire a cannon to fight the plague.

1009
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,754
What good does that do?

1010
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,708
Everybody knows it starts
air currents to carry the fever away.

1011
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,749
They might better drain the swamps
and clean up the city.

1012
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,310
- Is that what they do in Yankee land?
- They do.

1013
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,755
And other customs up North
that will bear copying.

1014
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,036
Eating horse-feed beans, maybe?

1015
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,758
Everyone to his own taste.

1016
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,554
I'll have to remind you, sir,...

1017
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,909
...that my wife is a
Northerner and a stranger here.

1018
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,072
- You talk like you're the same.
- See here, Buck!

1019
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,949
I'm sorry, but this subject
is an unwelcome one.

1020
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,113
Excuse me, but as mistress of the house,
you'll agree with me, I'm sure.

1021
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,795
Why, Aunt Belle, I wouldn't think
of forbidding any subject to my guests.

1022
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,956
Mr. Pres, sir? Here come
a white gentleman looking for you.

1023
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,429
- Hello, Jenkins. What is it?
- Dr. Livingstone sent me.

1024
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,559
Mr. La Cour's down bad with the fever.
Doctor says you better come right down.

1025
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,551
Of course. Send a boy for my carriage.

1026
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,632
You told him he could go visiting
with his folks down the Riverview.

1027
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,552
- Well, Bat will drive you.
- Yes, hurry up.

1028
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,914
Sir, Mr. La Cour is bad.

1029
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,719
He wants to talk
some bank business to you before...

1030
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,279
Well, before it gets too late.

1031
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,637
- Was I you, I'd ride. Be quicker.
- All right.

1032
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,355
You'll stop at Halcyon tonight, Jenkins.
Make the journey back at your pleasure.

1033
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,637
Gracious of you, Mistress Massie,
but I must return at once.

1034
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,119
Then you'll need a fresh mount.

1035
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,236
There's Bayou Belle and Donna Cona
in the stables.

1036
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,311
Bat will go with you
to bring the horses back.

1037
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,993
- Go along and saddle them.
- Yes.

1038
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,354
Thank you, Aunt Belle.

1039
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,511
- I ought to go with you.
- No, won't take long.

1040
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,954
You come down in the carriage.

1041
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,473
- Ted, get me a coat.
- Right away.

1042
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,834
I'm gonna put on some boots.

1043
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,468
You take care of her.
I'll be right back.

1044
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,472
Would you care to freshen up,
Mr. Jenkins?

1045
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,159
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Would you mind?

1046
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,673
Gladly.

1047
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,478
Why, Erroneous.

1048
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,193
What are you two doing here?

1049
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,555
Zette done say for us
to make inquirements...

1050
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,439
...when we all is to sing
with you and Master Pres.

1051
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,950
Just another old custom, Mrs. Dillard.
Tell Zette they can come up any time.

1052
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,190
- Yes, ma'am.
- What time, Miss Julie?

1053
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,557
Ain't you hear?
She done say, "Any time."

1054
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,836
- That don't mean nothing.
- It sure do.

1055
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,070
Of course it does, Errata.
Just you tell her.

1056
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,958
- Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.
- It do.

1057
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,718
It don't.

1058
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,800
Hope you'll all forgive me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Kendrick. Goodbye.

1059
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,996
We understand perfectly, Pres.

1060
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,351
- Now, darling, don't fret about me.
- I'll try not to.

1061
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,070
- You'll look after Amy, won't you, Ted?
- You needn't have asked.

1062
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,358
- Goodbye. Goodbye, everybody.
- Goodbye, Preston.

1063
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,191
- Goodbye, Pres.
- Goodbye, Julie.

1064
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,715
- I do hope everything will be all right.
- It always is.

1065
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,836
Of course, it's a pity Pres
had to leave now.

1066
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,230
But I suppose his bank comes first.

1067
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,197
You don't find that admirable?

1068
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,793
Oh, admirable, I suppose.

1069
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,633
It just seems to me
there are other things more interesting.

1070
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,119
I imagine Buck finds it so.

1071
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,350
Why, I never go into
a bank if I can help it.

1072
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,398
Seems like they're studying how
to get something away from somebody.

1073
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,879
I wouldn't say that, Buck.

1074
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,634
What Mr. Cantrell means
is that most folks down here...

1075
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,518
...prefer other pursuits, like planting.

1076
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,796
You needn't apologize for Mr. Cantrell.

1077
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,349
I'm sure he's capable of defending
his own insinuations.

1078
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,990
Why, Mistress Dillard, ma'am,
I surely didn't mean to offend.

1079
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,675
Of course, Amy.
Buck didn't realize what he was saying.

1080
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,911
He doesn't even realize
how Julie's using him.

1081
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,433
- Ted.
- How you mean that, son?

1082
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,429
I don't get the sense of it,
but it don't sound polite.

1083
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,669
You know what I mean.

1084
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,559
Julie's been egging you on,
first against Pres and now his wife.

1085
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,233
- Ted, be quiet!
- I meant what I said.

1086
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,799
Let's figure I didn't hear, then.

1087
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,874
And I'd keep Miss Julie's name
out of your conversation.

1088
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,600
You're fool enough to defend
what you don't even understand?

1089
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,990
Buck, don't you pay
any attention to him.

1090
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,630
I don't see anybody
that needs any defense.

1091
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,360
If I did, I'd make out
to defend them, yes.

1092
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,798
- Let's put it this way, Mr. Cantrell.
- Now, Ted.

1093
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,396
All evening long, I thought you coarse
and loud and not a gentleman.

1094
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,233
That's better. No need for that.

1095
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,072
Very well, Mr. Dillard, sir.

1096
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,071
I'd be glad of your kindness, Dick.

1097
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,673
Happy to do you the honor.

1098
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,558
You young jackass.

1099
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,837
- Buck, you surely don't mean to...
- Miss Belle, don't mean nothing at all.

1100
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,433
Just talking.

1101
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,190
What does he mean to do, Aunt Belle?

1102
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,879
Buck.

1103
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,995
- Of course you're joking?
- Joking, ma'am?

1104
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,395
Buck, I forbid you.
As a guest in my house.

1105
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,755
Forbid me what, ma'am?

1106
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,152
- To do what you're planning.
- I don't know what you mean, Miss Julie.

1107
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,719
Oh, stop play-acting.

1108
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,836
Your stupid code. It's for fools.

1109
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,639
You, too, beginning to think
our customs are old-fashioned?

1110
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,509
Oh, Buck, I beg you.
This mustn't happen.

1111
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,276
I don't understand.

1112
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,279
I guess there's a lot
I don't understand.

1113
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,515
Naturally, you'll apologize to Buck.

1114
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,035
General Bogardus,
may I put myself in your hands?

1115
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,395
You'll be good enough
to make the arrangements.

1116
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,994
Ted, listen to me.
You can't do this. You must've...

1117
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,916
Uncle Thee, you won't let this go
any further, will you?

1118
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,036
Mighty little I can do about it now.

1119
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,034
- Naturally, I'll do everything I can.
- Whatever it is, you must do it.

1120
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,271
Isn't this what you wanted, Julie?

1121
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,670
Or did your plans go astray?

1122
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,712
We women can start the men quarreling
often enough.

1123
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,956
We can't ever stop them.

1124
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,634
Come on.
"Let's Raise a Ruckus Tonight."

1125
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,828
- Julie.
- Come on, sing, Aunt Belle.

1126
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,353
Have the little Yankee join in.

1127
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,548
We have such charming customs
down here.

1128
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,957
That's why I wore
my white dress tonight.

1129
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,633
I'm being baptized.

1130
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,156
You'd no business to take him up, a
youngster that's never been out before.

1131
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,880
Why, if he's gonna talk man-size,
he's gotta act man-size.

1132
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,871
- But, Buck...
- Why, Dick, he's lucky.

1133
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,794
All I aim to do is clip a wing.
Fix him so he won't fly too high.

1134
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,632
Mighty nervous feeling
the first time you face shot.

1135
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,270
Wish I could tell him,
but that would be highly irregular.

1136
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,438
Anyhow, it might hurt his feelings.

1137
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,918
Don't be a fool, Ted. Buck has offered
twice to accept an apology.

1138
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,071
He doesn't want to fight you.

1139
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,232
You realize what you're up against?

1140
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,756
I've had the benefit of Buck Cantrell's
skill and experience.

1141
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,349
I'll make the best use of it I can.

1142
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,752
Gentlemen, take your places.

1143
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,878
Remember, gentlemen,
you turn and fire at the count of 10.

1144
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,429
- Very good, sir.
- Places.

1145
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,596
- Are you ready?
- At your service, sir.

1146
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,432
Ready, sir.

1147
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,434
Gentlemen. One, two, three, four...

1148
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:10,073
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

1149
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,239
Are you savages, you Southerners?

1150
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,037
I'll fix him so he don't garter
around me no more.

1151
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,758
Good morning.

1152
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,716
What brought you all out so early?

1153
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:44,432
It's a grand morning,
I couldn't resist it.

1154
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,432
Where are the gentlemen?

1155
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,269
- You know very well where they are.
- Oh, yes, at a meeting.

1156
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,796
A silly custom, but a part of what
we Southerners call our chivalry.

1157
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,757
You know, sometimes I envy them.

1158
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,215
To face the one you hate,...

1159
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:00,311
...to kill or be killed,
to settle something.

1160
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,876
We can't do that. We're women.
Oh, Zette, aren't they beautiful?

1161
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,032
Yes, ma'am, Miss Julie.
Right nice and pretty.

1162
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,277
Right nice and pretty.

1163
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,590
Pretty enough for Ted's grave.

1164
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,678
Ted.

1165
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,829
Buck's dead.

1166
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,348
I never saw a man die before.

1167
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,715
He knew what you had done.

1168
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,796
Before he died, he told me so.

1169
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,718
- Miss Amy, we're leaving, get ready.
- Thank you, general.

1170
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,838
Miss Molly, you'll ride back with us.
Dick will follow.

1171
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,352
I quite understand, Uncle Thee.

1172
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,471
My respects, ma'am.

1173
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,115
I'll arrange to turn my guardianship
over to the bank.

1174
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,470
- Julie, I...
- Stephanie.

1175
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,198
All right, Zette.

1176
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,357
Well, say it.
What are you thinking?

1177
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,231
I'm thinking of a woman
called Jezebel...

1178
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,829
...who did evil in the sight of God.

1179
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,792
He's to bury.

1180
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,957
- More killing.
- Sorry, gentlemen, a case of "had to."

1181
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,109
- A fugitive?
- No.

1182
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,511
Just a poor fool who was crazy enough
to think he could run the fever line.

1183
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,999
- Has it spread this far?
- Sure.

1184
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,754
Spreading like wildfire
all along the river, yellow jack is.

1185
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,832
We got orders to shoot whoever tries
to pass the parish boundaries...

1186
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,989
...coming or going.

1187
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,276
You mean no one can get
downriver to New Orleans?

1188
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,112
That's the law, gentlemen.

1189
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,552
Mind if we leave the body here
till we can get a wagon?

1190
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,029
I'm sorry, ladies.
You heard what the sheriff said.

1191
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,719
Uncle Cato,
bring the baggage back in.

1192
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
my home is yours, as always.

1193
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,430
That's today's crop for Lazarette Island.

1194
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,994
Excuse me.

1195
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,310
- Good evening, doctor.
- Good evening.

1196
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,708
- Bourbon.
- Certainly, doctor.

1197
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,632
Make mine double.

1198
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,475
Well, they might as well now.
Good a time as any.

1199
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,777
Ain't that kind of unusual for you,
son?

1200
01:21:30,778 --> 01:21:32,515
Are you telling me what I can drink?

1201
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,278
Why, Pres...

1202
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,479
Lord.

1203
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,035
Dr. Livingstone,
I don't know why I said that.

1204
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,839
- Don't you feel right, son?
- Kind of edgy, maybe.

1205
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,036
It's been a tough day.
I caught chill walking up.

1206
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,031
Chill? You better be easing down.

1207
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,998
With La Cour gone, we want you
to clear up that mess in the bank.

1208
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,469
It couldn't be.
I saw him myself day before yesterday.

1209
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,631
Well, I saw him an hour ago.

1210
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,995
You think I don't know
a dead man when I see one...

1211
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,513
...and him laying in his coffin?

1212
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,910
- His folks brought the body down.
- What happened now?

1213
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,275
Huger here claims
Buck Cantrell is dead.

1214
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,714
- What? Buck, dead?
- Fever?

1215
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,074
Sure, Huger, you're crazy.

1216
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,231
I'll give 20-1
Buck Cantrell is to bury.

1217
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,874
I'll give 10-to-1
Ted Dillard shot him in a duel.

1218
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,632
Ten-to-one?

1219
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,916
Ted Dillard follows him
around like a hound dog.

1220
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,753
Ted Dillard? And Buck? The best
pistol shot in Louisiana?

1221
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,148
Come on.

1222
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,630
- Twenty-to-one. Any takers?
- Yes.

1223
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,711
I believe I heard you make
a private matter...

1224
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,917
...that concerns my family
the subject of a bet.

1225
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,799
- Why, Dillard. I'm mighty sorry.
- It's not a thing to bet on.

1226
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,752
No, I reckon you're right.

1227
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,480
Only there's been so many
dead folks lately, that...

1228
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,158
- Dillard.
- Why?

1229
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,472
- Yellow jack!
- We must get out of here!

1230
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,312
- Yellow jack!
- Yellow jack!

1231
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,358
Get out of here!

1232
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,152
One of you lend a hand here.

1233
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,156
Ain't the one of you got enough whiskey
in him to give you a little courage?

1234
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,389
You're gonna let him lie here,
you drunken blackguards?

1235
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,432
If one of you don't help me, everyone
of you whose face I remember...

1236
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,831
...I'll call out, if you live through
this epidemic, to be challenged.

1237
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,038
You, Laurette.

1238
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,509
Taylor, Van Noy, come on! Come on!

1239
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,513
- Some rice, Dick?
- No, thank you.

1240
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,952
- More gumbo, Uncle Thee?
- Thank you.

1241
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,956
Serve the wine, Uncle Cato.

1242
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,229
Miss Julie, please, ma'am.
Bat, he just come.

1243
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,393
Say Dr. Livingstone sent him back.
Mr. Pres, he got the fever bad.

1244
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,432
- The fever?
- Pres? It can't be.

1245
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,113
Yes, ma'am. He take him to your house
because hotel folks won't take him in.

1246
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,114
He say y'all get there quick, before
they hustle him off to that leper place.

1247
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,919
Leper place? What does he mean?

1248
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,598
Lazarette Island,
where they ship the fever victims.

1249
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,155
- Get our carriage.
- But, Ted, you can't get through.

1250
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,551
Cato, have a couple of horses saddled.
Ted, come with me. You all stay here.

1251
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,359
Miss Amy, I'll get a pass
from the governor, short of killing.

1252
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,637
You and Miss Amy be dressed and ready.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

1253
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,712
- Bat?
- Yes, Miss Julie.

1254
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,233
Go on and eat. Go on.

1255
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,073
How come they let you through
the fever line? Sit down and eat.

1256
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,017
They never. I just
kind of oozed through.

1257
01:25:34,018 --> 01:25:34,719
How?

1258
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,438
Well, when the white gentlemen
stop me...

1259
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,751
...I leave the horse and go walking
across the back of the parish...

1260
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,831
...because I'm bound
to get back to Halcyon.

1261
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,195
I just kind of squinched
through the cane by the bayou.

1262
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,635
- You swam the bayou?
- No, ma'am, Miss Julie.

1263
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,313
I scared of them gators.

1264
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,232
I just kind of found me
a double-end boat.

1265
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,073
It ain't like I stealing, Miss Julie.
I fixing to take it back.

1266
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,879
You are. You're going back right now.
And I'm going with you.

1267
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,076
Get me a cloak.
I'll meet you at the smokehouse.

1268
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,559
- Miss Julie...
- Go on. Hurry!

1269
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,472
Miss Julie, ma'am!

1270
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,191
It's too risky
for a white lady, Miss Julie.

1271
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,352
I kind of mix in with the night.
But them sheriff folks ain't fooling.

1272
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,039
They're shooting first
and asking after.

1273
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,159
Bat, we're going!

1274
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,878
But, Miss Julie...

1275
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,912
Get me a coat.

1276
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,313
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1277
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,151
- Miss Julie!
- Doctor, is Pres still here?

1278
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,276
- Why, yes, ma'am.
- Thank heaven.

1279
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,558
Gros Bat, all right, go around
to the quarters, and thank you.

1280
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,472
- How is he?
- As well as can be expected.

1281
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,596
He's up in your room.
I had to bring him here.

1282
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,228
- No hotel would take him.
- Naturally. His place is here.

1283
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,992
Miss Julie!

1284
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,709
I don't think
you ought to go up there.

1285
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:04,514
Yes... Blood... Blood...

1286
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,874
That's what is...

1287
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,317
You oughtn't
to be in here, Miss Julie.

1288
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,835
Yellow jack's mighty catching.

1289
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,319
Pres.

1290
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,995
It's my head.

1291
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,909
Just keep on applying
the cold compresses.

1292
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,116
That's all we can do.

1293
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,400
- Get some ice.
- Yes, ma'am.

1294
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,198
Be quick.

1295
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,948
It's a part of a...

1296
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,676
Remember... White...

1297
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,349
Why, Miss Belle.

1298
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,112
- How'd you get through?
- We got a pass.

1299
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,269
- Pres is here?
- Yes.

1300
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,429
How is he?

1301
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,828
- Are you Mrs. Dillard?
- Yes.

1302
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,831
Well, he's no better
and he's no worse.

1303
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,197
- Please take me to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

1304
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,153
Pres, dear.

1305
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,355
Please, doctor, you must tell me.

1306
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,638
Then it's true.
They're gonna take him away?

1307
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,478
It was the only thing
I could decently do.

1308
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,912
- I'll be to kill first.
- There's been enough of killing, son.

1309
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,072
Pres is a fever patient.
I had to report him so.

1310
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,674
You reported him?

1311
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,274
Have you any idea what would happen
in New Orleans now...

1312
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,379
...if folks got to thinking
there's one law for the rich...

1313
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,319
...and another for the poor?

1314
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,596
Mistress Dillard,
I put Pres on his first horse.

1315
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,995
I caught his daddy
out of the saddle when he died...

1316
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,116
...at Buena Vista ahead of his men.

1317
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,999
Pres is beyond talking,
but I know him and I know his breeding.

1318
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,639
I know what he'd say.

1319
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,756
He's a man of honor.

1320
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,950
And I've got to get on down
to the wharf.

1321
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,030
Miss Julie,
you're looking mighty worn-out.

1322
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,589
You'd better get yourself some sleep.

1323
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,640
Otherwise, we'll be sending you
off to the island too.

1324
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,478
Doctor?

1325
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,758
Doctor?

1326
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,429
When they come for Pres,
I'm going with him.

1327
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,829
Mistress Dillard...

1328
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,434
You must arrange it
so that I can go with my husband.

1329
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,477
- But it's unthinkable.
- Will you arrange it?

1330
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,517
You must, doctor.

1331
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,792
You're asking a mighty terrible thing.

1332
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,269
Oh, doctor, will you?
I know what I'm asking.

1333
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,998
Will you?

1334
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,312
Yes, if you want it.

1335
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,118
Thank you.

1336
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,119
Amy.

1337
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,874
Of course, it's your right to go.
You're his wife.

1338
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,674
But are you fit to go?

1339
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,193
Loving him isn't enough.

1340
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,874
If you gave him all your strength,
would it be enough?

1341
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,235
- I'll make him live, or die with him.
- Amy.

1342
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,430
Amy, do you know the Creole word
for fever powder?

1343
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,794
For food and water?

1344
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,996
How to talk to a sullen,
overworked black boy...

1345
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,991
...and make him fear you
and help you?

1346
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,418
Pres' life and yours will hang
on things just like that,...

1347
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:08,676
...and you'll both surely die.

1348
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,274
Then it'll have to be that way.

1349
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,419
It's not a question of proving
your love by laying down your life.

1350
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,399
Nothing so easy.

1351
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,312
Have you the knowledge
and the strength...

1352
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,517
...to fight for his life and for your own
as one will have to fight?

1353
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,269
Amy, it's no longer you or me.

1354
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,272
- What do you mean?
- I'll make him live. I will.

1355
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,192
Whatever you might do,
I can do more...

1356
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,920
...because I know how to fight
better than you.

1357
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,394
Amy, if you knew
the horror of that place.

1358
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,757
It isn't a hospital.
It's a desolate island haunted by death.

1359
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,229
They'll put Pres in an open shed
with a hundred others.

1360
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,517
You must be there with him day and
night, watching every breath he draws.

1361
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,272
You must bathe him, keep him clean...

1362
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,510
...give him drugs,
fight for his food and water.

1363
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,716
You must keep the living from him,
and the dead.

1364
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,474
Be there by him,
with your body between him and death.

1365
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,153
Amy, I...

1366
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,673
Where is he?

1367
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,839
Upstairs. End of the hall.

1368
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,710
- I'm not afraid.
- No, you're not afraid.

1369
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,791
You're the bravest woman I ever saw.

1370
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,599
I even believe
you have the courage to save him...

1371
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,672
...by giving me the right
to go in your place.

1372
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,193
You're not afraid to die.

1373
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:54,831
I boldly ask a greater sacrifice
in Pres' name, his life.

1374
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:56,912
And for yourself?

1375
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,995
I'm asking for the chance to prove I
can be brave and strong and unselfish.

1376
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,593
Help me, Amy.

1377
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,877
Help me make myself clean again,
as you are clean.

1378
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,632
Let me prove myself worthy
of the love I bear him.

1379
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,273
Julie, tell me, something
that only you can tell me...

1380
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,830
...does Pres still love you?

1381
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,997
He himself might not know,
but you would.

1382
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,750
- Amy, you must let me go with him.
- Tell me.

1383
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,514
What does it matter who he loves?
It's his life that matters.

1384
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,272
Tell me.

1385
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,231
We both know.

1386
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,271
Pres loves his wife.

1387
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,712
Who else would he love?

1388
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,717
Not me, surely.

1389
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,830
I've done too much against him.

1390
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,837
You see, I never knew
how to be gentle and brave as you are.

1391
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,271
Had there been any love
in his heart for me...

1392
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,317
...I'd have taken him from you.

1393
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,791
I tried and failed...

1394
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,156
...because he loves only you.

1395
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,349
I'm grateful to you for telling me,
but I had to know.

1396
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,989
Amy.

1397
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,990
God protect you and Pres.
