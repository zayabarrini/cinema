[door closes]

2
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,123
How was my speech?

3
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,423
You were brilliant.

4
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,171
-[Anne] Did I lisp?
- You don't lisp.

5
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,844
I know.
That was what was so troubling about it.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,012
- The thought that I suddenly did.
- No.

7
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,257
Sarah, you must say hello
to the little ones.

8
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,592
No. It is macabre.

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,344
[Anne] Please.

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,724
[Sarah] No.

11
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,601
I love you, but that I will not do.

12
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,353
-[Anne] If you love me...
- Love has limits.

13
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,730
It should not.

14
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,394
[keys jingling]

00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,274
[lock turning]

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,427
You do not lisp, but you are mad.

17
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,802
Giving me a palace?

18
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,386
I've been wanting to give you something
for quite some time now.

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,142
Seemed like the perfect opportunity
with Marlborough winning.

20
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,475
It is a monstrous extravagance,
Mrs. Morley. We are at war.

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,730
We won.

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,857
It is not over. We must continue.

23
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,938
Oh.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,815
Oh, I did not know that.

25
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,610

00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,791
[woman] Take a hunk of bread.

30
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,389
And then Sally will take you to clean up
and then to Her Ladyship.

31
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,361
[woman] This mud stinks.

32
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,658
[Sally] They shit in the streets
round here.

33
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,907
â€œPolitical commentary," they call it.

34
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,363
Go through here.

35
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,368
Clean yourself up.

36
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,533
Thank you so much.

37
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,799
-[billiards balls clacking]
-[indistinct chatter]

38
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,169
Lady Marlborough.

39
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,802
I didn't know the new sewer ended in here.

40
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,842
It is I, Abigail.

41
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,931
Dear cousin.

42
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,350
I have a letter from our aunt...

43
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,348
and...

44
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,436
I'm sorry,
I did not mean to present as a...

45
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,151
I fell out of a carriage.

46
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,325
[shrieks]

47
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,695
And a man was pulling his...

48
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,117
Never mind the man.

49
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,835
The letter from our aunt.

50
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,421
[flies buzzing]

51
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:00,915
Friends of yours?

52
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,042
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,464
Your name, girl. If we are blood, name it.

54
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,545
I did not?

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,506
- Abigail Hill.
-[Sarah] The Somerset Hills?

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,763
The one who went mad and burnt
his own house down, himself in it?

57
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,685
Lost all his money at whist.

58
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,308
No one bets on whist.

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,888
My uncle was one of a kind.

60
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,690
[Abigail] I apologize for my appearance.

61
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,020
The staff led me here.
A harmless prank of some sort, I suspect.

62
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,228
[Sarah] And you want...

63
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,025
I hoped I might be employed here by you...
as something.

64
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,526
A monster for the children
to play with, perhaps?

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,953
Yes, if you like.

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,076

73
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,637
[music fades]

74
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,634
A palace.

75
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,683
You seem angry at my good fortune
and I thought we were friends.

76
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,555
I really doubt you've made that mistake.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,853
I was actually just teasing.
I thought you'd see that.

78
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,556
It will not stand.

79
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,901
Well, it will if I build it
using the finest craftsmen in the land.

80
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,570
I hope it will stand for 100 years

81
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,613
as a symbol
of my husband's gallant victory.

82
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,858
Listen, I applaud
your husband's gallant victory,

83
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,943
but considering the parlous state
of the treasury,

84
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,951
it seems something the queen should've
taken advice from her loyal opposition on.

85
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,658
Oh, but then it would've lost
its delightful surprise element.

86
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,245
Cunt!

87
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,077
[man] Horatio has done it again.

88
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,539
Prime Minister, we need to discuss
who will go to the French

89
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,421
-with the peace treaty proposal.
- We do not need a peace treaty proposal.

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,671
We have them on the run.

91
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,002
So they will give in to us.

92
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,586
One battle will not win the war.

93
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,093
I have held my party together,
as we the country landowners

94
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,970
have essentially paid
for this entire war--

95
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,222
And grateful we are, too.

96
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,519
...while city merchants
enrich themselves from it.

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,816
And yet I do not see your fat tweedy dead
when I look out upon the battlefield.

98
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,233
We're out of money. My point.

99
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,778
The French are chastened,
but not defeated, Harley.

100
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,275
We must destroy them.

101
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,358
Make them sue for peace
with broken hearts and begging backs.

102
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,364
- How sweet your wife is, Marlborough.
- Sweet and right.

103
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,492
I cannot agree.
We must take it to the queen.

104
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,074
If you'd be kind enough
to arrange a time, Lady Marlborough.

105
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:40,999
[Sarah] Of course.

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,878
[snoring]

107
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,005
[woman coughs]

108
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,450
[exclaims]

109
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,512
I'm ready for the Russian ambassador.

110
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,889
Who did your makeup?

111
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,842
We went for something dramatic.
Do you like it?

112
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,976
You look like a badger.

113
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,679
Oh.

114
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,728
[Sarah] Are you going to cry? Really?

115
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,278
Well, what do you think you look like?

116
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,900
A badger.

117
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,239
Do you really think you can meet
the Russian delegation looking like that?

118
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,415
No.

119
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,041
I will manage it.

120
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,247
Get back to your rooms.

121
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,246
Thank you.

122
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,557
Did you just look at me? Did you?

123
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,476
Look at me! Look at me!

124
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,554
How dare you? Close your eyes!

125
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,863
[Sally] Hello.

126
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,284
Hello.

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,707
Mrs. Meg says you are to scrub the floor

128
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,127
until she can see
her toothless, fat face in it.

129
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,662
Sorry.

130
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,944
[gasps]

131
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,655
You might need gloves.

132
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,655
Lye is dangerous. It burns bad.

133
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,658
[exclaims]

134
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,289

00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,793
[moaning painfully]

136
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,963
[Anne] Sarah!

137
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,265
I'm here.

138
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,479
You! Grab the bandage box off the shelf.

139
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,807
The queen's had an attack of gout. Hurry!

140
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,753
[Cries]

141
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,251
[Sarah] Mrs. Meg, brandy.

142
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,669
[Anne] It hurts.

143
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,925
[Sarah] My dearest, I know.

144
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,057
[moans]

145
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,977
Cousin, the beef.

146
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,523
[Sarah] Tell me a story.

147
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,937
I can't.

148
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,026
Ow!

149
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,102
[Sarah] Gently.

150
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,530
-[Anne] I can't.
-[Sarah] Yes, you can.

151
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,782
Cousin, start wrapping.

152
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,652
Everyone else, leave please.

153
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,205
[whimpering]

154
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,158
[Sarah] How we first met. Tell me that.

155
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:59,132
The wretched Cheever boy
had me on the ground

156
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,007
and he was holding me
and dropping spittle in my face.

157
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,552
[Sarah] He is still a pig. Then what?

158
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,262
[Anne sniffling]

159
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,678
[Anne] And then I heard footsteps.

160
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,688
Fast footsteps.

161
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,561
<i>Ow, ow!</i>

162
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,816
[birds chirping]

163
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,945
And I saw these pink shoes
running towards me.

164
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,077
And then they disappeared.

165
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,834
And then I heard a crack.

166
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,671
And then he fell off me.

167
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,596
[Anne moans]

168
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,221
And you held my hand and said,
â€œHello. I'm Sarah.

169
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,643
You're covered in spittle.
Let's wash you off."

170
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,724
[Anne screams]

171
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,856
[Sarah] Do you remember
how his jaw just hung there?

172
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,482
[Anne laughs] l do.

173
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,657
-[Sarah] You must try to sleep.
-[Anne moans]

174
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,120
[Sarah] You may go.

175
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,077
-[Anne] Don't leave me!
-[Sarah] I won't.

176
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,546
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

177
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,015
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

178
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,630
[muffled chatter]

179
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,188
[Abigail] For the queen.
The doctor's ordered it immediately.

180
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,890
It's a matter of extreme urgency.

181
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,065
She's sleeping.

182
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,354
Shall I tell the doctor
you imperiled the queen's health

183
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,234
and let you rue the ramifications?

184
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,741
What does "ramific..."

185
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,869
It means he will have you whipped.

186
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,281
[door opens]

187
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,525
What are you doing?

188
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,243
[Abigail] This is peleatis, the herb.

189
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,196
I out some this morning.

190
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,249
It reduces swelling and inflammation.
I thought it may help the queen.

191
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,791
You cannot just walk in here.

192
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,253
Why did the footman let you through?

193
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,668
It's not his fault. I lied to him.

194
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,295
[footman] The prime minister
and Mr. Marlborough.

195
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,003
L just wanted to help her.
She seemed to suffer so much.

196
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,220
Footman.

197
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,800
Take her downstairs.

198
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,138
Tell Mrs. Meg she is to receive
six of the birch. Go.

199
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,395
It's peleatis, the herb.

200
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,937
Anne, you must focus.

201
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,905
[Marlborough] We gather our forces here.
The Austrians mass here.

202
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,327
[Anne] Which country is that again?

203
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,996
[Sarah] Listen. Marlborough.

204
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,864
[Marlborough] This is the town of Lille,

205
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,327
in a valley in France.

206
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,831
We lure them in by sending a small force
to engage them.

207
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,085
They give chase.

208
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,508
We descend in numbers from above.

209
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,178
-[all] Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear! It is an excellent plan.

210
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,595
Queen Anne, do you agree?

211
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,177
The people expect it to be over.

212
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,886
Well, we all want it to be over,
but wishing does not make it so.

213
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,139
We could sue for peace,
but we will not get it.

214
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,141
It does help.

215
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,815
What?

216
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,149
There's something soothing on my legs,
it takes the burn out. What is it?

217
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,199
Oh, herbs, of some sort.

218
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,661
[Abigail] Please, please.

219
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,706
What is going on?

220
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,380
Do her in the barn, if that's what it is,
not in my kitchen.

221
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,799
Her Ladyship says six of the birch
for this one.

222
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,092
[Abigail whimpers]

223
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,599
[screams]

224
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,022
[Cries]

225
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,808
[Sarah] Stop.

226
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,768
Let her go.

227
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,523
Come with me.

228
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,606
[Abigail panting]

229
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,324
So, you are perhaps too kind
for your own good.

230
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,827
It has been said.

231
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,870
Which leads to stupidity.

232
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,746
The queen is soothed somewhat,
so I thank you.

233
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,124
You will get me some more of those herbs

234
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,091
and not overstep again.

235
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,383
My father always spoke highly of you.

236
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,174
I liked your father.

237
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,180
He had charm to burn.

238
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,470
Then I guess he did.

239
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,849
You have fallen far.

240
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,320
When I was 15,
my father lost me in a card game.

241
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,481
You are not serious.

242
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,817
This one here.

243
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,119
[Abigail] He was very upset about it.

244
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,033
Took off into the forest

245
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,242
with nothing but a scullery maid
and a dozen bottles for solace.

246
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,416
[Sarah] And you went?

247
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,870
[Abigail] I wanted to do right
by my father.

248
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,874
The debt was to a balloon-shaped
German man with a thin cock.

249
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,553
Thankfully, I managed to convince him a
woman has her blood in 28 days a month.

250
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,389
[chuckles quietly]

251
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,801
What happened to your hand?

252
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,186
[Abigail] Some of my...
colleagues are immune to my charms.

253
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,447
[classical music playing]

254
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,535
Earl Stratford,
do not come near me whining today

255
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,583
or I will crush your tiny heart to liver.

256
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,671
Madame Tournee. You may have
the tapestry budget you asked for.

257
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,591
Spend one penny more
and I will take your fingernails in lieu.

258
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,043
[Tournee] Merci.

259
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,015
Abigail, get a platter of oysters
sent to the Dutch ambassador.

260
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,182
Yes, Your Ladyship.

261
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,972
[Sarah] Colonel Masham.

262
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,725
Lady Marlborough.

263
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,397
The queen will ride on Wednesday.

264
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,607
Yes, Lady Marlborough.

265
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,853
Would you like a bite of my new maid
before you leave?

266
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,492
[music fades]

267
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,948
[duck quacks]

268
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,794
Must the duck be here?

269
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,590
Fastest duck in the city.

270
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,465
Horatio is a prize worth stealing.
He does not leave my side.

271
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,545
Keep him away from me,

272
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,132
or I will pull his liver out
and eat it with a cornichon.

273
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,050
Charming.

274
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,386
You should know I've canvassed my party.

275
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,938
They're waiting for us
to announce an attempt at peace.

276
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,474
We shall both make our case to the queen.

277
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,980
Yes, where is the queen?
We've been waiting an hour.

278
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,687
-[footman] Lady Sarah Marlborough.
-I'm here.

279
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,072
[Harley] Might I remind you
you're not the queen?

280
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,991
No, she has sent me to speak for her.
She is unwell.

281
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,034
[prime minister] What says she?

282
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,739
That Harley is a fop and a prat and smells
like a 96-year-old French whore's vajuju.

283
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,664
Oh?

284
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,328
Well, I really doubt you're quoting.

285
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,251
She has decided to continue with the war.

286
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,625
She feels another victory in will put us
in a stronger position for a treaty.

287
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,706
Her letters.

288
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,208
[Harley] And how are we going
to pay for this?

289
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,259
The land tax is to be doubled.

290
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,628
This is madness.

291
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,427
The war you will be fighting
will be in our own countryside.

292
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,723
She relies on you and your love of England
to hold the Tories together.

293
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,895
- There are limits.
-[Sarah] The love of your country?

294
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,598
To me, there is no limit on that.

295
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,059
Our last farthing to protect England
if we must.

296
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,314
[Harley] And our last man, too?

297
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,070
Look, the dead pile up,
as do the resentments.

298
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,273
- Or that does not concern you?
-[Sarah] I grieve them all.

299
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,031
In my heart, a scar for each, and I send
my own beloved with them, chest bared.

300
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,782
So do not lecture me on the cost.

301
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,537
[Harley] A treaty would save money
and lives. A win for all Englishmen.

302
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,664
[prime minister] We go to them after one
victory, they know we are scared.

303
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,122
We bury more of them,
they know we have them.

304
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,922
The queen has decided, Harley.

305
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:00,999
I disagree.

306
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,220
A lot. I'd like an audience with the queen
where I may state my case.

307
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,173
State it to me. I love a comedy.
ls there cake?

308
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,722
[Harley] This is a disgusting distortion
of the system.

309
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,177
You have no place in this.

310
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,433
Your mascara is running.

311
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,231
If you'd like to go fix yourself,
we can continue this later.

312
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:20,985
[grunts]

313
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,479
[Harley grunts]

314
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,277
[Sarah] You will need to pay
for the repair of that.

315
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,288
We have a war to finance.
Every penny counts.

316
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,240
[prime minister]
Come on, old bean. One more victory.

317
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:40,792
[duck quacks]

318
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,343
[prime minister] Must you rub it in?

319
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,807
A man's dignity is the one thing
that holds him back from running amok.

320
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,601
Sometimes a lady likes to have some fun.

321
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,146
[prime minister]
We need to be careful, Sarah.

322
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,109
He's a useful ally, but a dangerous enemy.

323
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,447
[Sarah] Borrow anything you want.

324
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,399
Thank you.

325
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,075
And thank you for the job.

326
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,824
I have a thing for the weak.

327
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,996
[footman] Lord Marlborough.

328
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,073
[Marlborough] It is time.

329
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,877
[Sarah] You must be safe.

330
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,963
You must not be foolish and brave.

331
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,291
Be smart and safe, I beg you.

332
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,296
I will.

333
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,502
[Sarah] Stay with me tonight.

334
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,381
[Marlborough] I must sleep with my men.
It is only right.

335
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,808
I had a dream

336
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,485
that this very small Frenchman
covered in blood...

337
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,322
was carrying Marlborough's head around,
feeding it Brie.

338
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,031
He's a great soldier.

339
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,075
He will be fine.

340
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:00,793
We will prevail.

341
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,962
Of course we will, Mrs. Freeman.
[chuckles]

342
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,474
[coughs]

343
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,685
[Abigail] I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

344
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,144
I think I caught a chill
picking the herbs for your leg.

345
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,358
-[Anne] That was you?
- Abigail.

346
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,496
Let's shoot something.

347
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,953
-[gunshot]
-[bird caws]

348
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,871
[Abigail] It's sad really.
They're so pretty.

349
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,884
Throw.

350
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,519
[Sarah] You're only
doing damage to the sky.

351
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,768
Can I ask you something?

352
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,853
As long as you are aware
that I have a gun.

353
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,774
You fought hard for this war
and your husband is at the front of it.

354
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,439
His life is at risk.

355
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,866
How can you do that?

356
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,988
[Sarah] It is right.

357
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,286
If we don't do it,
they will gather force and be over here

358
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,239
cutting us all into chops within the year.

359
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,954
You are of a sweet disposition
and have suffered blows,

360
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,753
so desire safety and favor above all else.

361
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,206
If he dies?

362
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,211
[Sarah] Did you not sacrifice your cunt
to fatty German to save your father?

363
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,592
Yes.

364
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,801
[Sarah] There's always a price to pay.
I am prepared to pay it.

365
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,601
- Throw.
-[wings flapping]

366
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,979
[gunshot]

367
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,518
[Sarah] Just relax and aim.

368
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,272
When it crosses your eye,
pull the trigger.

369
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,618
Throw.

370
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,827
[Sarah] Perfect.

371
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,452
I will make a killer of you yet.

372
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,391
[Masham] Are you following me?

373
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,899
I said, are you following me?

374
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,853
You seem to be following me, sir,
as I am in front of you.

375
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,951
That was you I saw
on the horse that morning.

376
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,246
I am a servant. Where would I get a horse?

377
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,323
Perhaps you dreamt of me'?

378
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,961
Perhaps it was you, and I should have you
stripped and whipped.

379
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,082
I'm waiting.

380
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,843
Going to ride that one, are we?

381
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,975
She does make my blood hot.

382
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,970
She's Lady Marlborough's new one.

383
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,521
Indeed.

384
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,064
Interesting.

385
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,112
[footsteps]

386
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,539
[Harley] Excuse me. Move. Excuse me.

387
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,663
- Your Majesty. How lovely to see you.
-[festive music playing]

388
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,037
It seems you have allocated
even more money

389
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,042
into the abyss that is this fool's errand.

390
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,797
Oh, uh, yes. We will win.
Sarah's sure we will win.

391
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:37,922
It's the landholders' tax.

392
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,755
You have no idea the firestorm of rage
you have set loose in the countryside.

393
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,386
- Really? Are they angry?
- Dearest queen.

394
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,013
[Anne] How do you like my stockings?

395
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,185
[Sarah] Festive.

396
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:50,356
Very. I was just explaining to the queen
the mistake this tax is. The war as well.

397
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,398
We should sue for peace.

398
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,317
Oh, Harley, you are such a bore.

399
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,814
That is for parliament.

400
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,569
A ball is for dancing and eating
those horseradish and venison puffs.

401
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,694
Have you tried them?

402
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,072
I'm having trouble swallowing
at the moment. Your Majesty...

403
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,494
I'd like to enjoy the music now.

404
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,948
Oh, yes. I love this music. I must dance.

405
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,044
[music continues]

406
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,288
[music continues]

407
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,075
[music continues]

408
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,682
Stop it!

409
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,055
- Stop it! Stop!
-[music stops]

410
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,351
- What has happened?
- I would like to go back to my room now.

411
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,312
Stop. Mr. Harley.

412
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,699
I agree I went too far
with the tax for the war.

413
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,152
-[Sarah] What?
- It will stay as it was.

414
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,495
We are your servants, my queen.

415
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,508
Anne.

416
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,590
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,820
[Sarah] It's okay.

418
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,941
Shall we go fast?

419
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,126
-[Anne cheers]
-[Sarah giggles]

420
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,792
[Anne cheering, distant]

421
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,255
-[cheering gets closer]
-[door slams open]

422
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,886
[Anne and Sarah laugh]

423
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,395
[both giggle]

424
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,246
[Anne panting]

425
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,776
Fuck me.

426
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,987
-[kissing]
-[panting]

427
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,489
Abigail, isn't it?

428
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,790
Yes, sir.

429
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,918
Stolen a book, I see.

430
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,663
Why, one could be stripped
and whipped for that.

431
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,293
My mistress lent it to me.

432
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,545
Shall we go ask her?

433
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,467
- No.
-[muffled laughter]

434
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,261
No.

435
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,257
Come and take the night air with me.

436
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,689
So, you once were a lady,
and now you are nothing.

437
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,024
A bit of scullery scraps.

438
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,435
How very sad.

439
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,446
Well, I'm still the lady I was,
in my heart.

440
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,321
No doubt. It is important
to make new friends, is it not?

441
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,780
Yes.

442
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,987
If that's what's actually happening here,

443
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,448
and not veiled threats
under the guise of civility.

444
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,867
Am I to understand you are smart?

445
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,543
You want something.

446
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,620
To fuck me?

447
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,249
I will leave that to my friend Masham,
who is completely cunt-struck by you.

448
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,335
So, tell me about Lady Marlborough,
Godolphin, the queen.

449
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,253
Anything gaining on?

450
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,047
I love gossip.

451
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,677
It's a failing, I know.

452
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,726
[Abigail sighs] Lady Marlborough
has been good to me.

453
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,386
She saved me.

454
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,973
I will not breach her confidence.

455
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,559
[Harley] Of course. You are in favor.

456
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,190
But favor is a breeze
that shifts direction all the time.

457
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,147
Then in an instant, you're back sleeping
with a bunch of scabrous whores

458
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,858
wondering whose finger's in your ass.

459
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,485
You cannot have too many friends in court.

460
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,407
I need a friend, Abigail.

461
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,327
One with cute ears and wide eyes.

462
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,831
I'm often blindsided
by the distorted situation at court.

463
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,583
As leader of the opposition,
I should not be.

464
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,457
I would merely like to know of any plans

465
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,840
Her Ladyship, Godolphin,
or the queen may have.

466
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,262
I will not betray my mistress's trust.

467
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,851
Oh, look. A wren. How cute.

468
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,228
[Abigail grunts]

469
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,726
You all right?

470
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,187
[panting]

471
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,608
Anyway, think on it.

472
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,527
There's no pressure.

473
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:50,040
[Sarah] You will have to tell Harley
you've changed your mind about the tax.

474
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,875
[Anne] Are the people really angry
about the land tax?

475
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,298
[Sarah] They'll be angrier
when the French are sodomizing their wives

476
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,921
and planting their fields with garlic.

477
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,424
[Anne] The Tories must not be
rode roughshod over, though.

478
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,970
And more dead if we do it.

479
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,550
[Sarah] It is painful to lose men,
but we cannot be halfhearted in this

480
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,636
or they will see our weakness and take us
and we will lose thousands more.

481
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,480
None for the queen.

482
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:11,894
What?

483
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,851
You cannot have hot chocolate.

484
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,811
Your stomach, the sugar inflames it.

485
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,737
- Abigail, hand me that cup.
-[Sarah] Do not.

486
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,781
I'm sorry, I do not know what to do.

487
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,699
[Sarah] Fine, give it to her.

488
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,244
Then you can get a bucket and a mop
for the aftermath.

489
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,509
Take me back.

490
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,966
[classical music playing]

491
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,739
You will pronounce the tax in parliament.
I will set the date.

492
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,251
[music fades]

493
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,720
[Abigail] I must tell you something.

494
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,518
[Sarah] Go on.

495
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,555
[Abigail] Mr. Harley came to me

496
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,561
and asked me to betray your confidence

497
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,269
about what goes on between you
and the queen and Godolphin.

498
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:40,779
[Sarah] I see.

499
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,823
And what will you do?

500
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,532
[Abigail] I'm not going to, obviously.

501
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,579
[Sarah] Not obviously.

502
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,538
You may tell me of his approach
to encourage my trust

503
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,294
and still work both sides of the street.

504
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,208
[Abigail] I am a person of honor,
even if my station is not.

505
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,086
Even if I were the last one left
in this wretched place,

506
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,420
I would remain a lady.

507
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,801
[Sarah laughs]

508
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,381
You're pretty when outraged.

509
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,847
So my secrets are safe with you?

510
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,769
All of them.

511
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,355
[Sarah] Good.

512
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,184
Even your biggest secret.

513
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,864
Abigail.

514
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,408
[gasps]

515
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,366
If you forget to load the pellet,

516
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,040
the gun fires, makes the sound,
but releases no shot.

517
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,788
It is a great jape. Do you agree?

518
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,460
Yes.

519
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,256
Maybe we will think of
a use for it one day.

520
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,919
Sometimes, it is hard to remember
whether you have loaded the pellet or not.

521
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,589
I do fear confusion and accidents.

522
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,682
I'm sure people will be careful.

523
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,927
[gagging]

524
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,523
[breathes deeply]

525
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,343
[Sarah] Beef, 12 guineas.

526
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,844
Cream.

527
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,809
Mrs. Meg, your cream bill is outrageous.

528
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,602
Are you bathing in it
to help your hemorrhoids?

529
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,350
No, Your Ladyship.

530
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
[Harley] May I examine?

531
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,606
Of course.

532
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,982
It's perfect, Lady Marlborough, as always.

533
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,156
[page whispering]
The queen. It is rather urgent.

534
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,992
Shall we sign off?

535
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,536
Of course.

536
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,956
[classical music playing]

537
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,846
Aim for the flagstones.

538
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,352
The lawn might break your fall.

539
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,149
[Anne] You do not care.

540
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,647
Mrs. Morley.

541
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
- Please!
- No!

542
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,277
[Cries]

543
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,526
[music fades]

544
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,236
[Anne] Stay a while.

545
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,788
No! Take the day off. I command it.

546
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,286
Someone must run things.

547
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,125
I am not food.

548
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,709
You cannot just eat and eat.

549
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,958
[Anne] Yet you are tasty and salty.

550
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,417
[squeals] If I grilled you,
you'd make a delightful meal.

551
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,085
Very well.

552
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,138
I will come and see you this afternoon,
and we can play whist.

553
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,720
[footsteps]

554
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,017
[classical music playing]

555
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,236
[Godolphin] The opposition asks us

556
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,735
-to be halfhearted in this war!
-[loud, indistinct chatter]

557
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,734
- We will not!
-[man] Hear, hear!

558
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,989
We must wear our griefs,

559
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,076
for England is worth our all,

560
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,745
and suffer we must for her!

561
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:08,713
Mr. Harley,

562
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,958
control your rabble!

563
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,679
I am, therefore, announcing today

564
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,631
-that, at Her Majesty's...
-[music fades]

565
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,305
About time, Mrs. Freeman.
This fucking leg.

566
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,721
It's like a monster attacking me.

567
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,354
Cut it off for me, will you?

568
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,977
[Abigail] I don't think so, Your Majesty.

569
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,731
Why are you here?

570
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,824
Lady Marlborough sent me,
as I am an excellent whist player

571
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,618
and she has been unavoidably detained
with business of state,

572
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,911
but will be here posthaste.

573
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,079
It's my state.

574
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,537
I am the business of state.
Did she actually send me her maid?

575
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,910
[Abigail] Your Majesty,
I wasn't always a maid.

576
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,121
I'm educated, I speak Latin, French.

577
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,206
My family fell on hard times.

578
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,258
- I'm also her cousin.
-lt's all very fascinating.

579
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,798
You shall leave, regardless,
and tell her to come.

580
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,134
They're gorgeous.

581
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,180
They're my babies. Let them out, please.

582
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,524
[Abigail] How many are there?

583
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,101
[Anne] Seventeen.

584
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,895
It's Hildebrand's day today.

585
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,107
[Abigail] Which one is he?

586
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,277
That one there. Shy, but stubborn.

587
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:22,662
[Abigail] May I?

588
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,661
[Anne] He likes you.

589
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,833
I lost some 17 children.

590
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,597
Some were born as blood,

591
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,391
some without breath...

592
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,845
and some were with me
for a very brief time.

593
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,393
Oh, my dear.

594
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,773
Today is Hildebrand's day.

595
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,987
The day you lost him.

596
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,369
Yes.

597
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,660
Each one that dies,
a little bit of you goes with them.

598
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,537
Would you like to join me?

599
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,251
[Anne] Oh. Lovely cake.

600
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,511
Yum.

601
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,422
[Abigail] You like it?

602
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,972
-[Anne] Delish.
-[Abigail] You do like it.

603
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,224
[Anne] Hello, Sussy.

604
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,931
Happy birthday.

605
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,353
Come on. There's some for you, too.

606
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,525
Don't eat Mummy's foot.

607
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,487
[knocking on door]

608
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,028
What an outfit.

609
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,364
Thank you.

610
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,283
I thought it might be too much.

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,869
Have you come to seduce me or rape me?

612
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,330
[Masham] I am a gentleman.

613
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,957
So rape, then.

614
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:58,754
[Masham] No.

615
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,961
No, you are...

616
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,388
You have intrigued me.

617
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,676
And you, me.

618
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,813
I'm intrigued by what you look like
under all this.

619
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,116
You're handsome.

620
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,792
No wonder you cover it up.

621
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,078
Who are you?

622
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,876
No ordinary maid.

623
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,832
It could be said I have fallen far.

624
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,844
It could be said I aim to catch you.

625
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,765
[Masham] Ow!

626
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,259
I might allow it.

627
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,182
Now good night, sir.

628
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,401
Progress?

629
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,858
Uh... She, uh...

630
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,405
- She bit me.
- Oh.

631
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,075
This wig's ridiculous.

632
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,657
A man must look pretty.

633
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,997
I'm not entirely sure she approves.

634
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,079
Try again in your own way, old boy.

635
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,618

636
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,481

638

[Sarah] Apologies regarding
sending Abigail in my stead.

639
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,348
[Anne] She was perfectly darling.

640
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,974
Hildebrand really took to her.

641
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,146
Is that a rabbit?

642
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,309
Anne, you are too sensitive.

643
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,188
And you are too mean and uncaring,
some days.

644
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,445
Some days, I'm quite lovely, though.
Let's think on them.

645
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:29,659
[Sarah] Anne.

646
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,411
You're such a child.

647
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,926
[Abigail] I guess all the rapes
were the hardest.

648
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,054
Made me feel at their mercy.

649
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,219
That I was nothing.

650
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,022
You are not nothing. You're a dear person.

651
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,099
Thank you.

652
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,398
You're so beautiful.

653
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,813
Stop it. You mock me.

654
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,398
I do not.

655
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,027
If I were a man, I would ravish you.

656
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,990
- Ravish.
- Enough.

657
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,539
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[children playing music]

661
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:46,944
Make them stop.

662
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,733
What?

663
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,655
Stop!

664
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,820
Enough!

665
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,821
Stop!

666
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,740
Be gone!

00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,446
I command it!

00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,289
Leave!

669
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,493
I don't want to hear it!

- Now I must rest.

you are in the west hallway.

[Abigail] No. I just believe you can.

00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,013
[Sarah] It's 12-11.

715
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,058
You're shooting
exceptionally well, Abigail.

716
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,313
[Abigail] You've taught me well.

717
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,026
I hope you haven't found your time
with the queen too tedious.

718
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:21,075
Oh, not at all.
And if it gives you rest, I'm happy.

719
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,328
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a shot badger.

720
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,246
Excellent.

721
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,115
The queen is...

722
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,701
an extraordinary person...

723
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,462
even if it's not readily apparent.

724
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,044
She's been stalked by tragedy.

725
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,421
She seems quite lovely.

726
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,798
[Sarah] I will not burden you again.

727
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,842
- I'm quite happy to...
- I know you are.

728
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,679
She will be angry if I do not appear soon.

729
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,222
Take your shot.

730
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,730
Throw.

731
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,660
[Abigail] Thirteen.

732
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,244
[Sarah] The queen?

733
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,912
I will be there directly.

734
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,553
The queen... asked for her.

735
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,560
I have sent for some lobsters. I thought
we could race them and then eat them.

736
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,311
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

737
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,442
I hope you have three.

738
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,236
You sent for Abigail
to try and make me jealous, I think.

739
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,154
Perhaps.

740
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,489
[Anne gasps]

741
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,237
They'll be in with the lobsters.

742
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,572
You scared?

743
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,824
[door opens]

744
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:50,782
Oh, I think a moat is a bad idea.
It's just-- It's too old-fashioned.

745
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,334
Your lobsters, ma'am.
Where should I put them?

746
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,128
Uh... here.

747
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,053
[exclaims]

748
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,311
Hello. Remember me?

749
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,222
[Abigail] Mr. Harley.

750
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,561
You always unbalance me.

751
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,355
[Harley] So what's been happening?

752
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,939
The queen and Lady Marlborough
are to race lobsters and then eat them.

753
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,364
Do you want to get punched?

754
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,658
The queen is going to announce

755
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,452
the doubling of the landholders' tax
to parliament.

756
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,779
Do you jest?

757
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,739
I don't think she's certain of it, though.

758
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,916
But Lady Marlborough
is providing that certainty.

759
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:34,833
Yes.

760
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,502
And?

761
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,121
That is all.

762
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,166
Why do I feel that is not all?

763
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,253
I'm trying my best.

764
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,179
I am.

765
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,802
All right, turn off the tears. Thank you.
Have a pleasant evening.

766
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,730
May I speak a moment,
with Her Majesty's pleasure?

767
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,744
May I exhort the chamber
to roar a mighty hurrah for Her Majesty

768
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,698
in her brilliant decision
to not raise the land tax.

769
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,333
-[crowd] Hurrah!
-[Harley] For the doubling

770
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,754
of the tax would have been a disaster,
and the fields would have run with blood

771
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,582
as the countryside rose up
against our city friends,

772
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,840
to add to the piling dead of our sons
already on the field of this war.

773
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,926
Again, to our queen, for her deep wisdom

774
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,176
in knowing where to draw the line
in holding our country together.

775
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,187
For there is no point winning a war abroad

776
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,934
if we are to star': one at home.

777
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,641
-[crowd] Hear, hear!
-[crowd] Hurrah!

778
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,692
[Harley] I apologize for the interruption,
Your Majesty.

779
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,523
The floor is yours, of course.

780
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,154
We look forward to hearing
what you have to say.

781
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,374
[indistinct chatter]

782
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,145
[imitation animal sound]

783
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,811
[clicking]

784
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,616
-[screams]
-[screams]

785
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,907
[Abigail] Men should not
sneak up on women.

786
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,238
You look scared.

787
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,323
[Masham] I'm hurt.

788
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,709
[Abigail shrieks]

789
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,423
-[Masham grunts]
-[Abigail shrieks]

790
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:57,893
[Abigail] Wait, wait!

791
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,392
Kiss me properly first.

792
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,690
-[Masham grunts]
-[Abigail giggles]

793
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,906
I have just now decided
to marry you, Masham.

794
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,783
I cannot marry a servant.

795
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,035
I can enjoy one, though.

796
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,957
I know it would ruin you to marry me.

797
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,254
I will fix things for us.

798
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,675
Don't you think we are a good match?

799
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,677
I think a very good match.

800
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,146
[Masham screams]

801
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,405
I looked like a fool.

802
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,827
They were all staring, weren't they?

803
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,872
I can tell even if I can't see,
and I heard the word "fat." Fat.

804
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,074
- And ugly.
- Anne.

805
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,706
No one but me would dare, and I did not.

806
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,913
I felt for you. He set you up.
It is our fault.

807
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,419
I didn't know what else to do.
I couldn't go through with it.

808
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,922
It's fine, Anne. It's fine.

809
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,468
He was ready for us.

810
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,554
He probably just assumed
that you've been working on her.

811
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,018
A minor hitch.

812
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,937
We will reset the date.

813
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,410
[Anne] What are you doing?

814
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,625
Oh, Your Majesty.

815
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,251
Lady Marlborough asked me to wait for you,
and I was...

816
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,088
The bed looked so beautiful,
and I was overcome...

817
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,586
with foolishness. I'm sorry.

818
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,554
Well, you may get out now.

819
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,282
Apologies again, Your Majesty.

820
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,072
What happened to your dress?

821
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,238
Wolves.

822
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:31,724
Her legs.

823
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,073
[Anne] Rub my legs.

824
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,894
[Abigail] Does it hurt a lot?

825
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,392
They're agony.

826
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,018
[moans pleasurably]

827
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,562
Oh, the pain.

828
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,818
Marlborough has written.

829
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:02,898
He's in position.

830
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,401
The battle will begin any time.

831
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,910
He will prevail.

832
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,082
Of course.

833
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,003
I imagine you will not sleep tonight.
I can stay and sit with you.

834
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,250
I'm all right.

835
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,856
Good morning, Lady Marlborough.

836
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,235
[Sarah] Did you see that book of poetry
from the Dryden fellow?

837
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,066
I... have not.

838
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:09,991
[Sarah] No.

839
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,326
No.

840
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,073
No.

841
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,122
No.

842
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:16,869
No.

843
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:19,501
I don't understand.

844
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,669
Did you take it? My book.

845
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:22,712
[Abigail] No.

846
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,461
I think you are a pretty little liar
that I have misjudged.

847
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,047
I did not mean for this to happen.

848
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,425
The queen, she's forceful.

849
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,176
[Sarah] You are dismissed from my service.

850
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,343
Go back to Mrs. Meg and tell her
to find you a position in the scullery.

851
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,350
And if she asks why, tell her
â€œBecause I am a disloyal little bitch."

852
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,055
Yes, Your Ladyship.

853
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,270
It has been an honor and privilege--

854
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,194
If you do not go, I will start kicking you
and I will not stop.

855
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,906
[panting]

856
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,659
[muffled crying]

857
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,507
[crying continues]

858
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,234
[sniffling]

859
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,234
You have become close to Abigail.

860
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,315
She's been a dear. Yes.

861
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,277
It is such a shame,
but I've had to dismiss her for theft.

862
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,953
She's a liar and a thief.

863
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,788
Your tongue
seems uncharacteristically still.

864
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,043
I heard you.

865
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,000
She's my servant. She's not dismissed.

866
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,505
I've made her my maid of the bedchamber.

867
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,131
Did you not hear what I said?

868
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,963
Yes, you regard her as a liar and a thief.

869
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,219
- Yes.
- I do not, obviously.

870
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,268
You will dismiss her.

871
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,891
I don't want to.

872
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,314
I like it when she puts her tongue
inside me.

873
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,892
[classical music playing]

874
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,561
[music fades]

875
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,662
It feels so strange to be in this.

876
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,955
It's good for you.

877
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,033
The doctor says it'll leach the toxins.

878
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,085
What if I should fall asleep
and slip under?

879
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,375
Just imagine it's hot chocolate.

880
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,840
- Oh, then I shall die happy.
-[Abigail giggles]

881
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,964
[door opens]

882
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,213
[door closes]

883
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,345
[Sarah] After you left, I thought,
â€œWhat a grand idea to take to the mud."

884
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,811
To get whatever poisons
one carries with one out.

885
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,852
[mud sloshing]

886
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,439
[Sarah] Abigail, could you fetch me
some refreshment?

887
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,609
I would like to, of course, but...

888
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,411
I must be at the queen's side
and behest at all times.

889
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,579
It is my role.

890
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,656
Such loyalty.

891
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,536
How delightful it is when one tries to
cultivate a new trait in one's character.

892
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,499
- Do not scratch at her.
-[Sarah scoffs]

893
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,838
Mr. Freeman.

894
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,510
Mr. Morley.

895
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,848
Oh, how handsome you are.

896
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,017
[Anne] How handsome you are, Mr. Freeman.

897
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,733
[Sarah] Oh... But I...

898
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,189
I forgot my glasses.

899
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:01,491
[Anne and Sarah laugh]

900
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,821
[chuckles]

901
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,212
You will be back in the street.

902
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,098
[Sarah] Do you remember
when we were young,

903
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,597
and we were not allowed out in the snow,

904
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,145
and we opened all the windows
in the ballroom

905
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,599
and sat there
as the snow flurries just wafted in?

906
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:38,312
And when your governess came in, we were
making a snowman and our hands were blue.

907
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,864
-[Anne] Oh, it was such fun.
-[Abigail] Sounds marvelous.

908
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,532
[Sarah] So many things
we have done together.

909
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,201
[Abigail] I do love ancient history.

910
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,116
Sorry, Abigail, did you say something?

911
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,073
Oh, I was singing.
I cannot get a tune out of my head.

912
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,909
[Sarah] Well, there is
so much room for it.

913
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:53,164
[Abigail chuckles]

914
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,871
Lady Marlborough, you're such a wit.

915
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,751
Oh, Abigail, you are a dear.

916
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,958
I think I shall retire for the evening.

917
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,885
Shall I prepare your bed, Queen Anne?

918
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,007
Or shall you and I adjourn
to your apartments for some sherry?

919
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,261
[Anne] Oh!

920
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,343
Sherry sounds just the ticket.

921
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,347
Good night, Abigail.

922
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,600
Yes, good night, dear Abigail.

923
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,813
You are enjoying all of this, aren't you?

924
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,648
To be beloved? Of course.

925
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,326
To see you trying to win me.
Why, what is not to love, my dear?

926
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:31,452
You will stop this ridiculous infatuation.
You have made your point.

927
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,624
Perhaps I was not making a point.

928
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,178
[Abigail] Perhaps because of my past,

929
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,852
perhaps a malformation of my heart.

930
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,307
I blame my father, of course. Cunt.

931
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,109
I must take control of my circumstance.

932
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,897
I will need to act in a way
that meets with the edges of my morality.

933
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,282
And when I end up on the street
selling my asshole to syphilitic soldiers,

934
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,785
steadfast morality will be a
fucking nonsense that will mock me daily.

935
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,290
I'm not quite following.

936
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,208
Shh.

937
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,961
I apologize.
But do "shh" when I'm thinking.

938
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,217
Your hair is so lustrous.

939
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,383
It's something people in court comment on.

940
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,759
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

941
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,383
I always thought of it
as rather nest-like.

942
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,592
Not at all.

943
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,261
[footman] Lady Marlborough.

944
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,017
I shall make you tea.

945
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,687
- What a lovely idea. Thank you, Abigail.
-[Abigail] Of course.

946
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,267
[Anne] Pat the kids hello.

947
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,352
Of course.

948
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,916
You will give that speech on
the tax increase in parliament next week.

949
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,253
[Anne] I dreamed of the man
on the roadside with one eye.

950
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,253
[Sarah] What man?

951
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,256
We drove through town.

952
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,012
He looked at me in such a way,
it made my blood chill.

953
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,132
So kind.

954
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,012
[Anne] Abigail, do you think the people
are angry?

955
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,219
Anne, she does not know.

956
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,807
We should ask people. Get some people in
from the villages and ask them.

957
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,983
[Sarah] That is not how matters of state
are dealt with.

958
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,776
People are led. They do not lead.

959
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,108
Would you leave Marlborough exposed?

960
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,406
He needs another battalion
ready to join him, and that means money.

961
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:29,949
Do not shout at me. I am the queen.

962
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,572
Then for once act like one.

963
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,723
[classical music playing]

964
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:07,604
Is the queen not riding today?

965
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,022
Do not speak to me.

966
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,044
[music continues]

967
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,050
[gags]

968
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,591
[coughs]

969
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,491
[music fades]

970
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,089
[indistinct chatter, laughing]

971
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,094
I have thought on the terms
of our friendship.

972
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,760
I thought it was unconditional love.

973
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,972
I will get you an audience with the queen
if you ask her a favor for me.

974
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,808
- Wench. You--
- Harley, you do not need me as an enemy.

975
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,435
As it turns out,
I am capable of much unpleasantness.

976
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:11,857
As am I.

977
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,406
[Abigail] You're so tiring,
being like this.

978
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,358
The queen has taken a shine to me,

979
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,319
and I will drip poison into her ear
regarding you

980
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,324
until she is mad with hatred for you.

981
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,373
Or we could have
a mutually advantageous friendship.

982
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,075
Count of three. Yes or no?

983
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,663
Well, if you're so close to the queen,
why not just ask this favor yourself?

984
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,124
[Abigail] I do not want her to ever think
I want anything from her.

985
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,584
- Have you counseled her for our side?
- No.

986
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,428
[Harley] The country's future
hangs in the balance.

987
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,176
Mm-hmm. My thing is what I wish
to talk about.

988
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,385
You do not care?

989
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,554
I thought you were on our side.

990
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,056
[Abigail] I'm on my side.

991
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,394
Always.

992
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,806
Sometimes,
it's a happy coincidence for you.

993
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:52,068
Like now.
You'll get a chance to save the country.

994
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,329
[moaning]

995
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,001
[grunting]

996
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,549
[Harley] What tremendous luck
to find you in the garden.

997
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,138
[Anne] We were taking the air.

998
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,303
[Harley] You do not like the war,
I know that.

999
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,346
[Anne] No, I do not,
but we must fight for what we fight for.

1000
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,098
[Harley] Godolphin and Lady Marlborough
seem to have corralled you

1001
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,308
so you do not get to hear
from your loyal opposition.

1002
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,609
[Anne] I am briefed appropriately.

1003
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,278
[Harley] Were it in person,
I'd believe it.

1004
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:37,234
-[Anne] I am often ill.
-[Harley] True.

1005
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:39,065
Sadly true.

1006
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,202
The war with the French will bleed us dry
even if we win.

1007
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,699
We are in our strongest position now.

1008
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,032
If Marlborough loses this next battle,
we could lose all.

1009
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,038
The people hate the war, you realize,

1010
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:51,664
they begin to hate you.

1011
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,832
Lady Marlborough has not told you
of the riots in Leeds?

1012
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,500
[Anne] No, she has not.

1013
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,466
- All I ask is that you search your heart.
- Of course.

1014
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,173
Not Lady Marlborough's heart, your own.

1015
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,141
I must talk to you of your maid also.

1016
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,889
- Abigail?
- I believe that is her name.

1017
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,022
It seems Colonel Masham has fallen
for her. He wishes to marry.

1018
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:12,766
[Anne] She's just a maid.

1019
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,351
[Harley] lt is irregular and inexplicable,

1020
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:17,858
but being sentimental,
I am moved to help if possible.

1021
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,826
What do you mean she's not been seen?

1022
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:28,077
[Masham] She took a horse, Your Majesty.
It did not come back and nor did she.

1023
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,791
[Godolphin] I shall send riders.

1024
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:34,545
No.

1025
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,882
I think she means to vex me.
Do not send riders.

1026
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,842
[Godolphin]
In case she has fallen, though.

1027
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,511
She's too good a rider for that.

1028
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,884
I know what she is. Do not seek her.

1029
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,104
[grunting and groaning]

1030
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,487
Where am I?

1031
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,273
You're in heaven.

1032
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,656
That's God. You'll meet him later.

1033
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,874
- I must go.
- I don't think that's happening.

1034
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:18,873
[woman] Lie back.

1035
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,837
[inhales sharply]

1036
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,047
[woman] Stop infection.

1037
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:39,185
[Anne] Get Lady Marlborough.

1038
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,689
Now! Take me to her!

1039
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,458
Find her.

1040
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,669
Find her!

1041
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,889
[Anne] There are wolves out there,
are there not?

1042
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,566
[Godolphin] No, Your Majesty.
I don't think so.

1043
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,110
Perhaps she's gone to Blenheim,
her palace?

1044
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,404
There is no palace yet. It is the woods.

1045
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,980
We should check in the trees,
just to be sure.

1046
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,065
[Anne] Mr. Harley!

1047
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,616
I apologize.

1048
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,444
I hope we find her,
and she's not dead in a ditch.

1049
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,530
The business of state, however,
cannot stop.

1050
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:35,788
Your Majesty, there has been no word
from the front in two weeks.

1051
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,040
There is no doubt
that Marlborough is in trouble.

1052
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,046
We need to send a division immediately
to help him.

1053
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,251
Costing a fortune, built on your paranoia,
and walking into God knows what.

1054
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,336
We need to wait.

1055
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,467
I will think on it for a while.

1056
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,718
[Godolphin] This cannot wait.

1057
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,224
We need to act now.

1058
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,143
Is it a bit like going late to your party?

1059
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:58,105
If the party's going well, they did not
need you, and they resent the intrusion.

1060
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,524
But if it's going badly,
you cannot save it,

1061
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,854
and you tend to regret
ever putting on your nice gown for it.

1062
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,238
[Godolphin] It is not like a party.

1063
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:07,986
[Abigail] I'm sorry, Prime Minister,
a passing thought.

1064
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,408
I think it is like a party.

1065
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,486
- A perfect analogy.
-[Anne] We will wait.

1066
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,538
Make sure they have their best dresses on
so they're ready at a moment's notice.

1067
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,040
Shift a division to the coast
and have a boat at the ready.

1068
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,165
Abigail.

1069
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,001
I worry something has befallen her.

1070
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,136
It's night. Out there alone.

1071
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,217
[Abigail] She's strong.

1072
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,678
- And she'll be fine.
- Yes.

1073
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,473
She saved me my whole life.

1074
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,604
Without her, I'm nothing.

1075
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,931
That is not true.

1076
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,063
- You are the queen.
-I'm tired.

1077
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,436
It hurts. Everything hurts.

1078
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:46,817
Everyone leaves me.

1079
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,281
Dies.

1080
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,529
Finally her.

1081
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:54,863
If she's not dead, I will cut her throat.

1082
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,198
She may be doing this to hurt me,

1083
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,705
make me dissolve and dissemble.
I will not.

1084
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,628
She will be fine. They will find her.

1085
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,001
[Anne] I don't care.

1086
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,628
You are a beautiful person.

1087
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,051
You glow with loveliness.

1088
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,338
We will marry you.

1089
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,970
- What?
- Colonel Masham wishes to marry you.

1090
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,177
- He does?
- Yes, you've quite captured him.

1091
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,020
That is absurd.

1092
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,936
I have nothing to offer.

1093
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:26,019
I'm a penniless servant.
It would be career suicide for him.

1094
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,571
Your first thought is for him?
Oh, you are a darling.

1095
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,818
I care for him.

1096
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,904
Not in the way I care for you,

1097
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:34,660
but enough to marry.

1098
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,951
I will not lie,
I would like to be a lady again.

1099
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,578
Yes, yes, this is right.

1100
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,578
While she is gone.

1101
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,411
If we wait, she'll return
and yell and stomp about it.

1102
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,917
But you must have this. This is my gift
to you, and I demand you take it.

1103
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:46,918
Of course. When--

1104
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:47,999
Let's-- Now.

1105
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,209
[classical music playing]

1106
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:56,050
I, Abigail Hill, take thee, Samuel Masham,
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1107
01:20:56,143 --> 01:21:02,105
[Masham] I, Samuel Masham, take thee,
Abigail Hill, to be my lawful wedded wife.

1108
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,899
[Clapping]

1109
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:06,772
[Abigail] It is most generous.

1110
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,318
I am overwhelmed.

1111
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,191
Shall we say "gambling debts," Mr. Harley?

1112
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,272
Excellent.

1113
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,153
[Anne] Oh, and you are to take apartments
in the east wing.

1114
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,154
-[Masham] Thank you, Your Majesty.
-[Abigail] Thank you.

1115
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,735
[Anne] Oh, it is fun
to be queen sometimes.

1116
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,616
[Harley] Hmm. One can only imagine.

1117
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,368
[music continues]

1118
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:22,416
[Masham] You're looking the wrong way.

1119
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,120
Where could she have gone?
You sent riders looking for her?

1120
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,955
[Masham] I have told you before.

1121
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,461
She would be sick for several days,
but she would be near recovered by now.

1122
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,713
[Masham] She probably went back
to Southampton.

1123
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,296
To do what? To plan what? To get ready?

1124
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:37,633
I am as hard as a rock,
and it is our wedding night.

1125
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,522
Lie still.

1126
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:47,775
[Masham grunts]

1127
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:01,782
Now that she is gone, I find myself
more concerned than when she was here.

1128
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,493
For it is like she could strike
from anywhere at any time,

1129
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,043
and I will not see it coming.

1130
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,125
[Masham exhales]

1131
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,752
I must be calm.

1132
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:13,793
She's gone.

1133
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:15,378
I'm married.

1134
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,096
[Masham groans]

1135
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:18,301
But I must be ready.

1136
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,054
And yet, how to be ready
when I do not know where my enemy is?

1137
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:26,355
My life is like a maze
I continually think I have gotten out of,

1138
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,062
only to find another corner
right in front of me.

1139
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,854
[Masham groans]

1140
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,441
[music ends]

1141
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:43,115
-[rhythmic creaking]
-[muffled moaning]

1142
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,160
Boy, fetch me a carriage.

1143
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:49,794
Mae says no.

1144
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,964
I'm leaving. Help me up.

1145
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,338
Mae says no.

1146
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,802
Are you feeling better, then?

1147
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,979
[Sarah] ls my horse alive,
or did you eat it?

1148
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,180
I sold it.

1149
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,353
You still owe me, though.

1150
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,986
You can suck for your supper from now on.

1151
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,562
I'll take 20%.

1152
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,442
You seem posh. Gents will like that.

1153
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:22,194
[Sarah] Have you ever seen
ten gold sovereigns?

1154
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,034
[Mae] In my dreams.

1155
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,365
[Sarah] Go to Hyde Park fountain
at 9:00 in the morning,

1156
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,326
and you will see a man walking a duck.

1157
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,631
[Godolphin chuckles]

1158
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,585
What happened? Are you all right?

1159
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,296
That cunt, Abigail, poisoned me.

1160
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,427
Mary Magdalene here found me.

1161
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,137
Did they rape you?

1162
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,311
No, they didn't.

1163
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,398
But gainful employment is on offer
should I need it.

1164
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,145
[Godolphin] Abigail did this?

1165
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,192
Yes.

1166
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,269
How goes the kingdom?

1167
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,732
â™ª Music â™ª

1168
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:07,203

â™ª Wondering â™ª

[music stops]

1186
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:24,491
Lady Marlborough.

1187
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:26,944
Oh, dear.

1188
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:31,957
The servant is dressed in the clothes
of a lady. How... whimsical.

1189
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,910
My dear friend and cousin,

1190
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,002
how good to see you've returned from--

1191
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,170
Hell.

1192
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,373
I'm sure you shall pass through it
one day.

1193
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,504
[Abigail] You've missed a few things.

1194
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:42,676
My marriage.

1195
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,845
It was a simple affair,
but beautifully done.

1196
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,264
[scoffs]

1197
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,140
Everyone leave.

1198
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:57,145
If you offer me tea,
you will forgive me if I don't accept.

1199
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:03,114
I have searched my heart, and I did not
have trust in it, and that is my shame.

1200
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,574
I could not just stand by
and let you destroy me.

1201
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,864
You have perhaps taught me that.

1202
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,078
But it's over now.

1203
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,498
I have won. I am safe.

1204
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,752
We do not have to fight anymore.
ls that not grand?

1205
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,039
If you just forgive me,
we can be happy together.

1206
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,462
[Abigail grunts]

1207
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,973
Obviously, you still have some anger
to expiate.

1208
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,013
I'll allow it this once.

1209
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,096
[Sarah] Congratulations
on your wedded bliss.

1210
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,021
[snickers]

1211
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,481
[Anne] Your face.

1212
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,691
Do I look that bad?

1213
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,652
If I were a man,
it'd be quite dashing, a scar like this.

1214
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,072
Where have you been, Sarah?
Why did you leave like that?

1215
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,744
[Sarah] I went riding.

1216
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,492
Some bandits attacked me.

1217
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,585
It took me a while to fight them off.

1218
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,128
Oh, your poor face.

1219
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,205
[Sarah] You should see them.

1220
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,715
And you've been well taken care of,
I trust.

1221
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,544
Some men were eventually sent to find me,
I hear

1222
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,971
I was worried for you. I thought you...

1223
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,715
You did not do it to try and hurt me?

1224
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,010
I do not play games with you.

1225
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,053
[Anne] No, I know, I know.

1226
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:17,892
Look at me.

1227
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,272
I will say this once and plainly,
my dearest one.

1228
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,186
You must send Abigail away.

1229
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:27,197
From my heart, Mrs. Morley, do it.

1230
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:28,865
I do not want to.

1231
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:30,864
[Sarah] She is a viper.

1232
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,911
[footsteps]

1233
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,284
You're jealous.

1234
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,206
- You will do as I say.
-[knocking]

1235
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:37,783
[footman] The prime minister
and Mr. Harley.

1236
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:38,868
[Sarah] What is it?

1237
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,078
[Harley] A thousand pardons, Your Majesty,
but word from the front.

1238
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,129
[Sarah] What has happened?

1239
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:44,752
Marlborough is ready.
He has them outflanked.

1240
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:47,046
He needs a garrison to attack the coast.

1241
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:48,969
Let them go to the party now.

1242
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,045
Of course, Your Majesty.

1243
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,630
[Sarah] What party?

1244
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,341
It happened while you were gone.

1245
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:55,847
Thank you, gentlemen.
Keep me informed of progress.

1246
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,896
It is good to see you home
and looking so well, Lady Marlborough.

1247
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,192
Now, you did very well with the divisions.

1248
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,193
[Anne] Yes, I know I did.

1249
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,197
However, the two new cabinet positions,
they must stay with the Whigs.

1250
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,787
I am the queen.
Do not try to do that thing you do.

1251
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,990
Do not try to manage this, as you cannot.

1252
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,413
I know that Harley has been in your ear
and Abigail in your bed.

1253
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,619
Enough!

1254
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,250
You will be as I wish you to be
from now on. Do you understand?

1255
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:25,422
Anne.

1256
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,257
[Anne] Don't. No, don't.

1257
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,760
No, your face frightens me. Don't!

1258
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,679
-[Sarah coughs]
- Good night, Lady Marlborough.

1259
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:41,480
Morning.

1260
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,392
Morning.

1261
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,861
What a strange sight you are, my dear.

1262
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,355
It is better, though.

1263
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,580
[Anne yawns]

1264
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,244
I think I'm becoming quite sentimental
as I get older.

1265
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,830
[Anne] Didn't think you had the capacity
for sentimentality.

1266
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:09,917
I didn't think so either...

1267
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:13,128
but so much is surprising me lately.

1268
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,973
I started looking over some of the many,
many, many letters you've written me.

1269
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,969
"I long for your embrace.

1270
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,439
I long for the heat from your naked body
on mine."

1271
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,187
It's very intense, very explicit.

1272
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,654
I thought I'd misplaced some of them
the other day. It was quite a fright.

1273
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,157
What if, say, that son of a bitch,
Jonathan Swift, got his hands on them?

1274
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:36,485
In his newspaper the next day.

1275
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,162
You would be ruined.

1276
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,283
You would never.

1277
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:43,872
You have no idea what I would do
for my country...

1278
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,790
and for you.

1279
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:49,131
Ruin me? You would do that?

1280
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,924
I will use these letters,

1281
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:54,129
unless you announce the tax rise,
change the cabinet as I wish,

1282
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:55,678
and get rid of Abigail.

1283
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,090
[classical music playing]

1284
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,288
Do you not wish to know what I've decided?

1285
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,957
I wish to know that you are happy,

1286
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:27,206
and that your spirit will lighten
once this is done.

1287
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,345
[music continues]

1288
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:25,264
[door opens]

1289
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,766
The queen requests the return of your key.

1290
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:34,107
You will return it and vacate court today.

1291
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,066
Where is she?

1292
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,818
[courtier] You will hand over the key.

1293
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,651
The queen will not grant you an audience.

1294
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:55,003
[door closes]

1295
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,840
[music fades]

1296
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,088
[knocking on door]

1297
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:02,756
[Sarah] Anne?

1298
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,766
I handed over my key.

1299
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,892
Mrs. Morley, you are angry, I know.

1300
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:14,935
I am sorry.

1301
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,608
I went quite mad for a moment.

1302
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:18,860
Just open the door.

1303
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,283
- Please, just... Could you just...
-[knocking]

1304
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,032
Mrs. Morley, open the door.

1305
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,174
I burned the letters. I burned them.

1306
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,346
Oh, do what you will.

1307
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,828
[Sarah] But I will not come back.

1308
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,123
Do you understand?

1309
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:16,914
I will go and be gone.

1310
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,295
Abigail has done this.

1311
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,298
She does not love you.

1312
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:28,975
[Anne] Because how could anyone?

1313
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,269
She wants nothing from me, unlike you.

1314
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,893
[Sarah] She wants nothing from you,

1315
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:38,227
and yet somehow she is a lady,
with 2,000 a year,

1316
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,358
and Harley sits on your knee most nights.

1317
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,189
I wish you could love me as she does.

1318
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,029
[Sarah] You wish me to lie to you?

1319
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:47,327
Oh.

1320
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:51,661
â€œYou look like a-- a-- an angel
fell from heaven, Your Majesty."

1321
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,458
No.

1322
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:56,040
Sometimes, you look like a badger.

1323
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,747
- And you can rely on me to tell you.
- Why?

1324
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,379
Because I will not lie! That is love!

1325
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,107
[Anne] I have my duties to attend to.

1326
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,523
[footsteps]

1327
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:51,133
I haveâ€œ.

1328
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,894
I have, over the last several months,
been unhappy with the government.

1329
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,524
[indistinct chatter]

1330
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,982
Lord Godolphin has lost my confidence.

1331
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,744
Therefore, I am announcing
a new prime minister...

1332
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,822
will be Mr. Harley.

1333
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,202
Godolphin,

1334
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,541
I thank you for your service.

1335
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,959
We will sue for peace
with France immediately.

1336
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,964
I have spoken!

1337
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:28,420
All depart!

1338
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,427
[cheering, murmuring]

1339
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:42,393
Leave that. I like it.

1340
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:44,694
The mirrors stay, too.

1341
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,072
Oh, my God.
You actually think you have won.

1342
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:52,027
Haven't I?

1343
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:55,200
We were playing very different games.

1344
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,118
All I know is, your carriage awaits,

1345
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:01,920
and my maid is on her way up
with something called a pineapple.

1346
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,740
[driver] Go?

1347
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:43,503
Go.

1348
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,805
[classical music playing]

1349
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:05,851
Do it again!

1350
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:08,445
[cheering]

1351
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,010
[music continues]

1352
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,359
-[door opens]
{Abigail giggles]

1353
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:04,834
I'm here.

1354
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,751
Will you do my legs, please?

1355
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:14,882
Of course.

1356
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,054
Hot towels, now.

1357
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:24,388
Are you drunk?

1358
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:26,473
I've had wine.

1359
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,396
Very good wine.

1360
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:32,192
You should have some.
I'll get you some. It would ease you.

1361
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:33,112
No.

1362
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,570
I don't understand these papers.

1363
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,490
I'm feeling unwell.

1364
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:46,243
Excuse me a moment, please.

1365
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,126
[coughs]

1366
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,425
[music fades]

1367
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,055
Sorry. I am unwell.

1368
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:05,600
Why, lay down.
I'll call the doctor for you, my love.

1369
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,147
[Abigail sighs] Thank you, thank you.

1370
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:10,396
[bell rings]

1371
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:13,311
[Anne] Doctor.

1372
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,003
[Sarah] What goes on?

1373
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:35,879
[Godolphin] They've brokered a peace
with the French,

1374
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,756
giving up too much, of course.

1375
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:38,757
Of course.

1376
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:40,885
Marlborough returns in a week.

1377
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,716
Harley will move to have him replaced.

1378
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,972
Now that peace with France
has been made...

1379
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,302
[crowd cheers]

1380
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,889
[Harley] Marlborough's return back
to England is imminent.

1381
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:49,973
I wonder, Your Majesty,

1382
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,434
whether it is right
that he is left as head of our forces?

1383
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:56,192
I will rip his mole from his face.
You must stop it, Godolphin.

1384
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:58,694
He is a hero who won the peace for us.

1385
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,946
Indeed, but he would have launched us
into a bloody war

1386
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:02,619
that would have ruined us,
so there's that.

1387
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:05,493
It would be easier to pull my strings
if you were back at court.

1388
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:08,200
A new era of peace and prosperity,
a new day,

1389
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,080
a door to a new future.

1390
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:11,252
There's metaphors abound.

1391
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,922
I'm tired. I will think on it.

1392
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:14,998
Thank you, all.

1393
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:19,919
[Godolphin] Obviously, you have chosen

1394
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:21,971
to keep the particulars of your dismissal
from me.

1395
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:25,346
I shall leave a gap in the conversation
for you to remedy that.

1396
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:35,568
I do not know of women and their feelings,

1397
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:38,647
but I know they nurse their hurts
like wailing newborns.

1398
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:43,027
Godolphin, I feel a surge of desire
to see your nose broken.

1399
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,030
Your point?

1400
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:48,118
Your Majesty, may I broach
the matter of Lady Marlborough?

1401
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,199
No, you may not.

1402
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,877
[Godolphin] A breach in a dear friendship.
Surely this could be healed.

1403
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:54,921
Some wounds do not close.

1404
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:56,923
I have many such.

1405
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:58,249
One just walks around with them,

1406
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:01,336
and sometimes one can feel them
filling with blood.

1407
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,591
A letter.

1408
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:05,765
An apology of some sort
that facilitates your return.

1409
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:07,809
There are limits to what one can give.

1410
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:11,187
Perhaps she could write you,
and we could attempt to repair

1411
01:41:11,274 --> 01:41:13,436
at least one wound in our queen?

1412
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:18,732
Cannot stop her.

1413
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,278
I imagine it'd be pointless,
and I would dash the letter into the fire,

1414
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,029
but I cannot stop her.

1415
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:26,824
[classical music playing]

1416
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,952
â€œYou... cunt."

1417
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,048
â€œMy God,

1418
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:41,175
I miss you.â€œ

1419
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,010
Are you sure this is all of the mail?

1420
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,140
[Abigail] You seek something?

1421
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,515
No, I...

1422
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,193
A fabric piece from my cousin in Florence.

1423
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,440
I'm sure it will come.

1424
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:05,651
â€œL dreamt I stabbed you

1425
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:08,487
in the eye."

1426
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:12,198
[music continues]

1427
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:14,918
This cannot be all of it.

1428
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:16,369
- It is, ma'am.
- Don't lean at me!

1429
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:19,673
Shall we request another fabric piece
from your cousin in Florence?

1430
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:22,842
Perhaps it was lost or eaten by mice
on the long journey.

1431
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,420
No, I just want to know
that all my mail is here.

1432
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:27,630
[Abigail] Of course.
Footman, go and check again.

1433
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:28,923
Immediately.

1434
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:30,925
Incompetent.

1435
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,566
â€œMy dearest...

1436
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:46,153
Mrs. Morley...

1437
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:50,953
I..."

1438
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:57,702
[music ends]

1439
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,345
I am in a quandary...

1440
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,559
and you are my dearest one.

1441
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,601
I do not know whether to speak of it.

1442
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:22,686
What is it?

1443
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,190
I'm not sure.

1444
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,271
I don't like this.

1445
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:27,152
You'll lodge this unknowable thing
in my brain,

1446
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:29,655
and it will eat me
with horrible possibilities.

1447
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:31,865
[Abigail] It is not horrible, dear Anne.

1448
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:33,742
It is just money.

1449
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:35,540
Money?

1450
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:38,793
I have found in the books...

1451
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:42,209
large sums of money seem to have flowed
to Marlborough,

1452
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,132
but are not reflected
in the forces' receipts of expenses.

1453
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:46,050
What?

1454
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:48,211
[Abigail] It is gone.

1455
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:51,176
Shall I request it back on his return?

1456
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,679
Quietly, perhaps?

1457
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,261
Are you saying that Sarah
diverted money to him?

1458
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:57,762
[Abigail] It does seem so.

1459
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,139
Some 7,000.

1460
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:02,225
[Anne] She would not.

1461
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,770
- It is just--
- She would not.

1462
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:12,861
I'm, of course, perhaps mistaken
in the bookkeeping.

1463
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:19,000
Sometimes all these numbers are dizzying,
and they're as fickle as humans.

1464
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:21,703
They often do add up
on the second or third attempt.

1465
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:24,710
There's a simple explanation
I'm not seeing.

1466
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:27,504
We shall banish it from our minds.

1467
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:32,426
Shall we take the children for a walk
in the garden?

1468
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:38,894
No, thank you. I need to rest.

1469
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:41,893
You may leave.

1470
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:56,871
Fuck!

1471
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,075
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1472
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:03,665
Fuck!

1473
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:08,883
[door opens]

1474
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,598
I need to put it back.

1475
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:30,772
Be gone.

1476
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,659
[door closes]

1477
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,508
Marlborough is at Southampton.
We need a decision.

1478
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:42,761
-[Godolphin] Your Majesty, if I may--
- There was very little mail today.

1479
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:46,598
[Harley] Quite. If I may,
the situation with Marlborough?

1480
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,225
He is stealing from me.

1481
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,151
[Godolphin] What?

1482
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:53,688
Your Majesty, that is preposterous.

1483
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:55,113
Lady Abigail, privy purse,

1484
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,864
is it not true they have stolen from me?
Damaged us?

1485
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:01,162
Yes.

1486
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,542
It is all there in black and white.

1487
01:47:07,338 --> 01:47:08,920
She must be ruined,

1488
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,080
banished from their beloved England.

1489
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,461
They are not loyal.

1490
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,134
They would hurt us, our country,
the queen.

1491
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:18,547
- Your Majesty, if I may--
- No, you may not!

1492
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,177
He will be charged. They will be banished.

1493
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:21,928
I have spoken. Get out!

1494
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,960
Ah, the mail is here.

1495
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:04,679
I suddenly feel so tired of England,
my darling.

1496
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,935
Perhaps we should go somewhere else.

1497
01:48:26,834 --> 01:48:27,665
[sighs]

1498
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:50,183
[rabbit squeals]

1499
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,190
[rabbit squeals]

[piano melody starts]

1501
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:19,209
- [thud]
-[Anne grunts]

1502
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:21,218
[Abigail] Anne?

1503
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:26,299
Darling Anne?

1504
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:29,059
Let's get you in a chair.

1505
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:31,353
How dare you touch the queen like that!

1506
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,395
-[Abigail] I'm sorry.
- I did not ask you to speak.

1507
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:41,652
[panting]

1508
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:44,233
Rub my leg.

1509
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,422
[melody builds]

1510
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,402
- You should lie down.
- You shall speak when asked to.

1511
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:30,203
[panting]

1512
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:33,366
I feel dizzy.

1513
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,252
I need to hold on to something.

1514
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:48,343
[Anne panting]

1515
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,391
[melody builds]

1516
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,822
[melody distorts]

1517
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:17,113
[melody fades]

1518
01:53:30,971 --> 01:53:34,305
[harpsichord playing]

1519
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,145
[man] â™ª Turn me loose â™ª

1520
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:49,565
â™ª From your hands â™ª

1521
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:53,115
â™ª Let me fly â™ª

1522
01:53:53,201 --> 01:53:55,818
â™ª To distant lands â™ª

1523
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,451
â™ª Over green fields â™ª

1524
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:02,704
â™ª Trees and mountains â™ª

1525
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,953
â™ª Flowers â™ª

1526
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:10,383
â™ª And forest fountains â™ª

1527
01:54:10,469 --> 01:54:12,961
â™ª Home along the lanes â™ª

1528
01:54:13,055 --> 01:54:15,717
â™ª Of the skyway â™ª

1529
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:18,970
â™ª For this dark â™ª

1530
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,224
â™ª And lonely room â™ª

1531
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:26,228
â™ª Projects a shadow â™ª

1532
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:28,730
â™ª Cast in gloom â™ª

1533
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,983
â™ª And my eyes are mirrors â™ª

1534
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:35,233
â™ª Of the world outside â™ª

1535
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:38,489
â™ª Thinking of the way â™ª

1536
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,743
â™ª That the wind can turn the tide â™ª

1537
01:54:42,584 --> 01:54:44,996
â™ª And these shadows turn â™ª

1538
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:48,250
â™ª From purple into gray â™ª

1539
01:54:48,757 --> 01:54:51,499
â™ª For just a skyline pigeon â™ª

1540
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:53,334
â™ª Dreaming of the open â™ª

1541
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,715
â™ª Waiting for the day â™ª

1542
01:54:55,806 --> 01:54:57,922
â™ª That he can spread his wings â™ª

1543
01:54:58,016 --> 01:55:01,805
â™ª And fly away again â™ª

1544
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,804
â™ª Fly away â™ª

1545
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,515
â™ª Skyline pigeon, fly â™ª

01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:10,271
â™ª Towards the dreams â™ª

â™ª You've left so very far behind â™ª

1548
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:17,984
â™ª Fly away â™ª

01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:21,662
â™ª Skyline pigeon, fly â™ª

1550
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:23,455
â™ª Towards the dreams â™ª

1551
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:27,877
â™ª You've left so very far behind â™ª

1552
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:32,749
â™ª Just let me wake up in the morning â™ª

1553
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:35,426
â™ª To the smell of new-mown hay â™ª

1554
01:55:35,512 --> 01:55:37,503
<i>â™ª To laugh and cry â™ª</i>

1555
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:39,087
â™ª To live and die â™ª

1556
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:42,516
â™ª In the brightness of my day â™ª

1557
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:45,139
â™ª I want to hear the pealing bells â™ª

1558
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,393
â™ª Of distant churches sing â™ª

1559
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,975
â™ª But most of all, please free me â™ª

1560
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:55,028
â™ª From this aching metal ring â™ª

1561
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:58,574
â™ª And open out this cage â™ª

1562
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,901
â™ª Towards the sun â™ª

1563
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:04,242
â™ª For just this skyline pigeon â™ª

â™ª He can spread his wings â™ª

â™ª You've left so very far behind â™ª
