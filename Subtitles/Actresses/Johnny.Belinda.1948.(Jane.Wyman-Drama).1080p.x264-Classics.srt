1
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,329
<i>The island of Cape Breton,
the northeastern end of Nova Scotia...</i>

2
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:17,771
<i>is just a small chunk of land
sticking out into the Atlantic.</i>

3
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,105
<i>Roads haven't been built through
everywhere yet.</i>

4
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:22,543
<i>You mostly have to come in from the sea.</i>

5
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,774
<i>It needs an old hand to navigate
through the shoals offshore...</i>

6
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:29,546
<i>especially during the storms that come up
suddenly in the summertime...</i>

7
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:32,486
<i>and the little lighthouse
has saved many a life.</i>

8
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,547
<i>The village isn't much to shout about.</i>

9
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:38,116
<i>Just a quiet, peaceful place where
the people are proud of their church...</i>

10
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:42,131
<i>built with their own hands and what
little money they could scrape up.</i>

11
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:43,996
<i>Their farms don't bring in much...</i>

12
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,558
<i>but for a few months each year
when the cod are running...</i>

13
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:48,194
<i>there's a lot of excitement.</i>

14
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:51,399
<i>You should see the harbor then,
alive with boats.</i>

15
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:54,500
<i>They leave the women to take care
of the potatoes and livestock...</i>

16
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,170
<i>and put out to sea.</i>

17
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,874
<i>Not many of them are lucky enough
to have their own boat...</i>

18
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,383
<i>but they all get a share
when the catch is paid for at the cannery.</i>

19
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:06,547
<i>A fair-sized haul means everything.
It means food for the long winter...</i>

20
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:09,558
<i>new blades for tools,
grain bought for cattle.</i>

21
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,094
<i>That's why we watch each vessel
as she comes in...</i>

22
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:14,096
<i>to see how low she sets in the water.</i>

23
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:18,157
Floyd, come on back here
and give us a hand with these fish.

24
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:22,069
Fergus, tack in on that line.
Help get this catch ashore.

25
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:25,174
Get that unloading net aboard.

26
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:28,234
- How many drags did you make?
- Two, three hours.

27
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,509
Take it away.

28
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:47,526
Get that boom over.

29
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,403
Don't tie it off, get it back onboard.

30
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,372
I don't want to hang around all day
on this reeking wharf.

31
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,206
- Look out!
- Hook's in his shoulder.

32
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:03,703
Hey, Dan'l!

33
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,873
- Do you know where the doctor is?
- Sure, he's dead.

34
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,976
No, the new doctor. Same place. Get.
Hurry up, bring him back, quick.

35
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:13,750
Come on, get going before this load
starts stinking the place up.

36
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:26,928
Yes?

37
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,632
I got to get the doctor.
Tim's been hurt down at the boat.

38
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,002
What is it, Stella?

39
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:34,737
There's a boy out here says a man's
been hurt down at the wharf.

40
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,108
I'll be right there.

41
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,823
Will you be giving me
some medicine, doctor?

42
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,679
No, Mrs. Poggety, just this diet list.

43
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,460
I think you'd better
have your teeth X-rayed.

44
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:44,010
- Oh, but Dr. Peterson always said--
- I'm not Dr. Peterson.

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,021
But what do my teeth to do
with my backache?

46
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,286
Well, it's taken medicine a good
many years to define that connection...

47
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:52,590
and I haven't time, unfortunately,
right now to explain it all to you.

48
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,688
Stella will take care of your things.

49
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,357
- Will you be back to supper?
- I don't know.

50
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,338
- When can I go back to work?
- No time at all.

51
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:13,541
The main thing is to see
there's no infection.

52
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,110
Would you like to put his coat on?

53
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:23,319
I'll take him in the buggy.

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,006
Hello, darling.

55
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:41,374
Hey, Locky. Going to the dance Saturday?

56
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:45,504
- Why? Your Gus going out with the fleet?
- I'll be on the wharf tonight.

57
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,742
Well, don't catch cold.

58
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,475
- So long, girls.
- Bye, Locky.

59
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:58,026
I looked for you, McCormick.

60
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,359
One half the fish you land yesterday
are undersize like little sardines.

61
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:05,059
Well, at 14 cents a pound I can't be
bothered sorting them. I'd starve to death.

62
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,206
If the buyer see them
he will not take them from me.

63
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:09,567
Well, boost your price
and I'll toss back the little ones.

64
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,982
And while we're talking about it...

65
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,907
- you miserable old skinflint...
- What's that?

66
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,685
Don't get your hackles up,
you Micmac Indian...

67
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:15,938
not with that tub of guts.

68
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:18,275
- Micmac?
- Micmac! You'd not last two rounds.

69
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,576
It's about time
somebody took you down a peg.

70
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,241
You sell our catch for fancy prices...

71
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,910
yet you knock down 12 cents the pound
on us farmers.

72
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,420
You do not like that?

73
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,956
Well now, you listen to me,
Mr. Locky McCormick...

74
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,788
you owe big bill in my store.
You know that.

75
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,794
Well, you pay or I take your stinky boat.

76
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,262
Why, you greasy old half-breed.

77
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:39,801
You try and take that boat
and I'll gut you out like a cod.

78
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,584
You keep your hands to yourself.

79
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,893
Pretty tony since you're working
for His Lordship, huh?

80
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:12,399
You mind your own business.
I've got to get supper ready.

81
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,732
I don't like to see you
working for this man, Stella.

82
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:17,329
He's a fine doctor. He's a...

83
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:21,770
Anyway he's something big.
Something even you can't pronounce.

84
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,744
Probably something not fit to mention.

85
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:26,077
What're you working your head off for,
anyhow?

86
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,187
What good's a dead uncle
if you don't use his money?

87
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,410
No hurry.

88
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:32,750
Plenty can happen between now
and the time the deeds will be signed.

89
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:37,259
You going to try to run it yourself?
That's a good farm, needs a man.

90
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,585
- We could make a lot out of that place.
- We?

91
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:43,530
Sure, I've been thinking things over.
You and me make a great pair.

92
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:45,600
We ought to get married,
the sooner, the better.

93
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,603
Well, this is a surprise,
Mr. Locky McCormick.

94
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,299
Blow your nose, don't look so silly.

95
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,930
Oh, Stella...

96
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,872
what dress you wearing
to the dance Saturday? The one I like?

97
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:57,275
Maybe.

98
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,777
- You're taking me then?
- Well, of course I am.

99
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,784
Fergus put in for it first.
We practiced a step for the jig contest.

100
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:03,978
I'm taking you.

101
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:07,318
He and Floyd can toss a coin to see
who dances with you, but I'm taking you.

102
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:09,380
The doctor's coming.
You'd better get out of here.

103
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,119
He's in my way.

104
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:15,022
- You're coming down to the wharf later?
- Might.

105
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,699
Thank you.

106
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,601
- Is the doctor in?
- He's eating his supper.

107
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,905
I've got to see him. She's awful bad.

108
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,990
I'll tell him as soon as he's finished
but I can't--

109
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,346
Stella?

110
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,118
- What is it?
- It's only Aggie MacDonald from the mill.

111
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,531
Nobody has anything to do with them...

112
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,524
and it's never a penny of pay
you'll get from her.

113
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,389
Well, she said someone was sick,
didn't she?

114
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,793
I didn't like bothering you,
but she's having so much trouble.

115
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:25,094
- The pain's that strong.
- I'll get my bag.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,729
He didn't come at night last time.
It's 12 miles to the veterinary.

117
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:34,104
It's our cow,
she's the only good one we've got.

118
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:37,206
We'll fix her up.

119
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,935
He wouldn't have wanted me
to call you, Black wouldn't.

120
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,640
He'll say it costs money...

121
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:16,275
but if the critter dies,
then it's me who's to blame.

122
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,445
I'll do all I can to help.

123
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,091
In there.

124
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,769
Would you hold the light
a little higher, please?

125
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:57,156
She can't hear you. She's deaf, dumb.

126
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,949
That's too bad.

127
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:02,691
What she don't know don't hurt her none.

128
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,760
- By the way, it's a girl.
- Aye.

129
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:36,053
- Thanks for coming.
- Glad to help.

130
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:57,048
- Was she born deaf?
- No...

131
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,917
she took sick
when she was about a year old.

132
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,183
Come time to talk, no sound come out.

133
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,949
She growed up that way, dumb.

134
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,720
Blessing she has
such a fine father and mother.

135
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:09,730
That ain't her mother.

136
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:14,298
It's my sister, Aggie.
Her mother's dead. She killed her.

137
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:18,538
She died in childbed.

138
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:22,304
I guess sometimes it's meant to be.

139
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,641
Sometimes it's easier
to lose someone that way...

140
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,942
than to lose them when they're still alive.

141
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,043
I was in love with a girl.
She married another man.

142
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:34,556
I was wondering. A young chap like you,
burying himself here.

143
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,887
The other doctors was always old.

144
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,757
That was part of it.
There were lots of other things.

145
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,591
It's a pretty stale story.

146
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:44,564
Way things were going,
I sort of got fed up.

147
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:49,766
So I decided to look for another way.
Simple life, simple things.

148
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:52,829
If people would only learn
to let each other live...

149
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:56,000
it would be a different world.
What's the fee?

150
00:11:57,144 --> 00:12:00,478
I wouldn't know.
I never delivered a heifer before.

151
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:05,081
I might take it out
in fishing in that pool of yours.

152
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,417
Looks like a wonderful place for trout.

153
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,786
- You're welcome anytime.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,207
Good morning, Stella.

155
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,945
I was early so I stopped in
to tidy up a bit. The dishes...

156
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,612
Please don't bother.

157
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:43,054
- Are you going out?
- For a little while.

158
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,681
That's a nice dress. New, isn't it?

159
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,386
- I made it myself. I make all my own--
- Very pretty.

160
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,494
I'll see you tomorrow.
We may have fish for dinner.

161
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,374
I like fish.
I've got the most wonderful way of--

162
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:52,957
No guarantees.

163
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,253
Look, Mrs. Lutz, the new doctor.

164
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,853
He hasn't been to church once
in three whole months.

165
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,398
Nice example.

166
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:28,558
He's a fine doctor. What he did for my Tim.

167
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:32,203
She's always talking about,
"He's a fine doctor..."

168
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,935
just because he put a bandage on a cut.

169
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:37,766
Hello?

170
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:19,305
Here, let me help you. Hello.

171
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,339
Now, where do they go?

172
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,872
Oh, the chickens.

173
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,995
Don't be afraid.

174
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,438
You watch me talk.

175
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,446
That is a...

176
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,018
rooster.

177
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,290
And these are...

178
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,524
hens.

179
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:29,609
Very good.

180
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:38,480
That's a tree.

181
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,786
Tree.

182
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:51,090
Yes.

183
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:57,764
Water.

184
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:11,409
Very good. Now if you give...

185
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:14,920
water to the tree...

186
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:18,151
it will grow.

187
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,524
Water to the tree, it will grow.

188
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,172
Yes, it will grow. The tree will grow.

189
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,974
It has very big roots. The roots go...

190
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:43,947
deep into the earth.

191
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,176
Earth.

192
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:58,198
And all of it together...

193
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,867
is land.

194
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:08,635
Land.

195
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,748
Good. Earth.

196
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:44,838
Eggs.

197
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,743
Four of them. Four.

198
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,353
No. One, two, three, four.

199
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,025
Four.

200
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,808
You're right. You're learning very fast.

201
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:20,475
Pretty soon you and I will be able to talk.

202
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:24,644
Talk. Right.

203
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,425
What're you trying to do, McCormick,
shake the clapper out of the bell?

204
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,561
- Where's my flour, Mac?
- Ain't it ready?

205
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,763
I can't see it.

206
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,102
The Dummy should be here to serve you.

207
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:01,348
She ain't done it.

208
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:04,623
I put it down for her.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

209
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,990
Where can I get a team weekdays?
I'll have to wait till Saturday.

210
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,171
But if it ain't done then,
I'm going somewheres else.

211
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,926
It'll be ready. I'll make her remember.

212
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,259
How can you expect a dimwit
to use her head?

213
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,279
What's all this? What is it?

214
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,476
Water, ocean.

215
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,146
Ocean.

216
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:41,384
What's got into you?
I write it all down for you.

217
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:44,622
Here, it's as plain as the nose
on your face.

218
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,498
Oh. Well, I guess I forgot.

219
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:53,000
Look.

220
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:02,243
Well, I was wondering.
She never makes a mistake.

221
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,883
Did you ever think
of sending her to school?

222
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:07,145
School?

223
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:10,314
She's deaf and dumb, man.
There's no teaching her nothing.

224
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:15,054
Here's the extent of her learning.
I make a sign at the top of each page.

225
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:18,362
A cross for Pacquet,
a circle for McCormick...

226
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,899
two lines for the McQuiggens and so on.

227
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,831
A mark for each bag.

228
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:27,002
I put them down when they come in,
she strikes them off when they're ready.

229
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:30,107
She's learned to identify every man
by his mark.

230
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:34,035
Must be over 40 names in this book
and she knows every one of them.

231
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:38,379
So that shows, Mr. MacDonald,
that your daughter is an intelligent girl.

232
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,919
Now, there's a special school
for the deaf at McGill.

233
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,851
Schools cost money...

234
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:46,118
and money don't grow on trees
in this country.

235
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:50,288
We're lucky to keep body
and soul together, we farmers.

236
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:53,294
I couldn't spare her. Thanks.

237
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:56,264
There's work enough around here as it is.

238
00:22:56,368 --> 00:23:00,135
But she could be taught, I'm sure of it.
What's her name?

239
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:03,305
Me wife wanted her named after herself...

240
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:06,203
Belinda. Belinda MacDonald.

241
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,913
But they call her the Dummy around here.

242
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,144
They shouldn't.

243
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:14,811
Even though she can't hear,
these people have very keen perceptions.

244
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,115
- Aye.
- They notice things.

245
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:19,157
Come to think of it, she's fond of colors.

246
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:23,992
I took her to church once years ago.
They played the organ.

247
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,555
A look come over her face
as though she heard.

248
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:30,397
I knew all the time
she couldn't hear a thing.

249
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,803
Well, I'm losing time.
I must get on with my work.

250
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,070
Good day to you.

251
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,133
Would you mind if I talked to her
once in a while?

252
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:39,438
Talk?

253
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:43,676
When I was an intern at the hospital
I worked for a while with deaf children.

254
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:47,116
Why, I might even have one of the books
still kicking around somewhere.

255
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:49,245
I'd like to try
to teach her some lip-reading.

256
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:51,790
You'll be wasting your while, man.

257
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,457
But you're welcome here anytime.

258
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:32,794
- $1.80, Mrs. Lutz.
- Did you get the oilcloth?

259
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:35,857
No, but I will save it for you
when it comes in. Thank you.

260
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,230
Bye.

261
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,464
There's the doctor again.

262
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,671
Talking to himself.

263
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:48,809
- It's spooky.
- I think he's queer in the head.

264
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,408
Pretty smart
when it comes to making out his bills.

265
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,828
Hello. Happen to know what kind
of tobacco Black MacDonald uses?

266
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,863
MacDonald has not bought here in weeks.

267
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,732
Dr. Richardson, I receive your bill.
Rather steep for a stomachache, yes?

268
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:13,434
As far as I remember, it was three calls.
Two of them after midnight.

269
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:17,441
Dr. Peterson always took his fees out
in barter, like everyone else.

270
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:19,534
Mr. Pacquet,
I have to get cash somewhere.

271
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:22,410
You and a few others
are the only ones who can afford it.

272
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:25,882
You wouldn't have to pay me any bills
if you'd stick to that diet I gave you.

273
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:29,183
The only trouble with you is
you eat too well.

274
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:32,349
Now, I'll have this. See, 15, isn't it?

275
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:36,891
Or would you rather wait
and have me take out a splinter?

276
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:13,921
Get your filthy bug out of my dough.

277
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:17,730
The spuds is covered with them.
I can't pick everyone off single-handed.

278
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:21,897
And milk, and plow,
and blast stones without any help.

279
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:25,465
- Don't blame me.
- I'm not blaming you, I'm only telling you.

280
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:27,670
I suppose you want me to pull the plow.

281
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,011
I suppose I'm not doing my share, cooking,
and mending, and baking, and spinning.

282
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,642
- Who helps me?
- You got the Dummy.

283
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:36,744
A fine lot of help, that one.

284
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,916
All the grand ideas that doctor
has been putting into her head.

285
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:43,483
Filling her up with fancy notions.

286
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:47,927
You know what she was doing
instead of feeding the hogs?

287
00:26:47,998 --> 00:26:49,796
Brushing her hair.

288
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:53,768
That's not fair to me.
I'm doing the work of six.

289
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:57,933
What's this I hear about you
loafing all day? There's work to do.

290
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:15,517
Aggie, did you see that?
She knew what I was saying.

291
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:16,821
Oh, tosh.

292
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:19,955
She can hear. Belinda, come here!

293
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:25,368
- I tell you she understands, woman.
- You're wandering in your head.

294
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:29,673
- But she came when I called her.
- She was reading your lips.

295
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:32,239
She's been a very good pupil.

296
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,314
Belinda, how do you say hello to a friend?

297
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:40,807
That's right.

298
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:44,811
"I am happy to see you."

299
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:47,055
And I'm happy to see you.

300
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:49,991
- Telling me she can talk that way?
- Of course.

301
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,996
We've been studying
from a book of signs...

302
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:56,158
which were devised by a Frenchman
a couple of hundred years ago...

303
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:58,600
the Abbe de L'Epee,
he was a priest.

304
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:02,764
See, each word has its own sign.
For instance, there's "man."

305
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,908
The sign is this: touching the hat brim.

306
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,913
- And what would "woman" be?
- This. Comes from a bonnet string.

307
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:15,009
And that's "mother."
Baby. You see, woman with a child.

308
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,953
It's beyond believing.
It's as clear as day.

309
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:20,385
And that is the sign for "day."

310
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:24,690
You see, this represents the horizon and
this is the sun coming up over the horizon.

311
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:27,561
This is noon
with the sun directly overhead.

312
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:32,399
Afternoon, evening, and night
when the sun has disappeared completely.

313
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:34,371
Good morning.

314
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,468
Good night.

315
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:40,805
And that's "bread."

316
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:49,951
What is it? It's a butterfly. Sure.

317
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:55,286
It is a butterfly. It flutters.

318
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,255
Aggie!

319
00:28:58,262 --> 00:28:59,924
Aggie, come here.

320
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,295
- I got something.
- What?

321
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:04,630
Look sharp now. Think fast.
What does this mean?

322
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:08,261
- It means you've gone loony.
- It's a butterfly. Look.

323
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,933
Don't go waving your hands at me,
I'm not the Dummy.

324
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:13,978
And if you want to have any bread to eat
while I'm gone, leave me be.

325
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:16,104
It's a good job you're going.

326
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,740
We'll have peace around here
for a couple of days.

327
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,513
It's like a miracle.

328
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:34,290
- Would she be saying "father"?
- Yes, she did.

329
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:37,331
It's the first time
she ever called me that.

330
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,838
Daughter, my daughter.

331
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,277
What do they want?

332
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,799
What's going on here, McCormick?

333
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:11,358
Where's my flour?
McQuiggens wants theirs, too.

334
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:12,492
It's all done.

335
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:15,038
We'd better load it
before we get too dizzy from dancing.

336
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:18,041
It's there on the racks.
Load it and get out.

337
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:20,475
Here it is, boys. Get to it!

338
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:25,678
All these are mine.
Put them on the bottom.

339
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,183
Yes, Lock.

340
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:31,754
- Afraid you'll crack a fingernail?
- Flour don't go good on my suit.

341
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:37,761
This floor's slick as a whistle.
Hey, Hector, come on. Give us a tune.

342
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,076
Hi, Stella, you're looking very handsome.

343
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,744
You like to dance.
Why don't you come with us?

344
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:37,811
- Yes.
- It'll be fun. Basket supper.

345
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:43,289
I'd love to. Unfortunately,
I have a previous engagement.

346
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:45,953
Two measles cases five miles apart.

347
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,618
Hey, the Dummy's dancing.

348
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:57,192
- Her name's Belinda.
- She looks kind of cute fixed up that way.

349
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:16,380
You keep away from that Dummy.

350
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:18,750
Keep away... The Dummy and me?

351
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:20,254
I saw you taking in her legs.

352
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:23,724
Jealous of a dimwit.
I'm plum ashamed of you, woman!

353
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,896
One thing, she'd never tell on you.

354
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:36,003
- But keep away from her or I'll be able--
- Well, I guess that's all.

355
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:37,763
What are we waiting for?

356
00:33:57,793 --> 00:34:00,126
I want some cider. Come on, hurry up.

357
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:01,924
Locky!

358
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,869
- What's the damage, Mac?
- You know what it is.

359
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,077
Locky, come on.

360
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,585
Everybody, sing. Everybody, sing now.

361
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,696
Didn't have time to finish them.
I can't do 10 things at once.

362
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:40,032
It's not my fault if my sister got sick.

363
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:43,739
Well, I'll only be gone a few days.
You can manage.

364
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:47,570
- Aggie!
- I'm coming.

365
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:49,441
Well, goodbye, Belinda.

366
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:55,078
Sometimes a body'd almost think
you understood.

367
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:21,807
You'll miss the train.

368
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:25,680
Besides, I don't want to leave Belinda
alone too long.

369
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:28,273
Nobody would bother stealing her.

370
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:54,868
There's Mrs. Johnny John-John
just back from hospital.

371
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:58,505
She looks right spry for a woman
who's just had her arteries cut out.

372
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,845
Not her arteries, Mrs. Lutz.

373
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,352
Get off my feet. You're drunk.

374
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,962
Mrs. Moore is her own worst enemy.

375
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:25,303
Not while I'm alive, she isn't.

376
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,764
Hello, Dummy.

377
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:02,166
Look what I brought you.

378
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,005
Want to dance?

379
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:34,702
First time a man kissed you, wasn't it?

380
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,047
Don't be scared, Dummy.
Your heart's pounding.

381
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:49,512
I caught a sea gull once,
it had the same scared look.

382
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,409
Hello, Mac.

383
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:53,007
Glad you're here. You've been missed.

384
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:55,278
Well, I'm sorry. I was busy with my call.

385
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:58,081
I've been worried about the girl.
There's something wrong.

386
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,588
- Why?
- You can see for yourself.

387
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:02,255
All right.

388
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:11,431
Hello, Aggie. You get back all right?

389
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,525
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't, would I?

390
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:15,798
- Is your sister better?
- Yes.

391
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:20,299
- Did she have a good doctor?
- Didn't have any. Doesn't believe in them.

392
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:23,739
Well, that's the right attitude
as long as one can afford it.

393
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:25,370
How's Belinda?

394
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:27,774
Getting peevisher by the day.

395
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:30,716
- Where is she?
- Around here somewhere.

396
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:02,442
Belinda. How are you?

397
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:11,918
Are you cross with me
for not coming to see you?

398
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:16,827
Well, you see, I couldn't.

399
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,931
Many men and women
suddenly decided to be sick...

400
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:26,002
at the same time.

401
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:34,277
Would you like to study your lesson now?

402
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,151
All right, no lesson.

403
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:49,630
Belinda, if you could only hear me.

404
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:53,330
You think I don't know what it means
being lonely like you are?

405
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:56,394
I've been lonely myself,
even when I was a child.

406
00:41:56,671 --> 00:41:59,072
Already then I wanted to be a doctor.

407
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:03,235
I thought that helping others
might help me. It did somehow.

408
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:09,376
Then all those other things happened.
The war and all that came after.

409
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:13,046
Made me lose faith in everything.

410
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:15,881
In myself, too.

411
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,556
Belinda.

412
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:26,528
Belinda, you must help me.

413
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:28,767
I need you.

414
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:38,342
Yes. I need you.

415
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,381
If you only knew what it meant
seeing you smile for the first time.

416
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:48,079
Bringing happiness, if it's only
to one single human being, is...

417
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:52,085
Belinda, don't let me think
I've failed again.

418
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,966
You'll help me.

419
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:07,468
Mac. Mac, come here.

420
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:10,977
Mac, Belinda's great trouble
is nothing more than loneliness.

421
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:13,047
And she's got to have a chance.

422
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:15,242
Now, there's a doctor in Stepney,
I met him at McGill.

423
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:16,579
A brilliant diagnostician.

424
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:18,415
I don't know exactly what good
it would do...

425
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:21,786
but I'd like to take Belinda to him.
Belinda...

426
00:43:22,657 --> 00:43:26,594
how would you like to go with me
to see a town?

427
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,253
T- O-W-N.

428
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:31,130
A big town.

429
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:46,279
You've done such wonders
with her yourself.

430
00:43:46,347 --> 00:43:47,947
Why does she have to go see that fellow?

431
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:51,180
Because, Mac, I don't know enough
and I think he does.

432
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:52,944
Doctor like that costs money.

433
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,115
Don't worry about that. I'm going to write
and ask him for an interview.

434
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,852
I'm sure he'll do it.

435
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,618
I'm going to write him tonight.

436
00:44:33,194 --> 00:44:35,527
No, Belinda, not women. Men.

437
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:37,804
Do you see any hope, Doctor?

438
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:40,904
Aye, that's why we keep on practicing,
Robert.

439
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:45,245
I understand your concern,
but she needn't worry.

440
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:48,048
The one fact I'm sure of
is there's no otosclerosis...

441
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:50,988
so as you know, it can't be hereditary.

442
00:47:51,724 --> 00:47:54,990
There's no possibility the expected child
could inherit it.

443
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:58,395
Clinically, the birth of the child
could make all the difference...

444
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:00,364
if my theory is correct.

445
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,265
I cannot say for certain, nobody can.

446
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:06,730
But what you've accomplished
is remarkable.

447
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:10,071
I'd hardly say that.
I just tried a few things I knew.

448
00:48:10,176 --> 00:48:12,577
You've always been an idealist
from way back.

449
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:15,274
Yeah, that's what makes good doctors,
Robert.

450
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:17,514
Keep in communication with me.

451
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:19,576
I'll be interested in following
the case with you.

452
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:22,278
- I'd be very grateful.
- Goodbye, lad.

453
00:48:50,783 --> 00:48:53,810
Dr. Gray said it wasn't possible
to determine her condition...

454
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,718
after only one examination.

455
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:58,121
He said she was very healthy,
very intelligent.

456
00:48:58,224 --> 00:48:59,635
And that he wanted to see her again.

457
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,128
Fine. Now maybe she'll have a chance.

458
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:05,655
She's worn out.
She slept nearly the whole way home.

459
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:09,932
Belinda, why don't you go upstairs to bed?

460
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:20,170
Good night, daughter.

461
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,489
She looks so grand in that dress.

462
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:44,194
Beats me why I never noticed it before.

463
00:49:47,607 --> 00:49:50,634
Do you think I could take her to church
come Sunday?

464
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:54,542
She's only been there the once,
when she was a child.

465
00:49:54,647 --> 00:49:56,206
Of course, why not?

466
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:59,183
Right now, how about taking the cows
to the barn?

467
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:01,220
I'm forgetting everything.

468
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:09,318
You're not very fond of Belinda, are you?

469
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:12,728
I've always been civil to her.

470
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,029
She's my brother's daughter.

471
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:18,502
You should see to it that she doesn't
have to carry those heavy sacks.

472
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:20,164
She's not too strong.

473
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:24,072
Doctor, you'll be doing
my brother and me a favor...

474
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:27,807
if you'll stop putting
those grand ideas into her head.

475
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,008
There were no complaints until you came.

476
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,643
She did her work like the rest of us...

477
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:35,314
like we all have to do if we want
to keep a roof over our heads.

478
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:39,150
I have to tell you, Aggie,
you're the only woman she knows...

479
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:42,059
and she'll be in need
of your sympathy and help.

480
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:45,393
- My help?
- Belinda's going to have a child.

481
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:54,564
Oh, no. No, it's not true.

482
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:56,539
There isn't any doubt.

483
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:00,540
When her father finds out, he'll kill her.

484
00:51:00,613 --> 00:51:02,548
That's why I told you.

485
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,411
She doesn't know.
Doesn't even realize it herself yet.

486
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:10,284
- But he must find out.
- I'll tell him, at the right moment.

487
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:14,126
Oh, it's...

488
00:51:14,427 --> 00:51:17,124
Do you have any idea who the man was?

489
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:20,124
No.

490
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,961
Don't let anything happen to her.

491
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:32,375
I've been pretty brusque with her.

492
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:35,443
You're making up for it now.

493
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:39,575
We MacDonalds, we're high-tempered.

494
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:44,921
We fight amongst ourselves...

495
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:48,388
but let trouble come from outside...

496
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:51,956
and we'll stick together.

497
00:54:03,796 --> 00:54:08,393
We will open our services by singing
the first verse of hymn number 73.

498
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:11,085
I'm requested to publish
the banns of marriage...

499
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:13,965
between Laughlin McCormick
of Carcadie...

500
00:55:14,032 --> 00:55:17,093
and Stella Maguire,
spinster of this parish.

501
00:55:18,536 --> 00:55:20,664
If any of you know
cause or just impediment...

502
00:55:20,772 --> 00:55:24,038
why these two persons should not
be joined together in holy matrimony...

503
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:26,008
ye are to declare it.

504
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:29,504
This is the first time of asking.

505
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:34,445
We will close our services
by singing hymn number 43.

506
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,785
You're the lucky one. Congratulations!

507
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:44,487
Mr. MacDonald, I'm so happy
to see you at our church again...

508
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:46,394
and Miss MacDonald.

509
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,632
I didn't know I could be so proud
of my own flesh and blood.

510
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:55,231
Did you see the way
they all turned and looked at her?

511
00:56:03,214 --> 00:56:05,979
Well, Stella, this is quite a surprise.

512
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:07,651
Thank you.

513
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:10,879
Well, good luck to you.

514
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:12,753
When's the wedding?

515
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:05,771
You mustn't forget your chores, girl.

516
00:57:22,994 --> 00:57:25,020
Have you lost your mind,
Black MacDonald?

517
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,189
What's the matter now?

518
00:57:26,297 --> 00:57:28,789
She's no mule! She can't stand all that.

519
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:32,929
What's got into you, woman?
I have to have this mash mixed, haven't I?

520
00:57:33,004 --> 00:57:34,495
She's done it ever since we had pigs.

521
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:37,269
Well, she won't do it anymore.
Now you leave her to me.

522
00:57:37,342 --> 00:57:38,674
Sit down.

523
00:57:39,177 --> 00:57:42,670
You're as white as a sheet.
I'll get you some water.

524
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:49,684
- Here.
- What's wrong with her?

525
00:57:49,788 --> 00:57:52,622
She's out of sorts.
The doctor told her to take it easy.

526
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:57,060
Look, I work from 4:00 in the morning
till dark. Year in, year out.

527
00:57:57,162 --> 00:58:01,065
What she has to do is no hardship.
Belinda's a healthy girl.

528
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,463
She's not.

529
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:05,634
Now you leave her to me
and to the doctor.

530
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:08,502
What do you make a mystery of it for?
She's my daughter.

531
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:10,493
I've a right to know
if there's anything serious.

532
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:13,706
Belinda's gonna have a... A child.

533
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,978
Oh, no.

534
00:58:17,649 --> 00:58:19,811
- It couldn't be.
- It's true.

535
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:23,681
That dirty, filthy doctor!

536
00:58:23,822 --> 00:58:25,688
No! No, you're wrong.

537
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:28,187
Who would it be then?

538
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:31,018
I don't know.

539
00:58:31,229 --> 00:58:32,993
- Tell me his name.
- Hold your temper.

540
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:36,000
Hold my temper?
What kind of a father do you think I am?

541
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,667
Listen, child, who was it that hurt you?

542
00:58:37,735 --> 00:58:39,101
How do you expect her to tell you?

543
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:40,815
She doesn't know
what you're talking about.

544
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:42,569
Keep out of this.

545
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,514
Show me. Show me the man's name.
Who was it? Who was it that hurt you?

546
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:52,073
She doesn't know! Leave her be.

547
00:58:52,183 --> 00:58:55,517
Don't be a fool, woman.
She's no babe in arms for all she's deaf.

548
00:58:55,587 --> 00:58:59,080
She's trying to shield the man.
Listen, child, show me.

549
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,590
Show me, I tell you.
Do I have to beat it out of you?

550
00:59:02,694 --> 00:59:03,923
Oh, no. No, don't!

551
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:05,573
Stop it!
You don't know what you're doing!

552
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:08,066
- Let go of me! I got to find the man!
- Come to your senses!

553
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:09,877
Even if she could talk,
she couldn't tell you.

554
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,045
You've no right to go on this way.

555
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:13,766
- No right? I'm her father.
- Then act like a father!

556
00:59:13,872 --> 00:59:16,467
Leave her be. I couldn't help it.

557
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:19,234
You're the one person that can give her
what she needs most:

558
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,972
help, comfort, and understanding.

559
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:24,072
What are you trying to do,
drive her insane?

560
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:28,715
- I couldn't help it. Hard to go on...
- Aggie, come on. Take her to her room.

561
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,389
- Have her get some rest.
- Yes.

562
00:59:34,726 --> 00:59:37,093
Now, Mac, you've got to listen to me.

563
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,187
I understand how you feel
and I don't blame you...

564
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:41,698
but believe me,
it's blotted out of her mind.

565
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:42,910
The way you forget a nightmare...

566
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:45,054
because you don't wanna bring back
that terrible fear.

567
00:59:45,136 --> 00:59:46,195
I've seen it in the war.

568
00:59:46,304 --> 00:59:48,796
It's nature throwing up a barrier
to prevent something worse.

569
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:50,501
I don't know what you're talking about.

570
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:52,848
- I've got to find the man.
- What good will that do her?

571
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:55,278
I'll lay what he done
before the men of the village.

572
00:59:55,346 --> 00:59:56,678
We'll show him what justice is.

573
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:58,875
And even if you do,
how will that help the girl?

574
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,679
Dragging her into a mess of scandal...

575
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:02,529
when she doesn't even know
what it's all about.

576
01:00:02,553 --> 01:00:05,648
- It'll crucify her. Is that what you want?
- You know it isn't.

577
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:09,984
What am I going to do? The shame of it.

578
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:13,998
Mac, you've got to think of her now,
not of yourself and your pride.

579
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:17,558
There's only one shame,
failing a human being who needs you.

580
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:25,143
I'm going up and talk to her now.

581
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,613
He didn't mean to hurt you.

582
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:07,745
He's just... Just very worried.

583
01:01:09,053 --> 01:01:13,013
That's what makes him
seem harsh and unjust sometimes.

584
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,555
He works so hard.

585
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:20,389
That's why he hasn't been able
to give you more time.

586
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,068
You've been alone so much, Belinda...

587
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:27,128
but you're not going to be alone anymore.

588
01:01:28,106 --> 01:01:30,598
You're going to be a mother.

589
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:46,613
Yes, Belinda.

590
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:15,049
You'll call it Johnny? But Belinda, you...

591
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:17,613
Well...

592
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:21,356
if you want it so much,
I guess you'll have a boy.

593
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,520
I'm sorry I couldn't get here any faster.

594
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,472
The horse could hardly break
through the drifts.

595
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,188
I was that worried.

596
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:35,027
Now, Aggie, I want you to get me
some more hot water, lots of it.

597
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:37,863
And woolen blankets. All you can find.

598
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:10,962
Why does it take so long? It's hours.

599
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:14,461
It's hard to get born and it's hard to die.

600
01:04:22,979 --> 01:04:25,312
Do you have some brandy around?

601
01:04:25,515 --> 01:04:27,108
I guess there's some.

602
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:48,836
- Aggie, now hold that just like that.
- Yes.

603
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:52,569
- On the corners.
- Her not making a sound, it's uncanny.

604
01:05:01,218 --> 01:05:03,244
Here, try to drink this.

605
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:18,198
Got to keep that heart going.

606
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:23,423
What are you bawling about?

607
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,833
- How is she?
- She's all right.

608
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:28,666
The baby's here.

609
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:31,574
It's a boy.

610
01:06:40,884 --> 01:06:43,547
Belinda, here's your boy.

611
01:06:58,868 --> 01:07:00,336
Can he talk?

612
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,972
He certainly can.

613
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:12,266
That ain't dirt, that's good clean earth.
That won't hurt Johnny none.

614
01:08:13,243 --> 01:08:16,941
I was brought up in a hog wallow.
You can't say I'm peaked.

615
01:08:39,102 --> 01:08:40,229
What's eating you now?

616
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:42,670
You don't get something for nothing
in this world.

617
01:08:42,772 --> 01:08:45,833
- What's that mean?
- It means no more credit.

618
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:49,135
We've had bad years before,
he's never stopped our credit.

619
01:08:49,245 --> 01:08:50,656
Why didn't you try to reason with him?

620
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,740
Because nobody would listen to me.

621
01:08:52,816 --> 01:08:55,444
I don't dare show my face in the village.

622
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:58,112
Everybody treating us like lepers.

623
01:08:58,287 --> 01:09:00,552
Come, Aggie.
It's not like a MacDonald to give up...

624
01:09:00,656 --> 01:09:03,125
because we're having a little hard time.

625
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:05,525
- We'll manage.
- Manage, is it?

626
01:09:05,794 --> 01:09:08,696
And who's to manage the salt,
and the sugar, and the tea, and the like?

627
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:10,197
Where are they to come from?

628
01:09:10,299 --> 01:09:13,064
We've managed to get deeper in debt
than anyone in Christendom.

629
01:09:13,168 --> 01:09:16,297
We've managed to shut our eyes
to everything that's happening.

630
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:20,536
I don't even remember what
the grinding wheel sounds like anymore.

631
01:09:20,642 --> 01:09:22,133
Try managing that!

632
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:26,342
He won't trust us for one more cent,
Pacquet won't, until that bill's paid.

633
01:09:37,059 --> 01:09:40,393
Them sheets are white as snow.
I bleached them extra special.

634
01:09:40,496 --> 01:09:43,364
The prettiest bride this town's ever seen,
that's what you'll be.

635
01:09:43,432 --> 01:09:45,526
- And who told you about it first?
- You did.

636
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:48,867
The cards never lie. There he is.

637
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:54,002
There'll be many a broken heart
come this Friday night.

638
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:02,350
Hello, Stella. I can drop you off.

639
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,851
No, thanks.

640
01:10:04,019 --> 01:10:05,885
Wait a minute. What's the matter?

641
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:09,413
Did Mrs. Poggety tell you to keep away
from men with blue eyes?

642
01:10:09,525 --> 01:10:12,427
A grown-up girl about to be married
swallowing that hocus--

643
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:13,962
Can't you mind your own affairs?

644
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:16,725
Always being so superior.
Always finding fault with everybody.

645
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:18,858
You of all people, after what you've done.

646
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:21,199
- What have I done?
- You know well enough.

647
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:24,900
A girl who can't defend herself,
who can't even talk. Shaming her.

648
01:10:24,973 --> 01:10:26,771
What do you mean?

649
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:29,541
Who said it? Locky?

650
01:10:30,445 --> 01:10:33,574
Everybody says it.
The whole village is talking about it.

651
01:10:34,116 --> 01:10:36,381
That's why nobody calls you.

652
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:38,748
So Locky said it.

653
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:42,088
I wouldn't have thought
you'd believe that, Stella.

654
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:57,930
Fog's rolling in.

655
01:10:58,006 --> 01:11:00,999
Can hear the lighthouse
sounding off already.

656
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:02,737
Won't help the crops any.

657
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,781
The poorer the crops,
the peskier the crows.

658
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:10,512
Mac.

659
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:15,584
They're saying in the village
that I'm Johnny's father.

660
01:11:16,525 --> 01:11:18,221
It's believable.

661
01:11:18,327 --> 01:11:20,296
When they don't know the answer,
they make up one.

662
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:23,662
I've been around this place a lot.
At all hours.

663
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:28,232
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

664
01:11:28,337 --> 01:11:31,796
I've even thought of your leaving here,
but that wouldn't prove anything...

665
01:11:31,873 --> 01:11:34,900
giving up something
you've worked for all your life.

666
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,640
I know of only one solution.
For me to marry Belinda.

667
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:42,916
That would really give them
something to talk about.

668
01:11:43,018 --> 01:11:46,420
And pretty soon
the gossip would die down for good.

669
01:11:47,222 --> 01:11:50,021
You're being generous, but it won't do.

670
01:11:51,593 --> 01:11:55,223
You see, she kind of feels things,
and people, with her insides.

671
01:11:56,598 --> 01:12:00,330
You don't love her,
you only feel a kind of pity for her.

672
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:04,033
You'd hurt her worse
than if you hated her.

673
01:12:04,106 --> 01:12:06,507
Make me feel pretty cheap.

674
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:11,337
For a while there I guess I was thinking
I was quite a guy.

675
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,111
You're one of the best I've run across.

676
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:19,018
Sometimes you can be too good.
Harm others while doing it.

677
01:12:20,522 --> 01:12:22,423
Well, look who's here.

678
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:26,290
I have something for Johnny.

679
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:32,190
You can see him. Watch.

680
01:12:37,072 --> 01:12:39,200
Yes, you can see him hear.

681
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,572
- Coming up a blow.
- A storm?

682
01:12:43,645 --> 01:12:46,877
Coming straight in.
I better get the cattle in.

683
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:51,577
I'll stay here. He has it.

684
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,625
Mac?

685
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:41,630
Mac!

686
01:13:56,084 --> 01:13:57,347
Well.

687
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,882
You don't know me, huh?

688
01:14:04,226 --> 01:14:06,161
You ought to, though.

689
01:14:12,734 --> 01:14:14,862
What are you doing in here?

690
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:18,401
I just come by
to see about some ground barley.

691
01:14:18,673 --> 01:14:20,869
That's a cute lad. Never seen him before.

692
01:14:20,942 --> 01:14:22,069
Keep away from him.

693
01:14:22,177 --> 01:14:25,113
What's the matter?
No harm in looking at him, is there?

694
01:14:25,213 --> 01:14:27,739
- Don't be scared. I'm Locky.
- Take your hands off him.

695
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:31,013
All right, all right.
He's a big boy, isn't he?

696
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:34,452
Spitting image of his father.

697
01:14:40,962 --> 01:14:45,058
Well, all right, if you don't want business,
I can go somewheres else.

698
01:15:29,244 --> 01:15:31,440
- Where you going?
- With you.

699
01:15:31,513 --> 01:15:33,948
- Well, where to?
- Wherever you're going.

700
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,916
- Why?
- To tell them.

701
01:15:37,152 --> 01:15:39,485
- To tell them what?
- What you done.

702
01:15:39,821 --> 01:15:43,849
- So they'll know how low a man can get.
- You'll tell them nothing.

703
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,094
Go ahead, walk.

704
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,631
Something's wrong?

705
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:11,936
What's happened?

706
01:17:14,448 --> 01:17:16,110
Belinda, what's the matter?

707
01:17:28,595 --> 01:17:31,258
Belinda, what is it? What's bothering you?

708
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:32,930
Belinda.

709
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:20,138
"Our Father, which art in heaven...

710
01:18:22,182 --> 01:18:24,174
"hallowed be thy name.

711
01:18:26,687 --> 01:18:28,849
"Thy kingdom come.

712
01:18:31,392 --> 01:18:33,384
"Thy will be done...

713
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:38,833
"in earth, as it is in heaven.

714
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:52,404
"Give us this day our daily bread.

715
01:18:54,948 --> 01:18:56,883
"Forgive us our debts...

716
01:18:58,952 --> 01:19:02,116
"as we forgive our debtors.

717
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:06,622
"Lead us not into temptation.

718
01:19:08,762 --> 01:19:11,630
"Deliver us from evil.

719
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:15,800
"For thine is the kingdom...

720
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,296
"and the power...

721
01:19:19,907 --> 01:19:21,535
"and the glory...

722
01:19:22,943 --> 01:19:26,539
"for ever and ever.

723
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:32,283
"Amen."

724
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:06,345
He's trying to sell him
his horse and buggy, he is.

725
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,581
He stopped talking when I came in,
but I heard enough.

726
01:20:08,655 --> 01:20:10,624
But what will he do without them?
A doctor.

727
01:20:10,691 --> 01:20:12,455
What practice he has he can cover afoot.

728
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:13,824
Just to the mill and back.

729
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:17,420
His luck's run out, that's what.
I saw it in the cards, so help me.

730
01:20:17,498 --> 01:20:20,798
Black. Spades, spades, spades,
no matter where I put them.

731
01:20:31,145 --> 01:20:34,377
That rig is worth
two times more than this bill.

732
01:20:35,682 --> 01:20:37,242
I make business and I have the right...

733
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:39,582
to get back what is owed me
all fair and honorable.

734
01:20:39,686 --> 01:20:42,155
But I do not want people saying
that I take advantage.

735
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:44,521
You don't understand.
You'd be doing me a favor.

736
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:45,854
I have to get rid of them.

737
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:49,419
You mean, something is wrong?
The horse is lame, maybe, yes?

738
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:52,159
No, he's sturdy as a horse.

739
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:55,025
But I'm in a hurry,
so I have to take what I can get.

740
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:58,095
- I'm leaving here for good.
- You are? When?

741
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,263
You seem pleased about it.

742
01:21:00,374 --> 01:21:02,673
- No, I think it's better for you.
- Why?

743
01:21:02,743 --> 01:21:05,838
You see, in this village,
we do not appreciate people coming here.

744
01:21:05,913 --> 01:21:08,747
Strangers who do not follow
our ways of living.

745
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:12,342
There are men here who can be very angry
and something can happen.

746
01:21:12,419 --> 01:21:14,081
- What?
- Anything.

747
01:21:15,022 --> 01:21:17,014
Look, Pacquet,
put away the tar and feathers.

748
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:19,423
Do you want the rig or don't you?

749
01:21:35,742 --> 01:21:37,938
She's as pretty as a picture.

750
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:51,087
Good luck, my boy. Now you can pay me.

751
01:21:51,158 --> 01:21:53,491
You know I can. And I want that boat back.

752
01:21:53,594 --> 01:21:55,256
You will have it.

753
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:02,400
- You've a good man, Stella.
- Thank you, Pacquet.

754
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:06,401
Charlotte, catch!

755
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:13,006
- Bye!
- Bye!

756
01:22:13,247 --> 01:22:16,479
It's about time Locky settled down.
He's led a stormy youth.

757
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,279
Out on the ocean, you mean, Mrs. McKee.

758
01:22:18,352 --> 01:22:19,650
You know what I mean.

759
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:44,205
Belinda, I want you
to promise me something.

760
01:22:45,946 --> 01:22:48,313
If anything ever happens to Johnny...

761
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:51,484
I want you to send for Dr. Gray.

762
01:22:54,521 --> 01:22:57,423
I couldn't come, Belinda. I won't be here.

763
01:22:57,591 --> 01:22:59,423
I have to go away.

764
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:04,190
After all, I'm a doctor.
I can't help anyone this way.

765
01:23:05,098 --> 01:23:07,658
I can't even make a living for myself.

766
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:10,328
Anyway, it's the only thing to do.

767
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,196
So I made an application.

768
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:15,674
I made an application.

769
01:23:18,844 --> 01:23:22,212
A staff job at the Toronto Hospital,
and they've taken me on.

770
01:23:22,281 --> 01:23:24,250
I got the answer today.

771
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:30,548
Do you understand?
Do you understand, Belinda?

772
01:23:31,957 --> 01:23:33,619
In a month or two...

773
01:23:33,726 --> 01:23:36,890
I'll be able to take care of things,
help you out.

774
01:23:36,962 --> 01:23:39,227
I've talked it over with Aggie.

775
01:23:39,632 --> 01:23:43,296
You see, the trouble is
I have to leave very soon.

776
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,567
Tomorrow, in fact.

777
01:23:49,642 --> 01:23:52,407
No, Belinda. I won't be able to come.

778
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:55,207
I'm going across the Gulf.

779
01:24:03,322 --> 01:24:05,154
Yes, very far away.

780
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:14,331
Yes, I'll be careful.

781
01:24:27,413 --> 01:24:28,779
Belinda...

782
01:24:43,529 --> 01:24:45,657
Forgive me, I didn't know.

783
01:24:56,442 --> 01:24:58,035
Don't be sorry.

784
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,771
I'm very glad.

785
01:25:35,114 --> 01:25:36,446
Come on.

786
01:25:37,683 --> 01:25:39,549
Hurry up, we're late.

787
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:42,554
It is the honor of the community
we have to think of.

788
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:44,419
Respectable people do not stand by...

789
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:47,789
and see shameful things like this happen,
and do nothing.

790
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,926
As a member of the Town Council,
I say it is our duty...

791
01:25:53,032 --> 01:25:55,467
to correct this unfortunate situation.

792
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:58,094
And we do not want anyone
to come from outside...

793
01:25:58,204 --> 01:25:59,604
and meddle in this.

794
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:03,472
We want to do this quietly.
We can take care of it ourselves.

795
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:04,703
Yes, Mrs. Moore?

796
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:07,406
Isn't it cruel to take a baby away
from its mother?

797
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,109
A creature who's a disgrace
to the whole village?

798
01:26:10,216 --> 01:26:12,913
Who can't even teach a child his prayers?

799
01:26:12,985 --> 01:26:15,819
Is it a crime to save a baby
from a life of misery?

800
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:20,052
These women can't provide for a child.
Already they've sold most of their cattle.

801
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,617
The place is run down.
There's no man to work it.

802
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:25,960
Why, the baby will be like her,
running loose like an animal.

803
01:26:26,065 --> 01:26:29,126
The doctor. When he finds out,
couldn't he make trouble?

804
01:26:29,235 --> 01:26:30,294
After what he did?

805
01:26:30,402 --> 01:26:32,337
Sneaking out of town
in the middle of the night?

806
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:35,567
He will be too smart
to ever show his face here again.

807
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:39,669
I could almost feel sorry for her.
It's a good thing she can't think or feel.

808
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,237
Nothing better could happen for the child
than the offer we got.

809
01:26:43,315 --> 01:26:46,808
He will have a name,
a home with respected parents...

810
01:26:47,086 --> 01:26:49,078
Mr. and Mrs. McCormick.

811
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,787
Now, there's no need for a lot of red tape.

812
01:26:51,857 --> 01:26:54,691
All we have to do is
get the release from the girl.

813
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,820
She only has to sign it.
It is an easy thing to make a cross.

814
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:02,300
With the release we send this petition.
I do not think there will be any trouble.

815
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:06,967
If the girl had normal intelligence
she would be grateful.

816
01:27:14,513 --> 01:27:16,141
What are you stopping for?

817
01:27:16,215 --> 01:27:18,980
Let's end this bickering.
He has the makings of a fine, sturdy lad.

818
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:20,862
I'm telling you again,
I'd sooner not take him...

819
01:27:20,886 --> 01:27:22,697
than let you turn him
into a thickheaded farmer.

820
01:27:22,721 --> 01:27:25,156
And I tell you he'll have to earn his keep
when he's growed.

821
01:27:25,224 --> 01:27:26,701
What if he gets sick? It'll cost money.

822
01:27:26,725 --> 01:27:29,194
Whose money?
I don't recall you bringing in any.

823
01:27:29,295 --> 01:27:31,890
Well, it's ours, ain't it? You're my wife.

824
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:34,523
And you expect me to pay for the honor?

825
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,693
You needn't worry.

826
01:27:35,768 --> 01:27:37,646
I'm not fooling myself
about why you married me.

827
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,270
And I know what started you on the idea.

828
01:27:39,371 --> 01:27:42,170
You want the kid because of that doctor.
'Cause you think it's his.

829
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:44,386
You're sweet on him
and couldn't hogtie him for yourself.

830
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,901
I loathe him.

831
01:27:46,278 --> 01:27:48,770
A man that would do a thing like that.

832
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:51,482
All right,
then don't think to pamper the boy.

833
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,178
He'll work as soon as he's able.

834
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,511
Giddap there. Giddap.

835
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:06,263
I'll go by myself. Give me the letter.

836
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,266
What for?
She won't understand it anyhow.

837
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:10,233
Give me that letter.

838
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,469
Can't hear, can't read.
And don't be all day about it.

839
01:28:53,112 --> 01:28:54,410
My coat?

840
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,450
May I see the baby?

841
01:29:15,801 --> 01:29:17,429
May I hold him?

842
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:20,764
May I hold him?

843
01:30:02,181 --> 01:30:03,444
Belinda.

844
01:30:06,418 --> 01:30:09,013
Would you let me take care of him?

845
01:30:10,289 --> 01:30:13,521
I mean, take him home just for a while.

846
01:30:15,227 --> 01:30:17,218
He'd be very happy,
he'd have everything he wants.

847
01:30:17,295 --> 01:30:19,924
You could see him whenever you like.

848
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:21,897
Please let me, just for a little while.

849
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:23,958
You have all this work.

850
01:30:24,936 --> 01:30:28,429
Why not, Belinda? I only want to help you,
can't you understand?

851
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,980
Just sign here. Just make a cross.

852
01:31:07,078 --> 01:31:09,343
If you don't give him to me,
they'll come and take him.

853
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:12,508
Belinda, listen, please! Let me take him.
I won't...

854
01:31:33,037 --> 01:31:35,370
- What's happened?
- Locky, I can't do it.

855
01:31:35,473 --> 01:31:36,771
What are you talking about?

856
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:39,037
He's ours, been given to us,
all legal and proper.

857
01:31:39,143 --> 01:31:40,304
We must give him up.

858
01:31:40,378 --> 01:31:42,210
We're being mean, Locky,
mean to the Dummy.

859
01:31:42,313 --> 01:31:44,976
You think she had no feeling,
you should see her with the baby.

860
01:31:45,049 --> 01:31:48,019
We just can't take him, she's his mother.

861
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:49,787
His mother.

862
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:53,356
Well, let me tell you something.
I'm his father.

863
01:31:54,525 --> 01:31:55,652
What?

864
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:58,389
His father, I'm telling you!
He's as much mine as hers.

865
01:31:58,496 --> 01:32:00,965
Locky, I told you to keep away from her.

866
01:32:01,032 --> 01:32:04,560
It's all over and in the past.
Unfortunate it is, it happened.

867
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:07,503
A man wants children and I want him.

868
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,371
Something in here wants him.
By the Godfrey, I'll have him!

869
01:32:24,922 --> 01:32:26,584
Where's the kid?

870
01:32:28,526 --> 01:32:30,358
Get out of the way.

871
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:04,782
It is the duty of the Crown Prosecutor...

872
01:34:04,855 --> 01:34:07,484
to present the facts
which will prove to you...

873
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:12,121
that beyond a doubt,
Belinda MacDonald is guilty of murder.

874
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:15,192
This is a difficult case...

875
01:34:15,366 --> 01:34:18,734
due to the unfortunate circumstances
of the accused.

876
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:23,035
But you and I, gentlemen,
must not allow these circumstances...

877
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:27,009
to bring about an undue amount
of sympathy for the accused.

878
01:34:27,845 --> 01:34:32,681
A murder has been committed
and the full penalty must be paid.

879
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:40,457
Is there any reason you know of,
Mrs. McCormick...

880
01:34:40,558 --> 01:34:43,426
why she should have killed your husband?

881
01:34:49,734 --> 01:34:50,861
No.

882
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,133
- Your witness.
- No questions.

883
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:56,598
Miss MacDonald.

884
01:34:58,743 --> 01:35:00,644
When the McCormicks...

885
01:35:03,814 --> 01:35:06,443
arrived that afternoon...

886
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:11,085
is it true that you were
in the house alone?

887
01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:20,730
Does she understand?

888
01:35:31,008 --> 01:35:32,169
Well, what did she answer?

889
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:35,405
She's not answering my question.
She hasn't answered any of my questions.

890
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:38,347
All she says is,
"I want my baby, I want my baby."

891
01:35:44,622 --> 01:35:47,421
There, "Tell them
to give me my baby, please."

892
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:50,290
The defendant obviously
doesn't want to answer the question.

893
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:51,761
My Lord...

894
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,856
under the circumstances,
the defendant is naturally confused.

895
01:35:54,965 --> 01:35:57,799
Apparently she does not understand
the interpreter.

896
01:35:57,868 --> 01:36:01,100
Since she was trained in the sign language
by one of the witnesses...

897
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,868
Dr. Richardson...

898
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,839
would it be permissible
for him to translate for her?

899
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:09,107
- Permission granted.
- Dr. Robert Richardson.

900
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:24,385
Would you mind facing her directly
so that she can read your lips?

901
01:36:27,565 --> 01:36:29,966
Were you alone in the house...

902
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:32,830
when the McCormicks came to see you?

903
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:36,036
Did you understand?

904
01:36:40,311 --> 01:36:41,574
"I was with my baby."

905
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,376
After you attacked Mrs. McCormick
and she ran out--

906
01:36:44,482 --> 01:36:45,848
I object, My Lord.

907
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:49,045
The defendant has not admitted
attacking Mrs. McCormick.

908
01:36:49,153 --> 01:36:50,519
Objection sustained.

909
01:36:50,588 --> 01:36:52,955
I'll phrase the question differently.

910
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,891
After Mrs. McCormick left,
what did you do?

911
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:59,089
Isn't it true that as soon as she left
you went to get the gun?

912
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:05,134
"I was very much afraid."

913
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,966
So you did take the gun deliberately?

914
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,300
Objection!

915
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:10,306
The defendant has made
no such admission.

916
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:11,431
My Lord--

917
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:13,977
If the Prosecution will be patient,
I might be able to help.

918
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:17,048
Please try to understand
what it means to be as she is...

919
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:19,106
living in a world apart,
shut off from everyone...

920
01:37:19,216 --> 01:37:21,117
never hearing the warmth
of a human voice.

921
01:37:21,218 --> 01:37:23,210
Think of the loneliness and the fear.

922
01:37:23,287 --> 01:37:27,155
These people, although tutored,
are governed almost solely by intuition.

923
01:37:27,257 --> 01:37:29,590
Belinda's been instructed
in certain fundamentals.

924
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:31,137
- She knows right from wrong...
- My Lord--

925
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:34,620
...but something in her was stronger than
the precept, "Thou shalt not kill."

926
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:35,926
My Lord, I object.

927
01:37:35,999 --> 01:37:40,232
Dr. Richardson is completely out of order.
He's not the counsel for the accused.

928
01:37:40,303 --> 01:37:43,740
Your Lordship, I insist this girl obeyed
an impulse older than the laws of man:

929
01:37:43,806 --> 01:37:46,935
The instinct of a mother
to protect her child.

930
01:37:47,343 --> 01:37:49,437
Any further breach of your capacity
as interpreter...

931
01:37:49,512 --> 01:37:52,482
I shall hold as in contempt of this court.

932
01:37:53,349 --> 01:37:55,181
Objection sustained.

933
01:37:55,318 --> 01:37:56,411
Now please proceed.

934
01:37:59,822 --> 01:38:01,916
When did you get the gun?

935
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:04,491
After Locky McCormick came in?

936
01:38:05,295 --> 01:38:06,661
"Yes." Why?

937
01:38:11,668 --> 01:38:14,137
"I was afraid he would hurt my baby."

938
01:38:14,204 --> 01:38:16,332
And that was your only motive?

939
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:18,965
Was there any other reason
why you were afraid of him?

940
01:38:19,042 --> 01:38:22,012
Your Lordship! The interpreter,
in rephrasing my question...

941
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:23,773
is trying to coach the defendant.

942
01:38:23,846 --> 01:38:26,179
This man is totally unqualified.

943
01:38:26,282 --> 01:38:28,979
He's deeply involved in the case himself
and I can prove it.

944
01:38:29,052 --> 01:38:30,953
May I present new evidence?

945
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,990
- Has it any bearing on this testimony?
- It has.

946
01:38:34,057 --> 01:38:35,855
Permission granted.

947
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:42,121
Dr. Richardson,
in your earlier testimony...

948
01:38:42,198 --> 01:38:45,862
didn't you deny being the father
of Belinda MacDonald's child?

949
01:38:45,969 --> 01:38:48,131
- I did.
- Did you write this?

950
01:38:48,371 --> 01:38:49,395
I did.

951
01:38:49,505 --> 01:38:51,974
I should like to read a passage
from this letter.

952
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:54,567
"...physician takes a lot more time...

953
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,871
"Work is hard. Be here soon.

954
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:59,006
"I have found a house for us.

955
01:38:59,082 --> 01:39:02,052
"It is small but it has
a beautifully sunny room...

956
01:39:02,151 --> 01:39:04,086
"for our little son."

957
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:11,422
I challenge this man's integrity
as a witness and as an individual.

958
01:39:11,527 --> 01:39:14,019
His actions speak for themselves.

959
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:17,359
Betraying this girl,
ignobly fleeing scandal.

960
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:19,861
He's laid himself open
to a charge of perjury.

961
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:23,429
His very appearance here is an affront
to the dignity of this court.

962
01:39:23,539 --> 01:39:26,304
He has violated the ethics
of an honorable profession.

963
01:39:26,409 --> 01:39:28,640
He should be stricken
from the medical register...

964
01:39:28,745 --> 01:39:31,078
expelled from decent society.

965
01:39:31,147 --> 01:39:33,048
No! No!

966
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,585
It was Locky's fault!

967
01:39:38,655 --> 01:39:42,649
It was him, Locky. He's the baby's father.
It was his fault!

968
01:39:43,626 --> 01:39:46,289
He told me
the day we went to get the baby.

969
01:39:46,396 --> 01:39:48,456
I wanted the baby but...

970
01:39:49,232 --> 01:39:51,724
somehow when I saw her with him
I couldn't.

971
01:39:51,801 --> 01:39:55,135
I said, "We shouldn't, it's mean,
she's his mother."

972
01:39:55,238 --> 01:39:57,730
And he said... He said:

973
01:39:59,409 --> 01:40:01,105
"I'm his father."

974
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:16,819
In this court's opinion,
the evidence is incontrovertible.

975
01:40:16,926 --> 01:40:18,861
That she acted in defense of her home...

976
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:21,658
against a man
whose guilt has been proven.

977
01:40:21,764 --> 01:40:23,926
The court expresses the hope
that the jury's verdict...

978
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,765
will stand as a reminder
that justice in this Dominion...

979
01:40:26,836 --> 01:40:28,998
will always protect the private citizen...

980
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:31,631
against those who would interfere
with his rights...

981
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:34,268
and his dignity as a human being.

982
01:40:38,881 --> 01:40:41,646
I'm glad that it turned out the way it did.

983
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:00,732
I know, Belinda.
You don't have to say anything.
