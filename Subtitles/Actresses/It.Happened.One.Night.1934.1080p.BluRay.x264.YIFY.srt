- No! Thank you. I’d rather you didn’t.

I told them to wait.

I’m sorry, miss,

Good morning.

Remember me?
I’m the fellow you slept on last night.

212
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,757
Seems to me
I’ve already thanked you for that.

213
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,676
- What time is the next bus?
- 8:00 tonight.

214

That’s 12 hours!

I’m sorry, miss.

Wouldn’t the old meanies wait for you?

You missed it too.

that what happened last night —

Look here, young man,
you needn’t concern yourself about me.

222
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,497
- I can take care of myself.
- You’re doing a pretty sloppy job of it.

Here’s your ticket.

224
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,960
- My ticket?
- I found it on the seat.

Thank you.

226
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,344
It must have fallen
out of my purse.

You‘ll never get away with it,

What are you talking about?

229
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:20,147
Your father will stop you
before you get halfway to New York.

230
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,109
You must have me confused
with someone else.

231
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,403
Quit kidding.
It’s all over the front page.

232
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,037
I’ve always been curious to know
what kind of girl would marry...

233
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,373
a front-page aviator
like King Westley.

234
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,001
Take my advice:
Grab the next bus back to Miami.

235
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,086
That guy’s a phony.

236
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,424
I didn’t ask for your advice.

237
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,427
That’s right. You didn’t.

238
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,305
You’re not going to notify
my father, are you?

239
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,182
What for?

240
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:59,102
- You probably could get
some money out of him.
- I never thought of that.

241
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,731
If you promise not to,
I’ll pay you as much as he will.

242
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:07,277
You won’t gain anything
by giving me away
as long as I make it worth your while.

243
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:11,448
I’ve got to get to New York
without being stopped.
It’s terribly important to me.

244
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,117
I’d pay you now,
only the only thing I had...

245
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,288
when I jumped off was a wristwatch,
and I had to pawn that to get clothes.

246
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:22,751
I’ll give you my address.
Get in touch with me
the minute you get to New York.

247
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,296
Never mind. I had you pegged
right from the jump —

248
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,506
just a spoiled brat
of a rich father.

249
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,176
The only way
you get anything is to buy it.

250

It never fails, does it?

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,599
Ever hear of the word “humility”?

252
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,102
No, you wouldn’t. I guess
it never occurred to you to just say...

253
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,939
“Please, mister, I’m in trouble.
Will you help me?”

254
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,316
No. That’d bring you down
off your high horse.

255
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:50,987
Let me tell you something:
You don’t have to worry about me.

256
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,531
I’m not interested in your money
or your problem.

my whole plot in a nutshell.

If you behave,
I’ll see that you get to King Westley.

If not, I’ll just have to spill
the beans to Papa.

407
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:03,539
Now, uh, which of these beds
do you prefer?

408
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,293
This one? All right.

409
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,527
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

Oh, this?

411
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,534
I like privacy when I retire.

412
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,829
I’m very delicate in that respect.
Prying eyes annoy me.

413
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,002
Behold the walls of Jericho.

414
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,798
Maybe not as thick as the ones
Joshua blew down with his trumpet...

415
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,591
but a lot safer.

416
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,803

You don’t want to join the Israelites?
All right.

421
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,779
Perhaps you’re interested
in how a man undresses.

422

There’s a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

423

No two men do it alike.

424
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,788
I knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

425
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,832

426
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,251

428
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,464
I have a method all my own.

429
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,675
If you’ll notice,
the coat came first...

430
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,303
then the tie,
then the shirt.

431
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,471
Now, according to Hoyle...

432
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,016
after that,
the pants should be next.

433
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,936
There’s where I’m different:
I go for the shoes next.

Of course you shouldn’t.
You don’t know how.
Dunking’s an art.
