1
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,636
You girls take the
napkins and the plates.

2
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,058
Out of there. Come on,
go find your mom.

3
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,364
Aunt Lily!

4
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,279
Aunt Lily!

5
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,105
- Would you help me here, please?
- It's not exactly my line, Martha.

6
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,908
- Thank you.
- But all right.

7
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,836
There we are.

8
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,960
Grandma!

9
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,798
Grandma!

10
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,097
Darling!

11
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,000
Grandma, I'm so glad you came.

12
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,726
I could hardly sleep last night,
waiting to see you today.

13
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,674
- Mrs. Tilford, will you excuse me, please?
- Yes, surely.

14
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,067
My!

15
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,220
Your new dress looks
lovely on you, Mary.

16
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,183
- And I must say, you look nice and healthy.
- Healthy?

17
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:31,520
The way they make you slave around here, I'm
lucky I don't have gray hair and rickets!

18
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,826
- It's all for your own good.
- Everything I hate always is.

19
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,611
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

20
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,155
- How do you do, Miss Dobie?
- Fine, Miss Wright.

21
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,699
- What do you think of our school?
- I rather like it. And you?

22
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,253
I may be hasty, but I
think it's here to stay.

23
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,413
I think we'll have two or
three new pupils next term.

24
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,625
Martha, it's almost
too good to believe.

25
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,520
Let's not stand here and gloat.

26
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,676
You should have a kitchen helper.

27
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,888
It's just too much to teach all
day, then cook, wash the dishes.

28
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,266
Aunt Lily, 10 minutes is a
long time for one glass.

29
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:14,448
I do not aim for speed, Martha.
I aim for perfection in life.

30
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,617
Will you try to perfect a few more?

31
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,695
If you'll excuse me, I have
one of my headaches.

32
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,407
I think I'd better go to my room and
prepare for tomorrow's classes.

33
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,493
- Good night.
- Good night.

34
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,594
Sleep well, Aunt Lily, and knit
up the raveled sleeve of care.

35
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,644
Karen...

36
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,049
You know that if I could support her in
any other way, I wouldn't have her here.

37
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,386
She worries you too much. One day,
we'll have enough money to...

38
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,097
Money! I forgot to tell you.

39
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,517
I did the bills, and we're
$90 ahead this month!

40
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,437
- Ahead? I can't believe it!
- It's not much, but it's the first time.

41
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,606
Out of the red, into the black.

42
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,775
- Finally!
- What'll we do with it?

43
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,236
- Save it.
- You need clothes.

44
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,613
- What about you?
- I'm a skirt-and-blouse character.

45
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,949
We're always in style.
But you're not.

46
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,785
You're Fifth Avenue.
Rue de la Paix.

47
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,761
- You need to be kept up.
- Yes, like an old battle monument.

48
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,957
I'm serious.

49
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,727
I remember how you used
to dress in college.

50
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,171
The first time I ever saw you,
running across the quadrangle,

51
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,423
your hair flying.

52
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,352
At the time, I was running
from a chemistry professor.

53
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,530
I remember thinking,
"What a pretty girl."

54
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,600
Time for lights out.

55
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,352
Your turn to crack the whip.
I'll finish up here.

56
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,157
- Hurry back, and we'll take a walk.
- All right, I'd like that.

57
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,408
- All right, girls.
- Already?

58
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,453
Miss Wright, my new ring, it's gone.
I can't find it anywhere.

59
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,748
Don't worry about it.
We'll look for it tomorrow.

60
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,801
All right, bedtime.

61
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,142
Lights out, everyone.

62
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,844
Go ahead and sing.

63
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,056
A woman who sings while she
works is a happy woman.

64
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,682
Who said that?

65
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,518
Joseph Cardin, M.D.
You ever hear of him?

66
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,229
No. Ethical doctors
don't advertise.

67
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,453
Ethical doctors starve.

68
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,859
I thought you were at the
hospital Sunday nights.

69
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,504
I was. I traded with Dr. Mallory.

70
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,030
Sunday for Wednesday?

71
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,175
It's an even swap. They
both have 24 hours.

72
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,343
Why don't you just crawl
in and browse around?

73
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,976
- You know what I did this morning?
- What?

74
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,770
I delivered my 100th baby.

75
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,610
Congratulations.

76
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,023
- How many children do you want, Martha?
- I already have 20.

77
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,028
Upstairs.

78
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,728
- Where's Karen?
- Putting them to bed.

79
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,531
That's good practice.

80
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,455
Why don't you pay tuition? Then you
could eat three meals a day here.

81
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,259
Martha, you've been a little
sharp with me lately.

82
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,261
Have I?

83
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,883
Maybe it's me.

84
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,394
Maybe it is.

85
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,908
Wait.

86
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:43,074
- Where did you get this book, Mary?
- Hurry up. I've read this page twice!

87
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,204
Okay, turn it.

88
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,919
Wow!

89
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,589
Double wow!

90
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,348
She's headed this way.

91
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881
How peaceful.

92
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,091
Everybody's studying.

93
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,065
Where's Catherine?

94
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,109
That'll be all for
today, Catherine.

95
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,978
That's last year's
history book, Mary.

96
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,315
I feel funny inside.
I don't know what I'm doing.

97
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,290
- I've got pains.
- Pains?

98
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,000
- I've had them all day.
- Where?

99
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,461
Around.

100
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,828
- Anything I can get you for pains "around"?
- I think I'd better call my grandmother.

101
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,997
Perhaps sleep is the best
thing tonight, Mary.

102
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,250
Tomorrow I'll call Dr. Cardin
and ask him about your pains.

103
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,894
All right?

104
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,230
Catherine, your harness.

105
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,674
Off to sleep, everybody.
Good night.

106
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,728
- Good night, Miss Wright.
- Good night.

107
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,681
"Dr. Cardin" this,
"Dr. Cardin" that.

108
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,351
She always drags him
into the conversation.

109
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,354
After all, she's in love with him.

110
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,106
Then why doesn't she marry him?

111
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,332
I heard him ask her that same
thing once. Downstairs.

112
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,214
I brought your coat. Are you ready?

113
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,388
Look who's here.

114
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,376
- Look who's here!
- Who's here?

115
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,930
You! It's Sunday. What happened?

116
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,382
I killed all the patients and
emptied the joint just for kicks.

117
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,935
Come on.

118
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,136
- But...
- Come on, Martha.

119
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,487
- I'm too tired for two girls.
- Martha and I were going for a walk.

120
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,613
Then go.

121
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,323
You go, Karen. I'm tired.
I have papers to correct.

122
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,914
See you later, Martha.

123
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,854
- Want to go to a movie?
- Nope.

124
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,448
- Walk by the lake?
- Nope.

125
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,610
Have a beer?

126
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,661
Hate beer.

127
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,657
What do you want to do?

128
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,651
Let's try something we've
never done before,

129
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,250
like getting married.

130
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,116
Even after we're married we'll be
saying the same things every night.

131
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,787
- Movies, a walk by the lake...
- I wouldn't like to think that.

132
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,996
No, I wouldn't.

133
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,500
It'd be nice to sit by ourselves
in our own room and...

134
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,584
Read a book.

135
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,307
Read a book?

136
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,341
"Miss Wright, is that what you'll
be doing after you're married?

137
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,440
"Reading books?"

138
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,780
What's the matter with you, Joe?

139
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,142
Same thing that was the matter with
me last week, last month, last year.

140
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,979
You know why we had to wait.
I couldn't leave Martha until...

141
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,204
"...until the school was
on its feet." Yes, I know.

142
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,527
I've never heard you
talk this way before.

143
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,047
Why are you angry tonight?

144
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,166
I don't know.

145
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,170
Why don't you know?

146
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,352
Why don't you know?

147
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,022
People feel the way
they feel, that's all.

148
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,384
I feel lonely, and I feel tired

149
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,096
and I'm sick of plans
for the future.

150
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,474
- Do you feel in love?
- Other people's children.

151
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,780
- I asked you, do you feel in love?
- Don't be cute.

152
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,331
What I'm trying to ask you,
only you talk so much, is...

153
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,966
Can we have a baby
12 months from now?

154
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,731
All right, kid. You got a date.

155
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,150
How I love you.

156
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,112
Love you. Love you. Love you.

157
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,315
Martha,

158
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,508
Joe and I decided tonight.

159
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,779
We're going to be married two
weeks after school lets out.

160
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,778
So soon!

161
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,327
It doesn't seem so soon to Joe.

162
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,321
No, I suppose it doesn't.

163
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,126
Congratulations.

164
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,042
Wouldn't it be nice to have the
wedding right here at the school?

165
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,170
The garden will be in full
bloom and the roses out.

166
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,294
We could put up a
candstriped awning.

167
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,632
And then good-bye,
Wright-Dobie school.

168
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,877
My marriage isn't going to make
any difference to the school.

169
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,380
It will, Karen. You know
it will. It can't help it.

170
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,050
You keep saying things like that.
We've talked about all this before.

171
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,054
You know Joe isn't asking me to give
it up, and I'm not going to leave.

172
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,825
No, of course not. I don't know
what I could be thinking of.

173
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,172
I don't understand you!

174
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,244
It's been so hard
building this place up.

175
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,721
Just when we're getting on our feet you're
ready to let it all go right to hell!

176
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:59,100
Martha, for God's sake, do you
expect me to give up my marriage?

177
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,402
No.

178
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,416
No, of course not.
I'm sorry, Karen.

179
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,582
I don't know how I
could be so selfish.

180
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,876
Please, forgive me.

181
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,545
I already have.

182
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,139
It's been a long day. We
both need some sleep.

183
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,458
Yes, you're right.

184
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,835
Who has the cooking
detail for breakfast?

185
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,262
I do.

186
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,942
Karen...

187
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,148
you know, don't you, that I
only want the best for you?

188
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,948
I know.

189
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,641
"This proves me base,

190
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,311
"if she first meet
the curled Antony

191
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,439
"he'll make demands of
her, and spend that kiss

192
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,566
- "which is my heaven..."
- Evelyn. Evelyn.

193
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:34,168
Can't you imagine yourself as
Cleopatra talking to an asp?

194
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,247
"This knot intrinsicate

195
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,875
"of life at once untie.

196
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,085
"Poor venomous fool.

197
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,434
- "Be angry, and dispatch..."
- Mary!

198
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,841
Why, Mary, are you just arriving
for your elocution class?

199
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,191
If you take no interest
in your work, then...

200
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,181
I went to get these flowers
for you, Mrs. Mortar.

201
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,768
You told us you loved flowers. And I
walked so far to get them for you.

202
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,618
That was very thoughtful
of you, Mary.

203
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,899
I suppose I'll have to
forgive you this time.

204
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,652
Thoughtfulness and
courtesy mean breeding

205
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,737
and breeding is an excellent thing.

206
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,406
I think you should write
that down, all of you.

207
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,709
We wrote it down last week.

208
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,888
- Put them in a vase for me, Mary.
- Yes, ma'am.

209
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,342
Good afternoon, Miss Wright.

210
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,585
Evelyn has just been
reading Cleopatra for us.

211
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,337
That's nice.

212
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,562
Mary just brought me a
gift of some flowers.

213
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,646
- Where did you get them, Mary?
- She picked them, especially for me.

214
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,237
Where did you get them, Mary?

215
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,411
Down near the lake.

216
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,076
I see.

217
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,084
That'll be all, girls. Thank you.

218
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,697
- Mary?
- I have to get my biology book for...

219
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,921
I'd rather you waited.

220
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,119
It wasn't necessary to go down
to the lake for those flowers.

221
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,664
There was a bunch exactly like these
in the trash barrels this morning.

222
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,138
What a nasty thing to do!

223
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,390
What a nasty thing.

224
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,597
Come.

225
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,813
Come and sit down.

226
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,471
Mary, why do you do these things?

227
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,274
Why do you lie to us so often?

228
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,576
I'm not lying.

229
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:32,953
If you have to do things to let off steam or
for adventure, come and tell us about it.

230
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,204
Tell us the truth. I promise
you, we'll try to understand.

231
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,795
I picked the flowers
down near the lake.

232
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,594
All right, you leave me no choice.
You'll have to be punished.

233
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,930
Take your recreation periods alone.
No field hockey, no swimming

234
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,683
and do not leave the school grounds
for any reason whatsoever.

235
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,852
- Saturday, too'?
- Saturday, too.

236
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,688
But the boat races are Saturday,
and you said I could go.

237
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,024
The boat races were a
privilege which you've lost.

238
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,026
I'll tell my grandmother how...

239
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,320
- Go upstairs.
- I'll tell her how you treat me.

240
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,248
Go upstairs, Mary!

241
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,383
I don't feel well.

242
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,969
I've got a pain.

243
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,261
It hurts here.

244
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,226
I've never had it before!

245
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,382
My heart! It's
stopping or something!

246
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,718
I can't breathe! I can't!

247
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,362
I can't!

248
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,271
It's nothing.

249
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,732
You'd better telephone Joe
and ask him to come over.

250
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,376
All right.

251
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,364
- What happened? Did she fall?
- No. I was disciplining her and...

252
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,075
- And you finally hit her?
- No, of course not.

253
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,995
- She just seems to have fainted.
- Maybe it's a heart attack.

254
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,391
Now, I think the feet should
be higher than the head.

255
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,004
- Try it here.
- Where?

256
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,215
- Here. Here.
- There?

257
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,610
Yes, there, a most important spot.

258
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,886
Yes, indeed.

259
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,264
When Delia Lambert had a
heart attack in Buffalo

260
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,267
right on the stage,
that was the spot.

261
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,728
- Did this Delia survive?
- Yes. I saved her.

262
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,272
How's her pulse?

263
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,621
The pulse is very bad.

264
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,153
I'm afraid she's slipping away.
There's no heartbeat at all.

265
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,780
We'll need a specialist.

266
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,616
Perhaps you, Doctor, would
condescend to take over?

267
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,951
What?

268
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,911
Heart attacks are
nothing to play with.

269
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,956
- Never played with one in my life.
- As the child's teacher, I...

270
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,009
Mrs. Mortar, please.

271
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,803
Well!

272
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,732
I was practically put
out of the room.

273
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,228
So you don't resent your aunt
being snubbed and humiliated?

274
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,148
- Aunt Lily.
- Karen is rude to me, and you know it.

275
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,985
Karen is very kind to you. And
what's even harder, very patient.

276
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,236
Patient with me?

277
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,197
When I've worked my fingers
to the bone for both of you.

278
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,217
Yes, to the bone, to the very bone!

279
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,173
Aunt Lily...

280
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,811
You've talked about going back
to New York for a long time now.

281
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,548
It's been years. I'll never
live to play on Broadway again.

282
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,274
But you will, Aunt Lily, you will.
You can go back to New York.

283
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,179
You want to get rid of me?

284
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,848
I'm trying to give you something
you've always wanted.

285
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,516
You keep talking about the theater

286
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,686
and the great opportunities in
television that you're missing.

287
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,856
Turning me out.
Nice, grateful girls.

288
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:07,129
- How can anybody deal with you?
- Please, do not raise your voice.

289
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,616
I shall write to my agent. When
they have a suitable part for me...

290
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,992
No.

291
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,827
I don't think we
should wait that long.

292
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll give you what little
money we have now.

293
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:21,542
You think I'd take your money?
I'd rather scrub floors first.

294
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,847
You'll change your mind
after the first floor.

295
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,008
I should have known by this
time that the wise thing to do

296
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,279
was to stay out of your way
when he's in the house.

297
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,525
When who's in the house?

298
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,893
Don't think you're
fooling me, young lady.

299
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,539
Any day that he's in the
house is a bad day.

300
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,209
Now, look...

301
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,032
Let's give it up. I'm tired. I've
been working since 6:00 this morning.

302
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,659
I know what I know.

303
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,079
You can't stand them being together,
and you're taking it out on me.

304
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,915
God knows what you'll
do when they marry.

305
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,042
- Jealous, jealous...
- Aunt Lily.

306
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,421
You've always had a jealous,
possessive nature even as a child.

307
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,424
If you had a friend, you'd be
upset if she liked anybody else.

308
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,259
And that's what's happening now.

309
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,928
And it's unnatural. It's just
as unnatural as it can be.

310
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,474
The sooner you get out of here, the better.
You are making me sick.

311
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,996
And I won't stand for you any longer.
I want you to leave tomorrow, no delays.

312
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,948
What are you doing down here?

313
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,842
- We just came to...
- I was going up...

314
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:41,205
- I was going upstairs.
- We just came down to see how Mary was.

315
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,624
I think you came down
to listen deliberately.

316
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,501
We didn't mean to.

317
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,648
Eavesdropping is something that
nice young ladies just don't do.

318
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,106
You wait outside in the hall.
I'll talk to you later.

319
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,848
You should not be around children.

320
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,309
When you're at your best,
you're not for tender ears.

321
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,144
So now it's my fault, is it?

322
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,604
You'd better look to yourself

323
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,624
and not continue to blame
me for everything.

324
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,911
What's the matter with the duchess?

325
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,997
Rehearsing an exit in case
she finds the right play.

326
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,416
- How's Mary?
- Strong as a mule.

327
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,419
I don't know who's teaching
fainting here, but she flunked.

328
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,838
We've about reached the end
of our rope with that child.

329
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,049
Someone should talk to
Mrs. Tilford about Mary.

330
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,094
- You wouldn't be electing me, would you?
- She's your aunt.

331
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,430
Yes, but I'm not writing the
Tilfords into the marriage contract.

332
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,683
Incidentally, did Karen tell
you she finally set a date?

333
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,158
She told me, incidentally.

334
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,866
- What's the matter, Martha?
- Nothing.

335
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,860
I think there is.

336
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,405
I don't know what's bothering you.
I always thought you approved of me.

337
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,366
You must know how fond I am of you.

338
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,618
If it's the school you're
worried about, don't.

339
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,047
- Karen knows I have...
- Damn you! Leave me alone!

340
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,348
Stop consoling me, or...

341
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:13,381
patronizing me, or feeling sorry for
me, or whatever it is you're doing.

342
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,229
Leave me alone!

343
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,391
The angel child is just
coming back to life.

344
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,060
Her roommates were busily
eavesdropping at the door

345
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,035
when Aunt Lily and I were
yelling at each other.

346
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,248
Karen...

347
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,985
I think we should separate
those girls from Mary.

348
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,505
Yes. She's a bad influence.

349
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,741
- I have a class waiting. They're outside.
- I'll take care of it.

350
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,715
All right, girls,
you may go in now.

351
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,416
How does it feel to be
back from the grave?

352
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,142
- Did you meet any interesting people?
- It's my heart, and it hurts.

353
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,560
You like that story, don't you?

354
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,011
- I want to see my grandmother.
- We're awfully sorry, Miss Wright.

355
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,264
I'm sorry, too. You never
used to do things like that.

356
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,766
I'm afraid we're going to
have to separate you girls.

357
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,935
Peggy, move into
Helen Burton's room,

358
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,739
and Mary, change rooms
with Rosalie Wells.

359
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,983
- Miss Wright.
- And it's just because I had a pain.

360
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,735
You're always being mean to me.

361
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,112
I'm always getting
punished, picked on,

362
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,087
blamed for everything
that happens around here!

363
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,417
Tell Rosalie.

364
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,606
Help!

365
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,860
Are you leaving?

366
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,283
Not until I get paid.

367
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,807
- Good-bye, teacher.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

368
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,551
Now, go on. Why did Dobie
want to get rid of Mortar?

369
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,929
Dr. Cardin and Miss Wright
are going to get married.

370
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,808
- Everybody knows that. Stupid!
- But everybody doesn't know

371
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,728
that Miss Dobie doesn't
want them to get married.

372
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,564
- How do you like that?
- Why doesn't she?

373
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,735
I don't know, but Mortar
said that Dobie was jealous

374
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,863
and that she was like that
when she was a little girl

375
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,116
and she never wanted anybody
to like Miss Wright

376
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,743
and that was unnatural.

377
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,388
Boy, did Dobie get sore at that.

378
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,957
What did she mean by unnatural?

379
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,500
"Unnatural."

380
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,224
"Un" for "not." Not natural.

381
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,144
Then genius here dropped her book.

382
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,740
- What are you doing?
- My bracelet.

383
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,743
I still can't find it.

384
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,271
I don't like that Mary
Tilford coming in here.

385
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:02,203
- Come here, Sylvester. We're moving.
- Peggy says she blows her nose all night.

386
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,462
- I need $2.
- I don't have it.

387
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,799
You have $2.75. Get it for me.

388
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,194
No, I won't get it for you.

389
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,054
Get it for me.

390
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,056
- I won't!
- Get it for me!

391
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,701
- Let go of my hand!
- Get it for me!

392
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,230
Girls!

393
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,315
What are you making
all this fuss about?

394
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,067
I shall get one of my headaches.

395
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,820
I'm very upset today, with
all my packing and moving

396
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,374
and I cannot stand this noise.

397
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,136
Isn't that Helen Burton's
bracelet, the one that was lost?

398
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,222
I...

399
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,258
No, ma'am.

400
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,678
It's Rosalie's bracelet.
You dropped it.

401
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,645
In my day, children were
seen and not heard.

402
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,855
Try and be ladies.

403
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,026
Rosalie!

404
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,377
Now will you get me the money?

405
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,885
Keep the change.

406
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,372
I'm sorry, grandma.

407
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,541
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

408
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,889
Forgive me?

409
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,059
What made you act that
way, run away like that?

410
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,085
I told you.

411
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,838
- I'm scared of them.
- Nonsense!

412
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,342
- They've got something against me.
- I don't believe that.

413
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,762
They're always punishing me for
anything they can think of.

414
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,138
You imagine it.

415
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,891
Miss Wright and Miss Dobie
are nice young women

416
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,865
and good teachers.

417
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,121
You don't know anything
about them. I do.

418
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,951
I know lots of things.

419
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,209
Like what happened yesterday.

420
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,503
What happened yesterday?

421
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,756
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

422
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,091
- Because you're going to take their part.
- Very well, then.

423
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,709
It was all about Miss
Dobie and Mrs. Mortar.

424
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,172
They were having a terrible argument,
and Peggy and Evelyn heard them

425
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,049
and Miss Dobie found out.

426
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,218
That's why they're making
us change our rooms.

427
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,387
What's wrong with that?

428
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,140
They don't like to have us near them.
They've got secrets or something.

429
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,310
There's nothing wrong with
people having secrets.

430
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,784
But these were funny secrets.

431
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,458
Peggy and Evelyn heard Mrs. Mortar
say that she knew what was going on.

432
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,197
And they were talking
about all sorts of things

433
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,877
about Miss Wright and
cousin Joe getting married

434
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,797
and how Miss Dobie was jealous.

435
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,623
And boy, did Dobie
get sore at that.

436
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,418
I don't wish to hear anymore
of this ugly gossip.

437
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:52,270
Besides, I don't believe this talk of
jealousy between Miss Dobie and Miss Wright.

438
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,481
But I didn't say she was
jealous of Miss Wright.

439
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,519
I said that Mrs. Mortar said

440
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,664
that Miss Dobie was
jealous of cousin Joe.

441
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,369
I don't understand.

442
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,236
Neither do I.

443
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,197
But Mrs. Mortar said
that it was unnatural

444
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,671
for a woman to feel that way.

445
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,287
I'm just telling you what she said.

446
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,914
Mrs. Mortar said that
Miss Dobie was like that

447
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,043
even when she was a little
girl, that it was unnatural.

448
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,712
Stop using that silly word.

449
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,464
That's the word she used.

450
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,215
Then they got mad at each other

451
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,344
and Miss Dobie told Mrs. Mortar
to get out of the house.

452
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,639
- That probably wasn't the reason at all.
- I bet it was.

453
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,391
Because, honestly, Miss Dobie
does get mean and cranky

454
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,060
every time cousin Joe comes.

455
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,812
And yesterday I heard her
say to him, "Damn you."

456
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,482
You've picked up some very
fine words, haven't you?

457
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,151
But that's just the word she used.

458
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,905
One time, Miss Dobie
was in her room late.

459
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,490
It's right near ours.

460
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,117
And Miss Wright goes in
there almost every night

461
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,869
and stays late.

462
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,081
That's why they want to get
rid of us. Of me, I mean.

463
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,415
Because we hear things.

464
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,686
That's why they're making
us move our rooms.

465
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,143
I've heard other things, too.

466
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,063
Plenty of other things.
Strange, funny noises.

467
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,906
- And we've seen things, too.
- What things?

468
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,145
- Bad things. I can't tell you.
- You're annoying me very much.

469
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,939
If you have anything
to say, say it.

470
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,775
I mean, I can't say it out loud.
I've got to whisper it.

471
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,922
- Why must you whisper it?
- I don't know. I've just got to.

472
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,927
Mary, do you know
what you're saying?

473
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,269
Stop the car, John.

474
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,183
Stop the car, John!

475
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,657
Just a moment.

476
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,716
It's true.

477
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,560
You wait right here.

478
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,344
MY goodness!

479
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,631
Good morning, Mrs. Tilford.

480
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,008
I've come here to see Miss
Wright or Miss Dobie.

481
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:28,236
They're in class. I never carried
a suitcase before in my life.

482
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,866
Oh, dear.

483
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,953
I'll wait.

484
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,662
I guess I'd better cram
these things into this bag.

485
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,152
My theater maid usually
does the packing for me.

486
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,626
What must I look like?

487
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,659
I gave up a very important role in
Morning Sunshine just to teach here.

488
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,203
And now my niece has dismissed me.

489
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,475
Dismissed, after a year
of backbreaking work.

490
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,921
I sacrificed my youth for her

491
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,132
but I'm sure you
know all about that,

492
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,231
and ingratitude,

493
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,862
and the sting of the wasp.

494
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,768
Do you suppose I could get one of
those coats in that other bag?

495
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,446
Mrs. Mortar...

496
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:21,497
I've been told you used a strange
word in connection with your niece.

497
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,653
I've heard that you feel
there's something unnatural...

498
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,281
Something unnatural? Why, the
whole thing's unnatural.

499
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,617
You would think that a healthy
woman her age would have a husband

500
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:34,329
or at least an admirer but she
hasn't, and she never has had.

501
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,957
Young men who liked her,
yes, but not for long,

502
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:41,211
because she has no interest
in them, only the school

503
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,355
and Karen Wright.

504
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,679
Mrs. Tilford, at 28, do you spend your
life with other people's children

505
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,016
no new clothes, working every
night, nothing to look forward to

506
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,143
but a summer vacation
with Karen Wright?

507
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,855
And now that Karen's getting married,
Martha's in a frenzy of bad temper

508
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,982
and she's taking it out on me.

509
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:06,789
Friendship between women, yes.
Nobody's had more friends than I.

510
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,799
But not this insane devotion.

511
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,579
I'm forgetting
something, my umbrella.

512
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,803
I left it in the closet.

513
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,586
Perhaps it's all for the best.

514
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,422
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

515
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,341
I couldn't have stood
it much longer.

516
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,637
Here it is. Anyway, one
shouldn't be away too long

517
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,940
from his true profession.

518
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,115
My make-up case. I left it
upstairs. I'll be right back.

519
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,502
- Drive back to the house, John.
- Yes, ma'am.

520
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,514
- I don't have to go back today?
- No.

521
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,599
This week?

522
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,518
No, Mary, you don't
have to go back.

523
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,520
Ever?

524
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,188
Ever.

525
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:22,747
You're the nicest, sweetest
grandmother in the whole wide world.

526
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:48,101
John, please stop at
Mrs. Anderson's house.

527
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,821
Catherine, will you
please continue?

528
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,251
Rosalie, will you come
outside with me a moment?

529
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,346
Go ahead, Catherine.

530
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,803
Rosalie, your mother
has sent us a message

531
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:21,223
that you're to pack a bag and
spend the night at the Tilfords'.

532
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,323
- John will drive you.
- Why?

533
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,022
I'm sure it's nothing to
be upset about, dear.

534
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,857
Your mother's been
away and very likely

535
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,661
just wants to see you as
soon as she gets back.

536
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,631
John's outside. Don't
keep him waiting.

537
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,426
Yes, Miss Dobie.

538
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,497
I'm going to ask it, too. Why?

539
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:49,209
First Mary doesn't come
back. Now Rosalie?

540
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,763
I don't know. I just don't...

541
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,189
Another car's coming.

542
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,436
Rosalie Wells is here to
spend the night with you.

543
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,355
- What?
- Till her mother comes for her.

544
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,442
- You mean, she's going to sleep here?
- If you don't keep her awake all night.

545
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,527
Why?

546
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,738
How do I know the crazy things
that are going on in this house?

547
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,837
All right, come on in, Rosalie.

548
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,328
- Have you had your bath, dear?
- Yes, ma'am, this morning.

549
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,623
Better have another. I'll be
in later to make up your bed.

550
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,053
And if you need anything,
you just let me know.

551
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,102
Sissy!

552
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,860
But, Mrs. Walton, there must
be a reason. You don't...

553
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:00,916
- Mrs. Vincent, won't you please tell us...
- Come along, now.

554
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,591
She hung up.

555
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,599
- Did you get Joe?
- No. I tried twice. He's out on a call.

556
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,139
- Miss Janet.
- Are we coming back, Miss Dobie?

557
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,224
I don't know, dear.

558
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,476
All the girls leaving,
it's all so funny.

559
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,645
Come along. Your mother
wants you to hurry.

560
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,481
- Didn't Mrs. Webb leave us a message?
- Yes, ma'am.

561
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,400
She said have Janet's trunk
packed, and I'll pick it up.

562
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,830
- That's all she told you?
- Yes, ma'am, that's all.

563
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,300
Mr. Burton, don't you...

564
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:53,427
What is happening here?
Has everyone gone insane?

565
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:03,260
- I'm awfully sorry to leave, Miss Wright.
- Come on, Helen.

566
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:07,441
- We're sorry, too, Helen.
- Thank you. Good-bye.

567
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,610
Go on out to the car, Helen.

568
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,064
How much do I owe you for
the rest of the term?

569
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:20,336
We don't want your money, Mr. Burton.
We want to know why all this is happening.

570
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,362
If you don't know, I don't know.

571
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:26,199
You mean, you're taking your child out
of school and you don't know why?

572
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,201
It'd be better if you
talk to Helen's mother.

573
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,369
Why?

574
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,843
It's not the kind of thing
I want to talk about!

575
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,970
Mr. Burton!

576
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,727
Mr. Burton, you've got to tell us.

577
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:43,878
What would you say if I told you that
I knew why you were leaving school?

578
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,447
You're always pretending
you know everything.

579
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,574
You and your silly secrets.

580
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:54,079
Suppose I told someone it all happened
because you told me something.

581
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,427
Me?

582
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,468
I don't know anything to tell you.

583
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,138
That's not what I
told my grandmother.

584
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,714
Why, Mary Tilford.

585
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,508
I didn't tell you anything.

586
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:10,512
I'm going right down to your grandmother
and tell her I didn't tell you anything...

587
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,930
Whatever it is.

588
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,984
You're just trying
to get me into...

589
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,825
Why don't you go?

590
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,652
Wait a minute. I'll come with you.

591
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,173
- What for?
- I want to tell her all about this.

592
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,660
- What about it?
- Just that you stole it from Helen Burton.

593
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,996
I never did any such
thing. I borrowed it.

594
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,458
And I was going to put it back as
soon as I'd worn it to the movies.

595
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,460
I never meant to keep it.

596
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,588
I was putting it back yesterday
when you made me drop it.

597
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,383
And who do you think
will believe that?

598
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,468
And if I told my grandmother

599
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,847
she'd tell your parents and
everybody at the school

600
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,766
and the police, of course,
that you're a thief!

601
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,519
And you'd be put in a school
for delinquent girls.

602
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,324
Mary, don't tell anybody!
Please, don't tell!

603
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,000
See?

604
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,445
Whatever you ask, I do.

605
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,046
Wild horses couldn't drag
the secret out of me now.

606
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,743
- Thank you, Mary.
- As long as you do what I say.

607
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,012
Want to join my sorority?

608
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,350
Yes, I think so.

609
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:25,211
Put your hand on your heart,
and take the oath of allegiance.

610
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,754
"I, Rosalie Wells,

611
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,632
"am now a member of
the inner circle."

612
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,801
I, Rosalie Wells,

613
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,888
am now a member of
the inner circle.

614
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,724
"I will never betray
a sister member."

615
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:41,495
I will never betray
a sister member.

616
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,647
- Hello, Amelia.
- Good evening, Joseph.

617
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,357
How are you?

618
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,400
Tired.

619
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,250
We're getting the results of
the mating season about now.

620
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,072
Did I take you away from a patient?

621
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,950
No. I was just finishing
at the hospital.

622
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,424
I told you that on the phone.

623
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,760
Yes, of course.

624
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,958
How is the hospital?

625
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,419
- How is it getting on?
- Just the same.

626
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,893
Not enough money, badly equipped.

627
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,799
Amelia, you didn't call me here
to talk about the hospital.

628
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,319
What's the matter?
Aren't you feeling well?

629
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,489
If I only knew how to start.

630
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,405
Start at the easiest place.

631
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,078
It's a very hard thing to say.

632
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,114
Hard for you to say to me?

633
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,528
Did you know they dismissed Mrs. Mortar
from the Wright-Dobie school?

634
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,503
They did? Good. It's about time.

635
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,451
Don't you think it odd they
wanted so much to get rid

636
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,800
of that silly, harmless woman?

637
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:45,250
Lily Mortar is not a harmless woman,
though God knows she's silly enough.

638
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,460
She's a selfish old bore.

639
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,213
If you're feeling sorry for
her, you're wasting your time.

640
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,937
- You didn't call me to talk about that.
- Joe.

641
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,610
No, something else.

642
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:04,143
You've been engaged to Karen
Wright for a long time, haven't you?

643
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,445
Two years.

644
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,829
She doesn't seem to be
able to make up her mind.

645
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,485
It wasn't that so much
as it was the school.

646
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:16,614
- It was a tough job getting it on its feet.
- And there's Miss Dobie.

647
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:20,076
Yes. Anyway, it's all settled.
You can buy the wedding present.

648
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,879
It's official.

649
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,301
Well? No congratulations?

650
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,640
Joseph...

651
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,317
You must not marry Karen.

652
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,481
Why must I...

653
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,804
What are you talking about?

654
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,153
Why must I not marry Karen?

655
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,324
Because there's something
very wrong with Karen.

656
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,189
And there's something
very wrong with you

657
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,333
for thinking you can
talk to me this way.

658
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,878
I know what I'm talking about.

659
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,332
Who's that?

660
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,328
- Mrs. Tilford, is she in?
- I won't have them here.

661
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,664
- What are you talking about?
- I won't have them here!

662
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,388
Then you don't want me here either!

663
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,006
Darling, what is this?

664
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,634
- What did she do it for?
- What are you doing to us?

665
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,595
- I don't think you should have come here.
- What is all this?

666
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,264
- Hasn't she told you?
- Nobody has told me anything.

667
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,310
What's the matter, Karen? Martha?
Did anything happen at the school?

668
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,936
There is no school anymore.

669
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,105
The children have been
taken by their parents.

670
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,231
Why?

671
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,983
We couldn't find out.
Nobody would tell us.

672
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,401
Finally Mr. Burton told us.

673
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,171
- Told you what?
- That...

674
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,259
That Martha and I...

675
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,350
That Martha and I have been lovers.

676
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,396
Mrs. Tilford told them.

677
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,399
- Did you tell them that?
- Yes.

678
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,267
- Are you sick?
- You know I'm not sick.

679
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,787
Then what did you do it for?

680
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,206
Because it's true.

681
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,782
You think it's true, then?

682
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:27,537
- You crazy, crazy old woman!
- You mean, you did say it?

683
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:31,666
- You knew what you were saying?
- I don't think you should have come here.

684
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,597
I shall not call you names, and I
won't allow you to call me names.

685
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:39,257
And I don't want to talk about
it with you, now or ever.

686
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,718
What is she talking about?
What does she mean?

687
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,147
Where did you get this idea?

688
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,449
This can't do any of us any good.

689
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,616
Can't do any of us any good?

690
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,482
Listen, this is our lives
you're playing with.

691
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,126
Our lives!

692
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,279
That's very serious business for us.
Can you understand that?

693
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,116
Yes, I can understand that. And I
can understand a great deal more.

694
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,994
You've been playing with a
lot of children's lives.

695
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,468
That's why I had to stop you.

696
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,976
I know how serious this is for you,

697
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,169
how serious it is for all of us.

698
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,587
I don't think you do know.

699
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,672
You came to find out if
I'd made the charge.

700
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,147
You found out. I made it.
Let's end it there.

701
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,855
I don't want you in this house.

702
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,140
I'm deeply sorry this had
to be done to you, Joseph.

703
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,644
- Amelia, you've done a terrible thing.
- I've done what I had to do.

704
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,355
You know I wouldn't have
acted until I was sure.

705
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,150
What they are is possibly
their own business.

706
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:43,196
But it becomes a great deal more than
that when children are concerned.

707
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,989
But it's not true!

708
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,669
It's just not true, not
one single word of it!

709
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,997
We're standing here defending
ourselves against what?

710
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,543
Against nothing. Against a
lie, a great, awful lie.

711
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,188
I'm sorry. I can't believe that.

712
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,275
Don't get the idea we'll
let you whisper this lie.

713
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,228
You made it, and you'll
come out with it.

714
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,531
We'll make you shriek it.

715
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,164
And you'll do it in a courtroom.

716
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,833
Tomorrow, Mrs. Tilford, you'll
have a libel suit on your hands.

717
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,044
Don't do that, Miss Dobie.

718
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,552
- It frightens you, doesn't it?
- Yes.

719
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,998
I'm frightened for you,

720
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,677
because I know it will bring
you nothing but pain.

721
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,963
It was wrong of you to
brazen it out here tonight.

722
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,842
It would be criminally foolish for
you to brazen it out in public.

723
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,469
It's already quite
public, Mrs. Tilford.

724
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,556
Five hours ago, we had our
lives decently to ourselves.

725
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:55,101
Now we have nothing left but
the dirt you made of us.

726
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,121
The dirt you made for yourselves!

727
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,958
This thing is your own.

728
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,611
Go away with it.
I don't understand it.

729
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:09,712
I don't want any part of it.
Take it out of here.

730
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,342
Clean your house, Joseph, and
in time, count yourself lucky.

731
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,762
You have understood nothing.

732
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,769
These are my friends.

733
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,432
When we clean house, the three
of us will clean it together.

734
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,682
Maybe we should clean your
house for you, Mrs. Tilford.

735
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,485
Where's Mary?

736
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,812
Under no circumstances.
I wouldn't allow that.

737
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,366
That's where you really got it.

738
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,319
How could you believe a child
saying something as awful as that?

739
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,614
And how could a child that age
even know about such things?

740
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,574
She could hardly invent them.

741
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,951
She's a bad girl, your Mary.
She always has been.

742
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,037
I'll have no more of this.

743
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,331
All I wanted to do was
get those children away.

744
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,305
That's been done.

745
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,303
You've been in my
house long enough.

746
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,521
Get out!

747
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,743
The wicked very young.

748
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,284
The wicked very old.

749
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,324
Let's go home.

750
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,116
When three people come to you

751
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,620
with their lives spread out on a
table for you to cut to pieces

752
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,163
the only honest thing you can do

753
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,513
is give them one last
chance to come out alive.

754
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:48,064
We want that last chance. If you're
honest, you'll give it to us.

755
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,998
Mary!

756
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,973
Sit down, dear.

757
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,399
I'd like to tell you something.

758
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,267
Everybody lies all the time.

759
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,477
Sometimes they have to,
sometimes they don't.

760
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,605
I've told lies for a lot of
different reasons myself, but...

761
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,608
There was rarely a time when,
if I'd had a second chance

762
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,334
I wouldn't have taken back
the lie and told the truth.

763
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,949
I'm telling you this because I'm
about to ask you a question.

764
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,503
Before you answer the question

765
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:04,265
I want to tell you that
if you've made a mistake

766
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,806
you must take this
chance and say so.

767
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,353
You won't be punished.

768
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,767
- Do you understand all that?
- Yes, cousin Joe.

769
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:19,573
Were you telling your grandmother
the truth, the exact truth

770
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,183
about Miss Wright and Miss Dobie?

771
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,282
Yes, cousin Joe.

772
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,193
We're not through, Amelia.

773
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,653
Why don't you like Miss
Wright and Miss Dobie, Mary?

774
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,656
I do like them. They
just don't like me.

775
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,784
They're always punishing
me for everything.

776
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,662
- Why do you think they do that?
- Because they're...

777
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,956
Tell your grandmother
why you were punished.

778
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,168
Because Peggy and Evelyn heard
things and they took it out on me.

779
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:52,171
- That's not true!
- Heard what, Mary?

780
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:56,675
Mrs. Mortar told Miss Dobie there
was something funny about her.

781
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,845
She said she had a funny
feeling about Miss Wright.

782
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:04,225
Mrs. Mortar said that was unnatural.
That's why we got punished, just because...

783
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,494
That is not the reason
they were punished.

784
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,978
My aunt is a stupid woman.

785
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:11,899
What she said was unpleasant,
but it was only said to annoy me.

786
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,442
It meant nothing more than that!

787
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,694
What do you think Mrs.
Mortar meant by all that?

788
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,779
Stop it.

789
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,365
I don't know, but all the
girls would talk about it.

790
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,701
When Miss Wright visited Miss
Dobie's room late at night.

791
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,870
And funny things did happen.

792
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,415
We'd stay awake and listen, and
we'd hear strange, funny noises.

793
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,376
- I'd get frightened.
- Be still!

794
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:34,255
No, you don't want her still now. What
else did you hear? What did you see?

795
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,024
I don't know.

796
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,937
- They were just things.
- What things?

797
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,364
- I don't know.
- She doesn't know?

798
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,526
- I saw plenty of things.
- What?

799
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,103
One night they were in
Miss Dobie's room late.

800
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:53,250
And I looked through the keyhole,
and they were kissing and...

801
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,568
Like what I told you.

802
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,462
That child is...

803
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,406
Ask her how she could see us again.

804
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,325
I was leaning down by the keyhole.

805
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,845
There's no keyhole on my door.

806
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,429
What?

807
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,916
There is no keyhole on my door!

808
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,461
It wasn't her room, Grandma.
It was Miss Wright's room!

809
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,505
How did you know anybody
was in her room?

810
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:20,759
I told you. We heard them.
Everybody heard them!

811
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,097
My room is at the other end of the house.
It's impossible to hear anything from there.

812
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,223
What is this?

813
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,642
Why did you say you saw
through the keyhole?

814
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,687
I'm so mixed up! Everybody's
yelling at me at one time!

815
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,648
I did see them! I did see them!

816
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,748
Mary, I want the truth.

817
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,079
Whatever it is, Mary.

818
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:44,867
We're finished here. We've
cleaned your house.

819
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,161
- Let's go home.
- Wait.

820
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:51,558
Please, wait. Stop crying.
I want the truth.

821
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,472
All right.

822
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,350
It was Rosalie who saw them.

823
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,444
She told us all about it.

824
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:07,824
I only said it was me so I wouldn't
have to tattle on Rosalie.

825
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,118
You ask Rosalie.

826
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,655
She said it was when
the door was open.

827
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,241
And she told us all about it.

828
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,881
Agatha!

829
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,833
Get Rosalie.

830
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,511
Yes, ma'am.

831
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,233
You deserve whatever
you get, Mrs. Tilford.

832
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,686
I don't know anymore.

833
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,440
Maybe it's what I do deserve.

834
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,820
Rosalie...

835
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,602
Mary says there's been a lot
of talk at school lately

836
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,247
about Miss Wright and Miss Dobie.

837
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,541
Is that true?

838
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,289
'Can

839
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,132
I don't know what you mean.

840
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,634
That things have been
said among you girls.

841
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,051
What things?

842
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,933
What was the talk about?

843
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,919
Don't be frightened.

844
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,723
I don't know what she
means, Miss Wright.

845
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,134
Mary has told her grandmother
that certain things at school

846
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:10,689
have been puzzling you
girls, you in particular.

847
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,360
Arithmetic puzzles me.

848
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:20,040
- I guess I'm just not very good at...
- No. That's not what she meant.

849
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,911
Mary said that you told her

850
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,420
that you saw certain...

851
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:30,546
certain things happen between Miss
Dobie and myself late at night.

852
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,971
Once when the door was open,
you saw us together in my room.

853
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,634
Oh, Miss Wright,
I didn't. I didn't.

854
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,515
- I never said any such thing.
- Mary!

855
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,138
Yes, you did, too.

856
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,816
You told us about what you saw.

857
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,926
I remember...

858
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,220
It was the day that Helen
Burton's bracelet...

859
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,471
I never did!

860
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,474
The day Helen Burton's
bracelet was stolen.

861
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,851
And no one knew who did it.

862
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,436
Don't you remember?

863
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,898
Helen said that if her
mother found out who did it

864
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,954
she would call the police,
and have the thief put in jail.

865
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,656
Rosalie, there's no need to cry.

866
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,085
You must help us by
telling the truth.

867
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,592
Grandma.

868
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,553
Yes! Yes! Yes!

869
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:27,840
I told Mary! What
Mary said was true!

870
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:30,360
I said it! I said it! I said it!

871
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,571
It's cold in here.

872
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,076
Yes.

873
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,292
What time is it?

874
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,545
I don't know.

875
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,631
I was hoping it was
time for my bath.

876
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,509
Take it early today.

877
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,392
I couldn't do that.

878
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,933
I look forward all
day to that bath.

879
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:39,356
Makes me feel important to know
there's one thing I have to do.

880
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,233
Kind of a date with something.

881
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,636
Let's go out.

882
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,309
Take a walk.

883
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,028
What if we see somebody?

884
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,525
What if we do?

885
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,660
Come on.

886
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,098
We'll go tomorrow.

887
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,891
No, we won't.

888
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,536
There's our friend.

889
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,449
I knocked on the kitchen
door, but nobody answered.

890
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,923
You said that last week.

891
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,639
All right. Thank you. Good-bye.

892
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,598
Stop it!

893
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,926
I've got eight fingers, see?

894
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,605
And two heads! I'm a freak!

895
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,637
Martha, what are we
doing here like this?

896
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,809
It's as if we're in a nightmare
and can't seem to wake up.

897
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:04,148
You'll be getting married soon.
Everything will be all right then.

898
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,900
It'll be a good day

899
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,900
and a happy one for me, too.

900
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,785
What's wrong?

901
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,034
There's nothing wrong.

902
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,004
It's just that I don't know
what I'm thinking anymore.

903
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,963
That about sums up my
official duty, Dr. Cardin.

904
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,616
I don't have to tell you how much
we've valued having you here.

905
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,743
You also know this
hospital is kept going

906
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,412
by people who are meddlesome
as well as generous.

907
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,249
- Thanks for the speech.
- Joe!

908
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,126
Everybody here knows that
you're not guilty of anything.

909
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,379
It's a matter of association.

910
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,007
I feel sure that if you were
to sever your relationship

911
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,777
with these two young women...

912
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,239
I'm sorry.

913
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,071
Good-bye.

914
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,256
I don't believe it.

915
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,984
And here I am!

916
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,277
Hello! Hello! Hello!

917
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,278
May I come in?

918
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,536
My old chair.

919
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,545
It's very good to see you both.

920
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,752
How is everything?

921
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,673
Everything's fine.

922
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,299
How are you?

923
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,548
A little tired.

924
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,917
- It's been a long trip.
- Of course.

925
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,960
Is there anything I can get you?

926
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,047
You know, I would like a cup
of tea, but don't you bother.

927
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,227
It's no bother, no bother at all.

928
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,441
Why, Martha...

929
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,512
You know, I think...

930
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,611
Where have you been?

931
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:01,019
- Now, there's your temper again.
- Answer me!

932
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,773
I've been on tour, you knew that.
Mostly one-night stands,

933
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,193
although we did have one
ghastly week in Detroit.

934
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,862
But the theater's changed.
There's no question of it.

935
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,032
They simply will not accept
a serious play on the road.

936
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,951
Isn't that interesting?

937
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,453
Is it a trend? Will it pass?

938
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,498
I don't know. I really
just don't know.

939
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,751
I was interviewed in San Francisco

940
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,879
and, I said, quite frankly...

941
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,715
I said that perhaps a whole
culture is changing.

942
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,050
It's possible, you know.

943
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,719
You think so? A whole culture.

944
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,864
My, we'd be so interested
to hear about it.

945
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:43,353
- Why didn't you answer our telegrams?
- I told you, I was moving around.

946
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,563
How did you manage to
get out of the summons?

947
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,066
What difference does it
all make now, anyway?

948
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,778
Karen is quite right. Let's
let bygones be bygones.

949
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:55,532
Why did you refuse to come
back here and testify for us?

950
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,576
I didn't refuse. I was on tour.
That's a moral obligation.

951
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,881
I couldn't just leave.
The curtain must go up.

952
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,583
For goodness sakes,
let's not go on like this.

953
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:10,338
- My trunk's at the station.
- Things have changed here, Mrs. Mortar.

954
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,507
I don't suppose you've
heard about it...

955
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,760
Although it's been in every
newspaper in the country.

956
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:20,265
How we lost a suit for slander
against a woman named Tilford

957
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:24,102
who accused us of having
had what the judge called,

958
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,247
"Sinful sexual knowledge
of one another",

959
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:31,735
based on remarks made by one
Lily Mortar against her niece.

960
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,819
But, my dear...

961
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,197
A large part of the defense's
case rested on the telling fact

962
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,783
that Mrs. Mortar would
not appear in court

963
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:42,463
to confirm, explain,
or deny those remarks.

964
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,259
She had a moral obligation
to the theater.

965
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,668
It wouldn't have done any good

966
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:52,519
for us all to get mixed up in
this unpleasant notoriety.

967
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,896
But I do see it your way.

968
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,843
And now that I'm here,

969
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:58,845
I'm going to stand shoulder
to shoulder with you.

970
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,740
There's an 8:00 train. Get on it.

971
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,480
All my grown life, I've been
something for you to pick dry.

972
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,783
Now get out and don't come back.

973
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,486
How can you talk to me like that?

974
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:18,166
Because I hate you.
I've always hated you.

975
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,797
God will punish you for that.

976
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,596
He's doing all right.

977
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:33,473
I'll wait upstairs
until train time.

978
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:40,571
You'll be sorry one day for
what you've said to me.

979
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,725
Look who's here. A few
weeks late, aren't you?

980
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,686
So it's you. I call that loyal.

981
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,490
A lot of men wouldn't
still be here.

982
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:56,333
- You're a very lucky girl, Karen.
- Get out of here!

983
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,549
Why did she come back?

984
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,010
She's broke.

985
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,796
Stop it.

986
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,099
She's not worth all that.

987
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,065
We'll give her some money
and get rid of her.

988
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,352
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what?

989
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,326
Turn away from me.

990
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:36,203
I didn't turn away from you.
I was putting out a cigarette.

991
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,037
Karen.

992
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:45,410
We sit around here much
longer, we'll all go mad.

993
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,839
So we're not going to sit around.

994
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,375
- I sold my place this morning to Foster.
- You can't do that!

995
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,835
We're getting married this week.

996
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,087
You have two days to pack
and close the place.

997
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,923
- Thursday we'll be in the car...
- You can't leave here. I won't let you...

998
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,467
It's all done. I found a good
place that needs a doctor.

999
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,928
It's farm country. It'll
be tough at first.

1000
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,724
But we'll live cheaply. There will
be plenty for all three of us.

1001
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:10,768
Joe, I'm not going with you.

1002
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,353
But thank you, from the
bottom of my heart.

1003
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,123
You're coming with us.
We want you to come.

1004
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:18,919
It's going to be good,
starting fresh in a new place.

1005
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,791
You don't want to go.

1006
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,617
No. I don't want to go.

1007
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,203
This was my place,
where I wanted to be.

1008
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,914
And you don't want to go. You
wanted to stay here, too.

1009
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:34,792
We can't stay, so to hell with it. We're
going to a place where we can live.

1010
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,515
Joe's right.

1011
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:40,590
But I'm not going with you. It's
better for all of us if I don't go.

1012
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,967
Stop talking nonsense.
You're coming with us.

1013
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:47,148
Later on, you can leave if you want to,
when you have something to leave for.

1014
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:49,575
All right?

1015
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,120
All right.

1016
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,439
I think I'll cook us a dinner.

1017
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,665
A departure dinner, whatever
that is. Something fancy.

1018
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,624
I've done this to you.

1019
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:08,627
I've taken away
everything you wanted.

1020
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,631
Stop talking that way.

1021
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,210
There are a lot of people in
this world who have bad trouble.

1022
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:20,139
We happen to be three
of those people.

1023
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:23,841
We could sit around the rest of our
lives and live on that trouble

1024
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,094
and we'd get to where
we'd have nothing else,

1025
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,318
because we wanted nothing else.

1026
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,557
We're going to put the
whole business behind us.

1027
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:35,829
There'll be no more talk about what
could have been or should have been.

1028
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,480
I'm sorry.

1029
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:40,625
I'll be all right as soon
as we get out of here.

1030
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,333
Joe, I want a baby.

1031
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,446
I want to have a baby.

1032
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:49,217
Maybe in a year or so. We
won't have enough money now.

1033
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,705
But I don't want to wait a year. You
said you wanted children right away.

1034
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,349
Why have you changed?

1035
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,208
We can't go on like this!

1036
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,978
Everything I say is made
to mean something else.

1037
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,482
Yes, every word has a new meaning.

1038
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,135
Child, love...

1039
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,904
Friend, woman.

1040
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,696
There aren't many
safe words anymore.

1041
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:16,571
Even marriage doesn't have
the same meaning anymore.

1042
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,658
It does to me, and it
should to you, if...

1043
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,029
If what?

1044
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:29,425
If you won't try to
take the past with us.

1045
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,786
Wherever we go, that'll
be with us a long time.

1046
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,955
We can't move away from that.

1047
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:39,305
A new place, a new room
won't fix that for us.

1048
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,271
It won't work.

1049
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,631
What won't work?

1050
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,842
The two of us, together.

1051
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:51,397
Stop talking like that. You'll
begin to believe it soon.

1052
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:55,058
Tell me. Tell me what
you want to know.

1053
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,852
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

1054
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,999
We've both known for a long time.
Say it now. Ask it now!

1055
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:04,915
I have nothing to ask.

1056
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,295
All right, is it? Was it ever?

1057
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,928
No.

1058
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:20,763
No, Martha and I never
touched each other.

1059
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:25,139
It's all right, darling.
I'm glad you asked.

1060
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,399
My God! What's happened to me?

1061
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,303
I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean
to ask that. I never believed...

1062
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,971
I know.

1063
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,183
Of course you didn't, but after
a while, you weren't sure

1064
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,486
and then you began to wonder.

1065
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:44,367
You've been a good, loyal friend.
Don't be ashamed of what you felt.

1066
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,113
All right, good or bad, I've
asked, you've answered.

1067
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,697
That's all.

1068
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,750
Let's go ahead now.

1069
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,927
You believe me?

1070
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,301
Of course I believe you.

1071
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,813
Yes.

1072
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,642
Maybe you do.

1073
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,145
But I'd never know whether you did.

1074
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:16,360
And your saying it
again won't do it.

1075
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,851
It doesn't matter anymore
whether you believe me.

1076
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,372
All I know is, I'd be
frightened that you didn't.

1077
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,084
That's the way it would be.
We'd be haunted by it.

1078
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,944
Things would never, ever be
right between us like that.

1079
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,292
You know that.

1080
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:37,034
- Darling, I didn't know what I was asking.
- Don't be sorry. You can't help it.

1081
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,965
It would have been a miracle if the
poison hadn't reached you, too.

1082
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,676
But go away for a while.

1083
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,921
Go away from me and love and pity,

1084
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,850
and all the things
that mess people up.

1085
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:57,022
Go away by yourself
and I will, too.

1086
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,276
And after a while, I'll know.

1087
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,323
And you'll know, and
then we'll see.

1088
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:09,817
- Please.
- There's nothing for me to know.

1089
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,070
- A few weeks won't make any difference.
- Please!

1090
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,044
I don't want to go!

1091
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,094
Go now, darling.

1092
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,802
What will you do?

1093
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,392
I'll be all right.

1094
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,724
Go now, darling.

1095
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:37,813
If it's what you want.

1096
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,236
It is.

1097
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,199
I'll be coming back.

1098
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,910
I'll be coming back soon.

1099
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,421
I don't think so.

1100
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,931
Oh, God!

1101
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,480
Hold still!

1102
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,680
You're as nervous as a cat.
What's the matter with you?

1103
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:25,476
- I couldn't sleep well last night.
- Going to a new school, I understand.

1104
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,771
You'll like Elmhurst. Doris
Tanner thinks it's wonderful.

1105
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:31,148
Doris Tanner just likes horses.

1106
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:34,068
That's all they do
at Elmhurst, ride.

1107
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,654
It has a very high rating,
and you'll make new friends.

1108
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:40,004
You won't be moping around,
like you did all summer.

1109
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,973
What's all this?

1110
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:55,432
My compact! I've been
looking everywhere...

1111
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,687
And whose ring is this?

1112
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:05,400
This scarf and gloves?

1113
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,505
"Happy birthday, Helen."

1114
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,690
Mary!

1115
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:49,560
She made me do it!
She made me do it!

1116
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,355
Don't believe her! She's just
trying to blame it on me...

1117
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,873
Be still!

1118
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,206
Come here.

1119
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,227
No.

1120
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,728
No!

1121
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,060
I'm all right.

1122
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,987
Cooking always makes
me feel better.

1123
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:16,289
I suppose we'll have to feed the
duchess. Even vultures have to eat.

1124
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,483
I baked a cake.

1125
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,986
And you know what?
I found a bottle of wine.

1126
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,504
We'll have a good dinner.

1127
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,459
Where's Joe?

1128
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:29,460
Gone.

1129
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:33,716
A patient? Will he be
back in time for dinner?

1130
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:35,721
No.

1131
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:40,313
Then we'll wait dinner for him.

1132
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,311
What's the matter?

1133
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,192
He won't be back anymore.

1134
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:00,751
You mean, he won't be
back anymore tonight.

1135
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,671
He won't be back at all.

1136
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,710
What happened?

1137
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,712
Karen, what happened?

1138
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,808
He thought...

1139
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,053
it was true.

1140
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,105
I don't believe it.

1141
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,848
I don't believe it!

1142
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:37,450
- What kind of talk is that? I don't believe it.
- All right!

1143
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:42,066
Didn't you tell him? For God's sake,
didn't you tell him it wasn't true?

1144
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,459
Yes!

1145
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,712
He didn't believe you?

1146
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,297
I guess he believed me.

1147
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,300
Then what have you done?

1148
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,330
I don't understand.

1149
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,374
What do you mean, you
guess he believed you?

1150
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:01,724
I don't want to talk
about it. It's over.

1151
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,982
Lord, I wanted that
for you so much!

1152
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,484
What's happened to us?

1153
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,911
Whatever happened

1154
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,899
go back to Joe.

1155
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:28,330
- It's too much for you this way.
- Stop talking about it.

1156
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:33,117
Let's pack and get out of here.
Let's take the train tomorrow.

1157
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,451
The train to where?

1158
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:37,329
I don't know. There must
be someplace we can go.

1159
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,598
I don't know where it is.

1160
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:43,595
They'd know about us.
We've been famous.

1161
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,382
But this isn't a new sin
they say we've done.

1162
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,061
Other people haven't
been destroyed by it.

1163
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,905
They're the people
who believe in it,

1164
01:29:58,143 --> 01:29:59,820
who want it.

1165
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:03,206
Who've chosen it for themselves.

1166
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,451
We aren't like that.

1167
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,580
That must be very different.

1168
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,504
We don't love each other.

1169
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,494
We've been close to each other.

1170
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:20,844
Of course, I've loved
you like a friend,

1171
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:24,477
the way thousands of women
feel about other women.

1172
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:26,337
I'm cold.

1173
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,506
You were a dear friend who
was loved, that's all.

1174
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,217
Certainly there can be
nothing wrong with that.

1175
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,596
It's perfectly natural that
I should be fond of you.

1176
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:39,516
We've known each other since we were
17, and I always thought that...

1177
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:42,036
Why are you saying all of this?

1178
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,200
Because I do love you.

1179
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,252
Of course. I love you, too.

1180
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,135
But...

1181
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:02,039
maybe I love you the way
they said I love you.

1182
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,808
I don't know.

1183
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,473
Listen to me!

1184
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,611
I have loved you the way they said!

1185
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,528
There's always been
something wrong.

1186
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:27,036
Always, just as long
as I can remember.

1187
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:30,567
But I never knew what it was
until all this happened.

1188
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:32,461
Stop it.

1189
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,040
Stop this crazy talk!

1190
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:40,160
You're afraid of hearing it,
but I'm more afraid than you.

1191
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:43,747
- I won't listen to you.
- No! You've got to know.

1192
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:47,643
I've got to tell you. I can't
keep it to myself any longer.

1193
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,554
I'm guilty!

1194
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:52,390
You're guilty of nothing!

1195
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,604
I've been telling myself that

1196
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:00,982
since the night I heard
the child say it.

1197
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:05,936
I lie in bed night after night,
praying that it isn't true.

1198
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,160
But I know about it now.

1199
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,857
It's there.

1200
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:13,253
I don't know how, I don't know why.

1201
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:15,529
But I did love you.

1202
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,332
I do love you!

1203
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,091
I resented your plans to marry

1204
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,748
maybe because I wanted you.

1205
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:28,427
Maybe I've wanted you
all these years.

1206
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,879
I couldn't call it by name before,

1207
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,548
but maybe it's been there
since I first knew you.

1208
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,134
But it's not the truth.
Not a word of it is true.

1209
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,314
We've never thought of
each other that way.

1210
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,698
No, of course you didn't.

1211
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:45,736
But who's to say I didn't?

1212
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:50,866
I never felt that way
about anybody but you.

1213
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,373
I've never loved a man.

1214
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,793
I never knew why before.

1215
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,083
Maybe it's that.

1216
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:03,629
You're tired and worn out.

1217
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,163
It's funny.

1218
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,432
It's all mixed up.

1219
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:12,294
There's something in you, and you
don't know anything about it

1220
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,755
because you don't know it's there.

1221
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,774
And then suddenly

1222
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:20,778
one night, a little girl
gets bored and tells a lie.

1223
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:24,014
And there, for the
first time, you see it

1224
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:28,143
and you say to yourself, "Did
she see it? Did she sense it?"

1225
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:32,119
But it could have been any lie!
She was looking for anything to...

1226
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:34,496
But why this lie?

1227
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,833
She found the lie with
the ounce of truth.

1228
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,531
Don't you see?

1229
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,381
I can't stand to have you touch me!

1230
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,179
I can't stand to
have you look at me!

1231
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,095
It's all my fault!

1232
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:54,179
I've ruined your life,
and I've ruined my own.

1233
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,856
I swear I didn't know it!

1234
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,229
I didn't mean it!

1235
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:05,615
I feel so damn sick and dirty,
I can't stand it anymore!

1236
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,742
I have something to say to you.

1237
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,210
Let me come in.

1238
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,216
Please.

1239
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,342
You must hear me.

1240
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:18,517
Mary and Rosalie Wells have
admitted the whole thing was a lie.

1241
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,692
I have more to tell you.

1242
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,999
I tried to call Joe. He
wouldn't answer my call.

1243
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:45,085
But I've spoken to Judge Potter.

1244
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:48,759
He'll hold a hearing and
reverse the court decision.

1245
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:53,302
There'll be a public apology and
an explanation in the papers.

1246
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:58,310
The damage suit, of course,
will be paid to you in full.

1247
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:02,774
And anymore that you'll be
kind enough to take from me.

1248
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,495
So you've come here to
relieve your conscience.

1249
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:20,701
A public apology and money paid,
and you can rest your head again.

1250
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:30,669
Don't rest it! You've
come to the wrong place!

1251
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:35,298
There's nothing we want
from you, Mrs. Tilford.

1252
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:40,011
There's no relief that
can be bought for me.

1253
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:44,682
I didn't come here for that.
I swear to God, I didn't.

1254
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,730
There must be something I can do.

1255
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:53,490
Please?

1256
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,071
Please, help me!

1257
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,031
Help you?

1258
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:33,902
Please go, Mrs. Tilford.
We don't want you here!

1259
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,471
I'm going away someplace
to begin again.

1260
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,229
Will you come with me?

1261
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,743
We can find work now.

1262
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,832
Thank you.

1263
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,999
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

1264
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:17,627
I want to go to sleep.

1265
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,913
Martha!

1266
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,293
Martha?

1267
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:49,388
Karen, is Martha with you?

1268
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:57,285
Her door is locked.
I don't understand.

1269
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:14,265
"The Lord bless you and keep you

1270
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:16,785
"and make His face
to shine upon you

1271
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,896
"and give you peace.

1272
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:22,120
"Both now and evermore."

1273
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,302
Goodbye, Martha.

1274
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:44,354
I'll miss you with all my heart.
