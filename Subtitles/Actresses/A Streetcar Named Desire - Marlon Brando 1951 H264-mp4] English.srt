[man whistling]

4
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,626
Can I help you, ma'am?

5
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:15,922
Well, they told me to take
a streetcar named "Desire"...

6
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,592
and then transfer
to one called "Cemeteries"...

7
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,804
and ride six blocks
and get off at Elysian Fields.

8
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:24,139
There's your car now.

9
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:25,348
[bell ringing]

10
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,651
Thank you.

[laughing]

15
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,440
When he got home, she was waiting.

16
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,485
Boy, you never heard nothing like that.

17
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,159
What's the matter, honey?
You lost?

18
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,411
I'm looking for Elysian Fields.

19
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,206
This is Elysian Fields.
What number you looking for?

20
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,249
Six forty-two.

21
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,710
You don't need to look no further.

22
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,632
I'm looking for my sister, Stella DuBois.
I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.

23
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:46,136
Yeah, that's the party, all right.
You just did miss her, though.

24
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,055
BLANCHE: This?

25
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:53,519
- Can this be her home?
- She got the downstairs. I got the up.

26
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,729
Oh, she's out?

27
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,232
WOMAN: You notice that bowling alley
up the street?

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,026
- I'm not sure I did.
- Well, that's where she's at, honey.

29
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:03,319
She's watching her husband bowl.

30
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,408
[men yelling]

31
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,999
STELLA: Blanche!

32
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:20,087
Blanche, honey!

33
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,841
- Stella. Oh, Stella for star!
STELLA: Blanche!

34
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,303
Oh, my darling. Now, let me look at you.
But don't you look at me, Stella. No, no!

35
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:31,640
- I won't be seen in this merciless glare.
- Did you find our place?

36
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,642
What are you doing in a place like that?

37
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,437
Never, never, never
in my worst dreams did I picture...

38
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:40,191
Only Poe. Only Mr. Edgar Allan Poe
could do justice to it.

39
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,318
What are you doing
in that horrible place?

40
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:44,653
Oh, what am I saying?
I didn't mean to say that.

41
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,073
I meant to be nice and say,
"What a convenient location," and such.

42
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,201
- You haven't said a word to me.
- You haven't given me a chance to.

43
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,913
- Open your pretty mouth and talk.
- Come say hello to Stanley first.

44
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,458
- No, not now. Not now.
- Just say hello.

45
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,794
Oh, which is he?
Which one is he?

46
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,797
[men shouting indistinctly]

47
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:09,970
- Is he the one that's...?
- The one that's making all the rhubarb.

48
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,389
Isn't he wonderful-looking?

49
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:15,476
[men yelling]

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,231
Stella, I can't meet him now.
Not till I've bathed and rested.

51
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,984
- Would you like a cold drink?
- Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration.

52
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,991
Oh, my baby, my baby.

53
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:34,827
Would you like some pop?

54
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:37,205
Honey. Pop?

55
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,707
Not with my nerves tonight.
Scotch for me, please.

56
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,501
Grape.

57
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:46,798
You haven't asked me how I got away
from school before the spring term ended.

58
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:50,551
STELLA: I thought you'd volunteer that
information if you want to tell me.

59
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,011
You thought I'd been fired?

60
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:55,014
STELLA: No. I thought
you might have resigned.

61
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:59,560
Oh, I was so exhausted
by all I'd been through, my nerves broke.

62
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,815
I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.

63
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,233
So Mr. Graves...

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,401
Mr. Graves is the high school
superintendent.

65
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,195
Thank you. He suggested I...

66
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,198
I take a leave of absence.

67
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,450
I couldn't put all those
details into the wire.

68
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,702
This buzzes right through me
and feels so good.

69
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,831
- Would you like another?
- Uh-uh. One's my limit.

70
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:21,916
You haven't said a word
about my appearance.

71
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,961
- You look just fine.
- God love you for a liar.

72
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,713
Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.

73
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,133
But you...
You put on some weight. Yes.

74
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,761
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.

75
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,057
- Oh, Blanche.
- Yes, it is. Or I wouldn't say it. You...

76
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:40,060
just have to
watch around the hips a little.

77
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:42,062
I want you to look at my
figure, you know?

78
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,313
I haven't put on one ounce
in 10 years, Stella.

79
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,608
I weigh now what I weighed
the summer you left Belle Reve.

80
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,735
The summer Dad died...

81
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:51,737
and you left us.

82
00:06:56,911 --> 00:07:00,455
It's just incredible, Blanche,
how well you look.

83
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:06,586
- Sure you wouldn't like another?
- Well...

84
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,338
Well, maybe I will just
take one tiny nip more.

85
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,425
Just to put the stopper on,
so to speak. Now, don't get worried.

86
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,803
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up...

87
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:19,432
and hot and dirty and tired.

88
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:23,436
Waiter.

89
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,817
- You want it hot?
BLANCHE: Scalding.

90
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:35,698
- Stella.
STELLA: What is it, hon?

91
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:39,035
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.

92
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,953
We'll put you right here.

93
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:44,957
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?

94
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,418
- Feel all right?
- Wonderful, honey.

95
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,670
I don't like a bed that gives much.

96
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,257
Stella, there's no door between
the two rooms, and Stanley...

97
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:56,344
- Will it be decent?
- Oh, Stanley's Polish, you know.

98
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,679
Oh, yeah.
Something like Irish, isn't it?

99
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,306
STELLA: Well...

100
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:03,934
I bought some nice clothes
to meet all your lovely friends in.

101
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:05,769
Well...

102
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,812
I'm afraid
you won't think they're lovely.

103
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,066
Well, anyway, I bought nice clothes
and I'll wear them.

104
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,653
I guess you're hoping I'll say
I'll put up at a hotel.

105
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,114
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
I've got to be near you, Stella.

106
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:21,661
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because...

107
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,455
Because as you must have noticed, I...

108
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:26,457
I'm not very well.

109
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,377
You do seem a little...

110
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,754
Will Stanley like me...

111
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:35,174
or will I just be a visiting in-law?
I couldn't stand that, Stella.

112
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,178
You'll get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him...

113
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:41,597
- Oh, he was an officer?
- He was master sergeant...

114
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,600
in the Engineers Corps,
decorated four times.

115
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,602
He had those on when you met him?

116
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,480
I assure you I wasn't just blinded
by all the brass.

117
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,732
- Oh, that's not what I...
- Of course, there...

118
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,652
There were things
to adjust myself to later on.

119
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,072
Such as his civilian background.

120
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,283
How did he take it
when you said I was coming?

121
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,369
- Oh, he's on the road a good deal.
- Oh, he travels?

122
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:06,080
- Mm-hm.
- Good. I mean, isn't it?

123
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:09,125
I can hardly stand it
when he's away for a night.

124
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:10,543
Oh, Stella.

125
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,045
When he's away for a week,
I nearly go wild.

126
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,465
- Gracious.
- When he comes back...

127
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,593
I cry in his lap like a baby.

128
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:22,264
I guess that's what's meant
by being in love.

129
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,726
Stella.

130
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:33,606
I haven't asked you the things you
probably thought I was going to ask...

131
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:38,486
so I'll expect you to be understanding
about what I have to tell you.

132
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,946
What, Blanche?

133
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:44,659
You'll reproach me. I know you're bound
to reproach me, but before you do...

134
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:48,079
take into consideration you left.
I stayed and struggled.

135
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,623
You came to New Orleans
and looked out for yourself.

136
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,251
I stayed at Belle Reve
and tried to hold it together.

137
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,879
Oh, I'm not meaning this
in any reproachful way.

138
00:09:56,047 --> 00:10:00,175
- But the burden fell on my shoulders.
- Best I could do was make my own living.

139
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,761
But you were the one
that abandoned Belle Reve, not I.

140
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,096
I fought for it,
bled for it, almost died for it.

141
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,098
Stop this outburst.
Tell me what happened.

142
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:11,269
- I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
- About what? Please!

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,359
The loss.

144
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:20,779
Belle Reve? Lost, is it?

145
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,615
Yes, Stella.

146
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,118
But how did it go? What happened?

147
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,538
- You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
- Blanche.

148
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:34,083
You're a fine one to stand there
accusing me of it.

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,835
- I won't stay in this house.
- Blanche!

150
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:38,545
[train approaching loudly]

151
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:42,132
[train passes]

152
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:45,009
- Blanche.
- I... I... I took the blows...

153
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,095
on my face and my body.

154
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:51,516
All of those deaths,
the long parade to the graveyard.

155
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:55,770
Father, Mother,
Margaret, that dreadful way...

156
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,481
You just came home
in time for funerals, Stella.

157
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,317
And funerals are pretty
compared to deaths.

158
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,904
How do you think all that sickness
and dying was paid for?

159
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:07,240
Death is expensive, Miss Stella.

160
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:10,993
And I, with my pitiful salary
at the school...

161
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:12,912
Yes, accuse me.

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,124
Stand there and stare at me,
thinking I let the place go.

163
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,668
I let the place go? Where were you?

164
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:22,088
- In there with your Polack.
- Blanche, be still. That's enough.

165
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:25,925
- Stella. Stella, you're crying?
- Does that surprise you?

166
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:27,260
[men laughing]

167
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,762
Mitch, we gonna play
at your house tomorrow?

168
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,973
No, not at my house.
My mother's still sick.

169
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,768
- All right, you bring the beer.
WOMAN: Break it up down there.

170
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,355
- I made that spaghetti and ate it myself.
- Now, honey, I told you...

171
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:41,024
and told you
we were playing Jack's beer.

172
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,276
[men laughing]

173
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,862
What's so funny?
You never phoned me once.

174
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,113
MAN: I told you at breakfast.
I phoned you at lunch.

175
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,906
Why don't you get yourself in here!

176
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,554
MAN: Do you want it
in the newspapers?

177
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,535
WOMAN:
I'm sick and tired of chasing you.

178
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:11,219
You must be Stanley.

179
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,013
I'm Blanche.

180
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,265
Oh, you're Stella's sister.

181
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,017
Yes.

182
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,102
Oh, hiya.

183
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,021
Yeah, where's the little woman?

184
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,065
- In the bathroom.
- Oh.

185
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,906
- Well, where you from, Blanche?
- Why, I...

186
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,449
I live in Auriol.

187
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,118
STANLEY:
In Auriol. Auriol, huh?

188
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,872
Oh, yeah, that's right. Auriol.
That's not my territory.

189
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:41,250
Man, liquor goes fast
in the hot weather.

190
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:44,795
- You want a shot?
- No, I rarely touch it.

191
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,966
Well, there's some people that rarely
touch it, but it touches them often.

192
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,343
[Blanche chuckles]

193
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:57,016
Mind if I make myself
comfortable? My shirt is sticking...

194
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:58,893
Please. Please do.

195
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,437
"Be comfortable." That's my motto,
where I come from.

196
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:05,316
It's mine too. It's hard to stay
looking fresh in hot weather.

197
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,735
Why, I haven't washed
or even powdered...

198
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,780
and here you are.

199
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:14,243
You gotta be careful. You sitting around
in a damp thing, you catch a cold.

200
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,621
Especially when you been
exercising hard, like bowling is.

201
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:22,292
- Well, you're the teacher, aren't you?
- Yes.

202
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,795
- What do you teach?
- English.

203
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,422
Well, I never was
a very good English student.

204
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:33,344
- How long you here for?
- Why, I don't know yet.

205
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,012
You gonna shack up here?

206
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,975
I thought I would,
if it's not inconvenient for you all.

207
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,227
Good.

208
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,357
Traveling wears me out.

209
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,192
Well, take it easy.

210
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,402
[cat screeching]

211
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,820
What was that?

212
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,241
Oh, those cats.

213
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:55,659
[screeches]

214
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:03,584
Hey, Stella.
What did you do, fall asleep in there?

215
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,669
Huh?

216
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:10,715
Well, I guess I'm gonna strike you
as being the unrefined type, huh?

217
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:16,345
You know,
Stella spoke a good deal about you.

218
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,640
She said you were married once,
weren't you?

219
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,561
[Stanley's voice echoing
in Blanche's mind]

220
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,355
Yes.

221
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,150
When I was quite young.

222
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:30,776
STANLEY:
Yeah? What happened?

223
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,320
[Stanley's voice echoes]

224
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,529
The boy...

225
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,157
The boy died.

226
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,416
[gunshot, in her mind]

227
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,215
I'm afraid I...

228
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,385
I'm going to be sick.

229
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,848
WOMAN: Fresh fish!
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

230
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,224
[horn honking]

231
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,817
[man singing]

232
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:17,906
STEVE: Looks like she's staying a while.
- Yeah.

233
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:20,075
- Hey, Stan, are we playing tonight?
- Yeah.

234
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,409
STEVE:
Well, I figured maybe we...

235
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:23,745
STANEY: Forget about maybe. It's the same.
STELLA: Stanley!

236
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,393
- Oh, hi, Steve.
STANLEY: Put it down.

237
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,582
STEVE: Now I'll go get the other one?
- Yes.

238
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,793
- Thanks, darling.
BLANCHE: Stella?

239
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,002
STELLA: Yes?

240
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,420
BLANCHE: Is that Stanley
back with my trunk?

241
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,297
STELLA: Yes, Blanche.
BLANCHE: Honey...

242
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:38,093
- will you get my blue net out for me?
- All right, Blanche.

243
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,637
BLANCHE: It was so good of Stanley
to call for my trunk.

244
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:43,098
STELLA:
He was glad to do it.

245
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,767
STEVE: I'll see you later.
- All right. Listen, don't forget.

246
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,728
Honey, I'm taking Blanche
to Galatoire's for supper tonight...

247
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:51,314
and then to a show
because it's your poker night.

248
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,275
How about my supper?
I'm not going to Galatoire's tonight.

249
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,444
I put you a cold plate on ice.

250
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:59,614
I'm gonna try to keep Blanche
out until the party breaks up.

251
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:02,826
- I don't know how she'll take it.
- Isn't that just dandy?

252
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:04,953
So you'd better give me some money.

253
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:06,371
Hey, where is she now?

254
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,623
She's soaking in a hot tub
to quiet her nerves.

255
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,418
She's terribly upset.

256
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:12,961
Over what?

257
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:16,506
She's been through such an ordeal.
We lost Belle Reve.

258
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,467
- What, the place in the country?
- Uh-huh.

259
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:22,303
- Well, how?
- It had to be sacrificed or something.

260
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:26,224
Honey, look. When she comes in, say
something nice about her appearance.

261
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:29,102
And, oh, don't mention the baby.

262
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,021
I haven't said anything yet. I'm waiting
until she gets in a quieter condition.

263
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:36,650
- Try to understand her and be nice to her.
- All right.

264
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,944
She wasn't expecting
to find us in such a place.

265
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,448
- All right.
- I tried to gloss things over a little...

266
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:42,741
in my letters.

267
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,035
Admire her dress.
Tell her she's looking wonderful.

268
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,955
It's important to Blanche.
Her little weakness.

269
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:51,708
Okay, honey, I get the idea, but...

270
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,420
Now, let's just skip back a little, the way
you said the place was disposed of.

271
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,838
STELLA: Oh, yeah.

272
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,716
Well, how about
a few more details on that subject?

273
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:03,887
Honey, look, it's best not to talk much
about it until she's calmed down.

274
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:08,266
Is that gonna be the deal? Sister Blanche
can't be annoyed with details right now?

275
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,602
Well, you saw how she was last night.

276
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,147
I saw how she was. Now, let's
cop a gander at the bill of sale.

277
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:16,274
I haven't seen any.

278
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,944
What do you mean? She didn't show you
papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?

279
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:22,030
Seemed like it wasn't sold.

280
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:24,657
Well, now, what was it, then?
Giveaway to charity?

281
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,035
- Shh. She'll hear you.
- I don't care if she hears me.

282
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,078
- Now, let's see the papers.
- Honey, there weren't any papers.

283
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:33,499
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.

284
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,127
Wait. Now, listen, did you ever hear
of the Napoleonic Code, Stella?

285
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:40,589
- I haven't heard of the Napoleonic Code.
- All right. Okay, then.

286
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:43,634
- Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
- Yes?

287
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:47,554
We got here in the state of Louisiana
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

288
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:51,058
According to which, what belongs to
the wife belongs to the husband also...

289
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,643
and vice versa.

290
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:54,394
Will you listen.

291
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,772
Take, for instance, I had
that piece of property...

292
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,399
My head is swimming.

293
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,986
Oh, well, all right, dear.

294
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,488
Okay.

295
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,491
We'll wait till she's through
soaking in the hot tub...

296
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:11,286
then I'm gonna inquire if she's
acquainted with the Napoleonic Code.

297
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,497
Oh, Stanley, don't be so silly.

298
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,667
It looks to me like you been swindled.
And when you get swindled...

299
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:20,212
under Napoleonic Code, I get swindled
too. I don't like to get swindled.

300
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,630
Oh, Stanley...

301
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,424
you've no idea how ridiculous
you're being...

302
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:26,301
when you suggest that my sister...

303
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:30,265
or I or anyone else of our family could
have perpetrated a swindle on anyone.

304
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:33,685
Oh, come on, now. Where's the money
if the place was sold?

305
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,937
Not sold. Lost!

306
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:37,397
- Lost.
- Come here.

307
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:41,109
- Stanley. Ow!
- Will you open your eyes to this stuff?

308
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:44,112
- What, she got this out of teacher's pay?
- Oh, hush.

309
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,115
Look at these fine feathers and furs
that she comes to preen herself in here?

310
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:51,242
What is this article?
That's a solid-gold dress, I believe.

311
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,787
- Oh, honest.
- This one here. What is that, a fox piece?

312
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:57,540
- Stanley!
- A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.

313
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,917
Where are your fox pieces?

314
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,504
This is bushy snow-white ones, no less.
Where are your white fox furs?

315
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:07,466
Those are inexpensive summer furs
that Blanche has had a long time.

316
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,553
I have an acquaintance who deals
in this sort of merchandise.

317
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:14,140
- He's coming to make an appraisal.
- Don't be such an idiot, Stanley.

318
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:18,394
Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's
a thousand dollars invested in this stuff.

319
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:21,480
Well, now, what is that?
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?

320
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,901
- Oh, Stanley. Would you...?
- That's pearls, Stella. Ropes of them.

321
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,778
What is this sister of yours,
a deep-sea diver?

322
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,990
Bracelets, solid gold. Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?

323
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:32,533
Be still, Stanley.

324
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,785
And here. Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.

325
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:38,539
A rhinestone tiara
she wore to a costume ball.

326
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,334
- What is rhinestone?
- Next door to glass.

327
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:42,793
STANLEY: Yeah.

328
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,048
I have an acquaintance who works in
a jewellery store and he's coming...

329
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,966
to make an appraisal of that stuff.

330
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:53,305
- Here's your plantation fella, right here.
- You know I... Stupid and horrid.

331
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:56,642
You stay away from these things
before she comes out of the bathroom.

332
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,645
The Kowalskis and the DuBois
got a different notion on this.

333
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:03,523
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

334
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:05,943
Go ahead.

335
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,447
You come on out with me
while Blanche is getting dressed.

336
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:14,241
Now, since when
are you giving me orders?

337
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,536
Are you gonna stay here
and insult her?

338
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,039
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.

339
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:37,723
Hello, Stanley.

340
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:43,854
Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a brand-new human being.

341
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,439
Oh, that's good.

342
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:50,862
Will you excuse me
while I put on my pretty new dress?

343
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,698
Go ahead.

344
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,241
[Blanche clears throat]

345
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,417
Oh.

346
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,843
Thank you.

347
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,734
I understand there's to be
a little card party here tonight...

348
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,154
to which we ladies
are cordially not invited.

349
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,613
STANLEY: That's right.

350
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:38,491
Where...? Where is Stella?

351
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,786
STANLEY: She's out there
on the porch.

352
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,962
I'm going to ask a favor of you
in a moment.

353
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,799
Well, now, what's that gonna be,
I wonder.

354
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:57,218
Some buttons in back.

355
00:21:58,137 --> 00:21:59,971
You may enter.

356
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:04,976
How do I look?

357
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,728
You look okay.

358
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,230
Well, thanks. Now the button.

359
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,696
Well, I can't do no more with them.

360
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,865
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

361
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:22,035
- May I have a drag on your cig?
- Yeah, have one for yourself.

362
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:24,079
Why, thank you. It...

363
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:26,873
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

364
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,542
Me and Stella was helping you unpack.

365
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:32,879
You certainly did a fast
and thorough job of it.

366
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:36,424
Well, certainly looks like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris, Blanche.

367
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,343
Clothes are my passion.

368
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:40,845
How much does it cost
for a string of furs like that?

369
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:43,181
Why, these were a tribute
from an admirer of mine.

370
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,141
He must have had a lot of admiration.

371
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,144
In my youth I excited some admiration,
but look at me now.

372
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:52,189
Would you think it possible that I
was once considered to be attractive?

373
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,900
Your looks are okay.

374
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,070
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go for that stuff.

375
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:00,447
- What stuff?
- Compliments to women about looks.

376
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,493
I never met a dame didn't know she was
good-looking or not without being told.

377
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:07,789
And some of them give themselves
credit for more than they've got.

378
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:11,042
I once went out with a dame
who told me, "I'm the glamorous type."

379
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:14,379
She says, "I am the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

380
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:17,340
- And what did she say then?
- She didn't say nothing.

381
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:20,426
- That shut her up like a clam.
- Did it end the romance?

382
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:23,513
Well, it ended the conversation,
that was all.

383
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:26,724
There's some men that are took in
by this Hollywood glamour stuff...

384
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:30,395
- and there's some men that aren't.
- You belong in the second category.

385
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:33,064
- That's right.
- I can't imagine any witch of a woman...

386
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,232
- casting a spell over you.
- That's right.

387
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,734
You're simple,
straightforward and honest.

388
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:40,904
A little bit on the primitive side,
I should think.

389
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:44,408
- To interest you a woman would have to...
- To lay her cards on the table.

390
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:47,244
Well, I never did care
for wishy-washy people.

391
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:50,247
That was why when you walked
in last night, I said to myself:

392
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,624
"My sister has married a man."
Of course.

393
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,502
- That was all I could tell...
- How about cutting the rebop!

394
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,879
STELLA: Stanley!

395
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,091
Come on outside with me
and let Blanche finish dressing.

396
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,177
- I'm finished dressing.
- Then come on out.

397
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,429
- Your sister and I are having a talk.
- Honey...

398
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:08,557
run to the drug store and get me
a lemon Coke with chipped ice.

399
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:11,517
Will you do that for me,
sweetie, please? Please.

400
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:14,770
All right.

401
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:21,861
Poor thing was out there listening to us.

402
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,615
And I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

403
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:30,745
All right now, Mr. Kowalski, let us
proceed without any more digression.

404
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:34,707
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.

405
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,459
What is it?

406
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:42,548
In the state of Louisiana we got here
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

407
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:46,928
Which says, what belongs to the wife
belongs to the husband and vice versa.

408
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:49,430
My, but you have
an impressive judicial air.

409
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:53,476
If I didn't know that you was my wife's
sister, I would get ideas about you.

410
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:59,483
- Such as what?
- Don't play so dumb. You know what.

411
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:03,487
All right. Cards on the table.

412
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:09,284
I know I fib a good deal. After all,
a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion.

413
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,038
But when a thing is important
I tell the truth.

414
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:14,706
And this is the truth:

415
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:20,170
I never cheated my sister, or you, or
anyone else on earth as long as I lived.

416
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:24,675
- Where are the papers, in your trunk?
- Everything I own is in that trunk.

417
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:31,306
What are you thinking of? What's in the
back of that little boy's mind of yours?

418
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,517
Let me do that.
It'll be faster and simple.

419
00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:38,438
- I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
- What are those underneath?

420
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:42,484
Those are love letters...

421
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:44,903
yellowing with antiquity...

422
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:48,282
- all from one boy. Give those back.
- I'm just gonna have a look.

423
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:51,535
- The touch of your hands insults them.
- Now, don't pull that stuff.

424
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:55,454
Now that you've touched them,
I'll burn them.

425
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,873
What are they?

426
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,295
Poems the dead boy wrote.

427
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:06,382
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me. But you can't.

428
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,637
I'm not young and vulnerable anymore,
but my young husband was, and I...

429
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:14,682
Never mind about that.

430
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:17,394
Just give them back to me.

431
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,566
Thank you.

432
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:26,069
What'd you mean by saying
you have to burn them up?

433
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:31,575
I must have lost my head for a moment.

435
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:35,996
Everyone has something they won't
let others touch because of their...

436
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,498
Their intimate nature.

437
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,090
Ambler and Ambler.

438
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:49,092
Crabtree.

439
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:52,428
- More Ambler and Ambler.
- What's Ambler and Ambler?

440
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:54,221
A firm that made loans on the place.

441
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:57,183
- It was lost on a mortgage.
- That must have been what happened.

442
00:26:57,351 --> 00:27:00,102
I don't want if, ands or buts.
What's the rest of the papers?

443
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,773
There are thousands of papers
stretching back over hundreds of years...

444
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,232
affecting Belle Reve...

445
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,194
as piece by piece,
our improvident grandfathers...

446
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,780
exchanged the land
for their epic debauches...

447
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:12,406
to put it mildly.

448
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:15,618
Until finally, all that was left...
And Stella can verify that.

449
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:17,119
- Was the house itself.

450
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:20,873
And about 20 acres of ground,
including a graveyard...

451
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:25,002
to which now all but Stella
and I have retreated.

452
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,506
Here they are, all of them.
All papers.

453
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:32,968
I endow you with them. Take them,
peruse them, commit them to memory.

454
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,471
I think it's wonderfully fitting
that Belle Reve...

455
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:39,475
should finally be this bunch of old
papers in your big, capable hands.

456
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:45,607
I wonder if Stella's
come back with my lemon Coke.

457
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,653
I got a lawyer acquaintance,
we'll study this out.

458
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:53,698
Present them to him
with a box of aspirin tablets.

459
00:27:55,368 --> 00:28:00,831
Under the Napoleonic Code a man has got
to take an interest in his wife's affairs.

460
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:03,500
And I mean especially now
that she's gonna have a baby.

461
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,505
Stella?

462
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:11,924
Stella, going to have a baby?

463
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,472
I didn't know
she was going to have a baby.

464
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,396
Stella.

465
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:32,694
Oh, Stella for star,
how lovely to have a baby.

466
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:35,321
Honey, everything's all right.

467
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:36,948
We thrashed it out.

468
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,409
I feel a bit shaky,
but I think I handled it nicely.

469
00:28:39,577 --> 00:28:41,619
I laughed and treated it all as a joke.

470
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,456
I laughed and called him a little boy
and flirted. Here.

471
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,875
I was flirting with your husband, Stella.

472
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,210
The guests are gathering
for the poker party.

473
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:51,129
[men singing]

474
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:55,216
STEVE: Hi, Stella.
STELLA: Hi, Steve.

475
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,220
I'm sorry he did that to you.

476
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:04,434
Why, I guess he's just not the type
that goes for jasmine perfume.

477
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:08,439
Maybe he's what we need to mix with
our blood now we've lost Belle Reve...

478
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:12,359
and have to go on
without Belle Reve to protect us.

479
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:16,989
Oh, how pretty the sky is.

480
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:19,033
I ought to go there on a rocket...

481
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,868
that never comes down.

482
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:23,162
Which way do we go now, Stella?

483
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,788
This way?

484
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,999
No, hon, this way.

485
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,252
The blind are leading the blind.

486
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,670
Red hots!

[piano music playing in distance]

[knocking on ceiling]

489
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:53,858
Are you going upstairs
and tell her to cut that out?

490
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,486
If I go up, I won't come down.
Let's just forget it.

491
00:29:57,571 --> 00:30:01,241
Remember that night she poured boiling
water through them cracks in the floor?

492
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,630
I gotta go home pretty soon.

493
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,674
- Come on, what do you say?
- No, I'm out.

494
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:19,426
Every time you win a big pot,
you're out like stout.

495
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,720
I got a sick mother
and she don't go to sleep...

496
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,806
- until I get in.
- What do you say?

497
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,474
I'm gonna wash up.

498
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:30,771
- Stella?
- Yes, Eunice?

499
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:34,108
EUNICE: You tell them guys
the kettle's on the stove.

500
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,485
STELLA: I'm gonna
break up the game.

501
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:40,530
- What did she mean by that?
- She'll pour it straight through the cracks.

502
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,283
Stella, wait. Wait till I powder.

503
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,993
I feel so hot and frazzled.

504
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,662
- Do I look done in?
- You look as fresh as a daisy.

505

One that's been picked a few days.

506
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:55,002
Why don't someone go to the Chinaman's
and bring back a load of chop suey?

507
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,839
- I'm losing and you want to eat.
- Well, I see you boys are still at it.

508
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,091
- Where you been?
- Blanche and I took in a show.

509
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,885
Blanche, honey, this is Mr. Gonzalez
and Mr. Hubbell.

510
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:06,054
How do you do?
Please don't get up.

511
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,390
Nobody's getting up here,
so don't get worried.

512
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,019
- Poker is so fascinating. Could I kibitz?
- You could not.

513
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,353
Why don't you women
go on up to Eunice's?

514
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:16,439
STELLA: How long's
this game going to continue?

515
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:17,690
Till we get ready to quit.

516
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,859
You should call it quits
after one more hand.

517
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:22,862
STANLEY: Go up to Eunice's.
STEVE: Hey, that's my coat.

518
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:27,074
That's not fun, Stanley.

519
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:31,996
It makes me so mad
when he does that in front of people.

520
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,373
- I think I'll go bathe.
- Again?

521
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,876
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?

522
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:38,377
STELLA: I don't know.

523
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,838
- Oh, good evening.
- Oh, hello.

524
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,966
Blanche, this is Harold Mitchell.

525
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,427
- This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.
- How do you do.

526
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:49,513
- How do you do, Miss DuBois.
- How's your mother now, Mitch?

527
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,223
Oh, she's about the same, thanks.

528
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,060
She appreciated your
sending over that custard.

529
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:56,937
Oh, excuse me, please.

530
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,482
Excuse me.

531

[giggling]

532
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:13,079
- That one seems superior to the others.
STELLA: Does he?

533
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:17,123
- I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
- His mother's sick.

534
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,834
- Is he married?
- No.

535
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:23,422
- Is he a wolf?
- Why, Blanche.

536
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,759
- Well, no, I don't think he would be.
- What does he do?

537
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:30,262
He's on the Precision Bench
in the Spare Parts Department.

538
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,473
The plant that Stanley travels for.

539
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,767
- Is that something much?
- No.

540
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:37,853
Stanley's the only one in his crowd
likely to get any work.

Hey, Blanche,
you're standing in the light.

00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:47,446
Am I? Gracious.

544
00:32:49,116 --> 00:32:50,700
You ought to see their wives.

545
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:53,453
Oh, I can imagine.
Big, beefy things, I suppose.

546
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,747
- Do you know that one upstairs?
- Oh, yes.

547
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:57,666
Well, one night...

548

[both laughing]

STANLEY: Hey, you hens!

551
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,715
- Cut out that cackling in there.
- You can't hear us.

552
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:09,176
Well, you can hear me,
and I told you to hush up.

553
00:33:09,928 --> 00:33:11,178
BLANCHE: Stella.

554
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:14,974
Look, this is my house
and I'll talk as much as I want to.

555
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:19,187
- Stella, don't start a row.
- Oh, he's half-drunk.

556
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:21,398
I'll be out in a minute.

559
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,344
- Come on, Mitch, are you in?
MITCH: Huh?

560
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:53,888
No, I'm out.

561
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:55,723
Who turned that on in there?

562
00:33:56,975 --> 00:33:59,518
- I did. Do you mind?
- Well, turn it off!

563
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:02,688
Come on, will you?
Let the girls have their music?

564
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,565
BLANCHE: Stanley!

565
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:14,074
STEVE: There you are.
I didn't hear you name it!

566
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:16,118
STANLEY: Didn't I name it?
MITCH: I wasn't listening.

STANLEY: Looking through the drapes.

MITCH: I wasn't.
STANLEY: We're gonna play.

00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,043
We're gonna deal this hand again,
play cards or quit.

571
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:25,336
Deal me out.

572
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,380
All right, this game's gonna be

Yes?

Oh, hello.

576
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:47,526
Excuse me.

577
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:51,029
The little boy's room
is occupied right now.

578
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,906
Oh, excuse me.

579
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:56,408
- Have you got any cigs?
- Oh, sure.

580
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,579
Oh, what a... What a pretty case.

581
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:02,540
- Silver?
- Yes.

582
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:04,291
Yes, read the inscription.

583
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,585
Oh, there is an inscription.

584
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,004
Why, I can't make it out.

585
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:16,178
"And if God choose...

586
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:20,432
I shall but love thee better
after death."

587
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,434
Why, that's from my
favourite sonnet by Mrs. Browning.

588
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,603
- Why, you know it.
- Certainly, I do.

589
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,565
Well, there's a story connected
with this inscription.

590
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:30,191
It sounds like a romance.

591
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,611
No, no, it's a pretty sad one.
The girl's dead now.

592
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:38,241
She knew she was dying when she give
me this. A very strange girl, very sweet.

593
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:41,744
- Very...
- She must have been very fond of you.

594
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:44,789
Sick people have such
deep, sincere attachments.

595
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:48,334
- That's right. They certainly do.
- Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.

596
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,086
It sure brings it out in people.

597
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:53,298
The little there is belongs to people
who have known some sorrow.

598
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,301
- I believe you're right about that.
- Oh, I'm positive I am.

599
00:35:56,468 --> 00:36:00,555
- Hey, Mitch!
- Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...?

600
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:05,602
DuBois.

601
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,478
It's a French name.

602
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,772
It means "woods,"
and Blanche means "white"...

603
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,941
so the two together mean
"white woods"...

604
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:13,735
like an orchard in spring.

605
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:15,861
You can remember it by that...

606
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:17,446
if you care to.

607
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,823
You are Stella's sister, are you not?

608
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,534
Yes. Stella is my precious little sister.

609
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:26,163
I call her little in spite of the fact
that she's somewhat older than I am.

610
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,748
Oh.

611
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:31,627
Oh, just slightly. Less than a year.
Will you do something for me?

612
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:33,003
MITCH: Sure. Yes, what?

613
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:36,840
I bought this adorable little paper lantern
at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.

614
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,051
Put it over the light bulb.
Will you, please?

615
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:40,636
I'd be glad to.

616
00:36:40,803 --> 00:36:44,848
I can't stand a naked light bulb
any more than I can a rude remark...

617
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,725
or a vulgar action.

618
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:50,729
Well, I guess we strike you as being
a pretty rough bunch.

619
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,441
Oh, I'm very adaptable to circumstances.

620
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:56,693
Well, that's a good way to be.

621
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:00,698
- You're not...?
- Married?

622
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:04,035
Oh, no.
No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher.

623
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:07,747
You may be a schoolteacher,
but you're certainly not an old maid.

624
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,959
Why, thank you, sir.

625
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:13,711
I appreciate your gallantry.

626
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:18,049
So you're in the teaching profession.

627
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:19,842
Yes.

628
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,261
- Yes.
- Grade school or high school...?

629
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:24,806
STANLEY: Hey, Mitch!
- Coming!

630
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:26,891
Gracious, what lung power.

631
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:28,727
I teach high school in Auriol.

632
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:31,522
Well, what do you teach?
What subject?

633
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,776
- You guess.
- Well, I bet you teach art or music.

634
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:38,903
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Well, of course, I could be wrong.

635
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:40,571
You might teach arithmetic.

636
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,198
Never arithmetic, sir.
Never arithmetic.

637
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:45,575
I don't know
my multiplication tables. Nope.

638
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:48,161
I have the misfortune
of being an English instructor.

639
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:50,747
I attempt to instil
a bunch of bobbysoxers...

640
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:54,126
and drug store Romeos
with a reverence for Hawthorne...

641
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,919
and Whitman and Poe.

642
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,755
Well, I bet some of them
are more interested in other things.

643
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:00,799
How very right you are.

644
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,928
Their literary heritage is not
what they treasure above all else.

645
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,555
But they're sweet things...

646
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:12,019
and in the spring it's touching to see them
making their first discovery of love...

647
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:16,440
as if nobody had ever known it before.

648
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:18,650
Oh.

649
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,864
- Sorry. Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
- Have you finished?

650
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:28,493
- Oh, yes. Yes, I have.
- Wait, wait. I'll turn on the radio.

651
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:32,122
Turn on the light above now.

652
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,665
[waltz music playing on radio]

653
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,459
Oh, look.

654
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:38,295
We've made enchantment.

655
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:48,597
[Mitch laughing]

656
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:52,517
- Three bullets, moustache.
- Straight! I gotcha!

657
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:54,144
[both laughing]

658
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:58,147
STELLA: Stanley! Stanley!
What are you doing with the radio?

659
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:01,650
Drunk! Drunk animal thing!

660
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,486
- Get out!
STEVE: Hey!

661
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,821
STELLA: Go on, get out!
- Hey!

662
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,365
STANLEY: Let go of her!

663
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,826
BLANCHE: My sister
is gonna have a baby!

664
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,121
[yelling]

665
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,875
EUNICE: You come on
up to my place, honey.

666
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:20,504
BLANCHE: Sister, did he
hurt you, darling?

667
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:24,174
Poker should not be played
in a house with women.

668
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:27,303
STEVE: All right, take it easy, will you?
MITCH: Look out.

669
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:31,265
MITCH: Get him in that shower.

670
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,519
STEVE: Look out.
MITCH: Get him in that shower, I said!

671
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:37,230
Come on, all right.
Get his feet, will you? Get his feet!

672
00:39:37,397 --> 00:39:39,565
STEVE: Grab his feet,
come on, take it easy.

673
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,609
Come on, boy. Get under there.

674
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:43,361
Come on.

675
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,571
Get under there. There you go.

676
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,365
[Steve laughing]

677
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,700
STEVE: How do you feel, Stan?

678
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:52,870
MITCH: Stanley, wake up!
Hey, Stanley!

679
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,997
STEVE: We ought to
get his clothes off and...

680
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:57,625
STANLEY: Hey! What do you think...!

681
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:00,086
[yelling]

[punching]

683

MITCH: Poker should not be played
in a house with women!

684
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,385
STEVE: Aw, come on!

00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,055
PABLO: Hey! Where's Steve?
Come on.

686
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,141
STEVE: Wait. Come here.
Take it easy.

687
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:34,577
Stella.

688
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,248
Honey?

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,626
Hey, Stella?

690
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,381
Honey, where are you?

691
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,635
Stella?

692

[sobbing]

693
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,771
Hey, baby...

694
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,619
Look, you can sleep over here, Stella.
Blanche can have Steve's place.

695
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:17,828
[phone ringing]

696
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:20,396
He ain't coming home tonight
if he knows what's good for him.

697
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:23,125
STANLEY [on phone]:
Is my baby up there? I want her...

698
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:26,378
Look, she ain't coming down
and she ain't gonna talk to you neither...

699
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:28,881
so you might just as well
not call her!

700
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:39,183
STANLEY: Hey, Stella!

701
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:41,435
You quit that howling down there
and go to bed!

702
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:43,270
STANLEY: Eunice, I want
my girl down here!

703
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:44,480
You shut up!

704
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:46,440
- You're gonna get the law on you.
STANLEY: Stella!

705
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:49,026
You can't beat on a woman
and then call her back.

706
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:50,319
You're gonna have a baby.

707
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:53,572
I hope they haul you in, turn a
fire hose on you like the last time!

708
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,033
STANLEY: I want my girl down here!
EUNICE: You stinker!

709
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:08,914
Hey, Stella!

710
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,392
EUNICE: I wouldn't mix in this.

711
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:25,120
STANLEY: Don't ever
leave me, baby.

712
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,388
EUNICE: Blanche, come back!

713
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,334
MITCH: Miss DuBois?

714
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,628
Miss DuBois?

715
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:15,171
Oh.

716
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:19,466
All quiet along the Potomac now?

717
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:22,010
She ran down here
and went back in there with him.

718
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:23,720
- Sure she did.
- I'm terrified.

719
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:26,598
Nothing to be scared of.
They're crazy about each other.

720
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,975
It's a shame this had to happen
when you got here.

721
00:44:29,143 --> 00:44:30,977
- Violence is so...
- Sit down on the steps...

722
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,313
- and have a cigarette with me.
- Why...

723
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:34,940
I'm not properly dressed.

724
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:37,609
Well, that don't make no difference
in the Quarter.

725
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:41,822
Such a pretty silver case.

726
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:44,366
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?

727
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:45,826
Yes.

728
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:53,332
So much...

729
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,794
So much confusion in the world.

730
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:01,006
Thank you for being so kind.

731
00:45:01,174 --> 00:45:04,009
I need kindness now.

00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:27,658
Stella?

735
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:29,577
STELLA: Hm?

736
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,541
Stella. Oh, my baby.
My baby sister.

737
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:37,793
STELLA: Why, angel,
what's the matter with you?

738
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:40,170
- He left?
- Stan? Mm-hm.

739
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,629
Will he be back?

740
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:44,048
- He's gone to get the car greased, why?
- Why?

741
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:47,803
I've been half-crazy, Stella. How could
you come back to this place last night?

742
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,640
Please, Blanche. He was as good
as a lamb when I came back.

743
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:55,269
- He's really very ashamed of himself.
- And that...

744
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:57,771
- That makes it all right?
- No.

745
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:01,193
Stanley's always smashed things.

746
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:05,155
On our wedding night,
as soon as we came in here...

747
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,115
he snatched off one of my slippers...

748
00:46:07,283 --> 00:46:10,160
and rushed about the place smashing
the light bulbs with it.

749
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:12,204
He did what?

750
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:16,584
He smashed all the light bulbs
with the heel of my slipper.

751
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:19,128
And you let him?
Didn't run, didn't scream?

752
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:23,758
I was sort of thrilled by it.

753
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,761
Eunice and you had breakfast?

754
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:29,931
Oh, do you suppose
I wanted any breakfast?

755
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:32,850
You're so matter-of-fact
about it all, Stella.

756
00:46:33,393 --> 00:46:35,603
What other can I be?

757
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:38,314
He's taken the radio to get it fixed.

758
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:42,151
It didn't land on the pavement,
so only one tube was smashed.

759
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,445
And you standing there smiling.

760
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:45,988
What do you want me to do?

761
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,032
Pull yourself together. Face the facts.

762
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,575
What are they in your opinion?

763
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,411
BLANCHE: In my opinion,
you're married to a madman.

764
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:55,248
I've got a plan for us both,
to get us both out of here.

765
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:58,834
I wish you'd stop taking it for granted
I'm in something I wanna get out of.

766
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:02,337
BLANCHE: I take it you have sufficient
memory of Belle Reve to find this place...

767
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:04,714
and these poker players impossible
to live with.

768
00:47:04,882 --> 00:47:07,716
- You take too much for granted.
- I can't believe you're in earnest.

769
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:10,052
- No?
- I understand what happened a little.

770
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,888
You saw him first in uniform,
an officer, not here.

771
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:15,599
STELLA: I'm not sure it makes
any difference where I saw him.

772
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:19,311
What you're talking about is desire,
just brutal desire.

773
00:47:19,479 --> 00:47:22,815
The name of that rattletrap street car
that bangs through the Quarter.

774
00:47:22,983 --> 00:47:25,150
Up one old, narrow street
and down another.

775
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:28,237
Haven't you ever ridden
on that street car?

776
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:32,992
It brought me here.

777
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,411
Where I'm not wanted...

778
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,246
and where I'm ashamed to be.

779
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:40,666
Don't you think your superior attitude's
a little out of place?

780
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:42,918
BLANCHE: A man like that...
STELLA: I told you I love him.

781
00:47:43,086 --> 00:47:44,795
BLANCHE: I tremble for you,
I just tremble.

782
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,839
- Hi, Stanley.
- Hi.

783
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:51,969
[train approaching loudly]

784
00:47:58,393 --> 00:48:00,853
May I speak plainly?

785
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:05,316
Yes, do. Go ahead, as plainly
as you want to.

786
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:08,235
Well, if you'll forgive me...

787
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:10,529
he's common.

788
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:16,493
Yes, I suppose he is.

789
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:18,537
Suppose?

790
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:22,040
Surely you can't have forgotten
that much of our upbringing, Stella...

791
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:25,835
that you just suppose there's
any part of a gentleman in his nature.

792
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,713
Oh, you're hating me saying this,
aren't you?

793
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,216
Go on and say it all, Blanche.

794
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:37,556
He's like an animal.

795
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,767
Has an animal's habits.

796
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:42,895
There's even something
subhuman about him.

797
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:46,565
Thousands of years have passed him
right by and there he is...

798
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:49,568
Stanley Kowalski,
survivor of the Stone Age.

799
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:52,863
Bearing the raw meat home
from the kill in the jungle. And you...

800
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:54,406
you here waiting for him.

801
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:57,242
Maybe he'll strike you
or maybe grunt and kiss you.

802
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,746
That's if kisses have been discovered
yet. His "poker night," you call it.

803
00:49:00,914 --> 00:49:02,247
His party of apes?

804
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:06,627
Maybe we are a long way
from being made in God's image.

805
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:09,254
But, Stella, my sister...

806
00:49:09,422 --> 00:49:11,924
there's been some progress
since then.

807
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:15,094
Such things as art, as poetry,
as music.

808
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:17,346
In some kinds of people...

809
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:20,599
some tenderer feelings have had
some little beginning...

810
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,519
that we have got to make grow
and to cling to...

811
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:28,315
as our flag in this dark march
toward whatever it is we're approaching.

812
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:32,276
Don't, don't hang back
with the brutes.

813
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:39,158
[door opening]

814
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,370
[Stanley whistling]

815
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,955
[banging]

816
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,001
[Stanley continues whistling]

817
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:12,734
STANLEY: Hey, Stell?

818
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:21,242
Hey, Stell?

819
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,417
- Hiya.
STELLA: Hi.

820
00:50:34,006 --> 00:50:35,840
Hey, is Blanche back yet?

821
00:50:38,844 --> 00:50:40,887
Yeah, she's back.

822
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:43,598
Oh, hi there, Blanche.

823
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,642
You look like you got under the car.

824
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:52,356
That mechanic down at Fritz's doesn't
know his axle grease from third base.

825
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:07,246
STANLEY: Hey!

826
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:08,581
[laughing]

827
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,212
STEVE: Don't throw
that thing at me! Eunice!

828
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,297
You brick redhead,
I'll play with you!

829
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:18,466
You wanna play with me,
I'll play games with you!

830
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:19,675
[Eunice screaming]

831
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,386
That's just what I gave your
brother, you big redhead!

832
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,390
EUNICE: He hit me!
And I'm gonna call the police!

833
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,603
Some of your sister's friends
have stayed in the city.

834
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:32,146
[both laughing]

835
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:38,069
- Did Eunice get the police?
- No, she's getting a drink...

836
00:51:38,237 --> 00:51:41,072
- at the Four Deuces.
- That's much more practical.

837
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:44,784
Blanche is making us
some new slip covers, honey.

838
00:51:46,078 --> 00:51:47,328
Hey, is she here?

839
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:49,497
She went to the Four Deuces.

840
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,332
That no-good, rotten...

841
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:58,588
Hey, Stella, I can't find
my other pair of shoes.

842
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,341
We cleaned in there.

843
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:02,800
I'll get them.

844
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:07,513
I can't find nothing
around this dump anymore.

845
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:12,393
Oh, Stanley.

846
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,645
What sign were you born under?

847
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:18,107
- What sign?
- Astrological sign.

848
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:19,942
I bet you were born under Aries.

849
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:23,152
Aries people are forceful, dynamic,
they dote on noise.

850
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,988
They love to bang things around.

851
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:27,949
Stanley was born just five minutes
after Christmas.

852
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:30,702
Capricorn, the goat!

853
00:52:43,091 --> 00:52:44,466
Say...

854
00:52:44,634 --> 00:52:47,219
do you happen to know
somebody named Shaw?

855
00:52:48,763 --> 00:52:52,641
Why... Why, everybody knows
someone by the name of Shaw.

856
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:57,646
This somebody named Shaw is under
the impression that he met you in Auriol.

857
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:00,900
I figure he must have got you
mixed up with some other party...

858
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:03,152
because this other party
is somebody...

859
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,571
that he met at a hotel
called the Flamingo.

860
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:09,658
Why, I guess he does have me
mixed up with this other party.

861
00:53:09,826 --> 00:53:13,872
The Hotel Flamingo is not a place
that I would dare to be seen in.

862
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,291
Oh, you know it then?

863
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,753
I've seen it and smelled it.

864
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:22,213
You must've got pretty close
if you could smell it.

865
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:25,759
The odour of cheap perfume
is penetrating.

866
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,637
Is that stuff you use expensive?

867
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,264
Twelve dollars an ounce. I'm nearly out.

868
00:53:31,432 --> 00:53:34,184
That's just a hint if you want to
remember my birthday.

869
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,565
I figure that he must have
got you mixed up...

870
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:44,068
but he goes in and out
of Auriol all the time...

871
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:47,029
so he can check and clear up
any mistake.

872
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:55,162
- I'll see you at the Four Deuces.
- Hey, don't I rate a kiss?

873
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,790
No, not in front of your sister.

874
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:02,753
[thunder rumbling]

875
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:11,554
Don't cry. I only do that with other girls
because I love you, baby.

876
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:13,180
Don't cry.

877
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:22,648
Stella.

878
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:24,942
You still scared of thunder?

879
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:27,486
What have you heard about me?

880
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:28,904
STELLA:
Huh?

881
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:32,783
What have people been
telling you about me?

882
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:37,955
- Telling?
- You haven't heard...

883
00:54:38,123 --> 00:54:41,083
any unkind gossip about me?

884
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:44,545
Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.

885
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:49,550
Honey, there was
quite a lot of talk in Auriol.

886
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:52,594
People talk, who cares?

887
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:55,764
I haven't been so awfully good
the last year or so, since...

888
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:58,684
Since Belle Reve started to slip
through my fingers.

889
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,227
Honey, all of us do things...

890
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:03,105
I never was hard
or self-sufficient enough.

891
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:04,522
Soft people...

892
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,151
Soft people have got to
court the favour of hard ones, Stella.

893
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:10,445
You've got to shimmer and glow.

894
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,364
I don't know how much longer
I can turn the trick.

895
00:55:13,532 --> 00:55:15,616
It isn't enough to be soft.

896
00:55:15,784 --> 00:55:19,245
You've got to be soft and attractive.

897
00:55:19,413 --> 00:55:20,913
And I...

898
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:23,291
I'm fading now.

899
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:31,800
Have you been listening to me?

900
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:34,887
I never listen to you
when you're being morbid.

901
00:55:42,854 --> 00:55:44,146
Oh.

902
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,315
Is that Coke for me?

903
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:50,402
- Not for anyone else.
- You precious lamb. Is it just a Coke?

904
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,490
- You mean you want a shot in it?
- A shot never did a Coke any harm.

905
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:55,908
Oh, let me.

906
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,534
You mustn't wait on me.

907
00:55:57,702 --> 00:56:01,872
I like to wait on you, Blanche.
It makes it seem more like home.

908
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,626
I have to admit, I...

909
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:08,712
I love to be waited on.

910
00:56:10,006 --> 00:56:11,632
Blanche.

911
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:14,927
Blanche, honey, what is it?

912
00:56:15,095 --> 00:56:17,096
BLANCHE: Oh, you're so
good to me, and I...

913
00:56:17,263 --> 00:56:19,848
- Now, Blanche.
- I know you hate me to talk sentimental...

914
00:56:20,016 --> 00:56:22,351
but believe me, honey,
I feel more than I tell you.

915
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:24,685
I won't stay long, I won't.
I promise.

916
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:27,396
- Now, Blanche.
- I'll go. I'll go soon.

917
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:30,733
I won't hang around
till he throws me out.

918
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:33,360
- Now, will you stop talking foolish?
- Yes.

919
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:34,611
Only watch how you pour it!

[Blanche screams]

00:56:35,988 --> 00:56:37,280
STELLA: Heavens.

922
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,824
Right on my...

923
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,283
pretty...

924
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:42,452
- pink skirt.
- Here. Use my hankie.

925
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,038
- Blot gently.
- I know.

926
00:56:45,206 --> 00:56:46,540
Gently...

927
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,250
gently...

928
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:49,709
gently.

929
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:51,461
Did it stain?

930
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:54,131
No.

931
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:55,632
No, not a bit.

932
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,967
[laughing]

933
00:56:57,176 --> 00:56:59,386
Isn't that lucky?

934
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:02,305
Why did you scream like that?

935
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:06,226
I don't know why I screamed.

936
00:57:08,396 --> 00:57:09,688
Mitch...

937
00:57:09,856 --> 00:57:11,565
Mitch is coming at 7.

938
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:14,067
I guess I'm a little nervous
about our relations.

939
00:57:14,235 --> 00:57:17,821
He hasn't gotten anything more than a
good-night kiss. That's all I've given him.

940
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:21,116
I want his respect. And men don't want
anything they get too easy.

941
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:24,953
On the other hand, men lose interest
quickly, especially when a girl is over...

942
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:26,413
Over 30.

943
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:30,083
When I mentioned marriage
they even forgot where I lived, so...

944
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,753
So, you see, I haven't informed him
of my real age.

945
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:37,757
Honey, why are you so sensitive
about your age?

946
00:57:37,925 --> 00:57:42,012
Because of hard knocks
my vanity has been given.

947
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,513
What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort of...

948
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:46,557
prim and proper, you know.

949
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:48,434
I want to deceive him...

950
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:51,438
just enough to make him want me.

951
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,857
Darling...

952
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:55,984
do you want him?

953
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:02,157
I want to rest.

954
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,578
I want to breathe quietly again.

955
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:08,955
Yes, I want Mitch.

956
00:58:09,123 --> 00:58:10,790
Very badly.

957
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,293
Just think, if it happens...

958
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:17,798
I can go away from here
and not be anyone's problem.

959
00:58:19,468 --> 00:58:21,636
Blanche, it will happen.

960
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:25,514
It will?

961
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,810
It will, honey, it will.

962
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:34,815
Only, don't take another drink.

Well, well.

- What can I do for you?
- Well, I'm collecting for the Evening Star.

took up collections.

I was joking. Feebly.

Will you...? Will you have a drink?

No, ma'am.

00:59:57,523 --> 01:00:00,442
No, thank you.
I can't drink on the job.

01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:07,532
Oh.

985
01:00:19,046 --> 01:00:21,088
Well, now, let me see.

986
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:28,511
No, no. I don't have a dime.

987

I'm not the lady of the house.
I'm her sister from Mississippi.

988
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:36,853
I'm one of those poor relations
you've heard tell about.

989
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:39,439
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
I'll come back later.

Hey.

01:00:42,026 --> 01:00:43,777
Have you...?

992
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,988
- Have you got a light?
- Sure.

993
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:58,666
- This doesn't always work.
- It's temperamental.

994
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,342
Why, thanks.

So late?

1001
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:26,568
Don't you love these long,
rainy afternoons in New Orleans...

1002
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:28,737
when an hour isn't just an hour...

1003
01:01:28,905 --> 01:01:32,574
but a little piece of eternity
dropped in our hands...

01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:36,412
and who knows what to do with it?

No, ma'am. I stepped inside.

Did anyone ever tell you, you look like a
young prince out of the Arabian Nights?

1018

You do, honey lamb.

Come here.

1020

Come on over here, like I told you.

I want to kiss you just once...

1022

softly...

1023

and sweetly on your mouth.

Run away now, quickly.

1025
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,280
It'd be nice to keep you,
but I've got to be good...

1026
01:02:53,448 --> 01:02:55,407
and keep my hands off children.

1027

Adiós.

Oh, bow to me first.

Hiya, Mitch.

1036
01:03:51,754 --> 01:03:55,215
I'm afraid you haven't had much
fun out of this evening, Blanche.

1037
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:58,426
- I spoiled it for you.
- No, you didn't.

1038
01:03:58,594 --> 01:04:01,930
BLANCHE: I simply couldn't rise
to the occasion, that was all.

1039
01:04:02,098 --> 01:04:06,142
I don't think I've ever tried so hard to be
gay and made such a dismal mess of it.

1040
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,938
I get ten points for trying.
I did try.

1041
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,318
Hello, moon.

1042
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:18,697
I'm looking for the Pleiades...

the Seven Sisters...

1044
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,367
but these girls aren't out tonight.

1045
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:23,994
Oh, yes, they are.

1046
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,829
There they are, God bless them.

1047
01:04:25,997 --> 01:04:28,664
All in a bunch, going home
from their little bridge party.

1048
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,583
May I kiss you?

1049
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,793
Why do you always ask me if you may?

1050
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:36,338
- I don't know if you want me to or not.
- Why should you be so doubtful?

1051
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,340
We parked by the lake,
and I kissed you...

1052
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:41,677
Honey, it wasn't the kiss I
objected to. I liked the kiss very much.

1053
01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:45,014
It was the other little familiarity
that I felt obliged to discourage.

1054
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,267
Not that I resented it,
not a bit in the world.

1055
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:50,895
In fact, I was somewhat flattered
that you desired me.

1056
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:54,941
But you know as well as I do that
a single girl, a girl alone in the world...

1057
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:57,319
has got to keep a firm hold
on her emotions...

1058
01:04:57,486 --> 01:05:00,447
- or she'll be lost.
- Lost?

1059
01:05:00,615 --> 01:05:04,284
I guess you're used to
the type of girl that likes to be lost.

1060
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:08,413
I like you to be exactly
the way that you are...

1061
01:05:08,873 --> 01:05:12,125
because in all my experience,
I have never known anyone like you.

No.

No, honey.

I'm not laughing at you.

1067

Well, come on,
let's finish our nightcap.

1068

You've been so anxious and solemn
all evening.

We've both been anxious and solemn.

And now for these last few remaining
moments of our lives together...

That's good.

We're going to be very bohemian.

1076

We are gonna pretend we're sitting in an
artists' café on the Left Bank in Paris.

01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:10,182
Oh. Well, why don't you sit down.
Take off your coat. Loosen your collar.

1080
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,602
- No, I better leave it on.
- No. I want you to be comfortable.

1081
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:17,064
No, I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt is sticking to me.

1082
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:22,027
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't
perspire, they would die in five minutes.

1083
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,613
Oh, this is a nice coat.
What...?

1084
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,825
- What material is it?
- They call this stuff alpaca.

1085
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:30,953
- Oh, alpaca.
- It's very lightweight alpaca.

1086
01:06:31,246 --> 01:06:33,956
- Oh, lightweight alpaca.
- Yes.

1087
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:37,794
I don't like to wear a watch coat even in
the summer because I sweat through it.

1088
01:06:37,962 --> 01:06:39,462
And it don't look neat on me.

1089
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:43,633
A man with a heavy build is careful of
what he wears so he don't look clumsy.

1090
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:46,886
- Why, you're not too heavy.
- You don't think I am?

1091
01:06:47,054 --> 01:06:48,888
You're not the delicate type.

1092
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:53,476
You have a massive bone structure
and a very imposing physique.

1093
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,229
I thank you.

1094
01:06:56,981 --> 01:07:00,275
At Christmas, I was given a membership
to the New Orleans Sports Club.

1095
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:03,695
- Oh, good.
- It's the finest present I was ever given.

1096
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:08,491
I work out there with the weights
and I swim. I keep myself fit.

1097
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:12,078
When I started there I was soft
in the belly, but now my belly is hard.

1098
01:07:12,246 --> 01:07:15,957
It's so hard now a man can punch me
in the belly and it don't hurt me.

1099
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:20,170
Punch me.
Go ahead. Go on. Punch.

1100
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:21,713
Come on.

1101
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:25,508
- Gracious.
- Heh, heh. See?

1102
01:07:25,676 --> 01:07:28,845
Blanche.

1103
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,638
Guess how much I weigh?

1104
01:07:31,182 --> 01:07:36,603
- I'd say in the vicinity of 180 pounds.
- No, guess again.

1105
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:38,229
- Not so much?
- No, more.

1106
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:41,149
- Well?
- I weigh 207 pounds.

1107
01:07:41,317 --> 01:07:43,651
I'm 6'1 " and one-half inches tall
in my bare feet..."

1108
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:46,196
without shoes on,
and that's what I weigh stripped.

1109
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:50,408
Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1110
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:54,370
Well, my weight's not a very
interesting subject to talk about.

1111
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,206
What's yours?

1112
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,374
- My weight?
- Yes.

1113
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,877
- You guess.
- Let me lift you.

1114
01:08:01,128 --> 01:08:05,006
Samson. Go on, lift me.

1115
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:10,637
- Why, you're light as a feather.
- You may release me now.

1116
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:13,681
- Huh?
- I said unhand me, sir.

1117
01:08:13,849 --> 01:08:17,602
Mitch, Mitch, we're in public.
You must behave like a gentleman.

1118
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:20,020
Just give me a slap
whenever I step out of bounds.

1119
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:24,983
It won't be necessary. You're a natural
gentleman. One of the few left.

1120
01:08:25,151 --> 01:08:28,904
I don't want you to think that I'm
severe or old-maid schoolteacherish...

1121
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,988
or anything. It's just, well, I...

1122
01:08:31,156 --> 01:08:35,576
I guess I have old-fashioned ideals.

1123
01:08:49,424 --> 01:08:51,634
Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?

1124
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:54,971
I think they were planning
to take in a midnight preview.

1125
01:08:55,138 --> 01:08:57,557
We all ought to go out together
some night.

1126
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:01,227
That wouldn't be a good plan.

1127
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:02,812
Why not?

1128
01:09:03,188 --> 01:09:05,606
You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1129
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,775
We was together in the 241 St..

1130
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:11,279
- I guess he talks to you pretty frankly.
- Sure.

1131
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:13,739
Has he talked to you about me?

1132
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,159
- No, not much.
- The way you say that...

1133
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,495
- I suspect that he has.
- He hasn't said much.

1134
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:23,584
Well, what he has said, what would
you say his attitude toward me was?

1135
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,460
- What makes you ask that?
- Well...

1136
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,671
Don't you get along with him?

1137
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,715
What do you think?

1138
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:31,925
I think he don't understand you.

1139
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:37,306
That's putting it mildly. Surely he must
have told you how much he hates me.

1140
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,520
I don't think he hates you.

1141
01:09:43,688 --> 01:09:46,982
He hates me,
or why would he insult me?

1142
01:09:47,275 --> 01:09:48,525
Of course...

1143
01:09:48,693 --> 01:09:51,569
there is such a thing as
the hostility of...

1144
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:56,490
Perhaps in some strange
kind of way, he...

1145
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:58,409
Oh, no.

1146
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,870
To think of it makes me...

1147
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:03,789
- Blanche.
- Yes, honey?

1148
01:10:03,957 --> 01:10:07,919
- Blanche, can I ask you a question?
- Yes, what?

1149
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:10,046
How old are you?

1150
01:10:11,715 --> 01:10:14,967
What do you want to know that for?

1151
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:19,430
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1152
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,935
- You talked to your mother about me?
- Yes.

1153
01:10:24,102 --> 01:10:25,645
Why?

1154
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:29,357
Because I told her how nice
you were, and I liked you.

1155
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:33,402
Were you sincere about that?

1156
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:37,031
You know I was.

1157
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:41,242
Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1158
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:45,789
- My mother is sick, and...
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

1159
01:10:46,124 --> 01:10:48,042
She won't live long...

1160
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,796
maybe just a few months,
and she worries because I'm not settled.

1161
01:10:51,964 --> 01:10:54,882
She wants to see me
settled down before she...

1162
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,514
You love her very much, don't you?

1163
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:07,311
You'll be lonely when she passes on,
won't you?

1164
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,775
I know what that means.

1165
01:11:16,362 --> 01:11:18,113
To be lonely?

1166
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:21,574
I loved someone once.

1167
01:11:21,742 --> 01:11:24,619
And the person I loved, I lost.

1168
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:27,247
Dead?

1169
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:32,961
He was a boy.

1170
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:37,007
Just a boy,
when I was a very young girl.

1171
01:11:37,717 --> 01:11:40,593
When I was 16, I made the discovery:

1172
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:42,388
Love.

1173
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:44,765
All at once, and much...

1174
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,309
much too completely.

1175
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:51,063
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light...

1176
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:55,026
on something that had
always been half in shadow.

1177
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:58,487
That's how it struck the world for me.

1178
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:00,823
But I was unlucky.

1179
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:02,658
Deluded.

1180
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,287
There was something about the boy.

1181
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,123
A nervousness, a tenderness...

1182
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,042
an uncertainty.

1183
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,377
And I didn't understand.

1184
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:18,008
I didn't understand why this boy,
who wrote poetry...

1185
01:12:18,176 --> 01:12:20,677
didn't seem able to do anything else.

1186
01:12:20,845 --> 01:12:22,888
He lost every job.

1187
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,932
He came to me for help.

1188
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,851
I didn't know that.

1189
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:30,479
I didn't know anything...

1190
01:12:30,645 --> 01:12:32,855
except that I loved him...

1191
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,982
unendurably.

1192
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:38,402
At night I pretended to sleep.

1193
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,654
I heard him crying.

1194
01:12:41,656 --> 01:12:43,157
Crying.

1195
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:48,996
Crying the way a lost child cries.

1196
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,164
I don't understand.

1197
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,666
BLANCHE: No.

1198
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:55,251
[sobbing]

1199
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:57,754
No, neither did I.

1200
01:12:58,798 --> 01:13:00,840
And that's why I...

1201
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:04,343
I killed him.

1202
01:13:05,845 --> 01:13:07,221
You...?

1203
01:13:17,023 --> 01:13:18,649
One night...

1204
01:13:19,067 --> 01:13:22,778
we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

1205
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:26,156
We danced the Varsouviana.

1206
01:13:26,366 --> 01:13:30,536
Suddenly, in the middle of the dance,
the boy I married broke away from me...

1207
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:32,454
and ran out of the casino.

1208
01:13:32,664 --> 01:13:34,289
A few minutes later...

1209
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:35,499
a shot.

1210
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:36,708
[gunshot, in her mind]

1211
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:38,335
I ran.

1212
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:39,920
All did.

1213
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:43,882
All ran and gathered about
the terrible thing at the edge of the lake.

1214
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,931
[whimpers]

1215
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:54,517
He'd stuck a revolver into his mouth...

1216
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:56,227
and fired.

1217
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,986
It was because...

1218
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:06,238
on the dance floor...

1219
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:09,658
unable to stop myself, I'd said:

1220
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:11,994
"You're weak."

1221
01:14:12,245 --> 01:14:14,788
I've lost respect for you.

1222
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,083
"I despise you."

1223
01:14:23,464 --> 01:14:24,923
And then...

1224
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:29,970
the searchlight which
had been turned on the world...

1225
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:32,347
was turned off again.

1226
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:34,141
And never...

1227
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:39,021
for one moment since, has there
been any light stronger than...

1228
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:41,440
than this...

1229
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:43,984
yellow lantern.

1230
01:15:00,044 --> 01:15:02,128
You need somebody.

1231
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,215
And I need somebody too.

1232
01:15:11,888 --> 01:15:14,348
Could it be you and me, Blanche?

1233
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:28,986
BLANCHE: Oh.

1234
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:32,657
Sometimes...

1235
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,493
there's God...

1236
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:38,913
so quickly.

1237
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:45,586
STANLEY: You wanna mess with me,
sonny boy, come on!

1238
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:47,463
All right, turn him loose!

1239
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:51,008
You're gonna kill who? You don't even
know when you're getting wised up.

1240
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:52,969
You don't have to wise me up!

1241
01:15:53,136 --> 01:15:56,639
Come on, here. Come on,
get to work here. We gotta get going.

1242
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:58,516
We got some bucks
to make around here.

1243
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,643
Go ahead and marry her,
but hurry it up.

1244
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:03,521
She's been in my house
five months and her time is up.

1245
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:17,618
[singing]
It's only a paper moon

1246
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:21,623
Sailing over a cardboard sea

1247
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,252
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1248
01:16:27,672 --> 01:16:29,881
If you believed in me

1249
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:32,717
It's a Barnum and Bailey world

1250
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:34,969
Just as phoney as it...

1251
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:38,139
Oh, hello, Stanley.

1252
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,891
[singing]
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1253
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:44,562
If you believed in me

1254
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:48,357
Some canary bird.

1255
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:51,235
STELLA:
All right.

1256
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:55,614
Please tell me quietly just what you think
you found out about my sister.

1257
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,576
You know your sister Blanche
is no lily, don't you?

1258
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,911
What have you heard,
and who from?

1259
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:03,706
You should know the line
that she's been feeding to Mitch.

1260
01:17:03,874 --> 01:17:06,917
Our supply man at the plant's
been going through Auriol for years.

1261
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,669
He knows all about her.

1262
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:12,548
And everybody else in the town
of Auriol knows all about her.

1263
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:16,427
She's as famous in Auriol as if she was
the president of the United States...

1264
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:19,597
only she's not respected by any party.

1265
01:17:19,931 --> 01:17:23,059
BLANCHE [singing]:
Without your love

1266
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:26,228
It's a honky-tonk parade

1267
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:31,108
So she moved to a hotel
called the Flamingo...

1268
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:33,611
which is a second-class hotel...

1269
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,613
and has the advantages...

1270
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:39,784
of not interfering with the private
and social life of the personalities there.

1271
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,953
Now, the Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings on.

1272
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:47,624
But the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1273
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:50,335
In fact, they were so impressed
that they requested her...

1274
01:17:50,503 --> 01:17:52,712
to turn in her room key
for permanently.

1275
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,715
And this happened a couple of weeks
before she showed here.

1276
01:18:03,807 --> 01:18:06,934
Honey, I know how
this is gonna upset you.

1277
01:18:07,102 --> 01:18:10,646
But listen, she pulled the wool
over your eyes just as much as Mitch's.

1278
01:18:10,814 --> 01:18:12,815
STELLA: Pure invention.
Not a word of truth in it.

1279
01:18:12,982 --> 01:18:15,442
Baby, listen. I checked on every story.

1280
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:19,279
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore in Auriol...

1281
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:20,781
because they wised up.

1282
01:18:20,949 --> 01:18:23,951
And after two, three days they quit,
then she goes on to another one.

1283
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:26,745
The same old line, the same old act
and the same old hooey.

1284
01:18:26,913 --> 01:18:29,331
And as time went by,
she became the town character...

1285
01:18:29,499 --> 01:18:32,543
regarded not just as different,
but downright loco and nuts...

1286
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,170
which brings us to lie number two...

1287
01:18:37,006 --> 01:18:38,633
Stella.

1288
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:41,094
Baby, now...

1289
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:44,889
She didn't resign temporarily because
of her nerves. She was kicked out...

1290
01:18:45,057 --> 01:18:47,142
before the spring term ended.

1291
01:18:51,105 --> 01:18:53,899
And, now, I hate to tell you the reason
that step was taken.

1292
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:56,527
A 17-year-old kid
she got mixed up with.

1293
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,362
The boy's dad learned about it...

1294
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,157
and he got in touch
with the high school superintendent.

1295
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:04,034
And it was practically a town ordinance
passed against her.

1296
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:06,913
BLANCHE: Stella.
- Yes, Blanche?

1297
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:10,167
Can I have another bath towel
to dry my hair with? I just washed it.

1298
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:11,877
Yes, honey.

1299
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:19,049
- What's the matter, honey?
- Matter, what?

1300
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,052
You have such a strange
expression on your face.

1301
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:24,930
- I guess I'm a little tired, is...
- Well...

1302
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:27,558
why don't you take a hot bath
as soon as I get out?

1303
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:29,935
How soon is that gonna be, Blanche?

1304
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,980
Not so terribly long,
possess your soul in patience.

1305
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,274
It's not my soul I'm worried about.

1306
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,405
Well?

1307
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,079
How many candles
you sticking in the cake?

1308
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,374
I stopped at 25.

1309
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:55,127
You got company expected?

1310
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:57,254
We asked Mitch to come over.

1311
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:00,090
Well, don't expect Mitch
over here tonight.

1312
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,092
Why?

1313
01:20:03,553 --> 01:20:07,680
Mitch is a buddy of mine.
We was together in the 241 St. Engineers.

1314
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:10,725
We work in the same plant,
we're on the same bowling team.

1315
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:13,228
Stanley Kowalski, did you repeat
what that...?

1316
01:20:13,395 --> 01:20:16,022
You bet I told him.
I would have that on my conscience...

1317
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,650
if I knew all that
and let my best friend get caught.

1318
01:20:18,817 --> 01:20:20,985
- Is Mitch through with her?
- I don't know...

1319
01:20:21,153 --> 01:20:23,696
- but he's wised up.
- Mitch was gonna marry her.

1320
01:20:23,864 --> 01:20:25,698
He's not gonna marry her now.

1321
01:20:25,866 --> 01:20:28,326
He's not gonna jump into a tank
with a school of sharks.

1322
01:20:28,494 --> 01:20:33,164
- What'll she do? What will she do?
- Oh, her future is mapped out for her.

1323
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,791
What do you mean?

1324
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:37,000
[Blanche singing]

1325
01:20:37,168 --> 01:20:40,754
Hey, toots! Canary bird,
will you get out of the bathroom!

1326
01:20:40,964 --> 01:20:42,464
BLANCHE: Oh.

1327
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:46,260
Oh, I feel so good
after a long, hot bath.

1328
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:48,512
I feel so good and cool and rested.

1329
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,930
[door slams]

1330
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:53,141
- Do you, Blanche?
- Yes, I do. So refreshed.

1331
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:55,644
Why, a hot bath
and a long, cold drink...

1332
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:59,065
always gives me
a brand-new outlook on life.

1333
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:02,318
What's the matter?

1334
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,487
What's happened.

1335
01:21:04,697 --> 01:21:08,658
- What is it?
- Nothing's happened, Blanche.

1336
01:21:09,076 --> 01:21:10,868
You're lying.

1337
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:13,371
Something has.

1338
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,256
Stanley?

1339
01:21:23,424 --> 01:21:25,008
Stanley, tell us a joke.

1340
01:21:25,175 --> 01:21:27,510
Tell us a funny little story
to make us all laugh.

1341
01:21:27,678 --> 01:21:30,013
I don't know what's the matter,
we're all so solemn.

1342
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,181
Is it because I've been
stood up by my beau?

1343
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:36,019
First time in my experience with men...
And I've had a good deal of all sorts.

1344
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:37,986
- That I've been stood up by anyone.
- Ha, ha.

1345
01:21:38,105 --> 01:21:39,689
I don't know how to take it.

1346
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,318
Tell us a funny little story, Stanley.

1347
01:21:43,485 --> 01:21:45,820
Something to help us out.

1348
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:48,281
I didn't think you liked
my stories, Blanche.

1349
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:51,284
I like them when they're amusing,
but not indecent.

1350
01:21:51,452 --> 01:21:54,620
I don't know any refined enough
for your taste.

1351
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:58,040
BLANCHE: Well, then. Let me tell one.

1352
01:21:58,207 --> 01:22:01,084
Yes, tell one, Blanche.
You used to know a lot of good stories.

1353
01:22:01,878 --> 01:22:04,379
Now, let me see. I have to run
through my repertoire.

1354
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:06,506
Oh, yes, I love parrot stories.

1355
01:22:06,674 --> 01:22:09,885
You all like parrot stories? This is
about the old maid and the parrot.

1356
01:22:10,053 --> 01:22:12,804
This old maid, she had a parrot
that cursed a blue streak...

1357
01:22:12,972 --> 01:22:16,224
and knew more vulgar expressions
than Mr. Kowalski.

1358
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:19,770
Well, the only way to hush the parrot up
was to put the cover...

1359
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:21,605
[doorbell ringing]

1360
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:29,779
Must be upstairs.

1361
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:34,075
Well, the only way
to hush the parrot up was to put...

1362
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,077
Go on, Blanche.

1363
01:22:37,412 --> 01:22:38,788
No.

1364
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:41,415
I don't think
Mr. Kowalski will be amused.

1365
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:48,255
Mr. Kowalski is too busy making
a pig of himself to think of anything else.

1366
01:22:48,924 --> 01:22:51,300
Your face and your fingers
are disgustingly greasy.

1367
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:53,719
Go wash up
and then help me clear the table.

1368
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,774
Now, that's how
I'm gonna clear the table.

1369
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:11,112
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

1370
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:17,243
Pig, Polack, disgusting, vulgar, greasy.

1371
01:23:17,953 --> 01:23:20,788
Those words have been on your tongue
and your sister's tongue...

1372
01:23:20,956 --> 01:23:22,790
just too much around here.

1373
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:26,919
Who do you think you are,
a pair of queens?

1374
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:31,173
Remember Huey Long said: Every man's
a king, and I'm the king around here.

1375
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:33,384
And don't you forget it.

1376
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:44,520
My place is all cleared up now.
You want me to clear yours?

1377
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:55,322
Stella...

1378
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,408
what happened while I was bathing?

1379
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:01,912
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing. Nothing, nothing, Blanche.

1380
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,874
- I think he told you about Mitch and me.
- No.

1381
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:07,334
You know why Mitch didn't come,
but you won't tell.

1382
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,670
- No.
- I'm gonna call him.

1383
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:13,048
- Don't call him!
- Yes, I am. I'll call him on the phone.

1384
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,217
Blanche, I wouldn't call him.

1385
01:24:15,385 --> 01:24:18,304
Got to be given some explanation
from someone.

1386
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:25,770
STELLA: Well, I hope you're
pleased with your doings.

1387
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:30,357
I never had so much trouble
swallowing food in my life...

1388
01:24:30,776 --> 01:24:33,736
looking at that girl's face
and that empty chair.

1389
01:24:33,904 --> 01:24:37,864
BLANCHE: Hello? I want to talk
to Mr. Mitchell, please.

1390
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,202
I'd like to leave a number, if I may.

1391
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,205
STANLEY: Honey.
BLANCHE: Tulane-4947.

1392
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,957
And say it's important to call, please.

1393
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:53,045
Honey, it's gonna be all right after
she goes and after you have the baby.

1394
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:56,590
It's gonna be all right again
between you and me, the way it was.

1395
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,759
Remember how it was?

1396
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:02,387
It's gonna be so sweet when we can
get them coloured lights going...

1397
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:05,641
with nobody's sister
behind the curtains to hear us.

1398
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,812
[Eunice and Steve laughing]

1399
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,738
Steve and Eunice.

1400
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,743
Come on back in.

1401
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:28,581
Blanche?

1402
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,167
Blanche.

1403
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:35,089
BLANCHE: Yes?
STELLA: Oh, come on, hon.

1404
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:38,926
Oh, what pretty, pretty candles.
Don't burn them, Stella.

1405
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:41,637
STELLA: I certainly will.
- No.

1406
01:25:41,805 --> 01:25:43,931
You ought to save them
for baby's birthdays.

1407
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:46,642
Oh, I hope candles are gonna
glow in his life.

1408
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:49,103
I hope his eyes are gonna be
like candles...

1409
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:52,189
like two blue candles...

1410
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,233
Lining a white cake.

1411
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:55,651
STANLEY: What poetry!

1412
01:25:56,278 --> 01:25:57,735
[door slams]

1413
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,490
I shouldn't have called him.

1414
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:06,327
Blanche. You know, it's hot in there
with the steam from that bathroom!

1415
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:11,457
I said I was sorry three times!

1416
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:16,796
I take hot baths for my nerves.

1417
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:18,840
Hydrotherapy, they call it.

1418
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:21,384
You healthy Polack,
without a nerve in your body.

1419
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:24,429
How can you possibly know
what anxiety feels like?

1420
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,806
I am not a Polack!

1421
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:30,184
People from Poland are Poles,
they are not Polacks!

1422
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,812
But what I am
is 100 percent American!

1423
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,982
I'm born and raised in the greatest
country on earth and I'm proud of it!

1424
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,191
[phone ringing]

1425
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,527
- And don't you ever call me a Polack!
- That's for me, I'm sure!

1426
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,155
Just keep your seat.
I'm not so sure.

1427
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,491
- Hello.
MAN [on phone]: Stanley?

1428
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,952
- Yeah, Mac.
- Listen, Stanley...

1429
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,623
Take your hands off me, Stella.
What's the matter with you?

1430
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:55,501
- Why do you give me that pitying look?
STANLEY: Will you shut up!

1431
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:00,340
No, we got a noisy woman in the place.

1432
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:05,887
I told you I don't want to bowl at Riley's. I
had a little trouble with Riley last week.

1433
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:10,266
I'm the team captain, ain't I? All right.
Then we're not gonna bowl at Riley's.

1434
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:13,393
We're gonna bowl at the West Side
or at the Gate, and I'll see you.

1435
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,103
Sister Blanche...

1436
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:18,397
I got a little birthday
remembrance for you.

1437
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:23,486
I hope that you like it.

1438
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:35,582
- Why, it's a...
- That's a bus ticket back to Auriol.

1439
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,376
Tuesday.

1440
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,545
[Blanche sobbing]

1441
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,679
STELLA:
Blanche.

1442
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,974
[door slams]

1443
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,897
You didn't need to do that.

1444
01:27:58,065 --> 01:28:00,525
Don't forget all that I took off of her.

1445
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:03,444
You didn't need to be so cruel
to someone as alone as she is.

1446
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:06,364
- A delicate article, she is.
- She is. She was.

1447
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,074
You didn't know Blanche as a girl.

1448
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:11,160
Nobody, nobody was as tender
and as trusting as she was.

1449
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:14,747
But people like you abused her
and forced her to change.

1450
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:18,292
- Do you think you're going bowling now?
- That's right.

1451
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:21,295
You're not going bowling.
Why did you do this to her?

1452
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,505
STANLEY: Let go of me.

1453
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:23,798
STELLA: I want to know why!

1454
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,091
Hey, cool it!

1455
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:29,220
Listen, baby, when we first met,
you and me, you thought I was common.

1456
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:32,098
Well, how right you was.
I was common as dirt.

1457
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,517
You showed me a snapshot
of a place with columns...

1458
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:37,477
and I pulled you down off them
columns and you loved it.

1459
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,354
Having them coloured lights going.

1460
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:42,774
And wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1461
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:48,155
Huh? Wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed here?

1462
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:51,533
Hoity-toity, describing me like a ape.

1463
01:28:57,623 --> 01:28:58,874
Stella?

1464
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,672
What's the matter with you?

1465
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,971
Honey, what's the matter with you?

1466
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,481
Honey, did I hurt you?

1467
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,901
Baby, what is it?

1468
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,531
Take me to the hospital.

Who is it, please?

01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:05,855
MITCH:
It's me. Me, Mitch.

Mitch.

[knocking on door]

1475
01:30:18,954 --> 01:30:20,830
Just a minute, please.

01:30:26,586 --> 01:30:27,920
[pounding on door]

1477
01:30:28,505 --> 01:30:31,340
Coming. Coming.

1478
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:40,975
Hello, Mitch.

1479
01:30:41,143 --> 01:30:45,020
You know, I really shouldn't let you in
after the treatment I received from you.

1480
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:48,232
So utterly uncavalier.
But, hello, beautiful.

1481
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,694
Oh, my, my, what a cold shoulder.
And what uncouth apparel.

1482
01:30:51,862 --> 01:30:53,237
Why, you haven't even shaved.

1483
01:30:53,405 --> 01:30:55,823
But I forgive you,
because it's a relief to see you.

1484
01:30:55,991 --> 01:30:57,992
You stopped that polka tune
I had in my head.

1485
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,910
Ever get anything caught in your head?

1486
01:31:00,078 --> 01:31:02,913
Of course not, you never get
anything awful caught in your head.

1487
01:31:03,081 --> 01:31:04,748
- We have to have that fan on?
- No.

1488
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:07,585
- I don't like fans.
- Well, let's turn it off, honey.

1489
01:31:07,752 --> 01:31:09,086
I'm not partial to them.

1490
01:31:09,254 --> 01:31:11,964
I don't know what there is to drink,
I haven't investigated.

1491
01:31:12,132 --> 01:31:14,633
- I don't want Stan's liquor.
- It isn't Stan's!

1492
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,887
Some things on the premises
are actually mine.

1493
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:19,429
How's your mother?

1494
01:31:19,805 --> 01:31:22,473
- Is your mother well?
- Why?

1495
01:31:23,058 --> 01:31:25,101
Something the matter with you.
But never mind.

1496
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:29,606
I won't cross-examine the witness, I'll just
pretend I didn't notice anything different.

1497
01:31:30,441 --> 01:31:32,609
It's that music again.

1498
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:34,695
[polka music playing in her mind]

1499
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:36,822
What music?

1500
01:31:38,241 --> 01:31:40,868
The polka tune they were playing
when Allan...

1501
01:31:42,662 --> 01:31:43,704
Wait.

1502
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:44,914
[gunshot, in her mind]

1503
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:46,123
There...

1504
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:48,000
the shot.

1505
01:31:51,129 --> 01:31:53,671
It always stops after that.

1506
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:58,718
Yes.

1507
01:31:59,762 --> 01:32:01,639
Now it's stopped.

1508
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,851
Are you boxed out of your mind?

1509
01:32:12,776 --> 01:32:15,611
Oh, I'll go and see what I can
find in the way of...

1510
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:19,698
By the way, forgive me not being
dressed. I'd practically given you up.

1511
01:32:19,866 --> 01:32:21,408
Had you forgotten your invitation?

1512
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:23,369
MITCH: I wasn't going
to see you anymore.

1513
01:32:23,536 --> 01:32:25,412
BLANCHE: Wait, I can't
hear what you're saying.

1514
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,498
You talk so seldom,
when you do say anything...

1515
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:29,833
I don't want to miss
a single syllable of it.

1516
01:32:30,043 --> 01:32:32,879
What am I looking for around here?
Oh, yes. The liquor.

1517
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:36,174
We've had so much excitement,
I am boxed out of my mind.

1518
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:37,801
Here's something.

1519
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:40,177
"Southern Cheer."

1520
01:32:40,345 --> 01:32:42,304
What can that be, I wonder?

1521
01:32:42,973 --> 01:32:45,391
Take your foot off the bed.
It has a clean cover on it.

1522
01:32:45,558 --> 01:32:47,518
You boys wouldn't notice
a thing like that.

1523
01:32:47,686 --> 01:32:51,814
- I've done so much to this place since I...
- Aren't you leaving here pretty soon?

1524
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:54,775
I wonder if this ought to be
mixed with something.

1525
01:32:55,443 --> 01:32:59,196
Mmm. It's sweet, terribly sweet.
Why, I believe it's a liqueur.

1526
01:32:59,364 --> 01:33:02,992
Heh, heh, heh. Yes, that's what it is, a liqueur.
I don't think you'll like it, but try it.

1527
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:04,868
- Maybe you will.
- I told you before...

1528
01:33:05,036 --> 01:33:07,162
I don't want any of his liquor,
and I mean it.

1529
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,915
He says you been lapping it up
all summer like a wildcat.

1530
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:13,377
I won't descend to the level
of such a cheap accusation to answer...

1531
01:33:13,878 --> 01:33:15,713
What's in your mind?

1532
01:33:16,131 --> 01:33:18,632
- I see something in your eyes.
- It's dark in here.

1533
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,552
I like the dark.
The dark is comforting to me.

1534
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:24,555
I've never seen you in the light.
That's a fact.

1535
01:33:24,723 --> 01:33:26,724
I've never seen you in the afternoon.

1536
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:29,268
BLANCHE: I met you
at the plant in the afternoon.

1537
01:33:29,477 --> 01:33:31,312
Not on Sunday afternoon!

1538
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:35,149
You never wanna go out till after 6, then
it's always some place not lighted much.

1539
01:33:35,317 --> 01:33:37,484
BLANCHE: Some obscure meaning
in this I fail to catch.

1540
01:33:37,652 --> 01:33:40,236
What it means is I've never had
a real good look at you.

1541
01:33:40,404 --> 01:33:42,447
- Let's turn the light on.
- Light? What for?

1542
01:33:42,614 --> 01:33:44,866
This one here with
this paper thing on it.

1543
01:33:45,743 --> 01:33:49,787
- What did you want to do that for?
- So I can see you, good and plain.

1544
01:33:49,955 --> 01:33:51,831
You don't really mean to be insulting.

1545
01:33:51,999 --> 01:33:53,124
No, just realistic.

1546
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:55,752
- I don't want realism. I want magic.
- Magic.

1547
01:33:55,919 --> 01:33:58,087
Yes, yes, magic.

1548
01:33:58,255 --> 01:34:01,840
I try to give that to people. I do
misrepresent things, I don't tell truth.

1549
01:34:02,008 --> 01:34:05,844
I tell what ought to be truth and if that
is sinful, then let me be punished for it.

1550
01:34:06,012 --> 01:34:08,347
Don't turn the light on!

1551
01:34:16,855 --> 01:34:20,316
Oh, I don't mind you
being older than what I thought...

1552
01:34:21,818 --> 01:34:23,402
but all the rest of it.

1553
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:24,987
[groans]

1554
01:34:25,864 --> 01:34:30,284
Why, that pitch about
your ideals being so old-fashioned...

1555
01:34:30,452 --> 01:34:33,287
and all the malarkey that
you've been dishing out all summer.

1556
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:37,500
I knew you weren't 16, but I was
fool enough to believe you was straight!

1557
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:40,836
Who told you I wasn't straight?
My loving brother-in-law?

1558
01:34:41,004 --> 01:34:42,463
- And you believed him?
- No!

1559
01:34:42,798 --> 01:34:47,051
No, I called him a liar at first
and then I checked on the story.

1560
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:49,846
I talked over long distance
to this merchant in Auriol.

1561
01:34:50,014 --> 01:34:52,057
- Who is this merchant?
- Kiefaber.

1562
01:34:52,225 --> 01:34:55,310
The merchant Kiefaber of Auriol.
I know the man. He whistled at me.

1563
01:34:55,478 --> 01:34:58,021
I put him in his place.
Now he makes up stories about me.

1564
01:34:58,189 --> 01:35:00,273
Didn't you stay at a hotel
called the Flamingo?

1565
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:03,318
Flamingo? No!

1566
01:35:03,486 --> 01:35:05,695
Tarantula was the name of it.

1567
01:35:05,863 --> 01:35:09,950
- I stayed at a hotel called Tarantula Arms.
- Tarantula Arms?

1568
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:13,829
Yes, a big spider. That's where
I brought my victims.

1569
01:35:13,996 --> 01:35:15,247
Yes.

1570
01:35:15,415 --> 01:35:19,751
I have had many meetings
with strangers.

1571
01:35:27,342 --> 01:35:29,593
After the death of Allan...

1572
01:35:29,761 --> 01:35:35,850
meetings with strangers was all I
seemed able to fill my empty heart with.

1573
01:35:36,435 --> 01:35:38,394
I think it was panic, just panic...

1574
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:41,772
that drove me from one to another,
searching for some protection.

1575
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:47,696
Here, there, and then
in the most unlikely places.

1576
01:35:48,197 --> 01:35:53,785
Even, at last, in a 17-year-old boy.
But somebody wrote the superintendent:

1577
01:35:53,953 --> 01:35:57,122
"This woman is morally unfit
for her position."

1578
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:58,790
True?

1579
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:00,542
Yes.

1580
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,836
Unfit somehow, anyway.

1581
01:36:03,004 --> 01:36:06,131
So I came here.
There was nowhere else I could go.

1582
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:09,009
I was played out.
You know what played out is?

1583
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:12,137
My youth was gone up the waterspout.

1584
01:36:12,305 --> 01:36:13,889
Then I met you.

1585
01:36:14,056 --> 01:36:16,057
You said you needed someone.

1586
01:36:16,225 --> 01:36:18,560
Well, I needed someone too.

1587
01:36:18,728 --> 01:36:20,645
I thanked God for you.

1588
01:36:20,813 --> 01:36:22,898
You seemed gentle.

1589
01:36:23,065 --> 01:36:24,316
A cleft...

1590
01:36:24,484 --> 01:36:28,236
in the rock of the world
that I could hide in.

1591
01:36:29,864 --> 01:36:32,532
But I suppose I was asking...

1592
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,660
hoping too much.

1593
01:36:36,745 --> 01:36:38,078
Kiefaber...

1594
01:36:38,246 --> 01:36:43,166
Harris and Shaw have tied an old tin
can to the tail of the kite.

1595
01:36:44,043 --> 01:36:45,543
I thought you were straight.

1596
01:36:47,463 --> 01:36:49,339
Straight?

1597
01:36:49,798 --> 01:36:51,716
What's straight?

1598
01:36:52,092 --> 01:36:55,386
A line can be straight, or a street...

1599
01:36:55,763 --> 01:36:58,473
but the heart of a human being?

1600
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,728
- You lied to me, Blanche.
- Don't say I lied to you.

1601
01:37:03,896 --> 01:37:08,067
- Lies! Lies! Inside and out, all lies!
- Never inside.

1602
01:37:08,235 --> 01:37:10,778
I never lied in my heart!

1603
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:14,031
[woman singing in Spanish]

1604
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,576
What?

1605
01:37:20,247 --> 01:37:22,331
From outside.

1606
01:37:27,128 --> 01:37:29,380
[speaking in Spanish]

1607
01:37:30,257 --> 01:37:32,633
Flowers. Flowers for the dead.

1608
01:37:35,971 --> 01:37:39,431
No.

1609
01:37:40,183 --> 01:37:43,811
Not now.

1610
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:53,279
I lived in a house where dying
old women remembered their dead men.

1611
01:37:53,446 --> 01:37:55,114
Crumble, then fade.

1612
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:57,491
Regrets, recriminations.

1613
01:37:57,659 --> 01:38:00,786
"If you'd done this,
it wouldn't have cost me that."

1614
01:38:00,954 --> 01:38:02,370
Legacies...

1615
01:38:02,538 --> 01:38:03,788
and other things...

1616
01:38:03,956 --> 01:38:06,165
such as bloodstained pillowslips.

1617
01:38:07,668 --> 01:38:09,544
I used to sit here...

1618
01:38:09,712 --> 01:38:11,004
and she used to sit there.

1619
01:38:11,672 --> 01:38:14,882
And death was as close as you are.

1620
01:38:15,509 --> 01:38:17,093
Death.

1621
01:38:17,511 --> 01:38:20,179
The opposite is desire.

1622
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:22,015
So how could you wonder?

1623
01:38:22,182 --> 01:38:25,184
How could you possibly wonder?

1624
01:38:28,022 --> 01:38:31,858
Not far from Belle Reve,
before we lost Belle Reve...

1625
01:38:32,026 --> 01:38:35,613
was a camp
where they trained young soldiers.

1626
01:38:35,864 --> 01:38:39,033
On Saturday nights,
they would go in town to get drunk.

1627
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,495
And on the way back, they would
stagger onto my lawn and call:

1628
01:38:44,122 --> 01:38:50,085
"Blanche."

1629

No, I don't think
I want to marry you anymore.

01:39:23,076 --> 01:39:24,743
No?

1634
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:28,790
No. You're not clean enough
to bring in the house with my mom...

1635
01:39:28,957 --> 01:39:31,501
Go, then!

1636
01:39:33,629 --> 01:39:35,380
Get out of here.

1637
01:39:35,547 --> 01:39:38,424
Quick, before I start screaming.

1638
01:39:39,009 --> 01:39:42,261
Get out of here quick,
before I start screaming!

01:40:43,323 --> 01:40:45,283
Open up in there.

1651

It's a police officer, open up.

- Go on.

- Are you all right?
- [whispering] I'll be good.

Oh, no, my gracious. What a thing.

1663
01:41:27,158 --> 01:41:31,119
How about taking a swim,
a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry?

1664
01:41:31,287 --> 01:41:33,455
That's if anyone's sober enough
to drive a car.

1665
01:41:33,623 --> 01:41:36,208
The best way in the world
to stop your head from buzzing.

1666
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:39,169
Only you have to be careful to dive
where the deep pool is.

1667
01:41:39,337 --> 01:41:43,507
If you hit a rock, you won't come up
till tomorrow. Heh, heh.

1668
01:41:44,592 --> 01:41:48,513
My goodness. They're playing
"Goodnight, Ladies."

1669

May I rest my weary head
on your shoulder?

1670

It's so...

1671
01:41:55,187 --> 01:41:56,896
comforting.

STANLEY: Hi, Blanche.

- How's my sister?
- She's doing okay.

1674
01:42:33,766 --> 01:42:35,308
How's the baby?

1675
01:42:35,852 --> 01:42:39,771
The baby won't come till tomorrow,
so they told me to get a little shut-eye.

1676
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:44,234
Does that mean...

1677
01:42:44,527 --> 01:42:46,820
we are to be alone in here?

1678

Yeah, it's just you and me, Blanche.

them fine feathers on for?

Oh. That's right.
You left before my wire came.

What, you got a wire?

1682
01:43:02,587 --> 01:43:05,797
I received a telegram
from an old admirer of mine.

1683
01:43:05,965 --> 01:43:10,510
- Anything good?
- I think so. An invitation.

1684
01:43:11,178 --> 01:43:12,804
What to?

1685
01:43:14,765 --> 01:43:17,934
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1686
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:20,687
Well, what do you know?

1687
01:43:21,188 --> 01:43:24,857
I was never so surprised in my life.
It came like a bolt from the blue.

1688
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:27,651
Who'd you say it was from?

1689
01:43:29,487 --> 01:43:31,155
An old beau of mine.

1690
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:35,159
Oh, the one that give you
the white fox fur pieces.

1691
01:43:35,744 --> 01:43:37,202
Shep Huntleigh.

1692
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:39,705
I wore his ATO pin
my last year in college.

1693
01:43:39,873 --> 01:43:42,457
I hadn't seen him for a while,
then just now this wire...

1694
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:45,668
inviting me on a cruise of the
Caribbean. The problem is clothes.

1695
01:43:45,836 --> 01:43:49,130
I tore into my trunk to see what I had
that was suitable for the tropics.

1696
01:43:49,298 --> 01:43:51,925
And you come up
with a gorgeous diamond tiara.

1697
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:54,344
This old relic? It's only rhinestones.

1698
01:43:55,179 --> 01:43:57,347
Oh, I thought it was
Tiffany's diamonds.

1699
01:43:57,514 --> 01:44:00,600
Well, anyhow,
I shall be entertained in style.

1700
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,979
Well, it just goes to show you,
Blanche, you never know what's coming.

1701
01:44:04,314 --> 01:44:06,482
When I thought my luck
was beginning to fail me.

1702
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,568
Into the picture
pops this Miami millionaire.

1703
01:44:09,903 --> 01:44:12,321
This man is not from Miami.
This man is from Dallas.

1704
01:44:12,489 --> 01:44:15,074
Just so he's from somewhere.

1705
01:44:15,408 --> 01:44:18,243
Close the curtains
before you undress any further.

1706
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:21,080
No, this is all
I'm gonna undress right now.

1707
01:44:22,874 --> 01:44:25,084
Hey, Blanche,
you seen the bottle opener?

1708
01:44:26,711 --> 01:44:30,798
I used to have a cousin who could open
a bottle of beer with his teeth.

1709
01:44:30,966 --> 01:44:35,386
And that was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1710
01:44:36,388 --> 01:44:40,683
Then one time at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth right off.

1711
01:44:41,309 --> 01:44:44,227
And then after that,
he was so ashamed of himself...

1712
01:44:44,395 --> 01:44:47,814
that he used to sneak out of the house
when company came.

1713
01:44:48,565 --> 01:44:50,692
Rain from heaven.

1714
01:44:58,867 --> 01:45:02,412
What do you say, Blanche? You want to
bury the hatchet and make a loving cup?

1715
01:45:03,122 --> 01:45:04,580
No. No, thank you.

1716
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:08,376
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1717
01:45:08,544 --> 01:45:11,296
Hey, wait a second.
I want to show you something.

1718
01:45:11,715 --> 01:45:14,299
Here's something I always break out
on special occasions:

1719
01:45:14,467 --> 01:45:16,301
Silk pyjamas I wore
on my wedding night.

1720
01:45:16,469 --> 01:45:18,929
When they call on that phone
and say, "You got a son"...

1721
01:45:19,097 --> 01:45:22,016
I'm gonna rip them off
and wave them like a flag!

1722
01:45:22,183 --> 01:45:24,268
I guess we're both entitled
to put on a dog.

1723
01:45:24,436 --> 01:45:27,730
You're having an oil millionaire
and I'm having the baby.

1724
01:45:29,024 --> 01:45:32,776
When I think of how divine it'll be to
have such a thing as privacy once more...

1725
01:45:32,944 --> 01:45:34,611
I could weep with joy.

1726
01:45:34,904 --> 01:45:37,823
This millionaire isn't gonna interfere
with your privacy none?

1727
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,743
It won't be the sort of thing
you have in mind.

1728
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:42,828
This man is a gentleman.
He respects me.

1729
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:44,621
What he wants is my companionship.

1730
01:45:44,789 --> 01:45:47,207
Having great wealth
sometimes makes people lonely.

1731
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:49,960
A cultivated woman,
a woman of breeding and intelligence...

1732
01:45:50,128 --> 01:45:53,547
can enrich a man's life immeasurably.
I have those things to offer.

1733
01:45:53,715 --> 01:45:56,050
And time doesn't take them away.

1734
01:45:56,217 --> 01:46:01,096
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

1735
01:46:01,264 --> 01:46:06,224
But beauty of the mind, richness
of the spirit, tenderness of the heart...

1736
01:46:06,392 --> 01:46:12,647
I have all those things... Aren't taken
away, but grow, increase with the years.

1737
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:14,274
Oh.

1738
01:46:16,277 --> 01:46:19,780
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman...

1739
01:46:19,947 --> 01:46:23,993
when I have all these treasures
locked in my heart.

1740
01:46:24,995 --> 01:46:28,664
I think of myself as a very,
very rich woman.

1741
01:46:28,832 --> 01:46:32,710
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1742
01:46:32,878 --> 01:46:34,003
Swine, huh?

1743
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:37,173
Yes. Swine.

1744
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:40,843
And I'm thinking not only of you but
of Mr. Mitchell. He came here tonight.

1745
01:46:41,011 --> 01:46:44,639
He dared to come in his work clothes to
repeat slander, vicious stories from you.

1746
01:46:44,807 --> 01:46:46,641
I gave him his walking papers.

1747
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,146
But then he returned. He returned with
a box of roses to beg my forgiveness.

1748
01:46:52,314 --> 01:46:54,565
He implored my forgiveness.

1749
01:46:54,983 --> 01:46:58,402
But some things are not forgiveable.

1750
01:47:00,155 --> 01:47:04,117
Deliberate cruelty is not forgiveable!

1751
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:07,036
It is one unforgivable thing,
in my opinion...

1752
01:47:07,204 --> 01:47:09,539
and the one thing
of which I have never...

1753
01:47:09,706 --> 01:47:11,290
never been guilty.

1754
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:14,710
So I said to him, "Thank you."

1755
01:47:14,878 --> 01:47:18,256
It was foolish of me to think that
we could adapt ourselves to each other.

1756
01:47:18,423 --> 01:47:21,884
Our ways of life are too different,
our backgrounds are incompatible.

1757
01:47:22,177 --> 01:47:27,931
"So farewell, my friend,
and let there be no hard feelings."

1758
01:47:45,408 --> 01:47:48,910
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1759
01:47:49,537 --> 01:47:52,622
Telegram? What telegram?

1760
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:56,668
- Heh. As a matter of fact, my wire...
- As a matter of fact...

1761
01:47:56,836 --> 01:47:59,254
there wasn't no wire at all.

1762
01:48:02,592 --> 01:48:05,177
And there isn't no millionaire.

1763
01:48:06,637 --> 01:48:10,932
And Mitch didn't come in here with
roses, because I know where he is.

1764
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:16,022
And there isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks.

1765
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,899
And look at yourself.

1766
01:48:18,066 --> 01:48:21,110
Take a look at yourself here,
in a worn-out Mardi Gras outfit.

1767
01:48:21,278 --> 01:48:25,113
Rented for 50 cents from some
rag picker with a crazy crown on.

1768
01:48:25,281 --> 01:48:27,449
What kind of a queen
do you think you are?

1769
01:48:27,783 --> 01:48:30,202
You know that I've been on to you
from the start...

1770
01:48:30,369 --> 01:48:33,288
and not once did you pull the wool
over this boy's eyes.

1771
01:48:33,581 --> 01:48:37,167
You come here and sprinkle the place
with powder and you spray perfume...

1772
01:48:37,335 --> 01:48:39,502
and stick a paper lantern
over the light bulb.

1773
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:41,797
And lo and behold,
place is turned into Egypt...

1774
01:48:41,965 --> 01:48:44,759
and you're the queen of the Nile,
sitting on your throne...

1775
01:48:44,927 --> 01:48:47,177
swilling down my liquor.
You know what I say?

1776
01:48:47,386 --> 01:48:49,012
Ha-ha!

1777
01:48:50,514 --> 01:48:51,806

01:53:44,057 --> 01:53:46,642
- How is she?
- She wouldn't eat anything.

1839
01:53:46,809 --> 01:53:50,187
I keep telling her we made arrangements
for her to rest in the country.

1840
01:53:50,438 --> 01:53:53,565
She's got it all mixed-up in her mind
about a cruise to the islands...

1841
01:53:53,733 --> 01:53:55,943
with Shep Huntleigh, an old beau...
BLANCHE: Stella?

1842
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:58,403
STELLA: Yes?
- If anyone calls while I'm bathing...

1843
01:53:58,571 --> 01:54:00,864
take the number,
tell them I'll call right back.

1844
01:54:01,032 --> 01:54:02,658
- Yes, Blanche.
- Oh, and Stella.

1845
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:06,495
The... The cool yellow silk, the bouclé,
see if it's crushed.

1846
01:54:06,871 --> 01:54:10,414
If it's not too crushed, I'll wear it.
And on the lapel...

1847
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:14,210
that silver and turquoise pin
in the shape of a seahorse.

1848
01:54:14,378 --> 01:54:17,380
You'll find it in the heart-shaped box
I keep my accessories in.

1849
01:54:17,548 --> 01:54:21,759
Oh, and Stella, see if you can locate
a bunch of artificial...

1850
01:54:23,345 --> 01:54:27,848
violets in that box. I'll wear it with
the seahorse on the lapel of the jacket.

1851
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:43,029
I just don't know
if I've done the right thing.

1852
01:54:43,197 --> 01:54:44,698
What else could you do?

1853
01:54:44,865 --> 01:54:47,659
I couldn't believe her story
and go on living with Stanley.

1854
01:54:47,827 --> 01:54:51,788
Don't you never believe it.
You gotta keep on going, baby.

1855
01:54:51,956 --> 01:54:54,874
No matter what happens,
we all gotta keep on going.

1856
01:54:55,042 --> 01:54:56,835
BLANCHE: Stella?
- Yes, Blanche?

1857
01:54:57,086 --> 01:55:00,171
- Is the coast clear?
STELLA: Yes, honey.

1858
01:55:00,339 --> 01:55:02,799
Close the curtains before I come out.

1859
01:55:03,009 --> 01:55:05,427
Tell her how well she's looking.

1860
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:09,973
They're closed, honey.

1861
01:55:16,856 --> 01:55:18,356
I just washed my hair.

1862
01:55:19,108 --> 01:55:22,986
- Oh, did you?
- I'm not sure I got all the soap out.

1863
01:55:23,154 --> 01:55:25,739
EUNICE: Such fine hair.
- That's the problem.

1864
01:55:25,906 --> 01:55:28,532
- Did I get a call?
- Who from?

1865
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:32,535
- Shep Huntleigh.
- No, honey, not yet.

1866
01:55:32,703 --> 01:55:35,246
- Strange.
STANLEY: Come on, Mitch.

1867
01:55:38,752 --> 01:55:40,002
[cards shuffling]

1868
01:55:42,297 --> 01:55:44,590
BLANCHE [mouthing]:
Mitch?

1869
01:55:48,845 --> 01:55:50,137
Oh.

1870
01:55:50,764 --> 01:55:52,723
What's happened here?

1871
01:55:53,099 --> 01:55:55,184
I want an explanation
of what's happened here!

1872
01:55:55,352 --> 01:55:57,102
- Hush, please, Blanche.
EUNICE: Honey...

1873
01:55:58,063 --> 01:56:00,564
What are you two
looking at me like that for?

1874
01:56:00,732 --> 01:56:02,691
Is there something wrong with me?

1875
01:56:02,859 --> 01:56:05,277
You look wonderful, Blanche.
Don't she look wonderful?

1876
01:56:05,445 --> 01:56:08,864
- I understand you're going on a trip.
- Yes.

1877
01:56:09,032 --> 01:56:11,492
Yes. Blanche is.
She's going on a vacation.

1878
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,744
I'm green with envy.

1879
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,998
Help me, you two.
Help me get dressed.

1880
01:56:18,166 --> 01:56:21,585
STELLA: Is this what you wanted?
BLANCHE: Yes, that'll do.

1881
01:56:21,753 --> 01:56:24,463
I'm anxious to get out of this place.
This place is a trap.

1882
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:27,299
- Such a pretty lavender jacket.
- It's lilac-colored.

1883
01:56:27,467 --> 01:56:30,511
You're, both of you, wrong.
It's Della Robbia blue.

1884
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:32,513
Are these grapes washed?

1885
01:56:32,681 --> 01:56:35,558
- Washed, I said. Are they washed?
- From the French Market.

1886
01:56:35,726 --> 01:56:38,269
That doesn't mean to say
they've been washed.

1887
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:39,938
[clock chiming]

1888
01:56:42,233 --> 01:56:45,610
The cathedral chimes.
They're the only...

1889
01:56:46,529 --> 01:56:48,988
clean thing in the Quarter.

1890
01:56:50,407 --> 01:56:53,992
- I'm going now. I'm ready to go.
- She'll walk out before they get here.

1891
01:56:54,619 --> 01:56:56,495
STELLA: Wait, Blanche!

1892
01:56:57,288 --> 01:56:59,998
Must we pass in front of those men?

1893
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:02,501
EUNICE: Why don't you wait here
till that game breaks up.

1894
01:57:02,669 --> 01:57:04,294
STELLA: Yes, honey, sit down.

1895
01:57:04,504 --> 01:57:06,296
[doorbell ringing]

1896
01:57:10,885 --> 01:57:12,511
Tell them to wait outside.

1897
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:17,766
Would you mind waiting outside just a
couple of seconds? They'll be right out.

1898
01:57:28,278 --> 01:57:30,738
Someone is calling for Blanche.

1899
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:34,116
It is for me, then.

1900
01:57:34,325 --> 01:57:37,453
Is it the gentleman
I was expecting from Dallas?

1901
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,871
Yes.

1902
01:57:39,038 --> 01:57:41,415
Yes, honey, I believe it is.

1903
01:57:42,584 --> 01:57:44,376
Why...

1904
01:57:44,961 --> 01:57:47,504
I'm not quite ready.

1905
01:57:49,173 --> 01:57:51,507
Ask them to wait outside.

1906
01:57:53,093 --> 01:57:54,343
Everything packed?

1907
01:57:54,928 --> 01:57:56,220
Stanley.

1908
01:57:56,556 --> 01:57:57,848
She'll be out in a minute.

1909
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,562
- They're waiting outside the house.
BLANCHE: "They"?

1910
01:58:04,355 --> 01:58:06,023
Who's "they"?

1911
01:58:07,859 --> 01:58:09,234
There's a lady with him.

1912
01:58:10,611 --> 01:58:13,654
I can't imagine who this lady can be.

1913
01:58:13,989 --> 01:58:15,531
How is she dressed?

1914
01:58:17,951 --> 01:58:20,788
Just a plain tailored outfit.

1915
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:26,418
Possibly she?

1916
01:58:35,136 --> 01:58:36,804
Shall we go now, Blanche?

1917
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:55,364
- Must we go through that room?
- I'll go with you.

1918
01:58:57,742 --> 01:59:00,869
- How do I look?
- Lovely.

1919
01:59:01,287 --> 01:59:02,955
Lovely.

1920
01:59:12,257 --> 01:59:16,927
Please don't get up.
I'm only passing through.

1921
01:59:25,812 --> 01:59:27,271
You...

1922
01:59:27,814 --> 01:59:29,606
are not the gentleman...

1923
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:31,983
I was expecting.

1924
01:59:33,819 --> 01:59:36,279
This man isn't Shep Huntleigh.

1925
01:59:44,997 --> 01:59:46,539
You forget something, Blanche?

1926
01:59:46,874 --> 01:59:48,958
[Stanley's voice echoes
in Blanche's mind]

1927
01:59:49,126 --> 01:59:53,337
BLANCHE [sobbing]:
Yes. Yes, I forgot something.

1928
01:59:54,798 --> 01:59:56,632
STELLA: What are they gonna
do to her?

1929
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,926
Don't let them hurt her.

1930
01:59:59,803 --> 02:00:02,179
- What are they gonna do to her?
- Shh. Honey...

1931
02:00:04,808 --> 02:00:06,684
WOMAN: Hello, Blanche.

1932
02:00:07,102 --> 02:00:09,145
[woman's voice echoing
in Blanche's mind]

1933
02:00:14,483 --> 02:00:16,652
STANLEY: She says
she forgot something.

1934
02:00:17,404 --> 02:00:19,113
WOMAN: That's all right.

1935
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:23,826
STANLEY: Well, what did you
forget, Blanche?

1936
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:29,206
- It don't matter. We can pick it up later.
- We'll send it along with your trunk.

1937
02:00:34,087 --> 02:00:38,299
I don't know you.

1938
02:00:38,508 --> 02:00:41,761
- I want to be left alone, please!
- Now, Blanche...

1939
02:00:44,515 --> 02:00:47,976
STANLEY: Blanche, you left nothing here
but spilt talcum and old perfume bottles.

1940
02:00:48,686 --> 02:00:52,521
Unless it's the paper lantern you want to
take with you. You want the lantern?

1941
02:01:00,489 --> 02:01:02,990
[Blanche yelling]

1942
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:13,584
MITCH: You done this to her.

1943
02:01:13,919 --> 02:01:17,380
STEVE: Come on, stop it.
STANLEY: Stop it, will you!

1944
02:01:17,547 --> 02:01:20,049
MITCH: He did this to her, I know...

1945
02:01:20,217 --> 02:01:22,093
He must be nuts.

1946
02:01:22,594 --> 02:01:23,886
[Mitch sobbing]

1947
02:01:28,016 --> 02:01:29,475
What are you looking at?

1948
02:01:29,643 --> 02:01:31,727
I never once touched her.

1949
02:01:35,941 --> 02:01:40,111
These fingernails have to be trimmed.
Jacket, doctor?

1950
02:01:40,529 --> 02:01:43,072
Not unless necessary.

1951
02:01:44,116 --> 02:01:45,574
Miss DuBois.

1952
02:02:03,301 --> 02:02:04,927
Please...

1953
02:02:05,095 --> 02:02:07,596
DOCTOR: It won't be necessary.

1954
02:02:08,974 --> 02:02:10,891
Ask her...

1955
02:02:11,059 --> 02:02:13,518
to let go of me.

1956
02:02:13,978 --> 02:02:16,938
DOCTOR: Yes. Let go.

1957
02:02:51,932 --> 02:02:53,933
Whoever you are...

1958
02:02:54,185 --> 02:02:57,479
I have always depended
on the kindness...

1959
02:02:57,897 --> 02:02:59,814
of strangers.

1960
02:03:27,593 --> 02:03:29,427
- Blanche.
STANLEY: Come on, honey.

1961
02:03:29,595 --> 02:03:32,846
Don't you touch me.
Don't you ever touch me again.

1962
02:03:45,568 --> 02:03:46,735
[baby crying]

1963
02:03:56,663 --> 02:03:58,497
STANLEY: Stella!

1964
02:04:01,459 --> 02:04:03,502
Come on, Stella.

1965
02:04:03,753 --> 02:04:08,465
No, I'm not. I'm not going back
in there again. Not this time.

1966
02:04:08,633 --> 02:04:10,843
Never going back. Never.

1967
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:13,137
STANLEY: Hey, Stella!

1968
02:04:14,597 --> 02:04:18,225
Hey, Stella!
