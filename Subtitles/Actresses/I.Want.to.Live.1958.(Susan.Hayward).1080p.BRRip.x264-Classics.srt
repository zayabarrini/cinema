1
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,201
- Oh!
- Come on.

2
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,410
Come on.

3
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,709
Come on.

4
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,259
What's the rush?
I'm supposed to wait for Bonnie.

5
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,716
She can catch up with you later.

6
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,302
Where? You guys wouldn't let us
look for a place to stay.

7
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,136
Listen, we didn't bring you
chicks in from Vegas

8
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,563
to go apartment hunting. Let's go.

9
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,565
GO, go: go'

10
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,897
No one knows where, but we gotta go.

11
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,139
Mmm.

12
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,644
Hey, what is this? Come on, get out of here.

13
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,313
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

14
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,151
All right, come on out, duchess.

15
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,824
You heard me. I said come out.

16
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,660
What, may I ask, are you two gentlemen
doing in my room?

17
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,244
- No sale, sister.
- Oh, come on.

18
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,795
Let's not make a federal case out of it.

19
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,330
It is a federal case.
Ever hear of the Mann Act?

20
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,381
Transporting a woman across
a state line for immoral...

21
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,175
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you drove the girl

22
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,002
in from out of state this afternoon.

23
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,682
Don't you think we check on those things
first with witnesses?

24
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,843
All right, get your stuff. Let's go.

25
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,269
Just a minute, Copper.

26
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,350
Did you and your runny-nosed witnesses
check on who was gonna pay for the room?

27
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,397
Me!

28
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,440
So...

29
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,520
There we are.

30
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,197
You know what you're saying?
What you'll be charged with?

31
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,740
Yeah, I know, and it's a misdemeanour.

32
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,941
No federal rap.

33
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,319
I've been there before.

34
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,872
All right, come on.

35
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,579
Get your paws off.

36
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,995
I soil easy.

37
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,999
Thanks, kid.

38
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,802
Don't lose this.

39
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,256
Gee, life's a funny thing.

40
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,183
Compared to what?

41
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,246
Left! March!

42
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,906
Hup, hup, hup, left, march!

43
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,916
- Hup, hup, left, march!
Now hear this!

44
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,753
I want to propose a toast
to those two grand little seagulls,

45
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,416
Peg and Bonnie.

46
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:24,429
<i>They made San Diego
a port the men of the U. S. S. Pompano</i>

47
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,430
- will always remember.
- Hup, march!

48
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,429
Hup, march!

49
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,843
Oh, you goofed.

50
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,099
Ok, pay up, dogface.
That will be a sawbuck.

51
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,930
Where'd you girls learn
close-order drill like that?

52
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,891
- In the W.A.C.S.?
- No.

53
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,275
The W.A.V.E.S.?

54
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,351
In Ventura.

55
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,063
California's most exclusive finishing school.

56
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,778
Very tough to get into, huh, Peg?

57
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,326
I always say there's nothing
like a good education

58
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,028
to get ahead in the world.

59
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,328
- Hey, Joe!
- And, furthermore,

60
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,623
I'd like to add a serious note.

61
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,461
Oh, sit down. You're rocking the boat.

62
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,132
Here you are.
I was just going to yell "girl overboard."

63
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,959
You can't hear yourself think in there.

64
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,340
Well, here's somethin' to think about.

65
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,092
I got me a three-day pass startin' Friday.

66
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,847
How about me and you go down to Tijuana?

67
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,467
- Negative.
- Why not?

68
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,681
I'm going on a weekend cruise.

69
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,355
Yeah? How's about inviting me along?

70
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,932
Oh, you wouldn't fit in.

71
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,270
I'm joining my mother and her friends
on a private yacht.

72
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,689
What are you handing me?
Your mother on a yacht?

73
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,821
Yeah! My mother on a yacht!

74
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,154
Besides, you're too young.

75
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,532
For what?

76
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,668
Am I still too young?

77
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,670
Well...

78
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,932
Hello, young lovers, hello.

79
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,851
Don't you ever knock
before entering a balcony?

80
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,520
Guess who's here?

81
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,430
Mac and Stuey.

82
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,312
- From Frisco?
- Uh-huh.

83
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,113
Ten-hut!

84
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,737
Forward, march!

85
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,027
Bury yourself!

86
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,454
So it looks like we finally made the bucket.

87
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,248
- Well, what happened?
- Remember the delicatessen

88
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,166
over on Bloom Street
we always wanted to knock over?

89
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,543
- Yeah.
- Well, we did.

90
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,666
- And they know we did.
- But can they prove it?

91
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,422
Well, they got a pretty fair case,
a witness even.

92
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,795
Well, one witness, that's all?

93
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,047
No, no fingerprints? Nothing like that?

94
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,879
Not unless I left them on the pickles.

95
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,594
So, you see, if we had an alibi...

96
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,220
Well, like, if you'd say we were with you,

97
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,222
- why, 1 O to one, we'd beat the rap.
- Sure.

98
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,188
Perjury's a felony.

99
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,724
That's what I told them.

100
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,229
There's three bills in it for you and Peg.

101
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,361
And all your expenses while you're in Frisco.

102
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,396
I don't know.

103
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,571
One thing about you, Bonnie.

104
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,320
You never let your pals down.

105
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,572
Come on. What do you say, huh?

106
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,117
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Oh, God.

107
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,497
I knew she'd do it!

108
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,794
It'll be like old times.

109
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,497
- Peg, we'll have a ball in Frisco.
- No, Bonnie.

110
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,672
I can't go with this kick.

111
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,795
Oh, don't be like that. They're nice guys.

112
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,252
Sure.

113
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,170
I guess I just haven't got your guts.

114
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
Uh-uh. This is where I cut out.

115
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,428
Okay, you guys, there's a party goin' on.

116
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,471
Let's live it up!

117
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,807
That's my Bonnie!

118
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,892
Hey, George!

119
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,481
Some liquor for my friends.

120
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,026
Bongos away!

121
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,736
Go, go, go!

122
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,954
Come on, Joe,
put a head on it!

123
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,509
You've done your time.

124
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,469
You're getting out. So watch yourself.

125
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,606
You're on probation for five years.

126
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,228
Don't leave the San Francisco area

127
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,186
or otherwise violate
your probation in any way,

128
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,021
or you'll be back here quick enough.

129
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,697
Oh, no, ma'am. I won't.

130
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,982
I hope you mean it.

131
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,199
I see one section juvenile morals,

132
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,955
four vagrancy, one vagrancy quarantine,

133
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,283
three soliciting, perjury,

134
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,371
not to mention the two years you spent
at the Ventura Reform School for Girls.

135
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,289
As long as you're adding up the score,

136
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,420
my mother was in Ventura before me.

137
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,801
That oughta be worth extra points.

138
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,968
What I'm trying to say is,
you do have a choice.

139
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,888
People have managed to be fairly happy
by not getting into trouble.

140
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,891
Get a job, maybe get married.

141
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,896
I have been...

142
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,022
Occasionally.

143
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,477
Your way doesn't seem to be going too well.

144
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,982
Why don't you try the other?

145
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,062
Thanks.

146
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,030
Maybe I will.

147
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,171
Oh, no. No, Mr. Thomas.

148
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,722
I couldn't let you do that.

149
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,430
Now, don't be silly, Miss. Baldwin.
Why not?

150
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,853
It is such a bother having just that one
account in San Francisco.

151
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,271
I should open one down here.

152
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,774
San Francisco! Then we're neighbors.
I go to Stanford.

153
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,102
- Oh.
- Now I claim it as a right to cash your check.

154
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,271
Well, if you insist.

155
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,106
- How's 20?
- Anything you say.

156
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,442
Just make it out to "cash."

157
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,612
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, God!

158
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,323
Oh, allow me, miss. Allow me.

159
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,704
Are you in some kind
of an earn-while-you-learn job?

160
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,411
- Cop.
- What?

161
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,624
Vice cop.

162
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh, look at these, all wet.

163
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,837
Oh, here, use one of mine. Just...

164
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,466
I feel as though I've just been through
a laundromat.

165
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,595
I'll be right back.

166
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,318
I don't know, Hank.

167
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,871
Pickin' on a vice-squad cop to kite a check.

168
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,199
That's not much of a recommendation
for a job in this place.

169
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,407
Well, she just got in town.

170
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,334
- Yeah, how was I to know...
- Where you from?

171
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,411
Fflsco.

172
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,996
Your occupation. What do you do?

173
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,331
The best I can.

174
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,794
Maybe you can do it for me.

175
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,552
Come here.

176
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,962
See you, and I'll raise you.

177
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,385
I'm out.

178
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,515
You chicken?

179
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,016
<i>PERK". Your end comes
to $100 and a quarter.</i>

180
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,097
Together with certain other activities
of the past month,

181
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,356
that makes...

182
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,809
$642.

183
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,311
I'll put it in the safe for you.

184
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,441
Uh-uh.

185
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,571
You want it?

186
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,073
I'm quitting.

187
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,779
- Oh.
- To get married.

188
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,361
Young Lochinvar, from behind the bar?

189
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,616
Uh-huh.

190
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,615
You've been married three times now.

191
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,409
Let's assume divorced as many.

192
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,457
You ought to have it figured by now,
no white knight's

193
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,792
going to come riding through your life.

194
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,581
Yeah, that's right.

195
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,251
There isn't space on my library card
for all my names.

196
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,927
You think as Mrs. Henry Graham

197
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,009
you'll be so ritzy you can't
work for me, is that it?

198
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,721
I'm tired of it, Perk, all of it.

199
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,020
Used to be fun, but it isn't fun anymore.

200
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,847
You know, I go past the markets now

201
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,274
and envy the housewives carrying
out the groceries.

202
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,854
- Eh.
- Eh.

203
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,108
I used to think they were stupid
squares, too, but...

204
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,365
I get so tired of going out
with a quarter to buy ice.

205
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,444
Okay, okay.
So congratulate the bridegroom for me.

206
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,987
Wait till you taste my cooking.

207
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,322
Good luck, Bonnie.

208
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,902
You crumb, lay off!

209
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,194
You little fool, give it here!

210
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,193
- It's our last $10!
- Oh, don't give me that.

211
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,029
- You cashed a check.
- I wasted it on food.

212
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,028
Listen to me, Hank.

213
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,324
When I got pregnant, you promised
to kick the habit.

214
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,829
I've tried, Bonnie. I've tried.

215
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,543
But tonight...

216
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,797
Aw, have a heart.

217
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,673
Just, just one more fix,
and that's it, I swear.

218
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,802
No.

219
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,260
Please, Hank, for the baby's sake.

220
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,808
Oh, the baby, the baby!

221
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,055
I got some rights, too!

222
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,103
Give it!

223
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,404
It's all right, honey. Shh.

224
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,941
Shh, here, here, aw, look at the tigey.

225
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,571
<i>Look at the “gay.</i>

226
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,697
Here, sweetie. Look at the tigey.

227
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,075
Please, honey, let...

228
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,121
Let me have the $10.
I just wanna put it on a horse.

229
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,377
- Horse?
- I got a tip.

230
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,415
I could score big.

231
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,251
Shut up!

232
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,838
Daddy didn't mean it, darling. Shh.

233
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,013
Daddy didn't mean it.

234
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,090
Oh, you...

235
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,259
You're so holy.

236
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,434
You're worse than me.

237
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,478
You're nothing but a no-good, fancy...

238
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,396
Daddy didn't mean it, darling.

239
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,905
He's sick.

240
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,158
Oh, don't you tell him about me.

241
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,450
Tell him about yourself!

242
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,995
- And you got a record to prove it!
- All right!

243
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,283
As long as we're all bellied up
to the bar for treats,

244
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,292
here's something for you.

245
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,746
I'm sick of supporting you and your habit!

246
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm sick of your smell!

247
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,876
This is a real dream house I've been running,

248
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,836
and no junkie's worth it!

249
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,054
Take it!

250
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,509
Go on, take it!
It's the last you'll ever get from me!

251
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,354
You mean that?

252
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,766
So help me.

253
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,229
I'm through.

254
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,072
Oh, it's nice to see you, Mr. Bixle.

255
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,404
Come on in out of the rain.

256
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,240
I could evict you right into jail,
giving me this check.

257
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,451
Now, calm down, Mr. Bixle.

258
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,127
Maybe you'd like a little drink
on a day like this, huh?

259
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,250
You're in serious trouble.

260
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,548
You don't even have an account
in that bank.

261
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,208
How careless of me.

262
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,466
I used to.

263
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,510
I guess I got my Checkbooks mixed up.

264
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,047
- I'll write you out another.
- No. Cash.

265
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,218
Mr. Bixle, give me until tomorrow.

266
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,769
My husband's been away all week.

267
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,312
I expect him back tonight.

268
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,599
All right. Tomorrow.

269
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,901
But after that, I'm going to the police.

270
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,079
Hello?

271
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,457
Babs, I was just gonna call you.

272
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,251
Of course you can.

273
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,381
Come on over. I'll be waiting.

274
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,510
Yeah.

275
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,174
That's a hot one. She calls me.

276
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,884
Takin' her along, you must be nuts.

277
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,848
I'll go to my grave saying you're nuts.

278
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,720
You play it my WaY-

279
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,515
Maybe we'll all get out of this world alive.

280
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,202
...and I thought if Bobby and I
could stay here for a while,

281
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,076
I might be able to work things out.

282
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,956
Stay as long as you want.

283
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,079
Only thing is, Santo and me is
taking a powder.

284
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,910
What's up?

285
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,001
All I know is, the police
contact says we're hot.

286
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,124
Are the cops liable to show?

287
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,088
"Are the cops liable to show?"

288
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,086
I wouldn't worry.

289
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,300
Good-looking dame like you.

290
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,554
Not worry?

291
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,100
I've got half a dozen bum checks around,
a busted parole, a...

292
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,351
A landlord on my neck...

293
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,680
I'm broke, Hank's disappeared.

294
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,435
And it's rainin'.

295
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,099
Take me with you, Perk.

296
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,484
With the baby?

297
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,778
I can leave him with Hank's mother.
She'll be back in a week.

298
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,109
How about it, Perk?
If I'm picked up with Bobby,

299
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,899
they'll put him in a foster home sure.

300
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,325
I got the answer.

301
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,861
She comes with me to Acapulco. Simple.

302
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,367
I told you once, King.
I don't think Mexico's a smart idea.

303
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,198
I don't care what you think.

304
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,325
What do you say, hon?

305
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,290
It's nice down there, and sunny.

306
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,122
I'll rub oil all over your body,

307
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,212
so's you don't get too bad a burn.

308
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,170
It so happens I'd take a rap
to avoid a trip with you.

309
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,629
Why? We could have lots of fun together.

310
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,842
You're not my type.

311
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,009
I heard there was no such thing
as not your type.

312
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,968
Until I met you.

313
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,854
And believe me, it's purely personal.

314
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,648
Don't get sore, glamour boy.

315
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,853
You can't win 'em all.

316
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,193
Anyway, she's coming with us.

317
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,568
I'll send the three of you postcards.

318
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,695
You let me know which pen.

319
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,820
Watch out!

320
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,839
Spotter to control.

321
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,545
Boarding Lynwood bus.

322
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,135
<i>2659 southbound.</i>

323
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,887
<i>One tail with her. Over.</i>

324
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,267
Good work, spotter.

325
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,686
Control to walker.

326
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,231
If feasible, call intersecting streets.

327
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,312
All right, let's go.

328
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,626
Excuse me, sir. Is this cross street Burgess?

329
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,961
<i>Yeah, this is Burgess.
Royal and Burgess.</i>

330
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,005
That Ethel's on the ball.

331
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,758
Minns to mobile 3. Royal and Burgess.

332
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,638
Wait at Royal. Take number one position.

333
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,761
Out.

334
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,970
Minns to control.

335
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,511
At destination, call in all division one units.

336
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,097
Destination is where she goes to cover.
Read me?

337
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,041
Cut that screamer, Ted.

338
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,459
For once, write it the way it happens,

339
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,922
eh, Montgomery?

340
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,344
Don't worry, Inspector.

341
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,671
I'll spell your name right.

342
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,888
A tramp, but smart.

343
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,183
Good-looking girl, too.

344
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,608
The kind that fools you.

345
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,855
<i>Ha, not me.</i>

346
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,692
I've seen angel pusses who'd shoot
their own grandmothers in the back

347
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,239
and take bets on which way they'd fall.

348
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,500
Excuse me.

349
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,419
Getting off at Barham Plaza.

350
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,674
Getting off.

351
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,095
Control to walker. Drop off.

352
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,847
We're putting the sergeant on Graham.

353
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,227
We wanna play safe.

354
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,304
Don't work too close yourself, please.

355
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,744
<i>Meanwhile on the local scene,</i>

356
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,621
<i>I've just been handed a news flash
on the Monahan murder.</i>

357
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,123
<i>Police announce an important break</i>

358
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,376
<i>in the brutal slaying
of Mrs. Mabel Monahan,</i>

359
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,125
<i>found beaten to death 11 days ago
in Burbank.</i>

360
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,460
<i>Bruce King, a self-styled steeplejack,</i>

361
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,883
<i>was picked up last night
on the Mexican border.</i>

362
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,380
<i>According to one source,</i>

363
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,634
<i>he has given authorities
several highly significant leads.</i>

364
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,260
<i>Have you ever wondered whether
distant grass really does look the greenest?</i>

365
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,099
Tomorrow, we move further out.

366
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,013
But that's gonna make it tougher
to visit Bobby.

367
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,973
Are you still on that kid?

368
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,107
What's for chow?

369
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,394
Champagne and winter strawberries.

370
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,525
- Why, you...
- I'm not your maid!

371
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,981
All right, you two!

372
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,699
What do you know?

373
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,582
Santa Claus' workshop is finally
taking a breather.

374
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,168
SANTOI What the...

375
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,301
I'm not the only one
who doesn't pay his light bill.

376
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,300
Get down!

377
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,596
<i>This is
the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

378
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,307
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

379
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,146
<i>We are authorized by Iavv
to apprehend you dead or alive.</i>

380
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,402
<i>Dead or alive.</i>

381
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,826
She was tailed.

382
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,202
She let herself get tailed!

383
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,121
<i>h' you wish to surrender peaceably,</i>

384
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:45,292
<i>come out singly as your names are called,
hands above your head.</i>

385
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,414
<i>Come out singly, hands above your head.</i>

386
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,761
<i>Emmett Perkins, come out.</i>

387
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,383
<i>Emmett Perkins.</i>

388
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,806
<i>We will not wait, Emmett Perkins.</i>

389
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,262
<i>That is a warning.</i>

390
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,064
Maybe you asked 'em here, huh?

391
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,700
Yeah. I'll show you
the engraved invitations.

392
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,584
Come out, John R. Santo.

393
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,171
MAN; John R. Santo.

394
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,591
<i>You have 60 seconds, John R. Santo.</i>

395
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,640
<i>Obey orders, and nobody will be hurt,</i>

396
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,092
<i>John R. Santo.</i>

397
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,428
Oh.

398
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,446
<i>Barbara Graham.</i>

399
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,786
<i>Come out, Barbara Graham.</i>

400
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,965
<i>Come out, Barbara Graham.</i>

401
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,977
<i>Barbara Graham, you have 60 seconds.</i>

402
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:44,077
<i>If you do not come out, Barbara Graham,
we will come in and get you.</i>

403
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:51,627
We are warning you
not to attempt anything, Barbara Graham.

404
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,788
Your friends are in custody.

405
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,915
It is over.

406
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,425
For the last time, Barbara Graham,
come out.

407
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,193
Keep your hands
above your head.

408
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,699
<i>You heard me, Graham.</i>

409
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,241
<i>Hands above your head.</i>

410
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,671
I won't warn you again, Graham.

411
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,998
Get those hands up.

412
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,299
Miss! Ed Montgomery.

413
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,259
Listen, give me a statement,
I'll write your angle.

414
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,935
Grrr!

415
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,103
Brother!

416
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,813
That's the one to print.

417
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,274
"Bloody Babs, the tiger woman."

418
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,403
Did she confess?

419
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,484
Not yet.

420
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,114
They've been grilling her all night.

421
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,037
I'm going over there now.

422
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,573
For your own sake,
Mrs. Graham, tell the truth.

423
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,705
I've been trying to, for once.

424
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,290
You want a lie detector test?

425
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,914
I want a lawyer.

426
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,591
If you're innocent, a lie detector test
can only help you.

427
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,423
Innocent of what?

428
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,677
What's the charge?

429
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,754
Open charge.

430
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,259
Could be any one of a number of things.

431
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,636
Like what, for instance?

432
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,764
For instance, $251 worth of bad checks,

433
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,270
parolee consorting with known criminals,

434
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,351
suspicion of robbery.

435
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,103
And, of course, that other thing.

436
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,567
What other thing?

437
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,353
Mrs. Mabel Monahan.

438
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,695
I never even knew the dame.

439
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,697
You know she's been murdered, don't you?

440
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,780
Yeah, so was Julius Caesar.
I didn't know him, either.

441
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,000
Ever use narcotics, Babs?

442
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,624
- No.
- No?

443
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,839
Well, your husband does.

444
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,293
You know, if you cooperate,
maybe we can let you have a fix.

445
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,466
There's no monkey on my back.

446
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,889
Never has been.

447
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,557
Then what's with your legs?

448
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,633
Why are you squirming?

449
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,263
I got a worse habit,

450
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,145
like goin' to the powder room
every six or eight hours.

451
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,398
- You mind?
- Sit down.

452
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,981
Lousy hop-headed slut!

453
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,652
I'd like to spread you out
and stamp you into the ground.

454
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,153
Everybody gets his kicks
some way.

455
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
- Why, you dirty...
- Mrs. Graham,

456
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,450
we have a tough, ugly job to do,
and you're making it tougher

457
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,117
- and uglier for all of us.
- My heart bleeds for you.

458
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,502
How can I help, Inspector,
buy a few tickets to the policemen's ball?

459
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,413
You're being very foolish.

460
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,090
We're giving you a chance,
not only to help the law for once,

461
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,337
but save yourself.

462
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,506
What do you mean?

463
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,718
If you turn state's evidence,
tell us everything you know

464
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,142
about the Monahan job,
you can walk out of here a free woman.

465
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,803
We're offering you complete immunity.

466
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,145
All you have to do is sign
a full statement naming names,

467
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,525
we won't even call it a confession.

468
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,818
And you go free.

469
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,147
So that's why you been playing
the mama bull, Inspector.

470
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,986
You think I'm a stoolie, huh?

471
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,037
No dice!

472
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,489
I'm sorry for you.

473
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,200
Dumb.

474
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,709
Just plain dumb.

475
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,872
Right now, your playmates
are spillin' their guts.

476
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,582
Don't let 'em make you the patsy.

477
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,417
You heard the inspector.

478
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,878
Minute you sign a statement,
you're off the hook.

479
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,515
All right, I'll name names.

480
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,801
Now we're cookin'.

481
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,729
The inspector, the lieutenant, the sergeant,

482
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,399
especially you, Sarge, are jerks!

483
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,561
But I'll say this for you, Sarge.

484
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,400
You sweat.

485
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,989
I'm getting tired of fooling around with you.

486
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,241
She's the hardest cookie
I ever ran up against.

487
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,825
Worse than her boyfriends.

488
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,452
Yeah, what about them?

489
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,249
I have nothing for the papers yet.

490
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,326
Bear with me, huh?

491
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,419
Next on your phone, Ed.

492
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,419
Charlie, she won't confess,

493
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,971
so I'm gonna play up her vice record.

494
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,050
Dope, prostitution,
any other kick I dream up.

495
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,269
Nope. I'll keep Santo and Perkins
in the background.

496
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,687
Graham's the one who'll sell papers.

497
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,643
Yeah, of course she is.

498
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,066
She's had a record ever since
she was knee-high to a slot machine.

499
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:30,943
Oh, I'll paste together my usual valentine,
cold-blooded sadist, titian-topped tigress.

500
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,150
Titian.

501
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,359
Titian. Skip it.

502
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,989
I'll have it for you in an hour.

503
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,909
Is that how you got your Pulitzer?

504
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:44,457
It's Mrs. Graham's tough luck
to be young, attractive, belligerent,

505
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,506
immoral, and guilty as hell.

506
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,719
Ever been arrested?
- No. Hey!

507
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,593
What is this, a striptease?

508
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,513
Whom do you wish notified
in case of death or serious illness?

509
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,017
Marlon Brando.

510
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,271
Hey, how about letting me
have that tiger back? Hmm?

511
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,651
He's housebroken.

512
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,063
After I check it, it will be placed
with your property.

513
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,860
Well, what are you doing?

514
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,617
No!DoNfl

515
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,915
<i>My bonnie lives over the ocean</i>

516
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,336
<i>My bonnie sails over the sea...</i>

517
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,129
All right, Jenny Lind,

518
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,418
I have to look you over for soars,
wounds, open sores.

519
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,752
Turn around.

520
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,845
Slow.

521
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,516
Put your arms out.

522
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,974
So, look for scars.

523
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,856
You don't have to count my pores
one by one, do you?

524
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,017
What's that?

525
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,861
Push-button control.

526
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,529
Looks to me like someone
used you to put out a cigarette.

527
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,737
Don't touch the merchandise.

528
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,662
Think you're pretty hot stuff, huh?

529
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,241
This will cool you off.

530
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,373
Aah! Ooh!

531
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,891
Come on, honey.
You're gonna pad with me.

532
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:36,524
"Stone walls may not a prison make,
nor iron bars a cage."

533
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,983
But they sure help.

534
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,539
What I still don't get is,
why your kind of bail

535
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,870
just for hanging some bad paper
around town?

536
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,127
What I mean is, it's way out of line.

537
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,748
$25,000 for a chicken crime like forgery?

538
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,542
Unless they got something else
on you, huh?

539
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,549
Look,hon“.

540
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:02,511
You keep your sympathy to yourself,
and I'll keep my business to myself.

541
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,591
Okay?

542
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,052
Graham, front and center.

543
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,059
Something for you.

544
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,486
- Barbara Graham?
- Yeah.

545
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,283
"Subpoena..."

546
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,668
"Appear before the grand jury
for the crime..."

547
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,003
"Murder?"

548
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,546
What is this? They're crazy.

549
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,093
Oh, no, they don't!

550
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,004
They don't pull a raw one like this!

551
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,215
They don't pin a murder rap on me!

552
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:47,098
I've done a lot of things in my time,
a lot of things, but not murder!

553
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,557
I told those cops,
I know nothing about any murder!

554
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,312
Nothing! Do you hear me?

555
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,569
Nothing!

556
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,069
<i>"I know nothing about any murder.
Do you hear me? Nothing!"</i>

557
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,742
<i>shouts Barbara Graham
as she is indicted this afternoon</i>

558
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,991
<i>by the grand jury for the murder
of Mrs. Mabel Monahan,</i>

559
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,123
<i>a crippled Burbank widow.</i>

560
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,830
<i>Indicted along with her
are the other three members</i>

561
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,835
<i>of the so-called Monahan murder mob.</i>

562
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,998
<i>Bruce King, Emmett Perkins,
and John Santo.</i>

563
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,672
Don't know who it is except
the name I told you on the pad.

564
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,269
Peg!

565
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,187
Bonnie.

566
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,857
Well, of course, Mrs. Ciesilwicz.

567
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,435
- You're married.
- Uh-huh.

568
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,986
His name's Joe. He's an aircraft worker.

569
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,647
Any kids?

570
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,031
A boy and a girl.

571
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,988
Would you believe it? I'm a real square.

572
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,075
Thursday afternoon club,
the Holy Rosary Society,

573
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,872
community chest, the works.

574
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,374
Well, me, too, almost.

575
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,167
I have a boy, 13 months.

576
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,748
And smart.

577
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,498
You shouldn't have come here, Peg.

578
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,836
Oh, don't be silly.

579
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,048
If the newspapers get hold of it,
your husband's liable to find out.

580
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,796
He knows.

581
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,131
Yeah, but...

582
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,057
Does he know about us, how we were?

583
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,391
I came clean about everything long ago.

584
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,775
When I told him I was coming to see you,
you know what he said?

585
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,736
He said, "That's what friends are for."

586
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,191
- He, he did?
- Sure.

587
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,074
Oh, Bonnie, are you gonna be all right?

588
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,917
Well, we might as well face it,
I'm in a real jam this time.

589
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,833
I'm the little ball bouncing around
a roulette wheel,

590
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,007
everyone betting me to land
where it's gonna do them the most good.

591
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,926
Votes for the D.A.,
circulation for the newspapers,

592
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,470
promotions for the cops.

593
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,264
That still don't give them the right
to hang a bad rap on you.

594
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,764
You didn't ask me if it was a bad one.

595
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,265
I didn't have to.

596
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,430
Thanks.

597
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,190
You'd do the same for me
if it was the other way around.

598
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,269
It could have been, Bonnie.

599
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,607
Oh, believe me, it could have been.
We were, we were so alike.

600
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,567
All right. Stop that.

601
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,576
You're a different person now.

602
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,581
You have been, ever since you
got smart in San Diego and cut out.

603
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,786
All the stuff I read...

604
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,713
And I could...

605
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,463
Never read the handwriting on the...

606
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,501
Wall.

607
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,302
Well, is there anything I can do?

608
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,926
Could bring your boy around for a visit.

609
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,641
No. I don't want Bobby down here.

610
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,015
Maybe you could go and see him, though.

611
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,350
Oh, sure.

612
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,686
Barbara Graham, time's up.

613
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,521
But I only just got here.

614
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,481
Visiting room closes at 3:00.

615
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,900
Thanks for coming, Peg.

616
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,735
See you soon.

617
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:52,904
Oh.

618
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,207
What about a lawyer? Have you got one?

619
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,660
Nothing to worry about.

620
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,336
I'll use the public defender.

621
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,839
No, sir.

622
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,467
No court-appointed attorney for me.

623
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,175
I don't want you, Mr. Tibrow, period.

624
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,675
I want the public defender.

625
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,761
I assure you, I'll do the very best I can

626
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,343
with the $500 given me
to investigate your case.

627
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:20,185
500 bucks. That's not enough to investigate
who's pinching soap from a

628
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,518
Look, at least with the public defender,
I could put up a fight,

629
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,233
even if he doesn't have the men
and the dough that D.A. has.

630
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,859
Why can't I have the public defender?

631
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,159
Because, as I've tried to explain to you,

632
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,992
the district attorney
has pre-empted him for Bruce King,

633
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,531
and your interests are adverse.

634
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,119
Well, he's a defendant, too, isn't he?

635
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,702
Yes, but he claims that you did
the actual killing.

636
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,124
Why, that crummy, no-good...

637
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,880
- Mrs. Graham...
- ...dirty, double-crossing...

638
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,091
Can't we spend our precious time
on something more constructive?

639
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,892
Yeah, you're right.

640
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,395
I should be thanking you
instead of fighting with you.

641
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,724
All I ask is complete honesty between us.

642
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,318
That's a deal.

643
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,437
Now, then.

644
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,116
You stated that on the evening of March 9,

645
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,239
you were at home
with your husband and baby,

646
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,739
but in your testimony to the grand jury,

647
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,745
you said your husband couldn't be found.

648
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,244
- Don't you believe me?
- A jury won't.

649
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,331
You can't simply tell them, "I wasn't there."

650
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,667
You've got to say,
"I couldn't have been there,

651
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,717
"because here is where I was,

652
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,425
"and these are the people
who were with me to prove it."

653
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,800
Well, I can't do that.

654
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,511
So, let's level.

655
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,516
What chance have I got?

656
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,391
With an uncorroborated alibi?

657
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,775
None.

658
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,682
There is.

659
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,817
I'm the someone.

660
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,566
You shouldn't read other people's mail.

661
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,647
There's a lot of things I shouldn't do.

662
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,236
Step into my office.

663
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,865
Little Rita will take care of the pretty lady.

664
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,879
You really weren't there?

665
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,010
That's right, Your Honor.

666
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,842
Well, then, you've only got
one problem, sweetie.

667
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,886
You weren't with anybody
some other place.

668
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,139
I was with my husband, but he skipped.

669
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,849
And my son.

670
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:04,929
Age one.

671
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,108
I've got a friend. His name's Ben.

672
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,356
He could use money.

673
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,687
Yeah?

674
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,824
Ben's coming to see me Friday.

675
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,280
Maybe he should try to see you, too.

676
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,361
No, thanks.

677
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,910
It's something to think about.

678
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,411
Look, you're in for manslaughter yourself.

679
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,379
Why would you wanna do this for me?

680
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,132
You're a friend in need.

681
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,092
Tomorrow's Friday.

682
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,473
Just another wild prison rumor.

683
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,726
My friend Ben comes on Friday.

684
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,598
Have you thought about it?

685
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,059
Yeah. A lot.

686
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,562
It's an awful big chance.

687
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,646
It's a big rap.

688
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,607
One slip-up, that's all I'd need.

689
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,158
You can trust Ben.

690
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,653
How about you?

691
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,996
You know about me.

692
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,791
Make it easy. Bet it hard.

693
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,422
Four trey, seven away.

694
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,299
<i>Mamas gem' home to stay.</i>

695
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,635
You made your point, sweetie.

696
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,014
Yeah.

697
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,595
I guess I did.

698
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,271
I'm gonna need a password.

699
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,654
This line. Here.

700
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,907
<i>BEN".
"I came like water."</i>

701
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,366
"And like wind, I go."

702
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,866
Ben?

703
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,292
That's me.

704
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,671
Rita told you about the deal,
the money part?

705
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,590
You'll get it as soon as I'm out of here.

706
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,717
I guess it's all right,
as long as you're okay in Rita's book.

707
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,048
Now, one other thing.

708
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,806
Is there any physical evidence,
fingerprints, blood on your clothes?

709
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,138
Are you nuts? I wasn't even there.

710
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,102
Look, will you play it straight with me?

711
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,312
I'm going way out on a limb for you.
Way out.

712
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,897
I wasn't there.

713
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,313
All right, now, let's get with it.
We don't have much time.

714
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,649
Thirty minutes, that's all.

715
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,657
That's long enough. Easy.

716
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,828
There's time to
run through it just once more.

717
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,372
All right.

718
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,666
It was the Encino Arms Motel.

719
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,995
I picked you up in town,
near your house on 54th Street.

720
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,004
You were in a cab.
I was awaiting for you at the corner

721
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,798
of 54th and Sunset.

722
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,381
We went out to the motel, and we...

723
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,506
Poor Aunt Maude.

724
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,008
But she shouldn't use a mustard plaster.

725
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,305
I guess so.

726
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,927
All right. We went out to the motel...

727
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,184
And we registered under the name
of Mr. and Mrs. J. Clark.

728
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,393
- Mmm-hmm.
- We stayed there till 7:00 the next morning.

729
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,852
In cabin 20.

730
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,188
And then you took me home afterward.

731
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,903
And if they ask me why you've kept quiet
about it until now...

732
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,029
I'm married,

733
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,784
but now that I see that it's a matter
of life and death...

734
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,533
It sure is.

735
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,457
Nothing better go wrong with this.

736
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,829
Don't worry.

737
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,084
Where were you that night, really?

738
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,549
Look, I've gotta know.

739
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,422
If someone saw you where you really were,

740
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,175
and they show up at that trial,
where does that leave me?

741
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,213
Huh.

742
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,383
Nobody saw me.

743
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,847
How can you be sure?
You're not even sure where you were.

744
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,728
I'm sure, but I can't prove it.

745
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,769
If I could, I wouldn't need you, would I?

746
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,184
Uh-huh. Well, suit yourself.

747
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,521
Much as I'd like to save
that gorgeous hide of yours,

748
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,906
I just can't take that kind of a chance.

749
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,863
We better forget the whole thing.

750
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,073
Come back.

751
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,862
Yeah?

752
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,536
You got something you wanna say?

753
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,836
You've really got the hammerlocks on me.

754
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,382
- What do you want?
- You were there, weren't you?

755
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,587
Is that all you'll believe?

756
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,010
It would be an easy thing to believe,
and I wouldn't have to worry.

757
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,884
I'll double your money.

758
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,299
On, baby.

759
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,304
Ben!

760
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,393
Have it your way.

761
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,728
You were with them?

762
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,146
With Perkins and Santo?

763
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,614
Because if you were, it's okay.

764
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,946
It will be my story against Bruce King's.

765
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,614
You were with them, huh?

766
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,121
All right, all right, all right.
I was with them.

767
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,657
Then from here on in, you just relax.

768
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,209
You're a cinch to beat the cyanide.

769
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,463
<i>May it please the coun',</i>

770
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,798
counsel for the defendants,

771
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,094
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

772
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,840
we will prove that on the night
of March 9, 1953,

773
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:59,770
King, Santo, Perkins, Barbara Graham
brutally murdered Mrs. Mabel Monahan,

774
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,402
a crippled widow, 61 years of age.

775
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,487
You will see why they needed a woman
to gain admittance to the Monahan home.

776
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:13,155
We will show you how they searched
every nook and oranny of her house,

777
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,368
looking for a hidden cache of money.

778
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,541
<i>And in conclusion of his opening statement,</i>

779
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,163
<i>district attorney Milton cries,</i>

780
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,166
<i>"We mean business.</i>

781
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,294
<i>"You, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have sworn you have no scruples</i>

782
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,049
<i>"about the death penalty,</i>

783
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,878
<i>"even though one
of the defendants be a woman.</i>

784
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:33,341
<i>"So now I say to you,
invoke the extreme penalty.</i>

785
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,301
<i>"Let justice be done."</i>

786
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,346
Very well.
You arrived in front of the Monahan house.

787
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,479
It was dark.

788
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,479
Santo tells Barbara Graham,
"You go ahead in."

789
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,234
You see Mrs. Graham enter the house.

790
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,687
Then what happened?

791
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,363
Well, after Mrs. Graham
entered the Monahan house,

792
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,025
Santo and Perkins insisted that I follow her.

793
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,109
And did you?

794
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,364
About a minute later.

795
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,373
When you went in, what was the first thing
that attracted your attention?

796
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,534
Well, Mrs. Graham
was striking Mrs. Monahan

797
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,961
in the face with a gun.

798
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,208
In the head and face.

799
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,881
In what position was Mrs. Monahan?

800
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,050
She was standing up.

801
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,469
Mrs. Graham had her by the hair
with her left hand

802
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,672
and was striking her with her right hand.

803
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,010
Then what did you do?

804
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,060
Well, I told Mrs. Graham
to cease hitting her anymore,

805
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,354
put my hand in the way.

806
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,730
Mrs. Monahan collapsed.

807
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,977
And then?

808
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,185
Well, they tied Mrs. Monahan up
and searched the house.

809
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
Who did?

810
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,358
Santo, Perkins, and Mrs. Graham.

811
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,567
Oh, and me.

812
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,067
You may examine.

813
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,948
Don't let him get away with that.

814
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,199
Tear him apart.

815
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,578
TIBROWI Mr. King,

816
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,161
was an offer made to you
by the district attorney's office

817
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,042
to testify at this trial?

818
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,252
It was.

819
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,417
Would you state what that offer was?

820
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,337
Mr. Milton told me that if I would
tell the truth,

821
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,047
he would ask the court
to dismiss this case against me.

822
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,968
And that's the reason for the testimony
you have given, is it?

823
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,768
Oh, no, sir.

824
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,096
What is the reason for it, then?

825
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,522
To bring justice.

826
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,771
To all persons concerned,
including yourself?

827
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:07,810
Yes, sir.

828
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,737
And you feel it is justice for you
to be released,

829
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,865
and perhaps the others condemned?

830
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,283
I do.

831
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:20,289
Mr. King, you testified earlier
that Emmett Perkins gave you a gun

832
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,164
about five minutes before you reached
the Monahan house.

833
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,244
Is that correct?

834
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,500
Four or five minutes. Yes, sir.

835
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:32,506
Well, Mr. King, if you did not intend
to participate in violence,

836
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,461
even if you were there only on...

837
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,139
How shall we say, your mission of mercy...

838
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,298
Objection!

839
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,476
Your Honor, he's characterizing
the testimony.

840
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,182
Sustained, as to the last phrase.

841
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,556
Mr. King...

842
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,563
Pray tell, why did you take the gun?

843
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,732
You know something,
I've often wondered myself.

844
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,158
That sure rocked the jury.

845
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,035
Look at them.

846
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,388
<i>And as the trial of Barbara Graham
goes into its third day,</i>

847
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,188
<i>the nationwide interest in the fate
of the so-called queen of the murder mob</i>

848
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,559
<i>continues to mount.</i>

849
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,016
<i>Tonight, the police
have been alerted by a tip-off</i>

850
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,352
<i>that there's a gangland
plot to spring her.</i>

851
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,522
<i>Extra precautions will be taken
in the courtroom tomorrow.</i>

852
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,983
Hey, leave us in, pops.
We wanna see Babs.

853
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,277
Go on home.
Ain't you kids got nothing better to do?

854
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,327
Ah, your mother wears army boots.

855
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,155
Psst. Bonnie.

856
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,626
Hi, Peg.

857
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,999
I saw Bobby this morning.

858
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,007
- How is he?
- Wonderful. He'll be walking soon.

859
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,543
Oh, I've gotta be there to see him
take that first step.

860
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,170
Oh, you will. You will. It's going fine.

861
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,464
Yeah, sure.

862
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,389
I just haven't had my innings yet, that's all.

863
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,934
Ah, Mrs. Graham,
I'm Ed Montgomery from...

864
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,010
I've seen the name.

865
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,895
Who's she?

866
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,226
Some autograph hound.

867
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,431
Me, too.

868
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,109
How about signing an exclusive interview?
I'll pay.

869
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,277
<i>OK, scoop.</i>

870
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,946
Here's your first installment.

871
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,533
"Bloody Babs shuns press."

872
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,822
Please remain seated,
and come to order.

873
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,327
Court is again in session.

874
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:31,587
The record will show the jury, counsel,
and defendants present.

875
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,372
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

876
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,458
Our next witness will be here
in a moment, Your Honor.

877
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,759
He's just outside.

878
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,265
Hey, that's my man.

879
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,428
Your who?

880
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,223
That's Ben. Ben, the one I told you about.

881
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,396
Raise your right hand to be sworn.

882
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,941
That's the fella who was with you
at the motel?

883
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,231
That's my witness.

884
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,444
Your witness?

885
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,525
He's just been called by the prosecution.

886
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,450
But that's Ben Miranda. That's my alibi.

887
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,704
State your name, please.

888
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,498
Benjamin Miranda.

889
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,497
What is your occupation, Mr. Miranda?

890
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,079
Police officer for the city of Los Angeles.

891
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,044
Now, sometime before today,
were you given a special assignment

892
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,966
by the Los Angeles police department

893
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,544
to work on the investigation
of the Monahan murder case?

894
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,799
Yes, sir, I was.

895
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,426
What was that assignment?

896
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,761
On August the 7th,
I went to the women's division

897
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,143
of the county jail for a meeting
with Mrs. Graham.

898
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,640
Was this meeting at
Barbara Graham's request?

899
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,316
They crossed me.

900
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,147
The both of them crossed me.

901
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,819
That dirty, stinking little tramp.

902
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:38,854
Shut up!

903
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,111
Now, at the time and place
you first saw Barbara Graham,

904
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,902
did you give her some kind of password?

905
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,032
Yes, sir. I did.

906
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,658
Can't you do something, Mr. Tibrow?

907
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,115
I'll do something.

908
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,992
What was the password?

909
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,708
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

910
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,831
You may, Mr. Tibrow.

911
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,926
May it please the court,

912
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:09,681
I have repeatedly warned my client
against deceiving me in any way,

913
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:10,844
but I have been deceived.

914
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,522
I've been lied to. I've been misled.

915
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,183
For the record,
I ask permission to withdraw.

916
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,564
I am sympathetic with counsel.

917
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,568
However, since no person
could be better qualified

918
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,867
than the attorney who has proceeded
in the case so far,

919
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,653
the court does not feel
that it should relieve you.

920
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,197
Just so the court understands my position.

921
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,239
Oh, it does indeed.

922
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,326
Proceed.

923
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,537
Read the last question, Mr. Reporter.

924
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,877
Question.
"What was the password?"

925
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,712
"I came like water, and like wind I go."

926
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,926
<i>BEN". It'd be my story against Bruce King's.</i>

927
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,222
<i>You were with him, huh?</i>

928
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,179
<i>All right, all right, all right.
I was with him.</i>

929
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,060
<i>Then from here on in, you just relax.</i>

930
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,225
<i>You're a cinch to beat the cyanide.</i>

931
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,063
<i>Those are the words which go echoing
through the courtroom today</i>

932
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,940
<i>at the trial of Barbara Graham.</i>

933
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,114
<i>A written transcript is used
in court for the prosecution,</i>

934
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,240
<i>but you are hearing the actual voices
as originally recorded</i>

935
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,743
<i>on the wire inside a
tiny mini-phone like this,</i>

936
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,329
<i>which Police Officer Miranda
conceals on his body</i>

937
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,582
<i>during his rigged prison meeting
with the alleged murderess.</i>

938
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,794
<i>It's all taken down on the miniature
recording device.</i>

939
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,218
<i>Her desperate attempt
to establish a false alibi,</i>

940
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,347
<i>her faltering admission she was there
at the scene of the crime.</i>

941
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:32,427
<i>The flaming redhead finally crumbles
into a shattered, frightened woman.</i>

942
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,729
<i>She is led crying from the courtroom
after the brutal session.</i>

943
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,764
<i>Curious onlookers, photographers,</i>

944
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,276
<i>and reporters, including this correspondent,
crowd around her.</i>

945
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,403
<i>Have you anything to say
for TV, Mrs. Graham?</i>

946
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,609
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

947
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:48,150
<i>What about the testimony of Bruce King
and Police Officer Miranda today?</i>

948
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,908
<i>I'm completely innocent.
I was home with my family that night.</i>

949
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,663
<i>They'll all die violently.</i>

950
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:57,118
<i>The spies, the liars, all the ones
who want me dead.</i>

951
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,497
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

952
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,920
<i>Do you swear it?</i>

953
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,079
<i>I swear it.</i>

954
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,382
<i>I swear it on my baby's life.</i>

955
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,961
<i>May God strike him dead if I'm guilty.</i>

956
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:11,010
<i>And what happens to Rita,
the blond prison siren,</i>

957
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,343
<i>the inside girl who so invaluably
aided the police,</i>

958
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,770
<i>while herself serving
time for manslaughter?</i>

959
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:21,483
<i>Her sentence is suspended,
and she is released on probation,</i>

960
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,770
<i>as the woman she helped entrap
takes the stand tomorrow</i>

961
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,438
<i>to fight for her life.</i>

962
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,358
And now, despite what
you told Mr. Miranda,

963
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,614
you claim the truth is that you were
at home with your husband

964
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,244
on the night of March the 9th.
Is that correct?

965
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,947
So, help me God.

966
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,662
And yet you made no effort
to contact your husband.

967
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,456
While at the same time,
you went to great lengths

968
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,747
to make use of the services of Mr. Miranda.
Is that correct?

969
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,331
The same goes for you!

970
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,791
Just answer the question!

971
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:52,715
I wrote Henry one letter
while I was in the county jail,

972
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,516
and I never got an answer.

973
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,093
And in that letter, did you say anything

974
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:59,897
about being with him on the all-important
night of March the 9th?

975
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,317
You're hesitating, Mrs. Graham.

976
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,024
I'm trying to think.

977
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,063
You do that.

978
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,360
May the record show
that I have here a letter

979
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,745
addressed to Henry L. Graham,

980
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:19,200
postmarked May 20th, 1953,

981
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,584
and stamped on it,

982
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,538
"Mail censored, Los Angeles County Jail."

983
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,253
I will ask that this be marked next
in order for identification.

984
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,424
So ordered.

985
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,047
People's exhibit 73.

986
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,629
I ask you to read this letter,

987
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,759
and tell us whether or not you wrote it.

988
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,978
That's her husband.

989
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,775
Henry L. Graham.

990
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,029
Oh, thank God.

991
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,826
I will clear
the courtroom

992
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,154
if there's another such
outburst from anyone.

993
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,076
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

994
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,418
Did you write that letter
to your husband, Mrs. Graham?

995
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,008
Yes, I did.

996
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,631
And in that letter,
did you say anything

997
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,338
about where you and
he might have been

998
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,513
on the night of
March the 9th,

999
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:17,136
or whether you
were together,

1000
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,559
or anything about
establishing your alibi?

1001
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,810
No.

1002
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,014
I offer into evidence,
if the court please,

1003
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,064
this letter
marked exhibit 73.

1004
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,356
Accepted into evidence,
letter marked exhibit 73.

1005
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:33,277
But I remember
now why I didn't.

1006
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,738
I wanted Henry to
come and see me.

1007
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,278
You also asked Mr. Miranda
to come and see you

1008
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,989
and testify falsely that he was
with you March the 9th.

1009
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,245
I didn't exactly want him.

1010
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,291
I just felt that I had no other choice.

1011
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,046
You told him that
you were really

1012
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,465
with Perkins and Santo that night,
didn't you, Mrs. Graham?

1013
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,672
I kept telling him that I wasn't
at the scene of the crime,

1014
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,471
and he acted like
he should insist I was,

1015
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,968
and I thought,

1016
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,142
well, this is my last chance.

1017
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,012
I can't prove where I was,

1018
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,641
and if he walks out on me,

1019
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,556
then I won't have anybody.

1020
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,394
I didn't know what to do,
which way to turn.

1021
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,070
Just respond to the question!

1022
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,192
All I could think of

1023
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,818
was that I couldn't
prove my alibi

1024
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,075
and I was gonna go
to the gas chamber,

1025
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,993
- and I was desperate!
Mrs. Graham...

1026
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:22,039
Have you ever been desperate?
Do you know what it's like?

1027
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,330
Mrs. Graham!

1028
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,374
Your Honor, I move that be stricken!

1029
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,997
So ordered.

1030
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,920
- Mrs. Graham, you...
- I know.

1031
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,589
I'm sorry. I know.

1032
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,634
Proceed.

1033
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,296
Mrs. Graham, perhaps
one of the reasons

1034
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,214
you were so "desperate,"
as you call it,

1035
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,890
during all this time,

1036
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,013
was that you knew

1037
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,890
you were already
on probation.

1038
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,688
I guess I still am.

1039
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,098
From where?

1040
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,732
San Francisco.

1041
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,528
Of what crime
were you convicted?

1042
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,613
You're hesitating
again, Mrs. Graham.

1043
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,488
Of what desperate crime
were you convicted?

1044
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,534
Perjury.

1045
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,521
Barbara Graham.

1046
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,398
He's here.

1047
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,022
How's the Dior? Okay?

1048
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,478
Oh, elegant.

1049
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,689
Hey.

1050
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,775
Tell him to come up
and see me sometime.

1051
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,492
Captain's given
you permission

1052
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,865
to see him in the
attorney's room.

1053
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,696
That's swell of her.

1054
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,949
I've seen him, Barbara.
He's a doll.

1055
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,459
Thank you, ma'am.

1056
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,082
Ask him
if he's got a friend.

1057
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,621
I'll do that.

1058
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,049
Aw, don't cry, honey.

1059
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,049
Hey, here she is.

1060
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,972
Now, give your mama
a kiss, like I showed you.

1061
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,556
Oh, sweetheart.

1062
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,934
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.

1063
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,848
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1064
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,565
- Peg, what happened?
- It's the cameras.

1065
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,694
Why don't you be decent
and give us a break, huh?

1066
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,909
Oh, mommy missed
you, sweetheart.

1067
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,361
Mommy missed you.

1068
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,498
Tell us, Barbara,

1069
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,660
how does it feel
seeing your baby,

1070
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,245
knowing that you
face the gas chamber?

1071
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,087
How the hell do
you think it feels?

1072
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,924
Damn them!
Damn them! Damn them!

1073
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,679
Get your mitts off!

1074
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,514
Back to your cell! Come on!

1075
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:34,682
Damn you! Damn you!

1076
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,601
Therefore, while there
are certain practices

1077
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,187
I don't think police officers
should indulge in,

1078
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,398
in this instance,
I see no grounds for criticism.

1079
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,867
Motion for a new trial is denied.

1080
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,577
May the record show
that I appeared

1081
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,199
for the motion for a new trial

1082
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,035
only since Mr. Tibrow
has taken ill?

1083
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,449
All right, Mr. Matthews,

1084
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:55,001
you'll be relieved of further
responsibility in this case.

1085
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,378
Thank you, Your Honor.

1086
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,002
The defendant, Barbara Graham,

1087
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,461
is remanded to the custody

1088
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,885
of the sheriff of
Los Angeles county,

1089
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,135
to be delivered by him

1090
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,385
to the California Institution
for Women at Corona.

1091
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,470
It is the judgment and
sentence of this court

1092
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,396
that the defendant,
Barbara Graham,

1093
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,224
suffer the extreme penalty,

1094
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,767
to wit, the death penalty.

1095
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,357
And that said
penalty be inflicted

1096
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,817
within the walls of
the state penitentiary

1097
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,945
at San Quentin, California,

1098
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,743
in the manner and means
prescribed by law,

1099
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,412
to wit, the administration
of lethal gas

1100
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,582
until said defendant is dead.

1101
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,599
Bring her over
here for T.V., boys.

1102
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,971
Please step aside.

1103
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,179
Hey, Babs!
Now your husband's dried out,

1104
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,604
I hear he wants to
change his story.

1105
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,857
Come on, will you?
Give it a break, huh, Montgomery?

1106
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,900
You didn't, Counselor.
You just dropped her.

1107
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,106
Any comments on that?

1108
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,237
From what I read in the papers,
she ain't my type.

1109
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,068
Uh-huh. Big boy like you.

1110
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,483
Maybe you shouldn't believe
everything you read.

1111
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,784
Have you
anything to say?

1112
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,412
Uh, how about it, Babs?
Just a short statement.

1113
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,119
Yeah, Babs, why so quiet today?

1114
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,543
I wanna thank
the gentlemen of the press.

1115
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,620
You've chewed me up
in your headlines,

1116
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,040
and all the jury had to do
was spit me out!

1117
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,090
You're all invited
to the execution.

1118
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,626
That's only fair.

1119
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,461
You led the pack, Montgomery.

1120
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,722
Bring your wife.
She'll enjoy it.

1121
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,888
For once, how about
a statement from you?

1122
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,844
Are you satisfied now?

1123
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,160
Hey, it looks
like a college.

1124
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,327
Yes.

1125
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,700
In fact, the
girls at Corona

1126
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,077
refer to the grounds as
"the campus."

1127
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,079
Rah, rah, rah.

1128
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,913
Well, I've gotta admit,

1129
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,464
this place is a
big improvement

1130
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,216
over some of those
other menageries I've been in.

1131
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,669
Every dress
different, huh?

1132
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,929
Yes, because no
two girls are alike.

1133
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,803
We want our girls
to walk tall with their heads up.

1134
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,012
Hi, Barbara.

1135
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,138
HI.

1136
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,725
She knew me.

1137
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,932
Guess I'm sort of the,
what do they call it,

1138
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,767
"big man on campus," huh?

1139
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,102
This is your room.

1140
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,276
Here we go again.

1141
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,483
Just show me where you
keep the hammerlocks,

1142
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,026
and I'm all set.

1143
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,033
We have to put you in isolation
because of your...

1144
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,580
Death sentence?

1145
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,874
First time I ever heard
it was contagious.

1146
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,041
Sorry, Barbara.

1147
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,702
It has to be this way.

1148
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,588
Ah, I probably wouldn't have
made the team anyhow.

1149
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,624
Never have yet.

1150
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:05,021
Is that Shelly Manne?

1151
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,435
Yeah. You like him?

1152
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,152
Knocks me out.

1153
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,777
They electrocuting somebody?

1154
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,825
That means two minutes
to lights out.

1155
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:18,996
Got to scoot.

1156
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,532
Solong.

1157
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,593
Good night, Bar...

1158
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,097
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
You can't wear that here.

1159
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,091
Well, why not?

1160
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,145
It's too... provocative.

1161
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,264
Provocative?

1162
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,225
There's nothing
but dames here.

1163
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,519
Not a man within miles.

1164
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,230
And I've got these
for a chastity belt.

1165
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,487
Oh, boy, would I love to have

1166
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,113
somebody to provoke.

1167
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,118
It's very foolish to make trouble
on your first night, Barbara.

1168
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,787
I'd advise you to
wear the nightgown

1169
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,334
we've provided you.

1170
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,502
- Well?
- Okay.

1171
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,668
Okay, I'll take it off...

1172
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,425
But I won't wear
your burlap job.

1173
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,343
I'll sleep raw.

1174
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:23,974
Well?

1175
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,104
Cover yourself.

1176
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,015
She refused
to take a lie detector test.

1177
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,305
She wrote Tibrow
she wants to take one now, Carl.

1178
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,599
Yes, now she does as
a last-ditch gamble,

1179
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,184
but she wouldn't
risk it before.

1180
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,523
Could be she had
other things to hide.

1181
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,813
Probably quite a lot.

1182
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,652
I still say there's
something about her.

1183
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,781
When you meet her...

1184
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,660
Hello, Mr. Matthews.

1185
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,530
How's Mr. Tibrow?

1186
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,949
Better, but still in the hospital.

1187
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,034
He asked me to reconsider
taking your appeal.

1188
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,243
Oh?

1189
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,045
I want Mr. Palmberg
to talk to you.

1190
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,250
Then I'll decide.

1191
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,372
Hello, Barbara.

1192
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,964
Sit over here, please.

1193
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,717
Carl is gonna make
some tests on you.

1194
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,720
He's a psychologist as
well as a criminologist.

1195
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,142
That's his problem.

1196
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,595
I don't like my mother.

1197
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,554
I never knew my father.

1198
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,231
Where's your hammer?

1199
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,641
Sky, blue.

1200
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,101
Monday, wash.

1201
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,356
How's that?

1202
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,612
They're responses
to the word test.

1203
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,781
All right, Al.
I'll see you later.

1204
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,779
Oh, sure.

1205
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,905
What's the book?

1206
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,622
Poetry.

1207
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,419
"There was a young lad
from Japan

1208
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,462
"Whose verses they
never would scan

1209
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,091
"When he was asked why,
he said with a sigh

1210
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,260
"Darn it all, I just can't
help trying

1211
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,757
"To get as many words
in the last line

1212
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,259
"As I possibly,
possibly can"

1213
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:26,760
We might get along.

1214
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,394
I hope so.

1215
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,601
I'd like to start
with a Rorschach Test.

1216
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:31,730
Do you know
what that is?

1217
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,107
Oh, yeah. lnkblots.

1218
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,393
They'll tell you
what's on my murky brain.

1219
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,940
Right.

1220
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,942
Go ahead.
What do you see?

1221
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,115
A rain cloud.

1222
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,615
Bobby.

1223
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,867
This one, this one
looks like a bed.

1224
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,788
What about her, Carl?

1225
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,376
She's totally amoral.

1226
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,707
She's a compulsive liar

1227
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,258
with no regard
for law and order

1228
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,669
or the conventions
of society.

1229
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,378
You must have
been reading my stuff.

1230
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,462
Then I shouldn't even...

1231
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,847
I think you should
take the appeal.

1232
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,640
- What?
- I think she's innocent.

1233
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,265
If she's innocent, why don't
Santo and Perkins speak up?

1234
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,804
What have they
got to lose now?

1235
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,480
The only cure
they can think of

1236
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,104
- for the cyanide.
- Come again?

1237
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:16,983
They believe that in the end,

1238
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,857
her sentence will be commuted.

1239
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,233
A young, attractive woman,

1240
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,530
a mother...

1241
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,950
And if you don't send
the actual killer to the gas chamber,

1242
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,236
how can you send
the ones who just stood around?

1243
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,538
That's why they decided
to keep her out front

1244
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:29,785
and say that she did it.

1245
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,324
And that's why they're
gonna keep her there,

1246
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,454
right up to the
chamber door.

1247
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,493
Now, that's just
your own opinion.

1248
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,208
Just my own opinion,
Montgomery.

1249
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:37,709
Unfortunately,
I can't print it

1250
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,290
under a byline
and make it a fact.

1251
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,334
There's the reverse, Carl.

1252
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,672
The State has to gas her,

1253
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,337
if they wanna get
Santo and Perkins.

1254
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,297
I'm convinced
she couldn't have done it.

1255
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,762
She has a positive
aversion to violence,

1256
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,014
physical violence,
not emotional.

1257
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,516
Forgery, perjury, vice,
these are her crimes.

1258
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,269
They're not crimes
of violence.

1259
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,693
They're the crimes of those
for whom violence is impossible.

1260
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,319
Also, she's left-handed.

1261
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,822
- I never noticed that.
- No.

1262
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,199
I didn't see it mentioned
in any of your articles.

1263
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,575
Bruce King testified
that she did it

1264
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,278
with the gun in her right hand.

1265
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,363
Well, you can't use that
in an appeal.

1266
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,619
It's evidence that was
available during the trial.

1267
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,621
Look, you
didn't bring me out here

1268
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,792
to tell you
how to appeal,

1269
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,211
only whether.

1270
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,291
Well, we shall have to...

1271
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,089
What do you mean "we"?

1272
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,211
Even if I take it,

1273
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,296
there's no money
for an investigation.

1274
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,543
Besides,

1275
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,970
in your present
state of health...

1276
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,672
Stop interrupting.

1277
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,225
We'll have to develop
a great deal of new evidence.

1278
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,726
That's my job.

1279
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,387
You'll translate it into

1280
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,564
your highly
incomprehensible legal prose.

1281
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,065
But evidence
and jargon alone

1282
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,692
will not save the lady.

1283
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,942
That's where you come in.

1284
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,362
The press created the climate
which condemned her.

1285
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:44,693
You'll have to change
that climate.

1286
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:45,902
Now, whatever
gave you the idea

1287
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,575
that I'm on your side?

1288
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,740
You're here, aren't you?

1289
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,366
To get a story,
that's all.

1290
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,789
You could have concocted
your usual story

1291
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,707
without making the trip.

1292
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,743
So it strikes me
you already had it in mind

1293
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,082
to change your
point of view.

1294
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,251
Hmm.

1295
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,259
I'm not sure what
I had in mind.

1296
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,418
I am.

1297
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,212
You remind
me of the man

1298
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,346
who was looking for his hat,

1299
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,890
when it was on his head
the whole time.

1300
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,015
Maybe,

1301
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,765
but at least I...
I haven't lost my head yet.

1302
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,774
<i>But today, Peg,
things are looking up.</i>

1303
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,863
<i>Mr. Matthews has
taken my appeal.</i>

1304
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,536
<i>There's a man with
him, a Carl Palmberg.</i>

1305
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,581
<i>I can't describe the
effect he has on a person...</i>

1306
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,538
<i>But there, that's it.
I'm a person again,</i>

1307
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,494
<i>not a condemned person.</i>

1308
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,553
<i>You can imagine
how upset I am, Al,</i>

1309
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,676
<i>that after all our efforts
for the last six months,</i>

1310
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:52,882
<i>they positively refuse</i>

1311
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,967
<i>to give me a lie
detector test.</i>

1312
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,770
<i>Surely, by now, there's
some word on my appeal.</i>

1313
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,646
<i>The suspense is killing me.</i>

1314
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:00,974
<i>Ha, ha!</i>

1315
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,479
<i>I guess you're
beginning to realize</i>

1316
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,564
<i>what an impossible
client I am,</i>

1317
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,816
<i>especially for
a nonpaying one.</i>

1318
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,569
<i>Could be my upbringing.</i>

1319
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,484
<i>And another thing, Carl,</i>

1320
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,619
<i>thank Montgomery for
his latest article.</i>

1321
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:14,653
<i>You were right.</i>

1322
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,739
<i>The interviews are
beginning to pay off.</i>

1323
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,244
<i>I don't know what's
making him change</i>

1324
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,496
<i>toward me in his old age,</i>

1325
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,327
<i>but he sure seems to have.</i>

1326
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,706
<i>Most important
of all, though,</i>

1327
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,541
<i>please, please,</i>

1328
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,671
<i>please, Carl,</i>

1329
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,297
<i>you must bring
me definite news</i>

1330
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,554
<i>about my appeal,
or I'll go insane.</i>

1331
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,521
Please, Mrs. Graham,
you must sit still.

1332
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,773
You ain't got rhythm,
Doc. that's your trouble.

1333
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,601
My trouble is 15 other
appointments today.

1334
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,527
These inlays take time.

1335
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,148
Pretty funny,
putting in gold inlays

1336
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,408
when they've already got
some of those cyanide eggs

1337
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,110
marked with my initials.

1338
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,285
Such talk.

1339
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,783
Barbara.

1340
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,531
Carl.

1341
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,370
I'd like to talk
to Mrs. Graham.

1342
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,372
It's all right.

1343
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,044
Don't just stand there, give.

1344
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,222
Your appeal has been denied.

1345
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:27,898
Did they set a date?

1346
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,110
December 3, but, uh, Al immediately
put in for a stay of execution.

1347
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,236
No!

1348
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,571
I don't want any stay!

1349
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,451
If you can't get my
sentence commuted,

1350
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,529
then don't get me a stay!

1351
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,120
At least I know it will be over
on December the 3rd!

1352
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,666
- Barbara...
- You heard me!

1353
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,539
I can't stand it anymore!

1354
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,749
I can't!

1355
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,081
Barbara.

1356
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,425
Oh, Carl.

1357
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,131
What am I gonna do?

1358
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,595
You're gonna get your teeth fixed.

1359
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,594
Come on.

1360
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,203
Bad dreams again, Barbara?

1361
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,750
Oh...

1362
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,127
Go away, and
leave me alone.

1363
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,846
There's your mommy.

1364
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,678
Oh, Bobby.

1365
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,018
Sweetie!

1366
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,441
On, Bobby. Baby, baby.

1367
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,564
Mommy's so happy to see you.

1368
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:33,940
How is she?

1369
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,860
With four days left,
how would you be?

1370
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,533
Oh, you're such
a big boy now.

1371
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,363
And you must weigh
at least 25 pounds, I bet you.

1372
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,537
Yeah.

1373
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,323
You remember how
we used to play

1374
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,208
wibbleton to wobbleton?

1375
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,037
This is a game we used
to play every night, hmm?

1376
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,289
Yeah, and here we go.

1377
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:57,006
From Wibbleton to
Wobbleton is 15 miles.

1378
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,921
From Wobbleton to
Wibbleton is 15 miles.

1379
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:03,258
Do you like that?
See, Peg? He remembers.

1380
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,304
Okay, sport,
here we go again.

1381
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,226
<i>From Wibb/eton
to Wobb/eton is 15 miles</i>

1382
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:17,488
<i>From Wobbleton to
Wibbleton is 15 miles</i>

1383
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:22,410
<i>From Wobbleton to Wibbleton</i>

1384
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,820
<i>From...</i>

1385
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,910
Come along, sonny.
Let's get some ice cream.

1386
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,576
Oh, don't, don't,
honey. You mustn't.

1387
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,961
Oh, Peg, anything but losing him.

1388
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,711
Maybe I could stand it if it,
if it weren't for losing him.

1389
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,501
You won't. Now, you won't!

1390
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,086
Sometimes I think
everything inside rne

1391
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,762
is gonna bust wide open,

1392
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,469
and I feel as though somebody's
pulling out my guts

1393
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,095
with their bare hands.

1394
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:47,931
Shh,honey.Shh.

1395
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,312
I never should
have had him, Peg.

1396
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,813
Even if I do miss
the gas chamber, I'll...

1397
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,019
I'll rot in prison.

1398
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,906
I'll only cause him to suffer
by staying alive.

1399
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,784
I'm glad I'm gonna die.

1400
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,783
Barbara.

1401
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:11,913
Barbara, listen to me.

1402
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,128
You've been granted
a stay of execution

1403
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,130
by the United States
Supreme Court.

1404
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,921
Oh...

1405
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,135
Oh, God.

1406
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,639
Oh, God!

1407
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,478
<i>If I'd known you were
in the hospital, Carl,</i>

1408
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,102
<i>I wouldn't have sent
that last silly letter.</i>

1409
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,607
<i>Guess I shouldn't
have anyhow,</i>

1410
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,359
<i>but waiting these
past two months</i>

1411
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,732
<i>for the supreme court
to review my petition</i>

1412
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,439
<i>has been a strain.</i>

1413
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,532
<i>I've been lying
here thinking</i>

1414
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:46,076
<i>about what you said
on your last visit.</i>

1415
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,245
<i>I do want to live, Carl.</i>

1416
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,119
<i>Life does seem
very dear to me.</i>

1417
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,954
<i>I want to live,</i>

1418
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,414
<i>and you're my greatest hope.</i>

1419
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,516
I can't believe it...

1420
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,981
Carl dead.

1421
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,277
And we were counting heavily
on his investigation.

1422
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,071
He didn't leave any notes
on his new stuff.

1423
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,528
It all went with him.

1424
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,367
Everything went with him.

1425
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,122
Well, don't say that.

1426
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,495
You've got a lot
going for you.

1427
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,161
Al Matthews, those committees,

1428
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,829
and me.

1429
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,583
That isn't what you came
to tell me, Mr. Montgomery.

1430
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,881
Yeah.

1431
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,177
The supreme court has
denied your petition.

1432
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,605
What's the new date?

1433
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,270
June.

1434
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,566
June 3.

1435
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,574
Yesterday, I found
two gray hairs.

1436
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,401
Not bad, huh? Only two.

1437
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,079
You've still got a couple
of legal shots to fire.

1438
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,615
Al is in court right now
working on them.

1439
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,245
And tomorrow
I'm gonna make a pitch

1440
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:17,785
to the Governor's
clemency secretary.

1441
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,166
I've even gotten the paper
to come outwith an editorial

1442
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,497
in favor of commuting
your sentence.

1443
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,752
Why not?

1444
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:26,093
Win or lose,
I sell a lot of papers.

1445
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:29,713
Yeah.

1446
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,554
Barbara, I...

1447
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,473
Barbara, what
I wrote about you

1448
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,229
during your trial...

1449
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,479
- The way I feel now...
- No!

1450
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,071
Ah, this is a
hell of a sendoff

1451
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,610
you're giving me.

1452
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,616
Everything but confetti.

1453
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,202
<i>And here in the southland,</i>

1454
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,753
<i>today marks the
beginning of the end</i>

1455
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:03,130
for Barbara Graham.

1456
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,377
<i>Our newsreel cameraman</i>

1457
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,254
<i>catches her leaving
Corona this morning</i>

1458
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,010
<i>on what may be her
last trip anywhere.</i>

1459
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:11,012
<i>As I watch Barbara
enter the car</i>

1460
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,216
<i>that will speed her to the
death cell at San Quentin,</i>

1461
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,142
<i>I think how little she looks
like a condemned murderess,</i>

1462
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:19,305
<i>who will lead off California's
first triple execution.</i>

1463
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,811
<i>More like the pretty girl
who, a long time ago,</i>

1464
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:24,567
<i>took the wrong fork
in the road of life.</i>

1465
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,645
<i>Thoughts like these
discourage me from</i>

1466
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,822
<i>crowding up to her
with the other reporters</i>

1467
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,274

barrage of questions.</i>

1468
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,984
<i>Do you still think
you have a chance, Babs?</i>

1469
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,119
<i>Hey, Babs.
Whafll you wear tomorrow?</i>

1470
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,206
<i>But even now,
hope eternal rides with her.</i>

1471
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,330
<i>At any time before her
scheduled appointment</i>

1472

<i>in the gas chamber

Governor himself,</i>

1474

<i>may yet decide to

1475
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,334
Here she comes!

1476
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,012
Babs! Babs!

1477
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,218
Hey, Barbara,
look this way!

1478
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,569
We're with you, hon!

1479
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,998
Want to see her
with me, Ed?

1480
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,004
Five minutes with Perkins
is what I want.

1481
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:27,290
Five lousy minutes, Warden.

1482
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,794
He's refused you.

1483
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,876
Since when are you
so sensitive to his whims?

1484
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,635
It's his last night, too.

1485
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,338
Yeah, but it doesn't
have to be Barbara's.

1486
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,551
That louse
could clear her!

1487
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,975
Will you stop giving me
a hard time?

1488
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,304
Any execution is tough enough
on the prison as it is,

1489
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,184
but with a woman in
the death house...

1490
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,939
At least will you tell Perkins
I'll be standing by?

1491
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:46,688
- Yes. Yes.
- All night, if necessary?

1492
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,524
Yes! You can wait here, but...

1493
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,404
Please lay off the pressure.

1494
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,955
Hello, Barbara.

1495
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,456
My name's Barbara, too.

1496
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:49,496
I'm Mrs. Graham to you.

1497
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,206
Whatever you like,
Mrs. Graham.

1498
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,417
- This is Mrs...
- Let's skip the introductions.

1499
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,630
This isn't a garden party.

1500
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,261
I would get
someone like you,

1501
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,592
fat stuff.

1502
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,428
Now, now, Barbara.
That's the wrong attitude.

1503
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,601
Sign her over
on the D.W., please.

1504
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,149
I wish you luck, Barbara.

1505
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,984
We all do at Corona.

1506
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,745
This is your cell.

1507
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,837
- You take the first watch.
- All right.

1508
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,126
I'll get the coffee started.

1509
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,215
And turn off that schmaltz.

1510
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,363
Might as well get into
something comfortable.

1511
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,870
I'm sure you'll be more
comfortable in these.

1512
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,662
What's eating you?

1513
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:05,864
You'll have to undress

1514
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,449
so I can give you a
complete shakedown.

1515
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,877
You won't find anything
hidden on my body.

1516
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,173
If I was gonna kill myself,
I'd have done it a year ago.

1517
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,880
I'm sorry, Mrs. Graham,
but we have orders to follow.

1518
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,053
- No!
- Mrs. Graham...

1519
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,926
Get this straight,
Miss Bedpan.

1520
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,723
Nobody's gonna go
pawing over me!

1521
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:25,304
I'm through with
all that stuff.

1522
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,101
Now get outta here!
Just leave me alone!

1523
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:28,895
Here, you! Don't get fresh
with us, or we'll...

1524
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,226
You'll what?

1525
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,767
What can anyone
threaten me with now?

1526
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,770
All right to come in?

1527
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,855
- It's the warden.
- Yes, sir.

1528
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,915
Do you have a cigarette
for me, Barbara?

1529
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,166
Ooh, that's a switch.

1530
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,589
Hmm, thank you.

1531
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,550
You know, we'd like you to be
as comfortable as possible.

1532
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,506
Do you have any
special requests?

1533
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,179
I just wanna see my lawyer
the minute he gets here.

1534
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,598
That's all that
counts right now.

1535
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,470
We've already arranged for that.

1536
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,264
Thanks.

1537
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,267
You haven't heard anything?

1538
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,393
No.

1539
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,604
One more thing.

1540
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:18,316
The gas chamber...

1541
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:20,489
Now, there's no use
dwelling on that.

1542
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:21,861
Just hope for the best.

1543
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,745
It's right around here
someplace, isn't it?

1544
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,033
You can order anything
you like for dinner.

1545
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,619
I don't feel like eating.

1546
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:38,416
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll retire.

1547
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,008
Yes, of course.

1548
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,128
- Warden?
- Yes?

1549
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:46,260
Don't forget to
call me at 10:00.

1550
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,642
- Warden?
- Yes?

1551
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,314
She refuses to
let me examine her.

1552
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,641
Must I?

1553
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:58,185
All right, all right.
Forget it.

1554
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,237
Very sharp.

1555
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,824
Well, I mustn't
disappoint my public.

1556
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:10,322
I can just imagine

1557
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,282
what those papers
are gonna say...

1558
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,292
"Bloody Babs spent
her last night

1559
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,828
"decked out in
lounging pajamas

1560
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,834
"of her
favorite color,

1561
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:19,498
"flaming scarlet."

1562
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,217
That's what they
always call red

1563
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,544
when I wear it.

1564
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:25,675
Or any other
color, I'll bet.

1565
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,223
Would you like some
coffee, Mrs. Graham?

1566
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:29,390
Yeah.

1567
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,393
Barbara...

1568
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,432
My name is Barbara, too.

1569
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,745
Ah, come on, come on.

1570
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,436
They sent some dinner over
for you anyway, Mrs. Graham.

1571
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,607
Take it out of my sight.

1572
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,613
You should keep
up your strength.

1573
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,900
It doesn't come
from the belly.

1574
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,946
Ah! Ah!

1575
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,198
I thought we agreed
not to count the hours.

1576
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,453
Sorry.

1577
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:21,286
Where's that lawyer?

1578
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,544
He'll be here.

1579
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,837
He'd better.

1580
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:26,541
He's liable to lose
an important client.

1581
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,253
It's Father Devers.

1582
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,973
- Hello, Barbara.
- Hello, Father.

1583
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,808
I'm glad to see you.

1584
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,476
My, mY-

1585
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,436
I suppose those are
what is known as

1586
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,321
the Hepcat's Pajamas.

1587
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:50,823
- Yes! You dig 'em?
- The most.

1588
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,829
I don't know why I
should feel so upset.

1589
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:01,494
- I'm not afraid to die.
- Of course not.

1590
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:04,208
You know, I think
it would be rather nice

1591
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,415
to come face to face
with the one person

1592
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:08,671
in all the world who
knows I'm innocent.

1593
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,506
None of us are
wholly innocent

1594
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,090
or guilty in
the eyes of God.

1595
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,847
I meant Mrs. Monahan.

1596
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:22,059
I brought you this, Barbara.

1597
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,435
Thank you, Father.

1598
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:26,693
What a lovely
going-away present.

1599
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,479
Saint Jude.

1600
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,863
Saint of the impossible.

1601
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:41,162
I'd like to go to
confession, Father.

1602
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,368
All right, Barbara.

1603
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:08,564
Forgive me, Father,

1604
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,316
for I have sinned.

1605
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:24,000
- Gerry Mulligan.
- Could be.

1606
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,794
I know all of his
sides by heart.

1607
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:30,666
Flaming scarlet.

1608
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,839
Now they'll announce it,
and you'll see.

1609
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,844
- Want me to relieve you?
- Shh!

1610
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,597
<i>A K.L.l. G. special
news bulletin.</i>

1611
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,136
<i>Four couples have
made overtures</i>

1612
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:45,768
<i>to adopt the 3-year-old
son of Barbara Graham,</i>

1613
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:48,600
<i>who, barring an Nth-hour
reprieve from the courts...</i>

1614
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:49,767
Shut that thing off!

1615
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:51,937
<i>...will die in the gas chamber
tomorrow morning at 10:00.</i>

1616
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:53,104
Those crumbs!

1617
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,441
What right have they
got to take my boy?

1618
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,777
- I'm sure they only meant...
- I don't care what they meant!

1619
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,445
What time is it?

1620
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:02,159
Never mind. Just tell
me what day is it?

1621
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,831
Thursday or Friday?

1622
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:05,871
It's Friday.

1623
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,963
Mr. Matthews here
to see Mrs. Graham.

1624
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,965
Now, you listen to me!

1625
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,968
Nobody's gonna adopt my kid.

1626
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,469
Where did you hear that?

1627
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:21,974
On that radio!

1628
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,509
Don't pay any
attention to it.

1629
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:26,016
- That always happens.
- Not to me!

1630
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,352
It's all been arranged
as you wanted.

1631
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,775
Bobby stays on
with his grandmother.

1632
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,482
- You swear?
- I swear.

1633
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:42,654
Things look good.

1634
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,660
I filed that writ
in federal court.

1635
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,869
Got the clerk to open
the office for me.

1636
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,166
That's where I've been.

1637
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:50,120
- The judge is studying the petition now.
- And?

1638
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,504
He won't give out
with anything tonight.

1639
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:55,174
I'll argue it first thing in the morning.
That's exactly what I wanted.

1640
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,129
Keep as much pressure
on him as possible.

1641
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:01,093
Just this once, I wish
it wasn't ladies first.

1642
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,266
Montgomery's sticking
around all night

1643
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:04,968
trying to get a
statement from Perk

1644
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,761
that will clear you.

1645
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:09,810
An exclusive statement,
I presume.

1646
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,313
He's wasting his time.

1647
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:16,570
There's a good chance
of getting the order switched around.

1648
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:18,489
If Perk and Santo
have to go first,

1649
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,446
they might just break down.

1650
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,030
Wanna bet?

1651
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,913
I still have a couple of rabbits
to pull out of the hat,

1652
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,661
so keep your chin up.

1653
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,250
The Governor turned down
your plea for clemency,

1654
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,793
but if he'll see me in person,

1655
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,040
I'll charter a plane to Sacramento.

1656
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,872
- No.
- Huh?

1657
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,707
Anything in the courts, okay,

1658
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,466
but don't beg for my life.

1659
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,886
- Barbara.
- Don't beg for my life!

1660
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,230
Deliver this for me, will you?

1661
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,770
- You'll have to clear that letter.
- He knows!

1662
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,105
What are you trying to do?

1663
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,189
Teach my lawyer the law?

1664
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:06,780
Keep it there.

1665
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,792
See you around,
mouthpiece.

1666
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,612
Here, sit on this.

1667
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,443
That floor must be getting hard.

1668
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,620
- Sure you don't need it?
- Uh-uh.

1669
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,870
Thanks.

1670
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:52,955
Look, you don't have to stay up
all night yakking with me.

1671
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,211
Tell fat stuff to relieve you
if you want.

1672
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,879
No, it's all right.

1673
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:59,457
<i>Music all night continues
after the late news.</i>

1674
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,666
Off he goes.

1675
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,468
<i>The head basketball
coach of Hampton High</i>

1676
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:05,012
<i>surrendered to police today
on a morals charge.</i>

1677
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:07,724
There, leave that.

1678
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:09,892
There's lots
of long-hair music I like.

1679
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,803
Me, too.

1680
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,849
Sometimes I find
it very relaxing.

1681
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:18,730
You got any kids?

1682
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,025
Two boys, three and six.

1683
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,324
What kind of a guy
is your husband?

1684
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:27,285
Well, right now
I'm sewing him

1685
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,412
with divorce papers
for desertion.

1686
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,990
I don't believe in divorce.
I'm separated.

1687
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:35,626
Divorced or separated,

1688
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,003
the way men are
these days,

1689
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,629
that's about the only way
you can live with them.

1690
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,251
Oh, no.

1691
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,880
No, my Henry was a
wonderful husband.

1692
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,586
He brought home
flowers or candy

1693
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:45,841
almost every night,

1694
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,175
and he was always
giving me money

1695
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:48,639
to buy things with.

1696
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:50,846
And talk about
doting fathers.

1697
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,187
No sacrifice was too
great for our boy.

1698
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,440
No, I've...

1699
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,188
I've got to admit...

1700
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:02,194
I had an ideal marriage.

1701
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,693
Well, then, what happened?

1702
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,324
Sorry. I didn't mean to be nosy.

1703
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,452
That's okay.

1704
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,873
I left my husband
because I was holding him back.

1705
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,335
You see, he was up
for a vice-presidency

1706
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,961
in the bank
where he worked,

1707
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,379
and I was afraid
he wouldn't

1708
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,708
get the promotion
because of me.

1709
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:24,379
For an important
job like that,

1710
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,010
they consider the
wife as carefully

1711
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:27,761
as they do
the husband.

1712
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:29,926
Yeah, I guess they would.

1713
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,557
Don't you think
you should rest?

1714
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,567
I don't wanna rest.

1715
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,567
It was a very big bank.

1716
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,745
You'd know the name if I told you.

1717
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:38,784
Come in.

1718
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:44,877
Good morning, Mrs. Graham.

1719
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,424
Good morning.

1720
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,678
Hot fudge sundaes
for breakfast.

1721
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,422
What won't I think of next?

1722
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:54,181
They're scrumptious.

1723
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,302
Let me tell you about a,
a champagne breakfast

1724
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:59,228
we had once in Vegas. We...

1725
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,280
It was in the back
room the whole time?

1726
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,240
It never rang once.

1727
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:19,824
Maybe it will.

1728
01:41:31,877 --> 01:41:33,345
Gas chamber. Phone check.

1729
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,006
Ring back in ten seconds.

1730
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:46,309
Okay.

1731
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:48,853
Is the warden's direct line
to the Governor open?

1732
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,062
Check.

1733
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:53,366
Remind the others to stop
all outgoing calls at 9:00.

1734
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,367
I know they know,
but tell them again.

1735
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,367
Now give me
Western Union.

1736
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,034
Western Union,
this is San Quentin.

1737
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:04,543
Give me a time check, please.

1738
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:10,758
Thank you.

1739
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,388
We're three seconds slow.
Record it, huh?

1740
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:16,635
Right.

1741
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,387
I wish we could
give her the benefit.

1742
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:25,325
Oh, they're awake,
but they still won't see you.

1743
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:26,830
Well, did they say anything?

1744
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:29,128
Yeah. Santo said to tell you
he'd managed to stay alive so far

1745
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:30,750
by keeping his mouth shut.

1746
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,296
Those two are the
dirtiest, slimiest,

1747
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,301
- no-good apes I've ever had...
- Agreed.

1748
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:39,256
What was she doing shacked up
with them in the first place?

1749
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,056
Air lock test okay.

1750
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,558
What time is it?

1751
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:11,605
It's 9215.

1752
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,359
Barbara,

1753
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:06,034
you've gotten a stay
from the Governor.

1754
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:07,157
Oh.

1755
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,619
Does this mean that I...

1756
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,374
...might get to live?

1757
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:14,417
No. It's just a delay
to give your lawyer time

1758
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:15,828
to argue in court
this morning.

1759
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:19,757
- We wouldn't want you to think...
- That I'm not going to be executed.

1760
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:25,675
I like that word much better
than "gassed," don't you?

1761
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:28,177
It's all up to the courts, Barbara.

1762
01:46:32,261 --> 01:46:34,263
Why, thank you, gentlemen.

1763
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,644
The saint of
the impossible.

1764
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:17,352
Oh, he's certainly got a
pip to work on this time.

1765
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:22,524
- More coffee, anyone?
- Yeah, thanks.

1766
01:47:28,484 --> 01:47:30,862
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I understand.

1767
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:33,702
We'll make it 10:45.

1768
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:47,719
I'm sorry, Barbara.

1769
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:49,471
Your writ has been denied.

1770
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:51,298
The stay is vacated.

1771
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:56,228
Do I have time to dress?

1772
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:58,473
15 minutes.

1773
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:06,155
15 minutes.

1774
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:03,708
- Can I help?
- No. No, loan do it.

1775
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,758
- Is my seam straight?
- Yes.

1776
01:49:13,464 --> 01:49:16,343
- Do I look okay?
- Very nice.

1777
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,845
Those earrings are just the touch.

1778
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,308
A pair of fake earrings.

1779
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:26,397
That's all I wound up with.

1780
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:31,524
You've been swell, Barbara.
Here, you give this to your kids.

1781
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,655
But that belongs to your boy.

1782
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:37,155
Oh, I suppose he's forgotten
all about it by now.

1783
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:39,661
You know how kids are.

1784
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:02,975
What are you doing?

1785
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:05,436
- Floor's cold.
- What?

1786
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:07,860
You'll have to take
your shoes off, Mrs. Graham.

1787
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:10,772
That's out.
I look better with them on.

1788
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:20,330
Well, what's that thing?

1789
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:21,957
You have
to put it on, Barbara.

1790
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,330
- What's it for?
- Nothing to be afraid of.

1791
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,041
It's just part
of a stethoscope.

1792
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:27,538
You're lying.

1793
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:29,456
No stethoscope looks like that.

1794
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,041
It attaches to a tube

1795
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,337
that leads to the rest
of the stethoscope outside the chamber.

1796
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:05,417
All right, nurse.

1797
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:12,132
Do I have to go
out there like this?

1798
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,093
Do I, Father?

1799
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:50,963
It's time.

1800
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:57,135
Her shoes.

1801
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:00,798
All right, let it go.

1802
01:52:23,445 --> 01:52:25,118
Oh!

1803
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:29,580
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1804
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,503
Until further word from you.

1805
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:37,338
Oh, Father, why do they torture me?

1806
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:40,008
Why do they torture me?

1807
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,014
Gentlemen,

1808
01:52:50,055 --> 01:52:52,854
an amended writ has been filed
in the State Supreme Court.

1809
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:55,019
The witnesses and press
are to go back to the waiting room

1810
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:57,196
until you hear from me.

1811
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,865
Gentlemen, I have
told you all I know.

1812
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:03,094
Anytime.

1813
01:54:06,757 --> 01:54:08,509
We'll make it 11:30.

1814
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,945
Barbara, I'm very sorry.

1815
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:27,031
Goodbye, and God bless you.

1816
01:54:29,905 --> 01:54:31,407
I want a mask.

1817
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:34,458
A mask?

1818
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:37,246
I don't want to look at people.

1819
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:39,836
I don't wanna see
them staring at me.

1820
01:54:40,749 --> 01:54:43,548
I have one.
My sleep mask.

1821
01:56:07,544 --> 01:56:09,967
Father,
I didn't do it.

1822
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,392
Step up.

1823
01:56:57,469 --> 01:56:59,221
When you hear
the pellets drop, count ten,

1824
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,765
take a deep breath.
It's easier that way.

1825
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:03,433
How do you know?

1826
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:43,139
Okay.

1827
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,121
Ed!

1828
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,958
Ed.

1829
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:08,334
It's over.

1830
02:00:23,466 --> 02:00:25,639
<i>BARBARA".
"Dear Mr. Montgomery,</i>

1831
02:00:25,677 --> 02:00:27,679
<i>"there isn't much I
can say with words,</i>

1832
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:30,140
<i>"they always fail me
when most needed.</i>

1833
02:00:30,181 --> 02:00:32,275
<i>"But please know that
with all my heart,</i>

1834
02:00:32,308 --> 02:00:35,152
<i>"I appreciate everything
you've done for me.</i>

1835
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,901
<i>"Sincerely, Barbara."</i>
