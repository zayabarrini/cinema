00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,170
<i>Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker</i>

3
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:04,306
<i>were the most famous
televangelist couple in America,</i>

4
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,376
<i>and, by far,
the most prosperous.</i>

5
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,711
<i>Ken and Barbie
of televangelism.</i>

6
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,212
And they seemed honest.

7
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:13,216
<i>They brought encouragement
and hope to lots of people.</i>

8
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:14,350
<i>He's the president</i>

9
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,852
<i>of a multi-million dollar
religious organization</i>

10
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,687
<i>called
the Praise The Lord Club.</i>

11
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,855
<i>PTL also
operates Heritage Village</i>

12
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,590
<i>in Fort Mill, South Carolina.</i>

13
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,859
<i>...Christian Disney World</i>

14
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>where PTL members
can vacation with inspiration.</i>

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,397
They are among
the best-known figures

16
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,965
in the world
of television evangelism.

17
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:31,267
But tonight they are
out of business.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,534
...following
the scandal that led

19
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,469
to founder Jim Bakker's
resignation last week.

20
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:35,704
There's debate about how much

21
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:37,239
the Bakker scandal will hurt

22
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:38,440
all the television ministries

23
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,341
and quiet concern...

24
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,543
Modern warfare
among the TV preachers.

25
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:43,579
In this electronic age,
the stakes are high

26
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:44,980
- with millions of followers...
- ...and recriminations.

27
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:45,914
And caught up in the fighting

28
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,849
are their fellow evangelists
Jimmy Swaggart,

29
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,452
Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell.

30
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,787
Now, about what
some people around here

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,321
are calling "pearly-gate."

32
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,990
Pearly-gate is the story
of Jim and Tammy Bakker.

33
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:56,858
It's remarkably
like Watergate,

34
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,429
which tainted
the name "politician,"

35
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:05,568
and such an episode is bound
to taint the name "preacher."

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,737
<i>The Bakkers couldn't
even get out of their car.</i>

37
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,304
<i>There were so many people
waiting to see them</i>

38
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,172
<i>after three months
of seclusion.</i>

39
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,374
<i>...busloads of tourists,</i>

40
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:14,010
<i>hoping to get a glimpse
of the elusive evangelists,</i>

41
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,645
<i>but they had no better luck
than the waiting newspeople.</i>

42
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,987
Okay, I'm gonna start
by taking some of this off.

43
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,487
Okay.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,290
Gonna take
your foundation off.

45
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,457
M'kay.

46
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,293
And then
we'll start fresh.

47
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,696
Can you take
your lips off?

48
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,370
- Okay.
- Do you want a little remover?

49
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:44,974
Oh, no. That's it.

50
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,010
That'll be all.
They're permanently lined.

51
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,543
Oh.

52
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,046
And my eyes
are permanently lined

53
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,913
and my eyebrows
are permanently on,

54
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,751
so there's not a whole lot
you can do.

55
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,019
My goodness,

56
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,287
- I... I didn't know.
- Mm.

57
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,056
Have you never done pictures
without those eyelashes?

58
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,457
Nope, and I never will

59
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:02,891
because that's my trademark.

60
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:06,529
And, you know, if I take that
away, then it's not me,

61
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,498
and no one's gonna wanna look
at me without my trademark.

62
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,798
So, I hold onto that.

63
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,501
Even if we softened
'em up and kept...

64
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:14,370
No. No, you can do
anything you want,

65
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,006
but my eyelashes stay
right where they are.

66
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:18,740
That's really you.

67
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,043
Mm.

68
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,945
Oh, yeah, this is who I am.

69
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:41,831
I didn't know what the
words "glory" or "hallelujah" be

70
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,732
because the devil
is all around us!

71
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:44,867
Oh, yes, he is!

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,602
And it's up to you to resist
his temptations. Hallelujah!

73
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,473
If you're not saved by Jesus,

74
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,675
you open yourself up to demons

75
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,079
and the devil
will make a home in you!

76
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,547
Glory to God!

77
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,880
When God spoke peace
to my heart,

78
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,617
I didn't know how to say
glory or hallelujah,

79
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,418
but I got saved!

80
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,020
I leapt upon that altar.

81
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,123
Jesus told me He loved me,

82
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,825
and He will love you.

83
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,929
He speaks through her.
Say, "Hallelujah!"

84
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,731
Hallelujah!

85
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:18,668
She is with
the Holy Spirit right now!

86
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,636
Feel the spirit! Say, "Glory.

87
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,572
"Glory to God."

88
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,839
Glory to God!

89
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,642
You too, sister!
Feel the spirit.

90
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,445
Raise your hands up, folks.

91
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,014
I was here.

92
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:33,715
Here the whole time.

93
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:36,151
Little girls go to Hell
for lying.

94
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,920
Honest and true.

95
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,522
I wanna be saved.

96
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:42,425
If you let me
come in with you,

97
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:44,594
God'd love me
like He's supposed to.

98
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,529
There's reasons you can't
be seen in church, Tam.

99
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,464
Grown-up reasons.

100
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,567
Is it because everyone thinks
you're a harlot?

101
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:53,402
And I come from a time

102
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,104
before Fred made you
respectable and stuff.

103
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,940
Only reason they let me back

104
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,411
is 'cause nobody but me
can play the piano.

105
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,980
But you remind them
I was divorced.

106
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,114
They see you,

107
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:07,916
all of us is going
to be banished.

108
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:11,487
The souls of all your brothers
and sisters

109
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,923
burning in Hell
because you don't listen

110
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,924
and you can't
sit still.

111
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,166
Stop performing.

112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,473
You're going to Hell, Tammy.

113
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:33,809
You don't belong here.
You don't belong anywhere.

114
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,510
You're ugly.

115
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,514
You've got
a demon inside you.

116
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,549
But I don't wanna go to Hell.

117
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,985
If they loved you,

118
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,753
they wouldn't leave you here.

119
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,955
They love me.

120
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,159
They love you not.

121
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,498
<i>Jesus, come into my heart</i>

122
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,201
<i>and forgive me my sins.</i>

123
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,637
I don't know what this is
everybody's getting,

124
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,806
but if it's real,

125
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,474
then, please, Jesus,

126
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:06,909
give that to me.

127
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,180
Amen!

128
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:14,049
Be strong in the Lord
and His mighty power.

129
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,650
Put on the armor of God

130
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:16,818
so that you can
take your stand

131
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,721
against the devil's schemes.

132
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,690
For our struggle isn't
against flesh and blood,

133
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:24,760
but against the powers
of this dark world!

134
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,662
Casting down imaginations

135
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:30,199
on every high thing
that exalts itself.

136
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,200
- Do you feel love?
- Yes.

137
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,169
You feel it, sister!
I know you feel it!

138
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,139
You too, brother?

139
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,740
If you feel the love,

140
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,543
- say, "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

141
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,144
- Say, "Glory to God!"
- Glory to God!

142
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:44,647
Accept the blood!

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,215
Feel love forever!

144
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,550
Hallelujah!

145
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,584
Praise the Lord!

146
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,120
Are you ready
to accept the love?

147
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,921
Yes.

148
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,937
Tammy Faye!

149
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,310
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

150
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,147
No, Tammy!

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,149
Tammy, get up.

152
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,752
He is with us!

153
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,686
She's peeing herself!
Praise God!

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,656
Yes!

155
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,823
- Tammy, I said get up.
- Shush now.

156
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:31,760
This baby is a miracle.
Don't you take her from us.

157
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:38,868
Mr. Bakker?

158
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,969
Yes, sir?

159
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:43,940
Thank you.

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,850
Um, sorry.

161
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,087
I would like to start
with a verse.

162
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,726
"Beloved, I wish above all
things that thou mayest prosper

163
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,797
"and be in health,
even as thy soul prospereth."

164
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,264
That is John 3, verse 2,

165
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,134
and it's written right here
in the good book.

166
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,303
He gave me this verse
last night.

167
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:17,306
God, He came right down
and He whispered it in my ear.

168
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,108
He said, "Jim Bakker,

169
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,712
"I intend for you to thrive,

170
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,180
"to live, and to love

171
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,183
"in this life."

172
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,317
He said it to me.

173
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,786
But us Christians,

174
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,889
we've been taught
that we're supposed to

175
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,325
expect failure.

176
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,328
When Jesus calls you home,

177
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,996
you think you're going
to get a bonus

178
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,132
if you make
yourself miserable?

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,401
You think if you deny yourself
indoor plumbing,

180
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,003
or if you don't have shoes

181
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,939
on your feet...

182
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,608
I'm... I'm sorry.

183
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,613
Go ahead.

184
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,317
You know, Heaven,

185
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,385
Heaven is heaven,
that is for sure.

186
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,122
But God's hope
for us

187
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:10,092
is that we live and we thrive
and we love here

188
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,326
in the promised land.

189
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,994
Here and now.

190
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:16,965
Here and now,
and in this very, very moment.

191
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,233
Hallelujah!

192
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,969
God does not
want us to be poor!

193
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,838
Oh, no!

194
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:26,175
He will gift the faithful
with eternal life,

195
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,310
eternal love,
and eternal wealth!

196
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:33,082
Hallelujah! Praise God!
Praise Him!

197
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,353
Be right
to remember,

198
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:40,055
"Blessed be the poor,"
Mr. Bakker.

199
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,224
Doesn't sound
very blessed to me.

200
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,331
You two are here to learn the ways
of the Lord through scripture, yeah?

201
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:50,398
Yes, sir.

202
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:51,466
And to spread
the word of God.

203
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh, yeah. You know,

204
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,003
I'm gonna sing the word in every
tent, in every church.

205
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:57,906
You know, God told me that
that's what He wants for me.

206
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,678
With makeup on your face?

207
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,814
Ahem. Jezebel.

208
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,088
"I do my best
to maintain always

209
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,189
"a blameless conscience,

210
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,425
"both before God
and before men."

211
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,762
"A man who keeps company
with harlots

212
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,363
"wastes his wealth."

213
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:24,934
Proverbs 29:3.

214
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:29,171
"Your stature is like that
of a palm and your breasts

215
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,506
"like clusters of fruit.

216
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,875
"I will take hold
of the palm tree."

217
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:36,278
"And I will take hold
of the fruit."

218
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,147
That's the Song of Solomon.

219
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,216
7:7.

220
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:48,156
I'm sorry I couldn't
drive you someplace nice.

221
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,760
Oh, this is
someplace nice, Jim.

222
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,429
Tell me something.
Tell me a secret.

223
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,196
Something that no
one else knows about.

224
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:56,264
Oh, I have no secrets.

225
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,767
I'll tell you anything
you wanna know.

226
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,968
We'll start
with everything.

227
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:02,470
Okay.

228
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:03,906
I'm the oldest
of eight children

229
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,841
and I'm a very
practical person.

230
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,343
And what you see
is all there is of me.

231
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,111
You know, I don't pretend
to be something I'm not

232
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,879
because what you see
is all you get.

233
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:12,514
And I love people.

234
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,017
I have a genuine,
genuine love for people.

235
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,286
And I hurt
when people hurt,

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,522
and probably a little more dramatic
than people would like me to be.

237
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,526
But I enjoy that.
That's just who I am.

238
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,162
I've never met anyone
quite like you, Tammy Faye.

239
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:31,233
Okay.

240
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,504
So, um, do you have
any secrets, Jim?

241
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:38,206
Well, one or two.

242
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,010
Well, tell me.

243
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:45,180
Well, before God found me,
I wanted to be a radio deejay.

244
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,583
- No.
- Yes.

245
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:52,221
I used to love
to make people dance.

246
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,156
Have fun.

247
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,392
Little Richard.

248
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,060
And Buddy Holly and...

249
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,162
Oh, and Fats Domino.

250
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,166
What happened?
Why didn't you do it, Jim?

251
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,233
Ah.

252
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,870
Never mind that.

253
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:08,904
Tell me.

254
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,140
Um, I don't think...

255
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,046
Well, all right.
I'll tell you, Tammy. Um...

256
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,148
Two years ago,
I was on a date

257
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:21,517
with my girlfriend,
Sandy, and...

258
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,918
- Mm.
- Oh, no,

259
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,619
with my girlfriend
at the time.

260
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,254
- Mm.
- But, anyhoo,

261
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,623
I borrowed my daddy's car
to take her out,

262
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:31,926
and there was all this snow
on the ground

263
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,397
and Fats was singing
<i>Blueberry Hill</i>

264
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,867
so loud

265
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,270
and I...
I was having these urges

266
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,538
that only the devil
would approve of

267
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,341
and I lost control of the car.

268
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,348
And I ran over a little boy,

269
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,983
little Jimmy Summerfield.

270
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,151
I ruptured
Jimmy Summerfield's lung...

271
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:59,588
...with my daddy's tire.

272
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,090
I didn't sleep
all night.

273
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:03,892
I was just up worried sick
about that boy dying.

274
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,393
So, I...

275
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,363
I made a bargain with God.

276
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,064
I said to Him,

277
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:11,333
"I will forsake my dream
of being a deejay.

278
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:16,138
"I will stop peddling
in rock and roll

279
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:20,441
"and I'll dedicate my life
to Him and Him alone.

280
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,378
"If He sees fit
to save that boy's life,

281
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,949
"He will win two souls
right then and there."

282
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,652
And what happened
to Jimmy Summerfield?

283
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,921
He lived.

284
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,323
- Oh.
- Yes.

285
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,357
- Praise be to God.
- Yes, praise Him.

286
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,296
So...

287
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:44,199
You still like me?

288
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:47,169
Oh, sure, I do, Jim.

289
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,405
Oh, even more now that
you were honest with me.

290
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:54,076
I'll tell ya,
I do miss dancing.

Oh. Oh, we can't.

308
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:12,153
I know.

309
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,493
Yeah!

310
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,095
What'd you do?

311
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,599
Hello, Mother.
This is Jim Bakker,

312
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,401
my husband.

313
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,603
Hello, Mother.

314
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:32,174
Oh, it's such a blessing
to finally meet you.

315
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,349
No.

316
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,084
No, Mother,
we can't go back to school.

317
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,453
They have a rule against
students marrying one another.

318
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,354
Did you know they had
that rule when you did this?

319
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:49,425
If I know the two of you,
you're just gonna love Jim.

320
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,692
Oh, he's so motivated.

321
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,527
He has so many big ideas.

322
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,396
Did you know?

323
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:08,509
Well, you can educate yourself right
out of a relationship with God.

324
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,445
He has a plan for us.

325
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:13,748
- God or that Jim boy?
- God.

326
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,584
What'd He tell ya
to do this time?

327
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:19,421
Come spring, me and Jim are
going to be traveling preachers,

328
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,123
bringing God's love
to all people.

329
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:24,093
Anyone who's hurting or they
feel like they've been left out.

330
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,828
Jim will preach and I'll sing.

331
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,297
And we'll be like
Oral Roberts and his wife.

332
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,532
Oral Roberts went to college.

333
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:34,570
He has one named for him.

334
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:36,637
God said that we're supposed
to have a good life.

335
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:39,208
That way, we can help
bring his love to all people.

336
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,710
There's a limit
to God's love, Tammy Faye.

337
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,113
No.

338
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,317
No, there's no limit to God's
love, Mrs. Grover,

339
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:51,420
and there's no limit
to Tammy Faye and I either.

340
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,122
We're soldiers
in Christ.

341
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,791
We've been called to serve
in a very real way.

342
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,859
God smiles
on a husband and wife.

343
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,461
"As a young man
marries a young woman,

344
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:03,132
"so will your Builder
marry you;

345
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:06,734
"as a bridegroom
rejoices in his bride,

346
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,805
"so will your God
rejoice in you."

347
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:12,406
Isaiah 62:5.

348
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,344
It's something we do.

349
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,427
Fred said that we could stay
until the weather changes.

350
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,330
Got some bubbles
at the swap meet.

351
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,269
I'm sorry, Tam.

352
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,174
I feel like
I'm letting you down.

353
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:49,177
She doesn't like me.

354
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,680
- No, Jim.
- No, she doesn't.

355
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,183
Of course she likes you.

356
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,522
Oh.

357
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:07,662
It makes Tammy sad
to see you so sad.

358
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:10,599
How's there supposed
to be bubbles

359
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,302
if there isn't enough water
to work up the bubbles?

360
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,337
Oh, I can work up
the bubbles, Jim.

361
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:19,475
All I gotta do
is dunk my hand.

362
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,246
And I swirl...

363
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,520
And swirl.

364
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:38,794
Am I doing that all right?

365
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,661
Uh-huh.

366
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,611
Well, hello there, Tammy Faye.

367
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,947
Hello, Mommy.

368
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,949
What are you doing
with those things?

369
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,285
Well, we're gonna use these
puppets as part of our sermon

370
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,952
and show the kids
how wonderful God is.

371
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:06,688
And if we can get enough
children to come,

372
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,022
they'll bring their mothers
and their fathers.

373
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,359
And before you know it,
we'll have our own church.

374
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,833
Have you counted
your blessings today, Tammy Faye?

375
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,035
No, not yet, Susie.

376
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:23,738
Time to count your blessings,
for they are plentiful.

377
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:27,375
Okay, well,
thank you for my husband.

378
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:31,513
Oh, you're so welcome, Tammy.

379
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,651
And thank you for Mother's understanding,
even if she doesn't understand.

380
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:38,253
Oh. You're welcome.

381
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,424
<i>And thank you, God, for love.</i>

382
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:00,676
Hmm.

383
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:10,318
Jim! Whose car is this?

384
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,355
No.

385
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:16,391
Get in. Get in. Come on.

386
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,392
Okay.

387
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,429
Roll that window up.
I got the heat on.

388
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,963
This fine vehicle

389
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:25,967
with the leather interior
and the chrome on the wheels

390
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,771
is a gift from God
for us to do His work.

391
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:35,609
But how
can we afford it, Jim Bakker?

392
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,646
Who is this?

393
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,082
I'm Susie Moppet.

394
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,684
Aren't you cute?
Well, do you know about God, Susie?

395
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:44,686
Oh, I do.

396
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:48,055
Well, God has cancelled
the claim of poverty

397
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:49,924
and deprivation in our lives

398
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,794
and He has placed
all the powers of heaven

399
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,063
and the First Bank
of International Falls,

400
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,632
Minnesota,
at our disposal.

401
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:59,667
Oh.

402
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:07,042
Oh, this is the nicest car
I've ever seen, Jim.

403
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:10,077
"Everything works for good
for them that love God."

404
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:12,113
Everything.

405
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,383
But you have
to have faith in Him

406
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:18,453
and in me and in us,
'cause if you don't,

407
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,088
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

408
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,123
- Oh, I do, Jim.
- You do?

409
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,693
Does she, Susie?

410
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,563
Oh, she do, Jim!

411
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,833
She really, really do!

412
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,078
You sure...

413
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:45,814
It's all right here.
In Psalm 37:4.

414
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,982
"Take delight in the Lord

415
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,053
"and He will give you
your heart's desires."

416
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:55,790
God starts turning
those wheels in your life!

417
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:57,057
You better believe it!

418
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:59,828
- Oh, now who is this?
- Oh, I'm Susie Moppet.

419
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,563
Well, hello there,
Susie Moppet.

420
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:02,963
Hi! Nice to meet you!

421
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,768
She jumped up.

422
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:09,703
<i>♪ Yes, Jesus loves me</i>

00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:21,483
He's greater than any problem.

428
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,883
Us Christians, we're just
stuck in the mud

429
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:24,886
like that old game.
Remember that old kids' game?

430
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,088
God wants us
just to run free.

431
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,561
Well, this is a fun song,
boys and girls.

432
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,063
So, hit it, Allie.

433

437
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,110
<i>You're watching

438

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,216
<i>Season all your

441
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,816
Oh, come on!

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,119
- Okay, okay, okay.
- <i>...with salt.</i>

443
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,155
<i>Do not leave the salt

444
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:03,123
<i>out of your grain offerings.</i>

445
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:04,593

<i>to all your offerings.</i>

447
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:10,065
You know, he's not terribly
dynamic for a charismatic.

448
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,832
I know, but people
just eat him up.

449
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,502
<i>...focus on the foundation.</i>

450
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:15,937
- Tammy, did you see that?
- Hmm?

451
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:18,507
Watch close.
Every now and again,

452
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,575
he glances up at the camera.

453
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,677
<i>It is upon Him that you can
place your strong...</i>

454
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,012
- See that?
- You're right.

455
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:28,917
He's talking right to you in
the comfort of your living room.

456
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,119
Well, if I could have
watched a preacher

457
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:34,523
on TV in my own home
telling me about God,

458
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,290
that would've made
such a difference.

459
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:38,893
Mm. Amen.

460
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:43,231
Especially from someone who
preaches as good as you do, Jim.

461
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,269
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,971
<i>...blow your home over?</i>

463

You know, we could do that.

464
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:56,545
You're so much more
handsome than he is.

465

<i>Keep calling.</i>

466
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,148

Mmm. Stop it.

469
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,853
You're distracting me.

<i>and we have a variety...</i>

472
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:12,661
Well, we'll have to call
the preacher down in Raleigh

473
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,562
and let him know we got
a better gig down here.

474
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:16,297
Don't make him
cross at you, Jim.

475
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,166
We wanna have
him want us back.

476
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,801
Hold on.

477
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,169
What?

478
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:22,270
The car.

479
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:24,740
I...

480
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,176
I... I parked it here.

481
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,845
Yep, you sure did. Uh-huh.

482
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,614
Well, must've got stolen...

483
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:34,749
What?

484
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:36,919
Oh.

485
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,720
Oh, maybe it got towed.

486
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,658
No, I know
I made the payments, so...

487
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:45,726
I think
I made the payments.

488
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,694
Oh, Jim.

489
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,330
Maybe they didn't get
the payments or maybe...

490
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,597
Oh, no.

491
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:51,132
I don't think I forgot.

492
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:52,666
- I think I...
- Okay.

493
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,069
- Oh, Tammy, I don't know...
- We need to pray.

494
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:57,171
Oh, did I?
Yes, yes, yes.

495
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,640
Oh, Lord,

496
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:00,608
we are good soldiers.

497
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:02,177
- We are here for good.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Tammy.

498
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,978
- We are here for your good.
- I'm so, so, so sorry.

499
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:05,146
And we ask
that you shine your light...

500
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,881
I shouldn't have put
so much faith in that bank.

501
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:08,616
God, I'm so sorry.

502
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,851
Jesus, I'm so sorry.

503
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,353
Tammy, I'm sorry.

504
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,053
I'm sorry.

505
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:14,690
Jim.

506
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,292
Hey.

507
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:20,894
Hey, I saw you preach
last night.

508
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,965
Those puppets of yours
filled me. Deeply.

509
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,266
Oh, thank you.

510
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:26,634
Thank you.

511
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:28,402
I'm staying
in the room next door.

512
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,805
- Can I help you with that?
- No!

513
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:32,641
Well, that's
very kind of you...

514
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:36,911
...but we don't rightly know
where we're carrying it to.

515
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:38,747
I work at a local
television station

516
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,915
with a minister by the name
of Mr. Pat Robertson.

517
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:46,988
He'd get a kick outta you two.

518
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:54,996
Yes, honey,
and that's $25 a pledge.

519
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:58,365
CBN.

520
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,334
Can I take your pledge?

521
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,805
Well,
I'm trying to focus.

522
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,441
And you're just
distracting me.

523
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,911
You make me laugh.
I was happy to find...

524
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:14,882
You're so funny,
Graham.

525
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:16,316
- Jim?
- Hey, honey.

526
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,186
Hi, I got a new outfit
for the show.

527
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:20,455
Oh, yes, I love it.

528
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:22,390
- Jim.
- Yeah?

529
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:23,724
You didn't even look at me.

530
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,226
Oh.

531
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:26,894
I'm sorry, Tam.

532
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:27,996
Have I ever told you

533
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:31,900
that I am the luckiest man
on the face of this planet?

534
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:33,767
Have I ever told you that?

535
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,870
- Not today.
- Not today, no?

536
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,104
I'm going to tell you
something, too,

537
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,907
but I'm not gonna
tell you right now.

538
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,075
You're gonna have to wait.

539
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,976
- No, no, no!
- Yeah.

540
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,278
You just have to.

541
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,147
And there he is.

542
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,282
Every time I try
and talk to him,

543
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,450
he just keeps making excuses
not to see me.

544
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:53,288
Well, my surprise is gonna
make you feel so much better.

545
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,256
I'll be right back.

546
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:56,423
No, Jim,

547
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:57,926
- the show's about to start.
- Hey, Pat!

548
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,995
- Jim! Hey!
- You got a second?

549
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:03,297
Have you given more thought
to our show idea?

550
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,199
All right,
let me get you set up.

551
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,899
Don't you already
have your hands full

552
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:07,201
with those puppets?

553
00:27:07,235 --> 00:27:09,738
Biggest earner we got.
You stay focused.

554
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,904
Well, yes, of course,

555
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:13,507
but you shut down CBN
at 10 p.m.

556
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,142
Why not do
a late-night show?

557
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,045
Just kind of like Johnny
Carson for Christians?

558
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:19,279
No, Christians don't
stay up that late.

559
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:20,180
Oh, I do.

560
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:22,149
- I don't sleep at all.
- What about Tam?

561
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,118
Well, she's gonna
miss you at night.

562
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:26,187
- Tammy loves the idea.
- Tammy, we're on.

563
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:29,257
Okay, we're live
in five, four, three.

564
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:34,996
Oh, hello, everybody!

565
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,832
Hi, Tammy!

566
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,267
Well, Jim is
a little bit late today,

567
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:43,138
so, um, the theme
of today's show,

568
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:44,972
how about we make it
all about the importance

569
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,275
of being places on time, hmm?

570
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,344
Oh, no! Oh, no!

571
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,311
- I'm sorry, kids!
- There he is.

572
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:54,815
I'm sorry, Tammy!
I'm sorry, everybody.

573
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:57,184
I was just having a
little, fun little chat

574
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,988
with Uncle Pat
just behind the barn.

575
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,156
Oh, yeah, and what'd you two
fellas get up to without me?

576
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,160
Oh, well, it's actually
something all you kids...

577
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:06,227
- Mm-hmm.
- ...are gonna wanna

578
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,895
tell your parents about.

579
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:12,300
It's a brand-new show
just for them

580
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,937
right here on CBN!

581
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,372
Well, amen!

582
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,474
And it's gonna be
called <i>The 700 Club.</i>

583
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:22,276
Now,
isn't that happy news?

584
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,245
Hallelujah! Yes! Yes!

585
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:26,580
- Hi, kids.
- Oh.

586
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:30,084
Hi, Susie Moppet.

587
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:32,921
Hi, Jim.
Today's a happy day.

588
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:34,488
Isn't it, kids?
And you know why, Jim?

589
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:36,290
Why, Susie?

590
00:28:36,324 --> 00:28:39,360
Well, you're gonna have
a new show, kids.

591
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:41,196
Yes.

592
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:44,899
And Jim is gonna have

593
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,401
a baby.

594
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:49,603
Look at Tammy,
she's right behind you.

595
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,576
We're gonna have a baby?

596
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,246
Isn't the world just
full of blessings, Jim?

597
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,280
Huh?

598
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,182
That's right, folks!

599
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,354
We're gonna
have a baby!

600
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:08,923
Oh-ho-ho!

601
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,026
<i>It's not a drag
to be saved.</i>

602
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,961
<i>It's not a boring thing.</i>

603
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:16,898
<i>That's religion.
See, you got 'em mixed up.</i>

604
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,299
<i>Religion is boring and dull,</i>

605
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,570
<i>but Jesus is life.</i>

606
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:25,340
<i>Now, my next guest is
a new friend to</i> The 700 Club,

607
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:29,477
<i>and I can smell
his chicken, yes.</i>

608
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:34,147
<i>The Colonel, Colonel Sanders
in</i> The 700 Club!

609
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:45,492
<i>Oh, the crowd appreciates you.
I think they like you.</i>

610
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:47,394
<i>I think they're wanting
some of that chicken.</i>

611
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,897
<i>I guess
the housewives of America</i>

612
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,198
<i>are thanking you
for fixing dinner...</i>

613
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,502
Hello.

614
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:56,170
<i>Oh, hi, Mom.</i>

615
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:59,473
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you calling so late?

616
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,376
Well, Jim says that I need
to rest for my pregnancy,

617
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,014
but, oh, you know me.
I can't rest,

618
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,216
<i>so thought I'd call my mother
to keep me company.</i>

619
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,183
I never got a rest.

620
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:12,387
Oh, I miss working, though.
You know?

621
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,323
It's so lonesome at home
all by myself.

622
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,991
<i>Wow! Oh, wow!</i>

623
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,326
And he barely
touches me anymore.

624
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,231
And when he does,
it's not enthusiastic.

625
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:26,935
Well, it's up to the wife to make
herself desirable for her husband.

626
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:29,704
I do that. Oh, I do.

627
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:32,073
<i>He's just really busy.</i>

628
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,641
<i>Really?</i>

629
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:36,043
So, are you watching
Jim's show?

630
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:38,246
<i>That new talk show
of his is on.</i>

631
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:39,613
Serving God don't feel like

632
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:41,615
it should be
a money-making opportunity.

633
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,450
<i>Yeah.</i>

634
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:46,054
You know,
I wanna do what he's doing.

635
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:48,655
And I wanna sing
and not in a puppet voice.

636
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:51,426
And I wanna talk about issues
that affect people's daily lives.

637
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,161
And there's so much
that we don't talk about.

638
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:54,261
There's so many secrets,

639
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:58,166
<i>and, you know, everyone says
I'm supposed to be tired,</i>

640
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:00,267
but I just wanna love people.

641
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:01,669
You got me out of bed

642
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:03,503
to talk to me about
how you're not tired.

643
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,406
Does that make sense to you?

644
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,477
No.

645
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,747
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Night night, Tam. Take care.

646
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,016
<i>Good night, Mom.
I love you.</i>

647
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:16,150
Bye.

648
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,451
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

649
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,588
Who was it?

650
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:25,626
That was Tam.

651
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:26,794
How is she?

652
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:28,695
Well, it seems like
she's having some trouble

653
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:30,364
with the pregnancy.
What'd I miss?

654
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:31,499
<i>...a second childhood.</i>

655
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,034
I don't know.
The sound was off.

656
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,434
<i>You love kids, don't you?</i>

657
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:36,204
- <i>You love children.</i>
<i>- I do.</i>

658
00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:39,673
<i>I have five grandchildren
and 14 great-grandchildren.</i>

659
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:42,677
<i>Wow!</i>

660
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,645
<i>I bet they're spoiled.
Do you spoil them?</i>

661
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:55,055
Oh, dear Lord God.

662
00:31:57,557 --> 00:32:01,228
What doors are you gonna open
up for me to walk through?

663
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:06,566
What can I do for happiness?

664
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:11,706
<i>Oh, I wanna get back on TV.</i>

665
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:16,478
<i>I'm going back
to work for you.</i>

666
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,098
Well...

667
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,235
What do you think
he pays himself?

668
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,269
Oh.

669
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,273
I should have worn
the other dress.

670
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,776
You look fine,
honey.

671
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:50,445
Oh.

672
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,546
There he is.

673
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,847
Dede's wearing a mink.
That's a real mink!

674
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:55,283
And it's warm outside.

675
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:57,718
You know, we...
we paid for all this, Tammy.

676
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,622
You and me, from the swimming
pool to the hot tub,

677
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:03,825
and Dede's dead animal.
We paid for it.

678
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,793
Well, the fruit isn't dropping our
way, that's for sure.

679
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:09,631
My little stars!

680
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:11,699
Hello. Hey, Pat!

681
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,100
- What a beautiful place!
- How are you?

682
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,202
- Oh, thank you, thank you!
- Paradise!

683
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:18,305
Look at that little baby, too.
Positively a chipmunk.

684
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:19,539
Thanks.

685
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,740
Hey, that's a nice coat.

686
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:21,843
Oh, thank you, dear.

687
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,243
Must be hot though.

688
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:24,578
No, not in the least.

689
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:26,247
Oh.

690
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,614
Hey, Jim,
I've been thinking.

691
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:29,617
Mm-hmm?
- Have you given any thought

692
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,286
to taking some time off
to be with your family?

693
00:33:32,953 --> 00:33:34,688
These times
do not come back.

694
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,756
- No.
- Trust me,

695
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:37,290
they are precious,
precious times.

696
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:38,625
- No, sir.
- Mm.

697
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,497
I can do <i>The 700 Club</i>
for a time.

698
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:46,399
We can air reruns of
<i>Jim and Tammy</i> for a few weeks.

699
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:48,635
- Hmm.
- A couple of months even.

700
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:50,371
What do you think?

701
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,542
It's very...
It's very kind of you, Uncle Pat.

702
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,942
Thank you.

703
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:59,714
But, you know, I got that bond
going with my audience, you know?

704
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:00,681
We're on the up-and-up.

705
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:03,184
I couldn't think of
abandoning them right now.

706
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,319
- Well, we'll think about it.
- Oh, Pat, Pat, Pat!

707
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,687
- Oh.
- He came.

708
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,890
Oh, my goodness!

709
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,429
- Hello! Hello!
- Honey.

710
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,597
- I see, I see him.
- Go say hi!

711
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:18,265
I know, I see him.
We'll sit down, we'll sit down.

712
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,167
Was your drive in okay?

713
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,768
- Jim, go say hi!
- I don't wanna say hi.

714
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:22,203
I'm fine.
We'll say hi later.

715
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,238
You remember
Jim and Tammy Faye?

716
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,439
Hey, now, the puppet people!

717
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:28,676
Oh, my goodness, just...

718
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,511
What a pleasure,
Mr. Falwell.

719
00:34:30,544 --> 00:34:32,312
A pleasure
and a blessing.

720
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:35,683
You are truly an inspiration to me.
It's an honor.

721
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:37,384
Nice to meet you, Jerry.
I'm Tammy.

722
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,219
Tammy Faye
and this is Sissy.

723
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:40,520
Aren't the three of you

724
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:41,588
as cute
as a button?

725
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,690
- Aw!
- Yes, sir!

726
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,192
It's a moral issue...

727
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:49,663
...feminist revolution.

728
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:56,636
You know it was fate.

729
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:57,704
It was when my youngest

730
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,373
was being baptized,

731
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,241
she was such
a little-bitty thing

732
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,843
that we had to put
a little milk crate

733
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,379
in the baptismal
for her to stand on.

734
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:08,850
Come on, let's go see Daddy.

735
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,855
Hi!

736
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:16,658
Could I sit down?

737
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,426
I have the baby,
you know.

738
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,295
It's kinda hard to eat
and, you know...

739
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,830
Sure. Um, yeah.

740
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:25,732
Using the fork and the knife
at the same time

741
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,267
and, you know,
get the food to my mouth.

742
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:28,436
Well, why don't...

743
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:29,569
- I think...
- And I wanna hear

744
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:30,937
all this interesting stuff.

745
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:32,239
- Yeah, but...
- Honey...

746
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,373
Well,
I'll be right back.

747
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:34,808
- Tam.
- Oh.

748
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:37,812
She's a firecracker, Jim.

749
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,718
- Jim.
- Yes.

750
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:45,820
Come on.

751
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,521
Okay.

752
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,725
Okay.

753
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:52,892
Well, very nice.

754
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,529
As you were
saying, Jerry?

755
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:58,765
Let's call me
Reverend Falwell.

756
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:00,668
Of course.

757
00:36:02,402 --> 00:36:04,638
Young people today
are raised on television.

758
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:06,707
It's taught them
an immorality.

759
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:11,745
But now, we are on television.

760
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:15,016
When I created <i>The 700 Club,</i>

761
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,052
all I needed was 700 people
to keep us going.

762
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:21,956
A year later, we're in
six markets and growin'.

763
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:26,594
Hundreds of thousands of folks
are hearin' the word.

764
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:28,728
Now, God has a voice
in this fight.

765
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:29,930
- Amen.
- Mm-hmm.

766
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:31,932
Mm. Who's He fighting?

767
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,435
The liberal agenda.

768
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:36,770
The feminist agenda.

769
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:38,506
Homosexual agenda.

770
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:41,508
It's time for a reversal
of these trends.

771
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:44,545
The only hope's
in saving America.

772
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,713
Get back
to the good old days.

773
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,948
Mm. Mm.

774
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:50,785
Well, I love our country,

775
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,020
but America is for them, too.

776
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:55,355
Uh... Well...

777
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:56,423
- Oh, Tam?
- Mm?

778
00:36:56,457 --> 00:36:57,757
Will you mind
getting me another Coke?

779
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,959
Jim, let your wife speak.

780
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:03,430
Debate. I think it gets us
all back to unity.

781
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:06,366
Oh, I don't want to debate you, Jerry.
I love you.

782
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,435
- I love all of you guys.
- Reverend Falwell.

783
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:10,437
Um...

784
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:12,406
We love you, too,
Tammy Faye.

785
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,774
Yes, we do.

786
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,410
God as my witness,

787
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:21,114
I made a pledge to continue to
expose the sins in this country.

788
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:25,018
The Bible explicitly
forbids homosexuality.

789
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,820
There's no gray area.

790
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,654
Mm.

791
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:32,058
Well, you know,
I don't think of them as homosexuals.

792
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,961
I just think of them as other
human beings that I love.

793
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:38,933
You know, we're all just people
made out of the same old dirt.

794
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,968
And God didn't
make any junk.

795
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,371
Right, honey?

796
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,007
- Tammy?
- Hmm?

797
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:50,777
- Tam.
- Hmm?

798
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,879
You can't...
What are you doing?

799
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,382
I'm changing
the baby, honey.

800
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:57,618
You can't talk
to him like that.

801
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,888
That's the big boss man.
We need him to like us.

802
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:02,756
- Jim.
- No, Tammy.

803
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,026
Look, listen to me.
I'm trying to build something here.

804
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm not messing around.

805
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:10,764
God told me He wants me
to have what Pat has.

806
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:14,000
But if you keep acting like that,
if you keep talking to Falwell that way,

807
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,502
I'm not gonna
ever get there.

808
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,871
Well, God's been talking
to me, too, you know, Jim?

809
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,573
And He said
that I gotta speak up.

810
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:22,476
So, here goes.

811
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,045
You can't leave me
at home all alone,

812
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:29,083
feeling unloved, and useless.

813
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:32,887
And He said that I belong on
TV just as much as you do.

814
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,655
And that I should sing
and I should be funny.

815
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,591
And I should talk about
real things for grown-ups.

816
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,828
Just, you know,
just the way you do.

817
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,864
And...

818
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:48,769
He says I'm not gonna tell
people who's going to Hell, Jim.

819
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:52,439
We're in the business
of healing people.

820
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,477
Yes.

821
00:38:58,011 --> 00:39:00,848
Jerry Falwell's
a powerful man, Tammy Faye.

822
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,018
Jim Bakker

823
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:09,556
is a powerful man.

824
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,725
Jim Bakker.

825
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,933
Yes, he is,
Tammy Faye Bakker.

826
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,505
I'm so, so sorry.
I forgot my own strength...

827
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:28,007
and my manly duties.

828
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,876
It's okay.

829
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,013
You know,
we built CBN in four years

830
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:35,515
and we could build
our own in half that.

831
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:38,018
Yes, I think we can.

832
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:41,622
Oh, yeah, we can.

833
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:45,926
Yes.

834
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:49,763
Jim Bakker is gonna
be a builder for Christ.

835
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:52,533
Oh, yes, he will.

836
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:55,669
And Tammy Faye Bakker

837
00:39:55,701 --> 00:40:00,507
is gonna sing her gospel
all around the world.

838
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,576
We are gonna spread His word.

839
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,044

never forget it.

Jim and Tammy are gonna be
so happy to see you.

899
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:58,451
I can't believe you've never made
it down to the studios before.

900
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:01,387
Well, the Carolinas are a long
way from International Falls.

901
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:03,890
Have you always been involved
with the church, Mr. Fletcher?

902
00:43:03,924 --> 00:43:05,459
I've done
all sorts of things.

903
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:07,928
Once, I was
even a party clown.

904
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,296
You don't believe me,
but it's true.

905
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:10,997
Come, this way.
Show's about to start.

906
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:12,065
Party clown?

907
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:13,167
We'll get you set up.

908
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,868
But the penile implant
of the inflatable type

909
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:17,471
is the one that we see here.

910
00:43:17,504 --> 00:43:19,139
Mm-hmm. And this is
the newest one?

911
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:22,209
Well, it is. And when the man
wants to become erect,

912
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:24,477
he simply
reaches down

913
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:28,082
and he squeezes
that several times

914
00:43:28,114 --> 00:43:29,415
and the man becomes firm.

915
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:31,818
I think
that's fantastic.

916
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:35,189
Go ahead, audience, go ahead.

917
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:39,326
Well, you know something else
that's fantastic?

918
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,361
I'm so excited
I'm just beside myself.

919
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:43,863
<i>I would like to introduce you</i>

00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:05,953
Thank you.

927
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:07,821
So, here's the house.

928
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,790
Isn't it beautiful?
I just think it's so neat.

929
00:44:10,823 --> 00:44:13,993
Our ministry's building lots
of houses on the PTL property.

930
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,764
There's one with pregnant teens
and one for kids with needs.

931
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:18,332
It's all part of our mission
to help people.

932
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,299
This is
just wonderful, honey.

933
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:21,868
Yeah, I'm so glad
you guys are here.

934
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:23,403
I got you set up
in the guest room

935
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:26,506
and you can stay there until
your new house is ready.

936
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,143
Come on.
Let me give you a tour.

937
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:33,881
This is the relaxation room.

938
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:36,950
Oh, now that you're here,
I'm just gonna bug you any time I want to.

939
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,786
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna wake you
up any hour of the night.

940
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:42,256
I'm just so glad to have you here
in the PTL property with me, Mom.

941
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:46,893
All those people
looking at me and clapping.

942
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:48,062
Oh, no.

943
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:50,397
I don't appreciate
being bamboozled like that.

944
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,299
It's love, Mom.

945
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:54,034
Oh, yeah,
that's God's love.

946
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,904
Every day, I have rapture.

947
00:44:56,937 --> 00:44:58,105
Rapture?

948
00:44:58,138 --> 00:45:01,808
You just spent an hour
talking about pumping penises.

949
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:05,445
Well, these things
happen to people

950
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:08,481
and I'm just being honest
about the way that life is.

951
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:11,484
And I'm providing solutions

952
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:13,353
to make marriages better.

953
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:15,221
- Tam, where's the privy?
- On the left.

954
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,390
Okay.

955
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,325
Sit down, Mom.

956
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:20,426
Who paid for
this house, Tammy?

957
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,095
Well, the ministry
makes lots of houses.

958
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:23,963
We've got one
for unwed mothers.

959
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:25,364
Wait till
you see Kevin's House.

960
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,035
Oh, yeah, that one's
for kids with special needs.

961
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:30,937
And it's named after a sweet
little boy named Kevin.

962
00:45:30,971 --> 00:45:32,139
Oh, he's 13 years old

963
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:35,409
and he is the sweetest,
tiniest little thing you ever saw.

964
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,911
His hands are attached
to his shoulders

965
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,613
and he has no arms at all.

966
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:41,015
Bless his little heart.

967
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:43,417
Let me show you to your room.

968
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:48,321
Okay, everyone,
let's see if I can do this.

969
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:51,024
So, now, you're gonna
go in a circle.

970
00:45:51,056 --> 00:45:54,160
Oh, mine looks a little bit
like it had an explosion.

971
00:45:54,194 --> 00:45:55,329
You know what I'm gonna do?

972
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:58,297
'Cause normally when I use
frosting, it's not this thick.

973
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,431
I'm just gonna do that.

974
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,533
I think it's gonna be pretty.

975
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,469
You know, next time,
I'm gonna make you guys my fudge.

976
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:04,538
That's the best.
I think I've only made that,

977
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:07,306
you know, on the show,
like, a couple times. Mmm.

978
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,209
I know! I wish
we had smell-o-vision,

979
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,276
so you could smell this.

980
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,012
This is really nice.

981
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,419
Oh!

982
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:21,187
That one.
How much time do we have?

983
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,322
10 minutes, Tammy.

984
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,958
Oh, goodness!

985
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:27,560
Hey, Mom. Did you see the show?

986
00:46:27,593 --> 00:46:29,328
Wasn't that fun?

987
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:32,331
I'm not sure what's so Christian
about decorating a cupcake.

988
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:34,901
Oh, Mom,
you're so funny.

989
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:36,536
- Have you seen this?
- Hmm?

990
00:46:36,569 --> 00:46:37,971
From <i>The Observer.</i>

991
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,007
Picture of you and Jim
on the front.

992
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,873
Ah.

993
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:43,576
"PTL's Bakker
diverts ministry funds

994
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:46,479
"for new building project."

995
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,915
What's that about?

996
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:50,651
Well, you can't
believe everything

997
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,585
that you read
in the newspapers, Mom.

998
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:54,353
How's Fred doing?
Is he settling in okay?

999
00:46:54,386 --> 00:46:57,924
Smoke and fire idn't just
the providence of Hell, girl.

1000
00:46:57,957 --> 00:46:59,926
You know when I saw that
clipping with my face on it,

1001
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,696
I thought for a second
that you were proud of me.

1002
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:07,100
I'm hearing there are articles
like this in the paper every day.

1003
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:08,634
The secular press hates us

1004
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:11,604
because we're winning
millions of souls for Jesus.

1005
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,240
Oh, Tammy Faye.

1006
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:16,042
You follow blindly.

1007
00:47:16,076 --> 00:47:18,612
In the end,
all you are is blind.

1008
00:47:21,348 --> 00:47:22,983
I don't know
how to do it.

1009
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:25,284
I just need it done.
That is your job.

1010
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:26,319
Yes.

1011
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,521
Yes.

1012
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:29,556
God bless you.

1013
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,270
You wonder why
I don't snuggle you.

1014
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:50,043
Maybe it's all
that goopy stuff on you.

1015
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:54,348
Well, it's better than
spending the night with an alligator.

1016
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:57,116
Oh.

1017
00:47:57,149 --> 00:47:59,518
That newspaper.

1018
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:02,288
She saved it like
it was a little treasure.

1019
00:48:03,288 --> 00:48:06,625
It made me feel so rotten.

1020
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:09,430
Well, your mother's never
been all that nice to you.

1021
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:11,765
Yeah.

1022
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:13,600
Some people
just don't change.

1023
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,371
We're not doing
anything wrong, though.

1024
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:27,448
Is that a question?

1025
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:29,649
No.

1026
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:48,401
Tammy, sometimes, I fear

1027
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:51,572
that what God wants of me
is beyond my abilities.

1028
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:54,273
I'm building
so much for Him

1029
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,243
in His name
and for His people.

1030
00:48:57,843 --> 00:49:00,112
- Yeah.
- And...

1031
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,149
And He's giving me
more visions every day.

1032
00:49:02,181 --> 00:49:04,384
Giving me more orders
all the time.

1033
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:07,219
And then, every day,
these creditors...

1034
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,358
...and the people who are
asking me to save them.

1035
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:16,395
I'm only one man.

1036
00:49:16,428 --> 00:49:17,663
I'm only one man, Tammy.

1037
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:19,132
Oh, Jim.

1038
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:23,203
Well, I only need one man.

1039
00:49:23,236 --> 00:49:24,638
You're enough, honey.

1040
00:49:26,538 --> 00:49:28,241
Okay, come on.
Come to bed.

1041
00:49:29,442 --> 00:49:31,578
Honey, it's been two months,

1042
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:34,580
and we said we were gonna
try to have another baby.

1043
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:36,716
Tammy,
I need your help.

1044
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,386
I need you not
to get in my way.

1045
00:49:39,419 --> 00:49:42,388
And I need you to not ask
more of me than I can give.

1046
00:49:42,422 --> 00:49:43,424
Okay.

1047
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:47,126
Do you wanna talk some more?

1048
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:54,835
Can you...

1049
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,402
Can you talk to God?

1050
00:49:58,138 --> 00:50:00,174
I'm so tired and...

1051
00:50:02,674 --> 00:50:03,676
Yes?

1052
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,345
I'll call you right back.

1053
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,748
I'll take it downstairs.

This is sublime.
This is top drawer.

1070
00:51:12,312 --> 00:51:13,714
You really think so,
Gary?

1071
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:15,582
I know so.

1072
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,484
Your opinion means
so much to me.

1073

I haven't been this excited
about working with an artist

1074
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:20,921
since I produced <i>Monster Mash.</i>

1075
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:24,857
That's really sweet.

1076
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,892
We could get a Grammy.

1077
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:28,895
- Really?
- Really.

1078
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,236
Tammy, it's time to go.
Time for the shoot.

1079
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,406

Hey, hey, Jim,
how are ya?

1084
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:48,448
<i>Blessed, Gary, blessed.</i>

1085
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,850
I'm sorry, Jim. You know,
I got lost in the music.

1086
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:53,953
Gary here, he just
makes it all so awesome.

1087
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,421
Wait till you hear it.

1088
00:51:55,455 --> 00:51:56,489
You're going to love it.

1089
00:51:56,522 --> 00:51:57,991
No, it's her voice, Jim.

1090
00:51:58,024 --> 00:52:01,460
I just turn the knobs here.
She sings like an angel.

1091
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:06,333
Well, I'm never giving you
back to Nashville, oh, no!

1092
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:08,435
It's such a beautiful way
to connect, Jim.

1093
00:52:08,468 --> 00:52:10,402
It's God's voice
through my voice.

1094
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,404
To the world's ears.

1095
00:52:12,437 --> 00:52:13,673
The things you say, Gary.

1096
00:52:14,774 --> 00:52:16,776
<i>Tammy!
You're not camera ready.</i>

1097
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:18,777
<i>You know everybody's waiting
for you and it's a big day.</i>

1098
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,513
<i>We gotta do 400 K today.
Can we shake a leg, please?</i>

1099
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:23,583
<i>Thank you. I'm sorry
to drag her away, Gary.</i>

1100
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:25,919
Okay!

1101
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,319
<i>Shake a leg, please.</i>

1102
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,488
Sure thing, Mister.

1103
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,788
<i>Thank you.</i>

1104
00:52:29,821 --> 00:52:31,390
- Jim.
<i>- Thank you, Gary.</i>

1105
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:33,393
- Tam?
- Mm?

1106
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:40,866
Ta-da! I made it!

1107
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,402
30 seconds, everyone!

1108
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:45,738
Light on one, please!

1109
00:52:49,408 --> 00:52:51,644
Hmm. How's that?

1110
00:52:51,678 --> 00:52:52,712
Yeah.

1111
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:59,618
And we're live
in five, four,

1112
00:52:59,652 --> 00:53:02,489
three, two...

1113
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:10,896
<i>Tammy and I are undergoing
the most vicious attacks</i>

1114
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,567
<i>in the history
of this ministry.</i>

1115
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:19,605
<i>By now, perhaps you think that we
should be used to these attacks.</i>

1116
00:53:19,638 --> 00:53:21,974
<i>But it's been going on
for a long time, Tammy.</i>

1117
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:23,442
<i>Oh, yeah,
that's right, Jim.</i>

1118
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:26,345
<i>It's been going on
a long time.</i>

1119
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:29,382
<i>We are being persecuted
by the secular press</i>

1120
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:33,786
<i>who simply do not want you
to receive the word of God.</i>

1121
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,388
<i>It is a witch hunt.</i>

1122
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,959
<i>And on top of this, we have
numerous past due bills...</i>

1123
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:41,493
<i>that must be paid</i>

1124
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:43,930
<i>if we want to save
the entire network</i>

1125
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:46,966
<i>and stay on the air delivering
the word of God every day.</i>

1126
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:50,337
<i>So, now is the time
for our prayer warriors</i>

1127
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,873
<i>to rise up because
we are in a war.</i>

1128
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:58,344
<i>You know, Tammy and I,
we just hate to do this,</i>

1129
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:02,348
<i>but if every person watching</i>

1130
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:06,518
<i>could double their pledge
right now,</i>

1131
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,922
<i>that way, we can save
the word of God.</i>

1132
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,957
I'm talking about salvation.

1133
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:16,930
Yours, mine, PTL's,
the entire world's.

1134
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,466
So, together,
if we agree together,

1135
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,370
let's give the devil
a black eye.

1136
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,073
Oh, the phones
are ringing. Oh.

1137
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:30,609
Praise Jesus and praise you!

1138
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,113
And God bless you!
God bless you!

1139
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,714
Hallelujah!

1140
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:38,618
<i>And don't forget,
remember, God loves you.</i>

1141
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,922
- <i>He really, really does.</i>
<i>- He really does.</i>

1142
00:54:45,558 --> 00:54:46,693
Cut! Very good, everyone.

1143
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,428
That was not bad.
How was that?

1144
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,997
- How was it?
- Uh, that was good, Jim.

1145
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:53,399
- We need to talk. Now.
- Jim, it was great.

1146
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:55,835
We're still gonna
be over budget on that...

1147
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,107
I just want the sleeves
a little shorter.

1148
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,042
Everything's about proportion.

1149
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:08,448
Okay, you ready to see?
Close your eyes.

1150
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:13,419
I love it, Mother.

1151
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,088
Oh, Sissy, you look
so beautiful, baby.

1152
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,655
Thank you.

1153
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:18,825
Golly Moses,
this thing weighs a ton.

1154
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,692
Oh, goodness.

1155
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,629
Why do you have to do
so much shopping, Tam?

1156
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:25,031
Well, I have to get
my exercise somehow.

1157
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:28,535
And, plus, I don't wanna balloon
up with the new baby coming.

1158
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:30,669
Hey, everyone,
come here, come here.

1159
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:32,337
Now, when she comes out,

1160
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,474
make sure you all tell her
how great she looks, okay?

1161
00:55:35,507 --> 00:55:36,942
You know, she hasn't had
enough love in her life,

1162
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:40,113
and it's time
that we all change that.

1163
00:55:41,513 --> 00:55:42,515
Go on.

1164
00:55:47,786 --> 00:55:49,656
Good grief.

1165
00:55:49,689 --> 00:55:54,093
You look so good! Come here.
You do.

1166
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,562
Right?

1167
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:56,763
Okay, get up
on the pedestal.

1168
00:55:56,796 --> 00:55:57,964
I am not getting up
on the pedestal.

1169
00:55:57,997 --> 00:55:59,165
- Come on, Grandma.
- Come on.

1170
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:00,799
- Come on.
- Don't push me.

1171
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:02,067
Oh!

1172
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,536
Isn't it fun?
We look like triplets.

1173
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,672
I look like a bear.

1174
00:56:06,705 --> 00:56:08,707
You look like
a beautiful bear.

1175
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,944
- Oh. It's too much.
- No.

1176
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:12,978
I already
have a coat.

1177
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:15,781
I don't need it.

1178
00:56:15,814 --> 00:56:18,884
Why are you so unwilling to accept
the love that God has for you?

1179
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,654
Can you pay for this?

1180
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,823
The pledges
are rolling in, Mom.

1181
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:26,024
People really like the show

1182
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:29,930
and they're very happy
to accept the love.

1183
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,700
Take the coat, Mom.

1184
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:35,968
Just take the coat.

1185
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:37,070
Well...

1186
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,938
Please, for me.

1187
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,878
Well, it is attractive,
and it's very, very warm.

1188
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:47,046
I just feel
like a million dollars.

1189
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:49,114
- It looks great, Jim.
- You think?

1190
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:50,582
Yeah, very subtle.

1191
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,585
I didn't feel a thing.
Not a thing.

1192
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,286
And I played golf
the next day.

1193
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,555
So, we'll have
a girl's night.

1194
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:56,656
We'll go to Maciano's,
get some pasta.

1195
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:57,723
Yes, yes.

1196
00:56:57,756 --> 00:56:59,525
- I love that place.
- Yeah? Oh, wait.

1197
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:01,995
You know, why don't you go
ahead, I'm gonna catch up.

1198
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:04,196
- I'm gonna go give Jim a kiss.
- Okay.

1199
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,232
See ya.

1200
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:08,667
And that reporter from
<i>The Charlotte Observer</i>

1201
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,203
been poking around.

1202
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:13,038
Calling some of our secretaries,
asking for comments.

1203
00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:14,907
I'm gonna put a picture
of that guy's butt...

1204
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,944
...on a punching bag

1205
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:20,145
and I'm gonna
use it for practice.

1206
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,915
We need
to talk about the deficit

1207
00:57:22,948 --> 00:57:24,850
we are running
on the expansion to studio...

1208
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:27,887
Phooey! Fletcher, no,
you're such a worrywart.

1209
00:57:27,919 --> 00:57:29,988
We're gonna do
a telethon next week.

1210
00:57:30,022 --> 00:57:32,025
The partners
will not let us down.

1211
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,693
Wanda, my nose is shiny.

1212
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:34,893
- Mm-mm.
- Yes, it is.

1213
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:36,194
- No.
- I'm telling you, Wanda.

1214
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:38,096
- It's fine.
- A little more powder, please.

1215
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:39,598
Your nose
isn't shiny, Jim.

1216
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:40,700
You're just being fussy.

1217
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,334
- Oh.
- Wanda, tell him he's fussy.

1218
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:43,937
You're fussy,
Pastor Jim.

1219
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:44,837
Oh, how dare you.

1220
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,939
You're wearing as much
as Tammy these days.

1221
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:50,343
Careful, you'll end up
looking like a clown.

1222
00:57:52,044 --> 00:57:54,346
- Stop it! You can't talk...
- But you know it's true.

1223
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,781
- You know it's true.
- Fletcher.

1224
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:57,616
You got Wanda laughing.

1225
00:57:57,649 --> 00:57:59,184
She's not laughing.
What are you laughing at?

1226
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:00,587
It's not funny.

1227
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,288
It's not funny.

1228
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,957
You guys!

1229
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:06,125
Oh, I got a new one.

1230
00:58:06,158 --> 00:58:08,294
Penny, cover your ears.

1231
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:10,095
What did the leper say
to the prostitute?

1232
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:11,764
- Oh, boy.
- What?

1233
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:13,333
"You can keep the tip."

1234
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:14,734
Oh, shit.

1235
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,736
Jim, you mean jerk!

1236
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,138
You're gonna
pay for that.

1237
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:21,174
I went too far.
I went too far. I'm sorry.

1238
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,776
- I got you now. I got you now.
- Wanda! Wanda!

1239
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,878
Wanda, come here.

1240
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,145
Come here and powder his nose.

1241
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:28,381
- No! No!
- "Wanda, help.

1242
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:30,216
"Wanda. Wanda.

1243
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:32,953
"My nose is shiny."

1244
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:37,322
Let me powder your nose.
Let me powder your nose.

1245
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:56,242

Gary.

1257

Aren't you glad
He touched you?

Truly. Yeah.

Hmm.

1260
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,093
Well, this is perfect.
I love this.

you, Tam, it's all you.

Oh, no. No, no.
You know I couldn't do this without you.

1263
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:58,171
You know, your voice
makes me feel closer to Him.

1264
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,974
Like He's right here.

1265
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,943
He is.

1266
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:07,212
Tam...

1267
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,252
when was the last time
that you were touched

1268
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,457
in the way that a woman
like you should be touched?

1269
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:21,194
Oh, well...

1270
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:23,895
I'm eight months
pregnant, Gary,

1271
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:25,364
so back it up from there.

1272
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:30,370
Does his touch tell you
how talented you are?

1273
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:34,841
Gary.

1274
01:00:34,873 --> 01:00:37,710
Do his eyes tell you
how beautiful you are?

1275
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,416
Does he listen to you?

1276
01:00:43,448 --> 01:00:45,451
Does he hear
how amazing you are?

1277
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:47,953
Tammy.

1278
01:00:47,986 --> 01:00:49,855
Yes.

1279
01:00:49,888 --> 01:00:52,791
Can I touch you
like that?

1280
01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:57,062
In that way that
you should be touched.

1281
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:02,468
You can kiss me

1282
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,803
- on my neck.
- Okay.

1283
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:05,872
- Don't leave a mark, okay?
- Yeah.

1284
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,219
Come here.

1285
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,089
I wanna hold you.

1286
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,430
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- What?

1287
01:01:31,462 --> 01:01:33,298
- Leave them on.
- All right.

1288
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,535
Oh, you're
so beautiful, Tammy.

1289
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,069
Oh, you're so big.

1290
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:38,538
Oh, yeah.

1291
01:01:39,605 --> 01:01:41,040
I like this.

1292
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,174
Yeah.

1293
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:49,415
What? What's wrong?

1294
01:01:49,448 --> 01:01:51,049
My water broke.

1295
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,822
Mm.

1296
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:58,891
You're so beautiful.

1297
01:02:06,631 --> 01:02:08,267
He's so precious, Jim.

1298
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,546
Congratulations, Jim.

1299
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:41,000
I understand
that Gary drove you here?

1300
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:46,205
We called the studio,
Jim, but you were on the air.

1301
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:49,375
Tammy was real upset
that you weren't here for it.

1302
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:51,944
No...

1303
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,915
I'm just wonderful, Jim.
I'm... I'm so wonderful.

1304
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,219
We announced
his birth on air.

1305
01:03:00,252 --> 01:03:02,522
We got a real surge
in pledges.

1306
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:03,956
Praise the Lord.

1307
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,292
We're gonna get
that expansion in Studio 3,

1308
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,593
thanks to this little miracle.

1309
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:11,063
Hmm.
Congrats, Jim.

1310
01:03:11,096 --> 01:03:13,099
This is such
a day of joy.

1311
01:03:15,968 --> 01:03:17,435
A day of celebration,

1312
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:22,575
but I just can't help the feeling
that something else is going on here.

1313
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:26,478
That something depraved

1314
01:03:27,578 --> 01:03:28,981
taints this day.

1315
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,621
Depraved is
a very big word, Jim.

1316
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:37,891
But it's a fitting word,
isn't it, Tammy?

1317
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,296
Yes, Jim.

1318
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:56,208
Well, Fletcher's
waiting outside

1319
01:03:56,241 --> 01:03:58,643
and he'll get this man back to
Nashville, where he belongs.

1320
01:03:58,676 --> 01:04:00,979
- Oh, no. Jim, please, no.
- Tammy.

1321
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:02,648
- Please.
- Tammy, I suggest

1322
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:04,417
you don't talk right now.

1323
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:07,085
Tammy.

1324
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,190
Tammy, I hope you're not
gonna let him do this.

1325
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,259
Tammy?

1326
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:16,529
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1327
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,165
Sorry.

1328
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,536
I'm so sorry, Jim.

1329
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,008
I'm so sorry.

1330
01:04:39,384 --> 01:04:41,152
Can you take the baby away
from her, please?

1331
01:04:41,185 --> 01:04:43,256
Okay. All right.

1332
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:49,561
Let me get you something to
help you sleep, okay, honey?

1333
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:20,325
Yes.
That's exactly what I told you.

1334
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:23,029
Formal living quarters
for some of the staff.

1335
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:24,096
Wow!

1336
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,397
- Yes.
- So ornate.

1337
01:05:25,431 --> 01:05:27,566
Inspired
by European architect.

1338
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:29,701
And over here,

1339
01:05:29,734 --> 01:05:33,305
that's the first
Christian water park.

1340
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:35,073
"We are fishers of men."

1341
01:05:35,107 --> 01:05:37,043
That's the bait.

1342
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:38,611
That's good.

1343
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,745
I wanted
to show you this, too.

1344
01:05:39,777 --> 01:05:42,180
See, over here... Yes.

1345
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:45,518
This is Old Jerusalem.

1346
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:48,054
And it's a stunning replica.

1347
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:49,822
Oh, it looks beautiful, Jim.

1348
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:51,190
- Yeah.
- So detailed.

1349
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:57,096
You know what they say about details?
God is in 'em.

1350
01:05:57,129 --> 01:05:59,698
- Yes.
- That's right.

1351
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,232
You know, for as long
as I can remember, Roe,

1352
01:06:01,265 --> 01:06:05,570
I've dreamed of a vacation destination
for Christian families to come to.

1353
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:07,707
A place where
they can, um...

1354
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,707
Hey, Tam.

1355
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:10,842
A place where they know

1356
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,078
that their children are gonna be
safe, you know?

1357
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:14,245
Sure.

1358
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,449
We're selling
partnerships to fund it.

1359
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:18,150
And that way,
the partners,

1360
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,319
they feel
the sense of ownership

1361
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:25,123
and a pride
in this Christian paradise

1362
01:06:25,156 --> 01:06:26,792
that they've built.

1363
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:33,498
Uh... Um, how many partnerships do
you have to sell in order to fund it?

1364
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,633
Hmm. Well...

1365
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:40,772
a lot.

1366
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,741
Yes.

1367
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:45,277
You know, because the
partnerships we've already sold,

1368
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:49,815
they've had to go
to funding other projects.

1369
01:06:50,748 --> 01:06:53,352
- I see.
- Yes.

1370
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,254
But I've been
praying on it.

1371
01:06:55,286 --> 01:06:57,323
I've been hoping
that you could advance PTL

1372
01:06:57,355 --> 01:06:58,723
just a little bit of credit.

1373
01:07:00,192 --> 01:07:04,130
Just to get the bulldozers
moving, you know?

1374
01:07:07,765 --> 01:07:08,800
Hi, honey.

1375
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:12,805
Uh, this is
Roe Messner.

1376
01:07:12,837 --> 01:07:14,839
He's the developer
of Heritage USA.

1377
01:07:14,872 --> 01:07:16,608
Well, I'm not
the developer yet.

1378
01:07:16,642 --> 01:07:18,210
Yeah.

1379
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,245
Hi.

1380
01:07:24,283 --> 01:07:28,821
The doctors have had
her on so many loopy things

1381
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:31,623
since Jamie Charles was born.

1382
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:34,926
Pills to make her normal.
Pills to make her sleep.

1383
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,629
Um, as long
as she's feelin' better.

1384
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,565
Yes. Amen.

1385
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:44,937
I love what you're
trying to do here, Jim.

1386
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,705
- Mm.
- I do.

1387
01:07:46,738 --> 01:07:48,908
I spent some summers
with my wife

1388
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,343
at Knott's Berry Farm.

1389
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:54,479
Every year the jellies
got less and less fresh.

1390
01:07:54,513 --> 01:07:56,649
- Mm.
- And I'm convinced

1391
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:59,951
it's 'cause they started hiring
the wrong kinds of people

1392
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:01,187
to make the preserves.

1393
01:08:02,754 --> 01:08:04,556
I knew you were my man, Roe.

1394
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:06,725
But, uh...

1395
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:10,529
I'm not a gambler, Mr. Bakker.

1396
01:08:10,562 --> 01:08:12,931
- Oh, well...
- Oh, this isn't gambling, Roe.

1397
01:08:14,332 --> 01:08:15,500
Oh, no, it's faith.

1398
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:19,571
I have seen
him perform miracles.

1399
01:08:20,538 --> 01:08:21,739
Huh.

1400
01:08:21,773 --> 01:08:24,709
I haven't had anyone claim to
be a faith healer to my face

1401
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:28,713
since I was about
six years old.

1402
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:32,283
Well, buildings are miracles.

1403
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,618
Aren't they, Roe?

1404
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:36,656
Well, it's amazing anything ever
gets built, that's for sure.

1405
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:38,891
Yeah.

1406
01:08:38,924 --> 01:08:41,660
This is beautiful.

1407
01:08:41,693 --> 01:08:44,697
We must take
a leap of faith for God.

1408
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:48,733
Especially when the Devil
is makin' us doubt.

1409
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,870
God's on our side, Roe.

1410
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:54,340
Every time we fall,

1411
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:58,443
God proves His love again

1412
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:00,813
and we come back.

1413
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:06,352
We come back bigger,
and stronger, and better.

1414
01:09:12,456 --> 01:09:18,730
"All things work for good
to them that love God,

1415
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:25,438
"to them who are called
according to His purpose."

1416
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:35,982
And I called you, Roe.

1417
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:51,497
You're welcome.

1418
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,270
You're owed a "thank you"?

1419
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,773
He was nowhere near saying yes
until I sat down.

1420
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:05,010
Oh, yes, to flirt with him.

1421
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:11,850
Are you gonna divorce me, Jim?

1422
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:13,919
I don't know.

1423
01:10:16,388 --> 01:10:17,390
I should.

1424
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:23,062
But God hates divorce.

1425
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:25,064
It ruined your mother.

1426
01:10:26,063 --> 01:10:27,765
It'll do the same to you.

1427
01:10:27,799 --> 01:10:29,935
You stopped paying
attention to me, Jim.

1428
01:10:29,968 --> 01:10:32,938
You broke faith
with me, Tammy!

1429
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:37,843
Gary, he told me that I was
beautiful and that I was talented.

1430
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:39,411
And he wanted me, Jim.

1431
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,411
Don't touch me!

1432
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:44,415
Gary wanted me, Jim,
in ways that you don't.

1433
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,050
Oh, my goodness.

1434
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:48,354
He was my friend.

1435
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:50,956
You know, I got a letter this
week, Tammy.

1436
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:52,890
From the President.

1437
01:10:52,924 --> 01:10:55,426
The President
of the United States,

1438
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,930
Ronald Reagan himself,
wrote me a personal letter

1439
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:02,800
thanking me for my support
in his election!

1440
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:05,671
I'm an important man,
Tammy Faye!

1441
01:11:05,703 --> 01:11:09,541
And people don't treat important
men the way that you treated me.

1442
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,479
I'm gonna clear my head,
I'm gonna pray.

1443
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,915
I'm gonna think
about what I want.

1444
01:11:22,854 --> 01:11:24,457
Jim?

1445
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:50,815
<i>Oh, God. How can I fix this?</i>

1446
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:55,821
God?

1447
01:11:58,055 --> 01:11:59,491
Where'd you go?

1448
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:01,993
Where are you?

1449
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,096
<i>Why can't I feel you?</i>

1450
01:12:07,998 --> 01:12:09,501
Where are you?

1451
01:12:11,736 --> 01:12:14,006
Oh...

1452
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:18,710
Where are you?

1453
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:20,845
Tammy? Tammy,
it's all right.

1454
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:24,082
- Jim.
- I'm here. I'm here.

1455
01:12:24,114 --> 01:12:26,919
It's all right.
Shh. It's all right.

1456
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:32,892
Um...

1457
01:12:33,858 --> 01:12:35,894
Tammy, I, um...

1458
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:40,632
I prayed on it.
And, um...

1459
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,035
What?

1460
01:12:43,068 --> 01:12:45,904
You know, maybe
I've been a better builder

1461
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:47,739
than I've been a husband.

1462
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:52,544
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1463
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,714
But I know for certain

1464
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:59,784
that you are
the only woman on Earth

1465
01:12:59,818 --> 01:13:01,687
who understands me.

1466
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,724
Oh, honey.

1467
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,960
It makes me so happy
that you're saying that.

1468
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:11,062
- Tammy.
- Baby.

1469
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,765
I'm sorry.

1470
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:18,504
Oh...

1471
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,706
You really hurt me.

1472
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,843
I know, Jim.

1473
01:13:25,544 --> 01:13:27,746
And I think you have
to apologize.

1474
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,015
I'm sorry.
Oh, I am so sorry, Jim.

1475
01:13:31,483 --> 01:13:33,018
To the partners.

1476
01:13:34,152 --> 01:13:37,122
- Mm?
- On air.

1477
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,158
Today.

1478
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,663
Oh.

1479
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:50,935
I learned the
best lesson in my whole life

1480
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:54,172
<i>because of something
terrible that I did</i>

1481
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:56,007
<i>that I cannot take back.</i>

1482
01:13:57,576 --> 01:14:00,245
<i>I learned how much
I love my husband,</i>

1483
01:14:00,278 --> 01:14:02,948
how much I care
for my husband.

1484
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:06,218
And I learned a lesson
of loneliness

1485
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:08,721
<i>such as I never experienced
in my whole life.</i>

1486
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:15,192
All of a sudden,
I realized

1487
01:14:15,225 --> 01:14:18,263
<i>that there was
a lot more to marriage</i>

1488

1489

01:18:45,129 --> 01:18:47,498
in this fight
for our nation's soul.

1582
01:18:48,065 --> 01:18:49,468
Mm.

1583
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:52,437
We should just stay out of it and
keep politics out of the church.

1584
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:55,473
Too much on the line.

1585
01:18:55,505 --> 01:19:00,845
Democrats are already trying to strip
away our churches' tax exempt status.

1586
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:06,551
Oh, this time, we'll keep
the evangelicals in the tent.

1587
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,087
When's lunch?

1588
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,156
<i>Well, hello, everyone,</i>

1589
01:19:11,188 --> 01:19:13,257
<i>it's just so nice
to have you here with us.</i>

1590
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:17,229
We have an experience today
that really is touching to me.

1591
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:19,630
Right here on my right,
I have a young man named Steve Pieters,

1592
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:22,000
and I'd like to
introduce you to Steve.

1593
01:19:22,032 --> 01:19:24,568
Steve is a patient of AIDS

1594
01:19:24,602 --> 01:19:28,372
and he's so generously allowed
us to talk to him today.

1595
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:31,443
He is presently taking chemotherapy
and is unable to travel.

1596
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:35,546
So, we have a satellite hookup
live from LA.

1597
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,350
- <i>Hello, Steve!</i>
<i>- Hi, Tammy.</i>

1598
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:41,118
<i>We're so glad to see you.</i>

1599
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:42,953
<i>I'm so happy I could be here.</i>

1600
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,323
<i>Okay, Steve.
At what time in your life</i>

1601
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:47,992
<i>did you feel like
you were different?</i>

1602
01:19:48,026 --> 01:19:51,263
<i>Did you feel like maybe you weren't
like some of the other guys?</i>

1603
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:55,666
<i>I realized I was gay
when I was about 11 or 12.</i>

1604
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:59,237
<i>I talked with a pastor in
the church where I grew up</i>

1605
01:19:59,269 --> 01:20:01,505
<i>and, um, he was freaked out.</i>

1606
01:20:01,538 --> 01:20:02,407
<i>Mm.</i>

1607
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:06,477
<i>He told me,
"Don't tell anybody."</i>

1608
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,147
<i>Never tell anybody
anything about it</i>

1609
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,215
<i>and it will go away,</i>

1610
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:14,953
<i>but it didn't go away.</i>

1611
01:20:14,986 --> 01:20:15,921
<i>Okay, I have another question.</i>

1612
01:20:15,953 --> 01:20:17,656
So, the satellite
is directly above us?

1613
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,690
Yes, it orbits us.

1614
01:20:19,724 --> 01:20:23,495
That's how we're able to reach so
many folks just simultaneously.

1615
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:25,397
Let me ask you, Jerry,
what's your viewership

1616
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:26,764
over at
Liberty Broadcasting?

1617
01:20:26,797 --> 01:20:31,135
Oh, well, I'm proud to say that we
reach three million viewers a day.

1618
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:35,340
My goodness. Praise God.
That's just wonderful.

1619
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,175
And you?

1620
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:42,147
Well, we here at PTL, we reach
20 million viewers a day

1621
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:46,150
in 56 countries just
because of that miracle

1622
01:20:46,184 --> 01:20:48,119
up there in the sky.

1623
01:20:48,152 --> 01:20:50,288
Oh, let's see
who Tammy's talking to.

1624
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:51,456
<i>And, Steve,
because of this feeling,</i>

1625
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:52,623
<i>did you try to make friends
with girls?</i>

1626
01:20:52,657 --> 01:20:55,427
<i>And did you try to be
around girls and everything</i>

1627
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,694
<i>so no one
would think anything?</i>

1628
01:20:56,728 --> 01:20:58,697
<i>Oh, sure, I dated girls.</i>

1629
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:02,134
<i>I tried to "program" myself
to be straight</i>

1630
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:04,502
<i>and it never worked.</i>

1631
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:06,171
<i>So,
what made you feel...</i>

1632
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:07,404
And what's this, Jim?

1633
01:21:07,438 --> 01:21:09,239
<i>...like there was
no way for you to be straight?</i>

1634
01:21:09,273 --> 01:21:10,976
I don't know.

1635
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:13,144
- This is not...
- <i>It was from meeting</i>

1636
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:16,747
<i>other gay people who were
happy with the way they were</i>

1637
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:19,751
<i>that made me realize I could
be happy with the way I am.</i>

1638
01:21:19,783 --> 01:21:21,987
Now, I find this problematic.

1639
01:21:22,019 --> 01:21:23,687
Yes. Well, you know Tammy,

1640
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,123
she... she connects
in her own way and...

1641
01:21:26,157 --> 01:21:28,526
<i>Okay, Steve.
What did you feel</i>

1642
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:32,430
<i>when you first heard
the word AIDS?</i>

1643
01:21:32,462 --> 01:21:34,366
<i>Was it just a word
to you, Steve?</i>

1644
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:38,303
<i>Well, yes. Why would it hurt me?
I was a good Christian pastor.</i>

1645
01:21:38,336 --> 01:21:40,238
I... I can't
look at this.

1646
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,605
No.

1647
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:43,675
She must have programmed it
last minute or...

1648
01:21:43,707 --> 01:21:45,009
You need to get
her under control.

1649
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:47,478
No, no. Let me help.

1650
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:50,547
Believe you me, I will be
having words with her.

1651
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:51,616
- She's been acting very...
- Jim.

1652
01:21:51,648 --> 01:21:52,683
Yes?

1653
01:21:52,716 --> 01:21:54,251
We have our differences.

1654
01:21:55,653 --> 01:21:58,590
People forget sometimes
a pastor needs a pastor.

1655
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,125
<i>As Jesus says in Mark 5...</i>

1656
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:02,460
Reach out.

1657
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:03,562
Yes.

1658
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,697
What happened when
you told your mom and dad

1659
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,065
that you were
feeling this way?

1660
01:22:08,099 --> 01:22:10,802
- <i>Well, my mother cried.</i>
- Uh-huh.

1661
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:13,605
<i>And my father held my hand</i>

1662
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:17,042
<i>and told me that I was
his son, no matter what.</i>

1663
01:22:17,075 --> 01:22:19,277
Ah, thank God.

1664
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,513
You know, thank God
for a mom and dad

1665
01:22:22,546 --> 01:22:25,149
who will stand
with a young person.

1666
01:22:25,183 --> 01:22:26,551
I think that's so important

1667
01:22:26,585 --> 01:22:29,421
because no matter what happens
to a young person in their lives,

1668
01:22:29,453 --> 01:22:32,322
they're still your boy,
they're still your girl

1669
01:22:32,355 --> 01:22:33,491
no matter what happens
in their life.

1670
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:35,259
And I think
it's very important

1671
01:22:35,292 --> 01:22:38,563
that we as mom and dads
love through anything.

1672
01:22:38,595 --> 01:22:40,631
And that's the way with Jesus,
you know?

1673
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:43,068
Jesus loves us
through anything.

1674
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,170
<i>Jesus loves me
just the way I am.</i>

1675
01:22:45,202 --> 01:22:48,540
<i>Jesus loves
the way that I love.</i>

1676
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,808
And have you found it
to be true

1677
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,477
that people
wanna stay away

1678
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:55,613
and that they're afraid to be
in the same room as you

1679
01:22:55,645 --> 01:22:57,616
and breathe the same air
that you breathe?

1680
01:22:58,416 --> 01:22:59,418
<i>Yes, Tammy.</i>

1681
01:23:00,218 --> 01:23:03,287
And how sad is that?

1682
01:23:03,321 --> 01:23:05,590
That we as Christians

1683
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:09,359
who are supposed
to love everyone

1684
01:23:09,393 --> 01:23:12,764
are afraid so badly
of an AIDS patient

1685
01:23:13,464 --> 01:23:15,733
that we will not
go up to them

1686
01:23:15,765 --> 01:23:18,135
and put our arm around them

1687
01:23:18,169 --> 01:23:20,604
and tell them that we care?

1688
01:23:26,844 --> 01:23:28,880
This is an emotional interview
for me.

1689
01:23:28,912 --> 01:23:30,080
I just met Steve

1690
01:23:30,113 --> 01:23:32,750
and it's like meeting him
in person for the first time.

1691
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:34,419
I wanna put
my arm around you.

1692
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:36,354
<i>And I wanna put my arms
around you, Tammy Faye.</i>

1693
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,795
- PTL.
- PTL.

1694
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,665
That's very good. Yes.

1695
01:23:48,632 --> 01:23:50,300
Every time she
calls, she screams,

1696
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,702
"Jim and his buddy
had sex on me."

1697
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:53,270
- Okay. Shh.
- "Now, I'm gonna kill myself.

1698
01:23:53,304 --> 01:23:55,607
"Jim Bakker'll have my gosh
darn blood on his hands."

1699
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:56,473
Now...

1700
01:23:56,507 --> 01:23:57,841
Never heard
so many curse words.

1701
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,144
Not even from
my brother Pete.

1702
01:23:59,176 --> 01:24:00,211
Right.

1703
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:01,712
- Did a caller upset you, dear?
- Tammy...

1704
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:02,913
Yes.

1705
01:24:02,947 --> 01:24:05,150
Oh, I'm so sorry. You know,
when we do shows like this,

1706
01:24:05,183 --> 01:24:08,353
really, we're challenging
Christians to open their hearts.

1707
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:10,654
- And some don't take it that well.
- Tammy, I will handle this.

1708
01:24:10,688 --> 01:24:12,257
Oh, no, I have this, Richard.

1709
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,225
It wasn't about the AIDS man.
It was about Jim.

1710
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,729
She's called before.
We all call her "The Shrieker."

1711
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,898
She says Jim and his buddy
had sex on her.

1712
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,598
Tammy,
you're needed on stage four.

1713
01:24:21,631 --> 01:24:24,368
Gosh, we've been having
these pranks for a long time.

1714
01:24:24,402 --> 01:24:26,738
And some people,
they're just hurting so bad

1715
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,340
and we just need to love them.

1716
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:31,910
Anyway, Jim doesn't have that in him.
Believe me.

1717
01:24:33,344 --> 01:24:35,480
I know him
better than anyone.

1718
01:24:58,402 --> 01:24:59,871
<i>Join the PTL Club,</i>

1719
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:02,739
<i>and Tammy wants to send you
a copy of her book...</i>

1720
01:25:02,773 --> 01:25:06,644
about how to
overcome fear.

1721
01:25:06,676 --> 01:25:09,846
If you haven't
sent in your pledge...

1722
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,283
$15, that is all,
$15 a month,

1723
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:14,952
it'll change
your life

1724
01:25:14,986 --> 01:25:17,522
and, uh, we could all use
a little bit of that.

1725
01:25:17,554 --> 01:25:19,990
So, Tammy, I think you
oughta sing a song for us.

1726
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:22,794
Oh, I'm back here
looking at the boat, Jim.

1727
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:24,229
<i>Isn't this
a magnificent thing?</i>

1728
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:25,496
<i>Yes.</i>

1729
01:25:25,528 --> 01:25:26,697
Right here in our beach.

1730
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:29,300
Looks brand new, I bet.

1731
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,468
One of the local boat companies

1732
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:31,936
- loaned it to us, I bet.
- I'm gonna take my shoes off.

1733
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:34,939
I'm gonna wade
in the water.

1734
01:25:34,971 --> 01:25:38,343
I don't think
that boat's ever seen water.

1735
01:25:38,376 --> 01:25:40,278
Oh, it's fake. That's...

1736
01:25:41,444 --> 01:25:42,613
That's why.

1737
01:25:44,715 --> 01:25:46,484
"That's why" what, Tam?

1738
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,420
<i>That's why
I can't hear Him.</i>

1739
01:25:50,453 --> 01:25:51,488
Oh.

1740
01:25:52,756 --> 01:25:55,227
How can I hear Him
when the sky is fake?

1741
01:25:56,327 --> 01:25:57,695
You want
to stand up, honey?

1742
01:25:57,728 --> 01:25:59,364
We're trying to do
a TV show here, baby.

1743
01:25:59,397 --> 01:26:00,564
You wanna come
give me some help?

1744
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,234
No? Well...

1745
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:09,806
I guess it's a good time
as any to work on the tan.

1746
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:15,513
Well, if Tammy's not going
to sing, I guess I am.

1747
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:16,580
<i>♪ Oh, we're blest</i>

1748
01:26:16,613 --> 01:26:17,748
<i>♪ We're blest, we're blest ♪</i>

1749
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,352
We just got her home.

1750
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,421
She's doing okay,
she's fine.

1751
01:26:24,455 --> 01:26:28,593
No, yeah. We'll be taking her to the
Betty Ford Center in the morning.

1752
01:26:28,626 --> 01:26:32,864
She just needs to rest.
No shows for a while.

1753
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:35,433
What's happening
with the other thing?

1754
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:40,805
Can I just say
I love you so much?

1755
01:26:40,837 --> 01:26:42,873
I love you.

1756
01:26:42,907 --> 01:26:46,944
My friends are gonna be so excited
when I tell them that I met you.

1757
01:26:53,951 --> 01:26:55,653
Tammy?

1758
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:58,489
You had enough drugs in your
system to kill a truck driver.

1759
01:26:59,523 --> 01:27:00,491
I did?

1760
01:27:00,523 --> 01:27:02,626
The doctor told us
if you'd waited a day longer,

1761
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,562
you would have
had brain damage.

1762
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:06,898
You could have died.

1763
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,799
You can't take
all those pills, honey.

1764
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:09,866
They're addictive.

1765
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:12,002
I didn't know that. I'll stop.

1766
01:27:12,036 --> 01:27:14,372
The doctors
didn't tell me that.

1767
01:27:14,404 --> 01:27:16,407
I'm not a drug addict.

1768
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,411
I'm only addicted
to Diet Coke.

1769
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:22,714
You have to stay right here.

1770
01:27:24,148 --> 01:27:25,684
God doesn't want you yet.

1771
01:27:26,716 --> 01:27:28,752
I have always prayed to Him

1772
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:32,424
that He would allow you to save
the souls that I wasn't able to.

1773
01:27:33,757 --> 01:27:35,460
And He has.

1774
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:37,062
You do.

1775
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,800
So, you have
to stay right here.

1776
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:44,768
Okay?

1777
01:27:45,836 --> 01:27:47,605
Okay, Mom.

1778
01:28:23,974 --> 01:28:24,976
Tammy.

1779
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,011
Oh. Hi, Jim.

1780
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,550
The Devil's coming
for me, Tammy.

1781
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:37,488
Can we talk about Satan later?

1782
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,523
You know, I'm trying
to feel like myself again.

1783
01:28:39,556 --> 01:28:41,091
There was a woman...

1784
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:46,898
Fletcher set it up

1785
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:52,702
after you did
what you did with Gary.

1786
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,507
I did it to prove something to
myself, I think. I... I don't know.

1787
01:28:57,507 --> 01:28:59,010
I hated it.

1788
01:29:01,879 --> 01:29:05,015
I ended up just
crying in the bathroom.

1789
01:29:11,822 --> 01:29:13,056
I fell...

1790
01:29:14,825 --> 01:29:16,528
a long way.

1791
01:29:18,127 --> 01:29:19,464
I'm so sorry.

1792
01:29:24,201 --> 01:29:26,171
Say something.

1793
01:29:29,806 --> 01:29:31,742
I've been hurting so bad, Jim.

1794
01:29:32,675 --> 01:29:34,044
For years.

1795
01:29:36,514 --> 01:29:39,150
And there's never
any release to the pain.

1796
01:29:40,718 --> 01:29:43,488
There's never anything
to make it stop hurting.

1797
01:29:44,854 --> 01:29:48,024
And when I get up
in the morning,

1798
01:29:48,058 --> 01:29:50,060
I feel like I'm just
gonna throw up...

1799
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:54,064
and throw up, and throw up.

1800
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,837
And I have to self-talk myself,
"You can make it, Tammy.

1801
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,738
"You can make it.

1802
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:03,942
"Don't give up."

1803
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,915
Damn it, Jim!

1804
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:17,921
I'm so sick
from my faith in you!

1805
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:23,261
Well, I'm sick of you, too.

1806
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:29,800
You try being married
to Tammy Faye.

1807
01:30:29,832 --> 01:30:33,970
All I've been doing is trying
to keep our marriage together,

1808
01:30:34,004 --> 01:30:37,274
keep the ministry together,
working night and day

1809
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:40,611
while you're just buying minks

1810
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:42,947
and drinking soda pop

1811
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:47,084
and cheating on me
with that ape!

1812
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,991
You used to take care
of me, Tammy.

1813
01:30:54,023 --> 01:30:55,725
You stopped taking care of me.

1814
01:30:55,759 --> 01:30:58,162
I don't wanna
take care of you, Jim.

1815
01:30:58,194 --> 01:31:00,697
I don't wanna be your mother.

1816
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,600
A woman needs a man
in a relationship!

1817
01:31:03,634 --> 01:31:05,870
- I am a man!
- You're a boy.

1818
01:31:05,903 --> 01:31:07,672
I built all of this.
I built you an empire.

1819
01:31:07,705 --> 01:31:09,774
You built you an empire.

1820
01:31:09,806 --> 01:31:12,710
No man could ever
give you enough.

1821
01:31:12,742 --> 01:31:15,645
You're a bottomless pit.

1822
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,049
And you keep on
asking me for more

1823
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:23,653
with that whiny,
grating Betty Boop voice!

1824
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:40,939
I thought
you liked Betty Boop.

1825
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,776
I'm sorry.

1826
01:31:46,743 --> 01:31:49,013
I'm so sorry, Tammy.

1827
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,314
Me, too, Jim.

1828
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:52,584
Um...

1829
01:31:55,051 --> 01:32:00,323
There's another thing.
The woman...

1830
01:32:00,357 --> 01:32:05,630
I gave her money
to stay quiet, but she didn't.

1831
01:32:05,662 --> 01:32:06,496
And, um...

1832
01:32:06,531 --> 01:32:09,033
And the money
came from PTL donors.

1833
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,201
Jim.

1834
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,002
And Charles Shepard has
the story from <i>The Observer.</i>

1835
01:32:12,036 --> 01:32:13,136
And he's gonna
print it tomorrow.

1836
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,373
Oh, my God.

1837
01:32:19,309 --> 01:32:21,980
- I just... I know...
- Jim. Oh, my God.

1838
01:32:24,313 --> 01:32:26,084
I destroyed
everything.

1839
01:32:27,785 --> 01:32:29,687
Our life's work, Jim.

1840
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,855
I know.

1841
01:32:31,955 --> 01:32:33,291
Tammy.

1842
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:37,694
Tam, my sweetheart,

1843
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,299
if anyone falls,
it's gonna be me.

1844
01:32:42,331 --> 01:32:45,769
You can let me be the man that
I was meant to be for you.

1845
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:49,073
You don't know anything.

1846
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:53,778
Oh, they're here.

1847
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:54,944
Who's that?

1848
01:32:54,978 --> 01:32:56,413
It's all right.

1849
01:32:58,014 --> 01:32:59,983
These are the men that are
gonna help me fix this.

1850
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:02,085
Oh, no, Jim.

1851
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,822
- No, no.
- Reverend. Thank you so much.

1852
01:33:04,854 --> 01:33:06,456
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Jim.

1853
01:33:06,489 --> 01:33:09,126
Oh, it's love that
carried me here today.

1854
01:33:09,158 --> 01:33:11,194
- God bless you.
- Tammy Faye.

1855
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,029
Jerry.

1856
01:33:13,063 --> 01:33:15,065
Come in, please.
Please come in. Welcome.

1857
01:33:15,099 --> 01:33:17,001
Thank you. Thank you
for coming, fellas.

1858
01:33:17,033 --> 01:33:18,169
All right.

1859
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:20,805
Well, here we are.

1860
01:33:20,837 --> 01:33:23,974
We think it's best
that we create a distance

1861
01:33:24,006 --> 01:33:26,109
between you
and the ministry.

1862
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:28,112
It'll only be
for a couple of weeks.

1863
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:31,748
Then, gradually,
we'll bring you back on the network

1864
01:33:31,782 --> 01:33:33,884
after all this
unpleasantness settles down.

1865
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:37,153
Jerry, you're a Baptist.
You know, you're not a charismatic.

1866
01:33:37,187 --> 01:33:39,055
And our audience
won't like that.

1867
01:33:39,089 --> 01:33:40,425
- Right, Jim?
- Audience?

1868
01:33:41,224 --> 01:33:43,193
I thought
they were parishioners.

1869
01:33:43,227 --> 01:33:44,929
They are.

1870
01:33:44,961 --> 01:33:47,163
They're our partners.
We call them partners.

1871
01:33:47,197 --> 01:33:48,399
Mm.

1872
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:50,300
20 million souls a day

1873
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:53,804
touched by The Word.
Thanks to PTL.

1874
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:55,004
Mm.

1875
01:33:55,037 --> 01:33:56,840
You go back there
right away, and...

1876
01:33:58,242 --> 01:33:59,810
Well, bless your hearts.

1877
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:03,781
Look at the two of you right
now, so very pitiful.

1878
01:34:03,813 --> 01:34:06,149
They see you,
and they'll change the channel.

1879
01:34:07,885 --> 01:34:09,420
Jim,

1880
01:34:09,452 --> 01:34:11,822
all those souls you won

1881
01:34:13,055 --> 01:34:14,991
for Jesus...

1882
01:34:16,492 --> 01:34:18,828
I'm here for you.

1883
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,998
- Thank you, Reverend.
- Mm.

1884
01:34:24,568 --> 01:34:27,071
Just make sure
you take care of our partners.

1885
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:30,373
That is the only thing
that matters now.

1886
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,886
<i>You're watching PTL,</i>

Tammy and I
are so very glad

1889
01:34:49,926 --> 01:34:54,430
that we've been granted the
opportunity to talk with you today,

1890

1892

Hello, everybody.

1893
01:34:59,836 --> 01:35:01,037
And...

1894
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:04,073
we want to say to you

1895
01:35:04,107 --> 01:35:09,212
that we are so very,
very sorry.

1896
01:35:09,246 --> 01:35:12,516
And to thank the people who
are standing with us all over,

1897
01:35:12,549 --> 01:35:15,352
saying, "Jim,
we do forgive you.

1898
01:35:15,385 --> 01:35:19,223
"We forgive Jim and Tammy
of all of their sins."

1899
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:23,226
And we're so thankful
that God has forgiven us.

'Cause the God I know
is still God.

- I sure will.
- All right.

1907
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:42,412
All right, Tammy Faye is
going to sing a song for us.

1908
01:35:44,014 --> 01:35:45,282
Well,
maybe you're hurting,

1909
01:35:45,314 --> 01:35:47,218
and you need
this song today, too.

2038
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:54,745
It's not over till it's over.

2039
01:43:31,081 --> 01:43:33,016
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

2040
01:43:33,049 --> 01:43:34,850
Oh.

2041
01:43:34,884 --> 01:43:35,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

2042
01:43:36,019 --> 01:43:38,355
- Nice to meet ya. I'm Tammy.
- Nice to meet you. Stephen.

2043
01:43:38,388 --> 01:43:39,855
All right. You need
a water or anything?

2044
01:43:39,889 --> 01:43:41,558
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- Okay.

2045
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,892
My new headshot.

2046
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:45,595
Yeah, all right. Nice.

2047
01:43:46,362 --> 01:43:48,664
All right. So...

2048
01:43:48,697 --> 01:43:50,099
I hear you're here
to pitch me something.

2049
01:43:50,132 --> 01:43:53,670
Oh. So I should...
I'll... Yeah.

2050
01:43:53,702 --> 01:43:55,671
So, I have two ideas
for you, Stephen.

2051
01:43:55,705 --> 01:43:58,908
And then I'd like to hear
what you see me doing.

2052
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:00,609
Okay.

2053
01:44:00,643 --> 01:44:04,081
Okay. Um, the first one
is about puppets.

2054
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:06,582
I mean, it's serious,
but it's also funny.

2055
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:09,853
It's a talk show
but with puppets.

2056
01:44:09,885 --> 01:44:11,754
And it's for kids
and also for adults.

2057
01:44:11,787 --> 01:44:16,058
And it's a way for people
to talk about their problems,

2058
01:44:16,091 --> 01:44:17,693
but with puppets.

2059
01:44:19,595 --> 01:44:20,763
Okay.

2060
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:24,701
Okay, I have something else
for you, Stephen.

2061
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:27,136
- Oh, okay, another one.
- It's for teenagers.

2062
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:29,973
You know, the biggest problem
that they say is,

2063
01:44:30,005 --> 01:44:33,042
"How can we get people
to listen to us?"

2064
01:44:33,076 --> 01:44:35,511
And I would really love
to give them that chance

2065
01:44:35,545 --> 01:44:37,047
and, you know,
go where they go.

2066
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,882
I'd love to go to the
piercing parlors with them,

2067
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:42,753
I'd love to go to the tattoo
places with them, and...

2068
01:44:42,786 --> 01:44:44,154
And you would call
this show, what?

2069
01:44:44,187 --> 01:44:46,156
- "Tammy's Terrific Teens."
- Oh, yeah.

2070
01:44:46,188 --> 01:44:48,591
I thought that would be,
you know, a fun title.

2071
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:50,761
I was just curious.

2072
01:44:50,794 --> 01:44:52,863
Well, what do you
see me doing, Stephen?

2073
01:44:52,895 --> 01:44:55,698
I mean,
you're the expert.

2074
01:44:55,732 --> 01:44:58,868
Well, have you reached out to any
Christian networks or anything?

2075
01:45:01,438 --> 01:45:03,407
Well, they won't have me.

2076
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:07,477
Okay. Well, what I've learned
from doing these shows,

2077
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,913
and I think you've
learned as well, is,

2078
01:45:09,946 --> 01:45:10,980
you know, it is dangerous

2079
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:13,817
to wanna be seen just for
the sake of it. You know?

2080
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:16,051
Well, I do love
the camera, but...

2081
01:45:16,085 --> 01:45:17,721
Why?

2082
01:45:17,754 --> 01:45:19,055
Well, because it's a person.

2083
01:45:19,087 --> 01:45:20,823
It's someone
to talk to.

2084
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:24,127
It's... It's God's love
through me.

2085
01:45:27,095 --> 01:45:28,531
So what do you think, Stephen?

2086
01:45:28,564 --> 01:45:30,134
You know, would you like
to do a show?

2087
01:45:31,568 --> 01:45:33,437
I don't know, Tammy.

2088
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,173
I just don't think it's a
good fit for us right now.

2089
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,841
Okay?

2090
01:45:39,843 --> 01:45:43,145
Well, well, I... I...

2091
01:45:43,179 --> 01:45:45,015
- I really appreciate...
- Thank you for coming in.

2092
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,817
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming through.

2093
01:45:46,849 --> 01:45:48,919
We'll take care
of your parking validation.

2094
01:45:48,952 --> 01:45:50,187
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2095
01:45:51,019 --> 01:45:52,621
You have a good one.

2096
01:45:55,892 --> 01:45:57,193
- Bye.
- Bye.

2097
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,763
Oops.

2098
01:46:18,848 --> 01:46:20,082
Oh, man.

2099
01:46:21,117 --> 01:46:22,953
What'd she do
to her face?

2100
01:46:25,889 --> 01:46:28,892
I told you she lived here.
What a freak.

2101
01:46:33,962 --> 01:46:35,931
- Oh, man.
- Hi.

2102
01:46:35,965 --> 01:46:37,701
Oh, shit.
She's comin' over here.

2103
01:46:37,733 --> 01:46:40,136
- You guys just hangin' out?
- Yeah.

2104
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:45,742
So, you can talk about me.
That's all right.

2105
01:46:45,774 --> 01:46:47,510
But, you know,
you gotta shake my hand,

2106
01:46:47,544 --> 01:46:49,546
and you gotta say hi first.

2107
01:46:51,179 --> 01:46:52,748
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet ya.

2108
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:54,017
I'm Tammy.
What's your name?

2109
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:55,819
- Um, Max.
- Hi.

2110
01:46:55,852 --> 01:46:57,120
But, you know,
we're not strangers.

2111
01:46:57,153 --> 01:47:00,023
I live right there.
We're neighbors.

2112
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:02,091
Oh! Let me show you guys
what I just got.

2113
01:47:02,992 --> 01:47:06,964
Who would like a picture?

2114
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,068
<i>Jolene, I cannot believe
that you have eaten</i>

2115
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,270
<i>almost an entire jar
of peanut butter.</i>

2116
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,639
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Susanne.</i>

2117
01:47:15,671 --> 01:47:17,607
<i>I happen to be eating for two.</i>

2118
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:18,807
Don't beg.

2119
01:47:20,076 --> 01:47:21,711
Okay, you're being so good.

2120
01:47:21,743 --> 01:47:23,746
<i>I say, have at it.</i>

2121
01:47:23,779 --> 01:47:24,915
<i>You know, Susanne,
since you're having</i>

2122
01:47:24,947 --> 01:47:26,649
<i>so much trouble collecting
money for your benefit,</i>

2123
01:47:26,683 --> 01:47:28,118
<i>I might be able
to help you out.</i>

2124
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:30,019
<i>You, how?</i>

2125
01:47:30,053 --> 01:47:31,654
<i>God bless you.
You've reached Tammy.</i>

2126
01:47:31,688 --> 01:47:33,123
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

2127
01:47:35,224 --> 01:47:37,627
<i>Hello, Mrs. Bakker.
This is Linda Thomas</i>

2128
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,229
<i>from Oral Roberts School
of Divinity.</i>

2129
01:47:39,261 --> 01:47:42,565
<i>You probably don't remember
but I volunteered at PTL.</i>

2130
01:47:42,599 --> 01:47:44,668
<i>You were always so nice to me.</i>

2131
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:46,670
<i>Anyway, I'm calling
to invite you to sing</i>

2132
01:47:46,702 --> 01:47:48,938
<i>at this year's festival
of Praise and Redemption.</i>

2133
01:47:48,971 --> 01:47:51,340
<i>I think you'd be a wonderful
addition to our program.</i>

2134
01:47:51,373 --> 01:47:53,676
<i>We'll check back with you to
find out if you're interested.</i>

2135
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:55,045
<i>Thanks very much.</i>

2136
01:48:26,309 --> 01:48:28,011
- Hi.
- Hi.

2137
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:44,827
So, what's new?

2138
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:46,964
Oh. I don't know.

2139
01:48:49,165 --> 01:48:51,835
I got an invitation
from Oral Roberts to sing.

2140
01:48:52,702 --> 01:48:54,137
- Wow.
- Yeah.

2141
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:56,739
That's wonderful.

2142
01:48:56,773 --> 01:48:57,974
- I'm not gonna do it though.
- You should.

2143
01:48:58,006 --> 01:48:59,942
No, I haven't been
in church for years.

2144
01:48:59,975 --> 01:49:01,044
Well, that's where you belong.

2145
01:49:01,077 --> 01:49:02,779
No, I don't belong with them.

2146
01:49:02,812 --> 01:49:04,346
They're gonna laugh.

2147
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:05,415
I'm not gonna go.

2148
01:49:05,447 --> 01:49:07,750
It's my fault
you feel that way.

2149
01:49:07,783 --> 01:49:09,085
I'm sorry for that.

2150
01:49:10,118 --> 01:49:11,254
All of it.

2151
01:49:13,956 --> 01:49:15,792
I pray for you, Jim.

2152
01:49:15,825 --> 01:49:18,961
And I pray that God
will use you again.

2153
01:49:20,362 --> 01:49:21,664
Yes.

2154
01:49:26,035 --> 01:49:28,337
I appreciate you signing
the divorce papers, Jim.

2155
01:49:28,371 --> 01:49:29,940
I didn't want to, Tam.

2156
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:31,707
I know.

2157
01:49:33,475 --> 01:49:36,179
But, you know, we've just been
through too much together

2158
01:49:36,211 --> 01:49:39,181
and, you know,
there's been too many hurts

2159
01:49:39,215 --> 01:49:41,685
that have happened
over the years.

2160
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:43,920
And that poor girl, Jim.

2161
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:46,089
I know, I know. I know.

2162
01:49:46,555 --> 01:49:49,358
I'm ashamed of that.

2163
01:49:49,392 --> 01:49:53,028
I've been getting some real
me and God time in here

2164
01:49:53,062 --> 01:49:54,730
and everything looks
very, very different

2165
01:49:54,764 --> 01:49:56,700
when you're looking at it
from the bottom up.

2166
01:49:56,733 --> 01:49:58,034
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

2167
01:49:58,067 --> 01:49:59,301
And I've just
been thinking,

2168
01:50:00,269 --> 01:50:02,939
were we preaching

2169
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:06,108
that God doesn't love you
if you're poor?

2170
01:50:07,343 --> 01:50:09,211
Well, you know
that I grew up poor.

2171
01:50:11,113 --> 01:50:13,817
It's not what
you have in stuff,

2172
01:50:13,849 --> 01:50:16,085
it's the people that count.

2173
01:50:16,919 --> 01:50:18,787
- Amen.
- Amen.

2174
01:50:34,136 --> 01:50:35,404
Tammy.

2175
01:50:37,273 --> 01:50:38,341
Mom?

2176
01:50:43,278 --> 01:50:46,049
<i>"We therefore
were buried with him</i>

2177
01:50:46,081 --> 01:50:47,483
<i>"through baptism into death.</i>

2178
01:50:48,483 --> 01:50:49,451
<i>"In order that,</i>

2179
01:50:49,484 --> 01:50:51,955
<i>"just as Christ was raised
from the dead</i>

2180
01:50:51,987 --> 01:50:54,423
<i>"through the glory
of the Father,</i>

2181
01:50:54,456 --> 01:50:58,127
<i>"we too may walk
in newness of life."</i>

2182
01:51:00,129 --> 01:51:02,297
Such a good service.

2183
01:51:02,331 --> 01:51:03,767
Hello, Tom.
Thanks for comin'.

2184
01:51:06,068 --> 01:51:08,271
There you are.

2185
01:51:08,304 --> 01:51:10,440
Aren't you gonna come in,
have somethin' to eat?

2186
01:51:10,473 --> 01:51:13,542
I don't belong
in there with them.

2187
01:51:13,576 --> 01:51:14,978
Yeah.

2188
01:51:16,011 --> 01:51:18,214
One good thing about your mum
kicking the bucket is

2189
01:51:18,246 --> 01:51:20,249
I never have to go
to church again.

2190
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:24,321
No, I shouldn't
laugh at that.

2191
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:29,091
- Oh, I did something terrible.
- Oh?

2192
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:32,495
Oh.

2193
01:51:32,528 --> 01:51:35,565
You're forgiven.

2194
01:51:35,598 --> 01:51:38,868
Ooh. Wow, she really
was blind, wasn't she?

2195
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:40,370
Mm-hmm.

2196
01:51:42,037 --> 01:51:43,873
I got somethin' for ya.

2197
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,542
You recognize this?

2198
01:51:49,377 --> 01:51:51,413
I thought Falwell
took everything.

2199
01:51:51,447 --> 01:51:53,016
She hid this.

2200
01:51:53,049 --> 01:51:54,951
She stole it.

2201
01:51:54,983 --> 01:51:56,318
Well, she said
she'd be damned

2202
01:51:56,352 --> 01:51:58,321
if she was gonna hand over
this precious thing

2203
01:51:58,354 --> 01:52:00,056
her daughter
worked so hard for

2204
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:02,259
to the fat Baptist.

2205
01:52:30,252 --> 01:52:32,421
<i>We're opening
the house now, Ms. Bakker.</i>

2206
01:52:32,455 --> 01:52:34,491
<i>People are taking their seats.</i>

2207
01:52:39,528 --> 01:52:41,531
Well, hello there, Tammy.

2208
01:52:43,265 --> 01:52:44,466
Hi, there.

2209
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:48,839
I'm scared.

2210
01:52:56,245 --> 01:53:00,850
<i>Jesus, come in to my heart,
and forgive me my sins.</i>

2211
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:03,353
I know I cared about things

2212
01:53:03,385 --> 01:53:04,520
that I shouldn't have.

2213
01:53:06,354 --> 01:53:08,290
And I know I got lost...

2214
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,528
and I forgot

2215
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,264
who you are to me...

2216
01:53:17,233 --> 01:53:18,935
but that's done now.

2217
01:53:20,635 --> 01:53:22,938
Yeah, I won't go forward

2218
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:26,209
looking in the rearview mirror
of my life.

2219
01:53:27,542 --> 01:53:29,446
<i>On stage in 10 minutes.</i>

2220
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:48,998
Thank you.

2221
01:53:50,265 --> 01:53:51,667
Here, this is
for the piano player.

2222
01:53:51,701 --> 01:53:52,903
Okay.

2223
01:54:09,318 --> 01:54:10,486
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

2224
01:54:11,554 --> 01:54:15,558
<i>...please welcome
tonight's special guest,</i>

2225
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,292
<i>Tammy Faye.</i>

2226
01:54:25,568 --> 01:54:27,370
Aw.

2227
01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:30,440
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2228
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:37,012
I am genuinely, I am so happy

2229
01:54:37,045 --> 01:54:39,381
to be back where
I once belonged.

2230
01:54:44,053 --> 01:54:48,291
This morning when I was
in need of some comfort,

2231
01:54:48,323 --> 01:54:51,160
I turned to
my favorite scripture,

2232
01:54:51,193 --> 01:54:52,696
Psalms 91.

2233
01:54:55,797 --> 01:54:58,501
"He that dwelleth
in the secret place

2234
01:54:58,533 --> 01:55:00,135
"of the most high

2235
01:55:02,138 --> 01:55:06,408
"shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty."

2236
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:08,377
And this is my favorite part.

2237
01:55:16,218 --> 01:55:19,122
"He shall
cover thee with His feathers

2238
01:55:20,723 --> 01:55:22,524
"and under His wings

2239
01:55:23,658 --> 01:55:26,261
"shalt thou trust."

2240
01:55:29,697 --> 01:55:32,735
Well, I haven't had a concert
in almost a decade

2241
01:55:34,403 --> 01:55:36,506
and I am a little nervous.

2242
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:40,243
But I'll do my best

2243
01:55:40,276 --> 01:55:43,779
to deliver Him to you folks
tonight. Okay?

for the amazing grace of God.

Because without

I wouldn't even be here today.

reached down and said,

enough for you today, too.
