00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,477
<i>Welcome to</i> The Kelly File, <i>everyone.
I'm Megyn Kelly.</i>

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,195
<i>Breaking tonight,
polls are moving, the race is changing,</i>

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,272
<i>and more than a dozen
Republican candidates</i>

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,512
<i>are trying to make themselves heard
with a little more than one week left</i>

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,593
<i>till the debate
that could change everything.</i>

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>And we're the gateway.
We, the questioners, are the gateway.</i>

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,040
<i>We at Fox and CNN
and everybody else who gets a chance</i>

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,476
<i>to actually moderate
a presidential debate with these guys.</i>

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,359
<i>I mean, these guys,
they deserve to face tough questioning.</i>

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,272
<i>As Chris says, and I agree,</i>

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,875
<i>they want George Washington's job
and they better earn it.</i>

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,435
<i>They better show the American people
they're worthy of it.</i>

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,309
<i>A lot of folks assumed
Donald Trump would flame out by now.</i>

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,835
<i>They have been proven wrong. Now wait.</i>

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,240
<i>Here. We gotta get to this</i>

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>because this is just breaking
on</i> The Daily Beast.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,075
<i>The headline is,</i>

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,279
<i>"Ex-wife: Donald Trump
made me feel violated during sex.</i>

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,274
<i>Ivana Trump once accused
the real-estate tycoon of quote, 'rape.'"</i>

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,874
<i>Somebody who speaks for Donald Trump</i>

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,838
<i>has come out and denied it as well</i>

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,037
<i>and added that legally, he says,</i>

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,510
<i>"you cannot rape your spouse."</i>

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
<i>Here's the one thing
you probably know about me.</i>

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>I have a big mouth.</i>

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,836
<i>Roger, you have Megyn on line one.</i>

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,318
- Megyn.
<i>- Morning, Roger.</i>

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,834
What'd you do to piss off Trump?

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,718
We did a segment on recent coverage
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,514
You're giving that oxygen
before the first goddamn debate?

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,277
Roger, we had a full-screen
of Ivana's recantation. Which is soft.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,158
<i>She accused him during a divorce.</i>

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,630
Well, his lawyer, Michael Cohen,

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
claims you can't rape a spouse.
It pissed me off.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,314
<i>Great. The future of Fox News
is now a goddamn feminist.</i>

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,353
- No. I'm not a feminist. I'm a lawyer.
<i>- We need him.</i>

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,079
Clean this up. Now.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,038
<i>Unfortunately, when it comes
to politicians and the media,</i>

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,992
<i>Roger Ailes knows his shit.</i>

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,636
<i>Appointed head of the Fox News channel
by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,</i>

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,714
<i>Roger transformed cable news,
pushing Fox to the forefront.</i>

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,757
<i>Years before, to get Nixon elected,</i>

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,395
<i>he created the modern town-hall debate.</i>

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,518
<i>To get Reagan elected, he made him
address the elephant in the room.</i>

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,196
I will not make age
an issue of this campaign.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,274
I am not going to exploit
my opponent's youth and inexperience.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,150
<i>To get George H. W. Bush elected,
somebody did the Willie Horton ads.</i>

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,994
<i>Roger denies it was him... a lot.</i>

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,118
<i>I have been astounded
at the number of Americans</i>

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,910
<i>who are fine with our country moving
in a socialist direction.</i>

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Here we go.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,152
<i>Their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.</i>

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,516
News is like a ship.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,116
You take your hands off the wheel
and it pulls hard to the left.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,473
Hey, look at this. James Murdoch.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,836
Tell me those lips haven't sucked cock.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,712
This is what nepotism gets you.

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,635
Roger rules Fox from behind these doors,
on the second floor.

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,680
When employees say, "the second floor,"
they mean Roger,

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,630
or the many VPs paid to enact his will
without qualms or questions.

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,474
Now, I know what some of you
are thinking, and, no,

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,517
Roger does not tell us what to say on air.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
He doesn't have to.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,399
- Love that dress, Megyn.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,675
No, really. I love it.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,794
He's not horny. He's just ambitious.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,272
<i>Roger is always watching.</i>

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,593
<i>The Eagles postponed their appearance
because co-founder, Glenn Frey,</i>

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,320
<i>is too ill to travel.
In a statement, the band announced...</i>

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,754
Morons.

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,992
<i>The phone in his office
connects directly to the control room,</i>

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,878
which is down on the first floor.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,919
- Yes, sir?
<i>- You fucking idiots!</i>

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,878
That's not Glenn Frey, it's Don Henley!

75
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,155
- Dump the B-roll.
- Dump it.

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,438
Back to anchor. That's not Glenn Frey,
that's Don fucking Henley!

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,591
- Oh, shoot.
- What the fuck, Kayla?

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,831
I'm sorry. I don't know secular music.

79
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,036
The Eagles?

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,914
- Only the biggest band of the '70s.
- When my mom was a toddler.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
- They all look the same. They're just old.
- Oh, my God.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,111
Down in the basement is the Fox newsroom.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
All our shows have crews
who work in these pods.

84
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
This is my staff.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,119
Hey, guys.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,715
We're below the city,
so it smells like mold.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,952
But there hasn't been a rat sighting
in four months.

88
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,679
- Four months.
- Yeah!

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,559
The anchors and their key producers
have base camps.

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,839
Here, on 17 and 18.
Often decorated with viewer art.

91
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,077
And everyone in this building,

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,914
even Roger, answers to eight.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,279
The eighth floor is home
to CEO Rupert Murdoch and his sons.

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,671
This is the power behind the power.

95
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,229
The actual studios
are scattered around the building.

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,392
Most anchor and show offices are here.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,597
Above are Fox Business, radio,

98
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,956
<i>New York Post</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,191
Most of the American
conservative establishment.

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,192
In one building.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,635
<i>The stage is finally set for
tonight's Republican debate in Cleveland.</i>

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,896
<i>All the candidates
are looking for a boost tonight,</i>

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,039
<i>but only ten of them have a chance
to appeal to voters in prime time.</i>

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,877
Trump has a real problem with women.
I wanna ask about it.

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,639
You can back that up?

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Yes.

107
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,356
Good morning.

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,760
Morning, Chris.

109
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Excuse me.

110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,831
Do you think that's it?

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,118
Sorry.

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,555
It's probably nerves.

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,872
No. When I'm nervous, I hear my heart.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,270
I can't hear it.

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,400
That's your first question?
Is this some feminist thing?

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,234
- She's not a feminist.
- It goes to his electability.

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,239
Did you run it past Tom Lowell?

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,073
We can go after Trump.

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,436
- The second floor said that?
- No.

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
The eighth. The Murdochs.

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,839
Rupert called Roger and said, about Trump,
enough is enough.

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,879
Look, all Trump does is watch Fox.

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,000
Roger gave him air for his crazy theories
and idiot grievances.

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,636
Why? 'Cause Roger shares a lot of them.

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,473
Are you sure you wanna take that on?

126
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Yes.

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,117
<i>It's the new look of politics...</i>

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,720
Okay, I don't know if these are
strong enough, but they help me.

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,799
- Nausea?
- Yeah. You go live in five hours.

130
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,314
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

131
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,993
Okay.

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,037
<i>Donald Trump feeds his own narrative.</i>

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
Oh, fuck. So nauseous.

134
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,896
If you can try to keep them down.

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,990
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,117
Fuck. Stop making that face, Julia.

137
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
I-I'm not making a face.

138
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Five hours?

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,595
- Yeah.
- Okay.

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,310
Don't worry. We're behind you.

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,232
Way behind you.

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,271
There's a blanket on the chair
and, just in case, a trash can beside it.

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,512
<i>Welcome to the first
Republican primary debate.</i>

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,391
<i>Tonight's moderators

145
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,039
<i>and Megyn Kelly.</i>

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,557
<i>Mr. Trump, one of the things
people love about you</i>

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,599
<i>is you speak your mind
and you don't use a politician's filter.</i>

148
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,320
<i>However,
that is not without its downsides.</i>

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,920
<i>In particular, when it comes to women.</i>

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,756
<i>You've called women you don't like
"fat pigs," "dogs,"</i>

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,911
<i>"slobs" and "disgusting animals."</i>

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,875
What is she doing?

153
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,429
<i>- Your Twitter account...
- Only Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

154
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,519
Great TV. She knows what she's doing.

155
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,954
<i>Your Twitter account...</i>

156
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,158
<i>For the record,
it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

157
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
<i>Yes, I'm sure it was.</i>

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,234
<i>Your Twitter account has several
disparaging comments about women's looks.</i>

159
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,280
<i>You once told
a contestant on</i> Celebrity Apprentice

<i>it would be a pretty picture

161

<i>...from Hillary Clinton, who is likely

<i>Call me stupid,

167
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,032
Trump is pissed.
He was up all night, tweeting.

168
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,395
Crap. Really?

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,196
What was he tweeting?

170
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,000
"Fox viewers give low marks
to bimbo @MegynKelly."

171
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
I hate that word.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,471
Yeah. It says you're too sexy to be smart,
but not smart enough to be sexy.

173
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,280
2:40 a.m.
"Wow, @MegynKelly really bombed tonight.

174
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,511
People are going wild on Twitter!
Funny to watch."

175
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,077
- 3:07 a.m. "Dear @Megyn..."
- Go, Trump. Donald Trump.

176
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Okay.

177
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,561
How many times did he tweet?

178
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,199
Like, 15.

179
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,714
Yeah.

180
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,712
He's never gonna be president.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,395
Wait. Am I gonna be the story?

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
- No.
- No.

183
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,035
- I'm gonna be the story.
- No.

184
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,634
No. No.

185
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,076
<i>I can't let you go
without talking about Donald Trump.</i>

186
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,833
Gretchen's giving this two blocks?

187
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,280
It's that far down the food chain?

188
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,670
We should get you a security team.
Think it over.

189
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,831
Trump called me before the debate.

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
He said he knew
that your first question was harsh.

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,271
- How could he know that?
- No idea.

192
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,919
I sure didn't.

193
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,837
It was good TV. Unexpected. Goddamn tough.

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,274
Proud of you, Megyn.

195
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
Thanks, Roger.

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Heard you were sick.

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Yeah.

198
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,956
I think it was my coffee.

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,478
- Where'd you get it?
- My driver.

200
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,552
He insisted on some fancy coffee joint.

201
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,790
You know this guy?

202
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,313
No. He's a driver, Roger.

203
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,073
- Did you know him?
- No.

204
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
You know better than that.

205
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,599
<i>Okay, yes, Roger Ailes is paranoid.</i>

206
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,637
<i>But his parents were nuts.</i>

207
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,870
<i>As he drove off to college,</i>

208
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,475
<i>they filed for divorce
and didn't tell him.</i>

209
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,155
<i>At Christmas, he came home
to find strangers in his house</i>

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,154
<i>and all his things, photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out.</i>

211
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,075
<i>I mean, is it any wonder the man created
a nostalgia machine for lost America?</i>

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
This is crazy.

213
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,389
We're sitting here wondering

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,756
if a candidate for president
poisoned my coffee.

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,479
It's only crazy until it happens.

216
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,119
And it happens.

217
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,433
I hate being the story.

218
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,590
I'll call Trump.

219
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,876
You go on vacation. Stay above it all.

220
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,634
He won't dent your ratings.

221
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,394
Nobody stops watching
because of a conflict.

222
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,318
They stop watching when there isn't one.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,437
- Some viewers will listen to him.
- Well, some.

224
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,911
But as long as he keeps saying
Megyn Kelly is unwatchable,

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,834
that means he's watching it.
They know that.

226
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,718
And they'll watch what he watches.

227
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
You'll be okay.

228
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,396
See you in a week.

229
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,496
Drink up, buddy boy.

230
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,276
- Thank you.
- Here's to a week of no kids but my own.

231
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

232
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,995
- Okay, Frank Bruni in <i>The Times.</i>
- Boo.

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,117
"The debate was riveting.
It was admirable.

234
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,960
It compels me to write a cluster of words
I never imagined writing:

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,599
hooray for Fox News."

236
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,593
Well, that's gotta make you happy,
praise all tangled up in an insult.

237
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,034
It does make me happy, Gil.

238
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,096
<i>And, you know, you could see
there was blood coming out of her eyes,</i>

239
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,840
<i>- blood coming out of her... wherever.</i>
- No. Oh, my God.

240
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,230
Did he just accuse me
of anger-menstruating?

241
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,880
Yes. Are... Yeah.

242
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,189
- Yeah.
- I'm calling Roger.

243
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,749
No. I'll talk to him.
Take your vacation. I'll handle this.

244
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,433
- Oh, my God.
- Do you hear the phones?

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,160
- Doug.
- I have to call you back.

246
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,576
<i>Would you like to correct yourself</i>

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,354
<i>on that other talking point
about men being dominant?</i>

248
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,996
<i>We don't have any time.
I wish we did. We're running over.</i>

249
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,656
<i>Yeah, well, HR is on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.</i>

250
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,478
<i>I gotta read that manual again.</i>

251
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,136
<i>I'll bring it to your office
right after the show.</i>

252
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,976
<i>Some guy came up to me and said,
"I saw you on</i> Fox & Friends <i>this morning.</i>

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,356
<i>Is Gretchen as cute in person
as she is on TV?"</i>

254
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,136
<i>- And what did you answer him, Eric?
- Oh, come on.</i>

255
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,629
<i>Beautiful dress. You look wonderful.
Great color.</i>

256
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
<i>In summary, Gretchen's beautiful.</i>

257
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,680
<i>- Beautiful. You look beautiful.
- Well, you look fabulous too.</i>

258
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,511
<i>Did you get a wax?
Does the waxing hurt?</i>

259
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,353
<i>He looks at me for that!</i>

260
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
<i>We'll try that.</i>

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,776
<i>Women are everywhere. We're letting 'em
play golf and tennis now.</i>

262
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,016
<i>- It's outta control.
- You know what?</i>

263
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,235
<i>You know... She's out.</i>

264
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,836
<i>You read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

265
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,149
<i>She needed a shower.</i>

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,595
The attitude off-camera was even worse.

267
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,512
Steve simply started ignoring me.

268
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,160
What did Mr. Ailes say
when you complained?

269
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,675
He said,
"You act like it only rains on women.

270
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,754
Stop getting
goddamn offended by everything.

271
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,069
You're a man-hater."

272
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,272
And, "Learn to get along with the boys."

273
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,915
- Then he took me off the show.
- But gave you your own.

274
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,191
Well, in the afternoon dead zone.

275
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,080
I mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

276
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,352
Even though
I did increase the ratings by 15%.

277
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,349
He moved me to second base.

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,394
<i>Back in Minnesota, before
I graduated summa cum laude from Stanford,</i>

279
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,597
<i>before I was crowned Miss America,</i>

280
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,151
<i>I played second base
in the sixth-grade softball league.</i>

281
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,390
I hate second base.

282
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,952
Did he ever offer to reverse that decision
if you made yourself sexually available?

283
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,795
Not directly.

284
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,995
With Roger it's always about loyalty.

285
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,436
He says he can fix things if you're loyal.

286
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,910
And you can guess
the ultimate expression of loyalty.

287
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,114
We don't guess.

288
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Oral sex.

289
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Roger likes to joke,

290
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,076
"To get ahead,
you gotta give a little head."

291
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Really.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,199
But Mr. Ailes never
unambiguously asks for oral sex?

293
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,079
I mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

294
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,277
Like, "You're sexy,
but you're too much work."

295
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,430
You're... I mean...

296
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,430
I have a whole list in here
because that's just how Roger is.

297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
What do you want out of a lawsuit?

298
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,355
What do I want?
I want this behavior to stop.

299
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,114
Someone has to speak up.
Someone has to get mad.

300
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,277
Well, that may not be you.

301
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,479
Your contract will have a clause
requiring secret, mandatory arbitration.

302
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,120
You familiar with Rudi Bakhtiar's case?

303
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,311
<i>- Yes.
- Well, you're supposed to be.</i>

304
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,272
My first act as DC bureau chief...

305
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,039
I want you down here full-time.

306
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,476
Oh, my God.

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,199
That's amazing. Yes.

308
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,760
You do know what this means for you?

309
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,036
<i>Shit. He doesn't think I'm ready.</i>

310
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,875
Brian, I will not let you down.
I'm gonna bust my ass for you.

311
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,599
Well, Rudi, come on, that's a given.

312
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,793
<i>So, what's the problem?</i>

313
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,439
But, uh...

314
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,279
Look, you do get
how I feel about you, right?

315
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,194
<i>Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

316
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,360
Well, I'm glad you said that, Brian,
because I really respect you too.

317
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,477
No. No. I mean...

318
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,719
how I really feel.

319
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,754
<i>Just look confused.</i>

320
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,239
All I want from you, Rudi,
is to see the inside of your hotel room.

321
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,073
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

322
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,280
That's all it's gonna take.

323
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,277
<i>Don't react. Make it your fault.</i>

324
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,993
Brian, if I've done anything

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,710
to make you think
I feel that way about you, I apologize.

326
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
<i>Friends.</i>

327
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,475
- We're friends.
<i>- Professionals.</i>

328
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
We have a great professional vibe.

329
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
<i>Now sell it.</i>

330
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,000
I just don't do that.
I've never had to do that for a job.

331
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,196
I know, I know.

332
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,192
You know I'd kill for DC,

333
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,389
but there's no way
I'm showing you my hotel room.

334
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,992
<i>This is gonna ruin my career.</i>

335
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,352
Well, now I feel like a creep.

336
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,478
No. No, you're so not.

337
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,994
<i>Fucking creep.</i>

338
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,956
They fired me.

339
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm a lousy reporter apparently. Assholes.

340
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,016
<i>She proved what they wanted her to prove.</i>

341
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,839
No one really wins by suing Fox News.

342
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,312
It's been our experience
that once you go public in your job...

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,150
no one will hire you.

344
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,471
If you're able to stick it out at Fox,
gather more evidence,

345
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,237
you might be able to sue Ailes himself
instead of Fox.

346
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,436
And that is why I'm here.

347
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,480
Because Marty Hyman told me
that over here in New Jersey

348
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,997
I can avoid arbitration
by suing Roger personally.

349
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,231
He says that
you've managed to change the law,

350
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,392
and that we could call other women
and show a pattern.

351
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,233
Will other women come forward?

352
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,595
Yes, they will.

353
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,831
You live and work in New York.

354
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,798
Roger has a house in Bergen County

355
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
where he stays
when he can't make it upstate.

356
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,193
You do your homework, Ms. Carlson.

357
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,640
No fingerprints.

358
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,156
That's how much
I practiced the violin as a child.

359
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,199
If Roger finds out you came to us,
he won't just fire you.

360
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,398
He will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

361
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,915
He will attack you personally.

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,038
These men, they care more about
their reputations than they do money.

363
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Roger won't stop.

364
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,839
- I know.
- You know that.

365
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,676
Colleagues you admire will say publicly
you're a superior, ambitious woman

366
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,717
who's suing because her career stalled.

367
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,954
Let 'em.

368
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,750
Okay.

369
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,753
If we work hard, you might be lucky enough

370
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,311
to watch the most powerful man in TV
go after you with everything he's got.

371
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,758
Thank you.

372
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,312
I'm telling you,
other women will come forward.

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,200
Let's hope.

374
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,115
Frankly, I think you have
a gap in the network, Mr. Shine.

375
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,511
There are millions
of young conservatives in this country.

376
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,479
I mean, you can look
at my Instagram account. There are.

377
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,517
They don't have a voice on our network.

378
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,634
I see myself as an influencer
in the Jesus space.

379
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,915
And don't get me wrong,

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,232
I've learned a ton from Gretchen,
I truly have, of course.

381
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,835
But no judgment here,

382
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,719
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

383
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,554
It's just not that helpful to her.

384
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,831
To be honest, Mr. Shine,

385
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,310
she's sort of Establishment.

386
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,959
With a capital E.

387
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,635
That's why I wanted
to talk to you in private.

388
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,554
Kayla, before we move you up...

389
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,070
I want to ask you something personal.

390
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,909
Mm-hmm.

391
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,156
What do you think of our slogan,
"Fair and Balanced"?

392
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm glad you asked.

393
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,030
Look, our news shows
and our opinion shows are very different.

394
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,397
Our news is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

395
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,954
Our opinion shows,

396
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,033
Roger gave a voice
to people who didn't have one.

397
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,670
And he balanced the American conversation.

398
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,434
So, our newspeople are fair.

399
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,038
Our entertainers
are a very necessary form of balance.

400
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,476
Attagirl. Perfect.

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,835
But today we're sticking up for girls
on International Day of the Girl.

402
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,560
And, for the first time on cable news,
here I am,

403
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,118
makeup-free for a reason.

404
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,238
<i>Tomorrow I'll be back
in my regular makeup.</i>

405
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,631
And I thank the other brave women
who came on today's show <i>sans</i> makeup.

406
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,112
But let's continue to tell our girls,
"Just be yourself."

407
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Shep.

408
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
- And clear.
- Yes.

409
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,635
Great show.

410
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,110
Get me some makeup.

411
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,316
I have some bad news.

412
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,234
Kayla is leaving us for the asshole.

413
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,796
O'Reilly?

414
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,395
It is our highest-rated program.

415
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,278
And we can't be?

416
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,352
No, I believe in <i>Real Story,</i> I do.

417
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,796
Did you just see that segment?
Did you see it?

418
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,917
We're doing something unique here.

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,719
Together. All of us.

420
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,034
- Can you just...
- Sure.

421
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Listen to me.

422
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,989
I can get you where you wanna be.

423
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,754
I can protect you.
Just don't get ahead of yourself.

424
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,911
You have a lot to learn. I can teach you.

425
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,496
I'm not getting ahead of myself, Gretchen.

426
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,936
- I'm taking the next step.
- No. Listen.

427
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,237
- I learn by doing.
- Come on, please.

428
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm confused.

429
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,073
You want me to pass on a promotion

430
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,836
so you can help me get the same promotion

431
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,513
- on a show with worse ratings?
- No.

432
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,717
I want a little loyalty. I need loyalty.

433
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,950
Women, together.

434
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,838
I'm loyal to the network.

435
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,912
It's not us versus them, Gretchen.

436
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,394
Miss America.

437
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,436
Roger.

438
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Hi there.

439
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,117
- This is a treat.
- What the fuck are you doing?

440
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,954
A segment on how we oversexualize women.

441
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,192
You said be more myself, so, ta-da.

442
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,760
You know what makeup does?

443
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,479
Keeps everybody from seeing you sweat.

444
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,236
Well, it's... Most of the mean tweets
that I receive are about my appearance,

445
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,233
so it is important that we fight back
against this kind of bullying.

446
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,800
Bullying isn't meanness.

447
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,918
Bullying is people with more power
hitting people with less.

448
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,550
These jackasses have cell phones.
You have a fucking TV show!

449
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,837
We have to fight
the objectification of women.

450
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,956
Bullshit.

451
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,714
Listen, mouth shut, ears open.

452
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,231
Nobody wants to watch a middle-aged woman
sweat her way through menopause.

453
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,240
What?

454
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:58,471
Not on national fucking television!

455
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,755
Thank you for the advice.

456
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,950
Objectification.

457
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,957
- All right.
- Gretchen, I really appreciate...

458
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Shut up.

459
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Good luck.

460
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,750
Drift.

461
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Go, go, go!

462
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,639
- Whoo!
- Good one, honey.

463
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,630
- I got it!
- It's right on the line!

464
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Hey.

465
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,475
It's a zoo here.
The phone's ringing off the hook.

466
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,154
Anyone care he called me a bimbo?

467
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,551
- Not really. He tweeted the <i>GQ</i> photo.
<i>- I saw.</i>

468
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,393
<i>- And?</i>
- Torn.

469
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,996
God, I'd love to be slut-shamed.

470
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,549
Gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement.

471
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,518
No. No response. Zero.

472
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,319
Ah...

473
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,511
Doug just lost. I gotta go.

474
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,556
- Next time, honey.
- Nice.

475
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,711
- Good game.
- Trump, '16.

476
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,550
Excuse me.

477
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,350
You talk to my wife again,
I will beat you to a fucking pulp.

478
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,158
- That was weird.
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,520
- You're getting some action.
- Oh, really?

480
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,072
Oh, man.

481
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Asshole.

482
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,319
You don't have to worry about Trump.

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,496
You're tougher than all those guys, okay?
You just gotta worry about the crazies.

484
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,040
- I can handle a few crazies.
- I know.

485
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,040
Mommy.

486
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,081
Trump will stop
once he feels he's won the argument.

487
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,835
I feel like he's less interested
in winning the argument

488
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,073
than just having the argument
with you in public

489
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,998
to prove he can take on the establishment.

490
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,839
I'm not the establishment.

491
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,038
Honey, get real.
You are the establishment now.

492
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,634
- Mommy!
- Not yet!

493
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,435
You do understand
I have to be above this, right?

494
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,232
I have to be an anchor first,
then a woman.

495
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,677
You know the entire country
is talking about your period right now?

496
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,238
- Mommy!
- What?

497
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,073
- There's a man.
- What?

498
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,799
- Yardley!
- Look. He's right there.

499
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,496
- Yardley, where is he?
- Look. There he is.

500
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,776
Jesus. He's got a fucking camera!

501
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Come here, honey.

502
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,176
No! Don't open the door.
They can't sell them if we're inside.

503
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
Get out of here! Go!

504
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Are you okay?

505
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,953
What were you guys doing?

506
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,793
- Mommy and Daddy?
- Mm-hmm.

507
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,520
It was a cross... crossword... Um...

508
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,512
Mommy was just taking a quick little nap.

509
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,637
- Quick one.
- It wasn't that quick.

510
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,871
I'm gonna have to
call Roger about security.

511
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,113
<i>It's as clear as a bell that Mayhem Kelly
has gone over to the dark side.</i>

512
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,910
<i>The more she sells out,
the wider her nostrils have become.</i>

513
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,719
<i>Listen to what I've just said to you.</i>

514
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,816
<i>- Have you seen them flare?</i>
- He's here.

515
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,957
<i>This woman was once pretty,</i>

516
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,794
<i>and the more she has sold out,
the wider her nostrils have become.</i>

517
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,234
<i>They're almost porcine.</i>

518
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,277
<i>She snorts her insults at America...</i>

519
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,280
Roger!

520
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:08,457
<i>...and, as I say, it's now
the portrait of Dorian Kelly,</i>

521
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,914
<i>not the portrait of Dorian Gray.</i>

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,277
Give me a day to figure out
how we hit Trump back.

523
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,430
Stop by later.

524
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,239
I don't want my kids hearing this crap.

525
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,959
Ignore the damn morons.

526
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,359
I'm old, fat, and ugly.

527
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,830
Christ, they call me Jabba the Hutt.

528
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,516
Hemophilia swells my joints.
Can't exercise.

529
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,556
I feel fine, but I look like shit.

530
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,950
I look the opposite of how I feel.

531
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,078
Do I let it affect me? No, I do not.

532
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,318
<i>This isn't entirely true.</i>

533
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,189
<i>Roger is also fat because he'll get
a room-service menu and order page two.</i>

534
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,478
No goddamn orange on Fox!

535
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,472
<i>But he cares a lot about looks.</i>

536
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,835
Fucking idiots.

537
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,752
Let's turn our attention to South Korea.

538
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,675
South Korean officials say talks with the
north have adjourned until tomorrow...

539
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,071
<i>Early on, he realized
for a network to stay on 24 hours a day,</i>

540
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,237
<i>you need something to hold an audience.</i>

541
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,673
Joining me to discuss the Korean peninsula
is Seth Choy...

542
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,717
<i>That something is legs.</i>

543
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,358
There's a reason for clear desks.

544
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,552
We need you in a shorter dress.

545
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,496
<i>But you know that they're gonna take...</i>

546
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,477
Wide shot! Wider!

547
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,119
Go to the wide shot!
I want to see her goddamn legs.

548
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,317
Why the fuck do you think I hired her?

549
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,680
<i>But this might be seen by racial
activists purely through the racial prism.</i>

550
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,751
Stand up and give me a spin.

551
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,431
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a visual medium.

552
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,678
Yeah. That's good. Sit down.

553
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,399
I support the wall. I do.

554
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,631
But mass deportations, come on.

555
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
That'll never work

556
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,076
because of the 14th Amendment.
You want me to quote it?

557
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,471
"If you were born in America,
you're an American, period. Period."

558
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,349
Get me a demographically friendly
Hispanic woman on immigration.

559
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,956
But hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

560
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,316
Okay. New girl's up. Kayla.

561
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,000
Hi, sir.

562
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,072
So, I was listening to
Rush Limbaugh this morning.

563
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,914
He said something kind of cool
about Anthony Weiner.

564
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,559
How he's an exhibitionist

565
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,078
in every aspect
of how he presents himself politically.

566
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,550
- Oh, my God.
- Is she the best you can do?

567
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,712
Bill Shine asked us
to give her a try, so...

568
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,952
Okay, let's not lose focus.
Back to immigration.

569
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,199
Oh, my gosh.

570
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,430
I can't get fired.

571
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,399
This is the only job I have ever wanted.

572
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,598
I don't wanna be on TV, I wanna be on Fox.

573
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,000
Uh-huh.

574
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,074
My family, every day,
every holiday, especially holidays,

575
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,389
they watch Fox News.

576
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,800
We're like addicts.

577
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,674
Fox is how we do church.

578
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,256
You know when
they made the corner logo turn...

579
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,200
The bug.

580
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:47,877
...because folks had "Fox"
burned into their TV screens? That's us.

581
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,360
Kayla, you're not getting fired.

582
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,552
He cannot scale his anger.
He's a perpetual outrage machine.

583
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,836
That's why crazies love him.
No offense to your family.

584
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,196
You want to do the folders?
No crying at Fox.

585
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
No crying.

586
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,790
Let me explain your mistake here.

587
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,552
So, Rush is on Hannity's team.

588
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,757
They're the competition.
They're GOP party hacks.

589
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,320
So, he thinks he's way ahead of them,

590
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,556
so steal from Drudge and Breitbart,
not talk radio.

591
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,676
Okay.

592
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,400
Also, stop worrying if the story's legit.

593
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,995
If you can't source it,
just go with, "Some are saying."

594
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,516
Seriously?

595
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,119
You have to adopt
the mentality of an Irish street cop.

596
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,159
The world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

597
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,435
minorities are criminals,

598
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,239
sex is sick but interesting.

599
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,712
Ask yourself, "What would scare my
grandmother or piss off my grandfather?"

600
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,269
And that's a Fox story.
Are you writing this down?

601
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,550
It makes so much sense.

602
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,994
- Frighten, titillate.
- Right.

603
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,754
Frighten, titillate. Frighten, titillate.

604
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,776
When you're starting the story,
you need to start with a clear villain.

605
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,473
Mm-hmm.

606
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,677
Liberal judge, pinhead mayor,

607
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,956
Vermont, Hollywood.

608
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,037
Conservatives want to conserve.

609
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,079
You're the last defense against...

610
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,513
Jesus-hating, trans-loving,
Clinton-controlled Armageddon, baby.

611
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,478
Oh, come on.

612
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,359
You do believe some of that, right?

613
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Yeah.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,754
- That's quite a face you have.
- Really?

615
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Thank you.

616
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,550
- I'm drunk.
- I'm drunk as well.

617
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,229
You have a Hillary poster in your house.

618
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,634
I guess I do.

619
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,955
Okay, my parents would be horrified
if I went home with a Democrat.

620
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,591
The lesbianism, however?

621
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,677
Oh, I'm not a lesbian.

622
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm not a Democrat.

623
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,157
I just have
two giant Hillary posters in my kitchen.

624
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,393
As a joke though, right?

625
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,393
No. That's who
I'd like to be the president.

626
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,358
Are you serious?

627
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm a closeted Democrat.

628
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,400
At Fox News?

629
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,278
Oh, my God. I thought that you knew that.

630
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,159
No, I didn't know that.
Does anyone know that?

631
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,630
Can you not tell? You can't tell anyone.

632
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,560
- Of course I won't tell.
- No, I'm so serious.

633
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,118
- Can I ask something?
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,432
Why do you work at Fox?

635
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,995
Why don't you work at MSNBC or something?

636
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,077
I think I thrive in toxic environments.

637
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,800
I never know if you're kidding or not.

638
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
I am kidding.

639
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,795
I applied everywhere,
and I got a job at Fox.

640
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,432
And I keep applying to other places

641
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,433
and they keep not taking me
because I work at Fox.

642
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,240
Oh, my gosh.

643
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,029
It's okay.

644
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,117
One day I'm gonna be free.

645
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,716
What? It's not that bad.

646
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,599
If you're gay, it's pretty bad.

647
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,320
Well, yeah, you don't wanna be gay at Fox.

648
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,312
You work for Bill O'Reilly
and you have a Hillary poster?

649
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,552
You do know he likes to call up
female producers and whack off, right?

650
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,710
Bill?

651
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,200
Yes, Bill.

652
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,509
No.

653
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,416
You haven't heard about
the Andrea Mackris lawsuit?

654
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,760
- No.
- Oh, my God.

655
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,153
This should be in the welcome packet.

656
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,118
She was one of his associate producers.

657
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,350
He took her, and only her,
to the Republican National Convention.

658
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,999
Called her up at 11 p.m.,

659
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,150
touching himself

660
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,193
and telling her what he wanted
to do to her with the old falafel.

661
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Are you kidding?

662
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,713
It's on the Internet.

663
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,271
And then, quote,
"using a vibrator upon himself."

664
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,077
Like, he brought a vibrator
from home to the convention?

665
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,720
Yes, you have to bring a vibrator
from home to the convention.

666
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,516
The question is,
what does a man do with a vibrator?

667
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,197
Do you place it alongside the shaft?

668
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,874
I don't wanna hear that.

669
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,880
"Fucking die, bitch."

670
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,718
"If I see you, you better run."

671
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,751
"I wouldn't be sleeping too soundly
if I were you."

672
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,800
Trump's lit the torches.

673
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,951
You're getting security tonight.

674
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,839
All I want is for this to go away, Roger.

675
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,474
Look, every general in history
has gone into battle feeling the same.

676
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Right.

677
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,910
I'll read a statement at the top, saying,

678
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,993
"Yes, Trump is attacking me,
but I'm not going to respond."

679
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,560
Any defense will come from you.

680
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,910
Not right now.

681
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,880
You set a record on viewer e-mail.

682
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Let me guess.

683
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,279
None of it on my side.

684
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
No.

685
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,673
Our audience loves Trump.

686
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,355
A hell of a lot more
than the Murdochs realize.

687
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,033
More than Trump knows.

688
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,319
He's tweeting we made peace.

689
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,951
He'll come on <i>Fox & Friends</i> tomorrow.

690
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,992
He needs us. We need him.

691
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,434
It's got nothing to do with you.

692
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,354
All right. It's late.

693
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,999
I have dogs to feed.

694
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,274
Just to be clear...

695
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,513
I will not be kissing Trump's ass
at nine o'clock.

696
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,676
We fight tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

697
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,752
Can I see that statement again, Bill?

698
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,355
Heard there was
a dust-up involving yours truly

699
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,591
and presidential contender Donald Trump.

700
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,269
How you doing, Megyn?

701
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Hanging in there.

702
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,909
Give him hell, Megyn.

703
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,113
<i>Okay, quiet on the set.</i>

704
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,996
<i>We go live in five, four, three, two...</i>

705
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,896
I just got back from a weekend at the
beach with my husband and my three kids.

706
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,116
Did anything happen
in the news while I was gone?

707
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,113
You may have heard there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

708
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,317
and presidential contender Donald Trump.

709
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,756
Mr. Trump was upset
with a question I asked...

710
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,032
Oh. Cute baby.

711
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,680
I gotta say, I can't stand your show.

712
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,396
Oh.

713
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,238
You guys at Fox, you're doing
terrible things to our country.

714
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,998
Well, I hope that makes you feel better.

715
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,156
How you treat people you disagree with
says everything about you.

716
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,115
<i>Jesus was a white man too, you know?</i>

717
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,760
<i>It's like, he was an historical figure.</i>

718
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,280
<i>I mean, that's a verifiable fact.</i>

719
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,496
<i>As is Santa. I just want
the kids watching to know that.</i>

720
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,400
<i>But my point is, how do you just revise it
and change Santa from white to black?</i>

721
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,837
<i>I mean, you can't. Not really.</i>

722
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,594
Wow.

723
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,949
Nice dress.

724
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,756
I hope you don't wear that
to Sunday service.

725
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,797
Please. I have church jeans,

726
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,270
so I can hold a latte on my knee.

727
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,952
- Oh, my God. Kayla. Did you see this?
- What?

728
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm a creep.

729
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,032
- That is gross.
- I know.

730
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,113
I love that.

731
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Are you crazy?

732
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,636
What?

733
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,677
That's my friend from college.

734
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,353
I'm just looking out for you.

735
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,875
- Who are you stalking?
- No one.

736
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,557
I feel for you. That show.

737
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,075
Oh, his bark is worse than his bite.

738
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,640
Well, I work for Roger.

739
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,076
We have two-, three-
and four-doughnut days.

740
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,992
Sugar does make everybody crazy.

741
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,496
No, these aren't doughnuts he eats.

742
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,796
They're doughnuts he throws. At somebody.

743
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,879
No, he's a pussycat.

744
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,433
Come say hi.
We're always looking for on-air talent.

745
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,318
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

746
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Now?

747
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,676
Sure.

748
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,599
That's Roger's private elevator.

749
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,760
Hang on a sec.

750
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,234
Hello.

751
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,913
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

752
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,157
Liberals don't get Megyn.

753
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,597
She's a star
not because she thinks Santa's white,

754
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,637
- but because she'll say it.
- That's right.

755
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,595
Yeah, few have courage in the spotlight.
It's powerful to watch.

756
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,110
And she went up 30% that quarter.

757
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,237
Well, that too.

758
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,518
All audiences want is authenticity.

759
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Mmm.

760
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:36,671
For 200 years, Santa's a fat white guy.

761
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,400
- They think Santa, that's what they see.
- Right.

762
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,358
You want to change that? Fine.

763
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,478
Let's discuss it
without you calling my people racist.

764
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Exactly.

765
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,394
A liberal is somebody
who wants to live in a future

766
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,316
that he is too lazy or too arrogant
to actually create.

767
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,598
Well, in my family,
Santa's always been white

768
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,878
and, according to my granddaddy,
a communist.

769
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,511
So, that's my family.

770
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,876
So, what can I do for you, Kayla?

771
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,794
Why did you drop by to see me?

772
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,996
Well, the thing is, sir,

773
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,669
I actually started on-air during college
in Central Florida. Weather.

774
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,070
I want to convince you
that that is where I belong, Mr. Ailes.

775
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,396
I think I'd be freakin' phenomenal
on your network.

776
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,040
Well, it's Mr. Murdoch's air...

777
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,671
but I did create it. I do run it.

778
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Right.

779
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,115
You have a pretty face.

780
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,919
Here, stand up and give me a twirl.

781
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,070
Now?

782
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,152
Yeah. Just a quick spin.

783
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,799
Oh. Sure.

784
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,197
Well, that's very good.

785
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,911
Now, pull your dress up
and let me see your legs.

786
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,835
Um...

787
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,756
It's a visual medium, Kayla.

788
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Come on.

789
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,750
Higher.

790
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,480
Come on. Higher.

791
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,835
That's fine, Kayla.

792
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,719
Why don't you sit down?

793
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,796
Thank you.

794
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,829
Mm-hmm.

795
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,353
You have a great body.

796
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,510
Thank you.

797
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,949
Mr. Ailes...

798
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,991
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

799
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,151
- No, no, of course.
- ...to anyone.

800
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,674
I'm here to help my employees,

801
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,996
- not hurt them.
- It would just sound...

802
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,993
Anything that happens here, in this room,

803
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,720
is strictly between you and me.

804
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,789
- Okay.
- Of course, it cuts both ways.

805
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,549
I'm discreet...

806
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,153
but unforgiving.

807
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,316
Success in broadcast television is hard.
It's arbitrary.

808
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,995
This is the most competitive
industry on earth.

809
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,711
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,160
We could work together.

811
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,515
I could pluck you out and move you
all the way to the front of the line.

812
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,597
But I want something in return.

813
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,871
Do you know what that is, Kayla?

814
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,836
- Uh...
- Loyalty.

815
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,477
I need to know that you're loyal.

816
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,799
I need you to find a way to prove it.

817
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,030
Mm-hmm.

818
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,634
You think about that, all right?

819
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,559
So, we'll talk again?

820
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,157
Faye can show you the way out.

821
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,990
Thank you, sir.

822
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,836
Jess. Jess.

823
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,552
Something really weird just happened.

824
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,436
I just went to say hi to...

825
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,355
I just... I met...
I was invited to meet Roger.

826
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,515
I mean, nothing...

827
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,193
nothing happened.

828
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,509
Kayla.

829
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,670
It's actually better for you
if you don't involve me in this.

830
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,676
Um, 'cause they know that we're friends.

831
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,955
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,876
Okay.

833
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,791
This place is crazy.

834
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,552
No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!

835
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,717
- Jesus.
- Okay, we're here.

836
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,216
<i>His assistant's name is Rhona.</i>

837
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,959
<i>The security guard is Keith.</i>

838
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Got it.

839
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,680
Gil, last words?

840
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,638
<i>Yeah, don't piss him off. I need this job.</i>

841
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,557
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- I'll be waiting right here, okay?

842
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,674
No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!

843
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,231
No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!

844
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,120
Are you happy now, bitch?

845
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,157
<i>During the day, if I'm in the office,</i>

846
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,278
<i>I have a number of people
that I'll just call out a tweet to.</i>

847
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,396
<i>It's always my right.</i>

848
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,376
<i>You probably had
some pretty nasty tweets sent your way.</i>

849
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,696
<i>I don't want that to happen.
I have fans that really love...</i>

850
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,599
<i>But you retweet some of those.
It's notjust the fans.</i>

851
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,200
<i>But not the more nasty ones.</i>

852
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,351
<i>You would be amazed
at the ones I don't retweet.</i>

853
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,909
<i>- "Bimbo"?
- Uh...</i>

854
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,515
<i>Well, that was a retweet.
Yeah, did I say that?</i>

855
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,320
<i>- Many times.
- Okay. Excuse me.</i>

856
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,912
<i>But not the most horrible thing, you know.</i>

857
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,469
<i>Over your life, Megyn,
you've been called a lot worse.</i>

858
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,256
<i>- Is that right?</i>
- All right, that's enough.

859
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,873
<i>It's not about me. It's about the...</i>

860
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,031
Well, what do you think?

861
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,193
I think you're too solicitous.

862
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,509
Thank you.

863
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,716
But this once,
I can handle a straight-up positive.

864
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,393
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

865
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,917
He attacks you for a year straight

866
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,469
and you let him off with a fucking "oops."

867
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,916
What? I don't let him off.

868
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,357
I confront him. I used Donald Trump.

869
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,352
Honey, you absolved him.

870
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,478
Doug, there are internal
political pressures at play here as well.

871
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,279
Yeah, yeah. I bet. I get it, Gil.

872
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,114
You know what, can we have a second, guys?
Please.

873
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,478
I'm not trying to be critical.

874
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,552
Well, you are. I made this go away.

875
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,758
I stopped his harassing bullshit. For us.

876
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,150
I never asked you to do that.

877
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,074
He is going to be
the Republican candidate for president.

878
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,913
I'm a news anchor. I need access to him.

879
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,515
You need access? At what fucking price?

880
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,116
At what price?
The price of our apartment. My salary.

881
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,352
That pays our fucking bills.

882
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,840
- Look. For the record...
- No. You know what?

883
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,274
It's been a shitty year!

884
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,476
Really fucking shitty year,
and I'm allowed to want it over.

885
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,916
You are.

886
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,875
Fuck.

887
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,639
So, what I'm saying is, do we really need
AR-15s to be able to hunt deer,

888
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,836
protect our families?

889
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,159
I'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

890
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,176
Some of these mass shootings
would have been less deadly

891
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,429
if that had been the case.

892
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,831
But I'm also with the majority today,

893
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,231
taking a stand
against semiautomatic assault weapons.

894
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,136
Which brings us back
to the question of the day.

895
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,518
Should Congress reinstate
the Assault Weapons Ban?

896
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,150
I know a lot of you don't agree with me.
That's fine.

897
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,596
Huh.

898
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,517
89% of you say no.

899
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,997
And that's what makes America great.

900
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,776
Clear.

901
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,280
Great.

902
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,158
The second floor wants to see you.

903
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,430
- Now?
- Yeah.

904
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,315
This is Kayla.

905
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,794
Hi.

906
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,194
Mm-hmm.

907
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,592
Yeah. I'll come right up then.

908
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,280
Ladies.

909
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,160
Hi.

910
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,309
Phew. Hot in here.

911
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,750
Gretchen. Well, how are you?

912
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,036
Faye, I miss our lunches.

913
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,270
Mmm.

914
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,710
Roger wants to see me?

915
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,793
Oh. Uh, no, I think it was Dianne.

916
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,709
I just saw her in with Bill.

917
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,678
All right. Well...

918
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,353
See you ladies later then.

919
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,840
Bye.

920
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,240
Roger's ready for you, Kayla.

921
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Okay.

922
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,520
Never stops.

923
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,156
Gretchen, you've been such
an instrumental part of the Fox family.

924
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Absolutely.

925
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,912
We just wanted to tell you
that we appreciated the work...

926
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,480
He's firing me, isn't he?

927
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
Yes.

928
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,914
You wanna tell me why?

929
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,992
<i>What could they say?</i>

930
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,151
<i>"You're sexy, but you're too much work.</i>

931
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,475
<i>You're a man-hater.</i>

932
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,035
<i>To get ahead
you gotta give a little head."</i>

933
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,235
Good luck, Ms. Carlson.

934
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,791
<i>Do you know why
we dress soldiers the same?</i>

935
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,792
<i>So everybody knows they're replaceable.</i>

936
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,440
<i>I refuse to be replaceable.</i>

937
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,111
Well, they finally did it. I'm out.

938
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,816
- <i>Did they give you a cause?</i>
- No.

939
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,435
<i>Good. Ready to go to war?</i>

940
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,989
Oh, yeah. I'm ready.

941
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,396
Murdoch here.

942
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,016
<i>Funny. Have you seen the lawsuit?</i>

943
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,838
Which lawsuit?

944
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,636
I'm not stopping.

945
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,475
Roger's being sued for sexual harassment
by Gretchen Carlson.

946
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,829
Where's Dad?

947
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
<i>Paris.</i>

948
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,031
- Yeah.
<i>- I have your father's attorney for you.</i>

949
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Thank you.

950
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,755
<i>Morning. So, this employee
has sued Roger personally.</i>

951
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,553
He doesn't know who she is.

952
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,593
Are you familiar with Ms. Carlson?

953
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,916
No. Until two hours ago,
I'd never heard of her.

954
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,118
More importantly, no one heard from her
after she was fired.

955
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,078
Wait. Not even to negotiate a severance?

956
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,477
No. And that suggests
she knew it was coming and she had a plan.

957
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,994
<i>As News Corp attorney,</i>

958
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,915
<i>I recommend you conduct an internal
investigation into Roger's behavior.</i>

959
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,992
I know you two have had issues with him.

960
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,999
I need everyone's attention.
Listen up, people.

961
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,120
A <i>Post</i> employee
has received a package of anthrax.

962
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,874
That's just above us.
Close the goddamn vents!

963
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
All of them!

964
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,231
- Roger.
- And nobody opens the mail!

965
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,073
- Roger.
- We're under attack!

966
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,992
Roger! Hey!

967
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,117
Everything upstairs is under control.

968
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,512
You need to calm down.

969
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,479
Do not give orders in my newsroom.

970
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,677
If it were yours,

971
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,910
you'd own it.

972
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
It's okay, everyone.

973
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,191
Everything's gonna be fine.
You can go back to work.

974
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,280
Thank you.

975
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,511
Uh-huh. Yeah, let's look into her claims.

976
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,000
<i>Done.</i>

977
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

978
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,951
Oh, my God, it's Anchor Barbie.

979
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,238
I'm testing for Fox Business.

980
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,951
Holy fucking Christ!

981
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,429
I'll call you right back.

982
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,080
Pull up <i>The New York Times</i> right now.

983
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,336
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

984
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,875
- Holy shit!
- Did you see this?

985
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,270
- Jesus!
- Fuck.

986
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,589
Jesus Christ.

987
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,512
Holy shit!

988
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,750
Oh, my God.

989
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,320
<i>The Times</i>?

990
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,029
No way.

991
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,919
Josh. Get me a nice shot from Main Street.

992
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,878
- No Priuses in it.
- Right.

993
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,670
When you're photographing for my paper,
don't wear a hoodie.

994
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,915
Okay.

995
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,673
Hoodies are creepy.

996
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,920
Thank you. Thank you.

997
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,556
What is that?

998
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,109
Oh, uh, just grocery-store sushi.

999
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Mmm.

1000
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,792
Sushi's not liberal food.

1001
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,554
I... didn't say that it was.

1002
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,640
Hi, love.

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,954
<i>I'm leaving now.
Go home. I'll meet you there.</i>

1006
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,040
What?

00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,416
<i>Fox News host Gretchen Carlson</i>

1008
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,194

<i>Alleges she was fired

1013
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,880
<i>Carlson claimed in the lawsuit</i>

1014
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,597
<i>that Ailes took her off the popular
morning show</i>, Fox & Friends, <i>in 2013,</i>

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,072
<i>cut her pay and placed her

1016
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,557

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,520
No.

1022
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,520
<i>Beth, I just talked to</i> TheWrap.

1023
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,159
It's an online publication.

1024
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,479
I said, how sad it is we've got this woman
making these complaints

1025
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,950
when there are real victims out there.

1026
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,072
I know, Roger. I told <i>People</i> magazine

1027
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,200
we've been in your office alone
a lot over 15 years.

1028
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,516
I've never seen anything
like what I'm reading about.

1029
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,336
I said, "I don't think Gretchen Carlson
has a friend in the building."

1030
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,016
- I know, Roger. Someone would've told me.
- They're gonna quote me on that.

1031
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,269
Not a ring of truth.

1032
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,034
Maria Bartiromo
sent <i>Variety</i> a stock chart.

1033
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,270
- Hey, we're up.
- Whoo-hoo.

1034
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,159
Hannity tweeted, "I talked
to hundreds of women at Fox this week,

1035
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,435
both on air and off.

1036
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,040
They say it all BS."

1037
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,713
- Brit Hume, too.
- Brit?

1038
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,510
"Why didn't Gretchen quit and sue
instead of suing only after she got fired?

1039
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,829
Why didn't she complain?"

1040
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,754
- Why didn't she complain? Really?
- He means the anonymous hotline.

1041
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,797
- There's a hotline?
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,599
I did the harassment seminar twice.

1043
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,856
- I never heard about a hotline.
- Because it's bullshit.

1044
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,714
They have a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

1045
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,476
A hotline in this building
is like a complaint box in occupied Paris.

1046
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,799
It's like we're telling women,
"Go on. Speak up for yourself.

1047
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,833
Just know
the entire network is with Roger."

1048
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,639
No one will believe you.

1049
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,513
They'll call you a liar.

1050
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,434
And as for your career,
you want assignments and air time?

1051
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,354
Go ahead. Call the paranoid man
who decides your salary a pervert,

1052
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,035
and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

1053
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,874
On a phone
he has a contractual right to record.

1054
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,395
Jesus fucking Christ,
do you think women are idiots?

1055
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,039
It's like somebody stripped you naked

1056
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,158
and they want you to walk through
this office just to fucking prove it.

1057
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
Okay.

1058
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,917
Can I see you for a minute?

1059
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,759
What the fuck was that?

1060
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,599
I don't know, but I liked it.

1061
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,789
I won't call you a feminist,
but say there's a spectrum, you are...

1062
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,553
Roger harassed me.

1063
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,360
Ten years ago.

1064
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,434
I had turned down a law-firm partnership
for an entry-level job here at Fox.

1065
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,470
Roger would call me up to New York
to dangle prospects.

1066
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,629
I wanted his help.

1067
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
Did you...

1068
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,558
do anything?

1069
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,640
No.

1070
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,274
Will you talk?

1071
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,039
- Megyn?
- I don't know.

1072
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,395
I don't know.

1073
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,113
I mean, going on the record...

1074
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,915
Jesus.

1075
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,999
It's basically admitting
you're the weak one in the herd.

1076
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,754
No, it's admitting you're the hot one.

1077
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,593
It has nothing to do with that, Gil.

1078
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,080
- Say women.
- Oh, my God.

1079
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,437
Look, there is a reason
certain women can defend Roger.

1080
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,072
If I report this and it leaks, it will
follow me for the rest of my career.

1081
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,992
I don't wanna
be defined by Roger's bullshit.

1082
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,720
I refuse to be the fucking poster girl
for sexual harassment.

1083
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,998
He can't still be doing that crap, right?

1084
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,197
I mean, the man has a walker.

1085
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,678
- Viagra?
- Gil.

1086
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,075
Help me here.

1087
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,951
Please. How do I play this?

1088
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,635
Well, you only ask when you already know.

1089
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,839
If I learned anything this year,
it's to not get sucked into a fight

1090
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,435
with someone who has better reason
to be in it than you do.

1091
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,240
Okay.

1092
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,159
Okay.

1093
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,353
So, what is it you wanna do?

1094
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,920
For right now, nothing.

1095
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,554
- Good.
- Good.

1096
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,073
There she is.

1097
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,433
Hi, Roger.

1098
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,874
Hello, sweetheart.

1099
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Hi.

1100
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Sit, sit.

1101
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,753
- You've met Mayor Giuliani before?
- Of course.

1102
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,311
There's an internal investigation,
but I'm not gonna wait for it to clear me.

1103
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,199
The Republican convention
is less than two weeks away.

1104
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,749
This is bullshit. I'm gonna fight it.

1105
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,519
The charges are absurd.

1106
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,114
I'm in, Roger.

1107
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,635
I love that fate has given me
a chance to repay you

1108
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,319
for when I was in intensive care.

1109
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,757
Roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

1110
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,400
Told them he'd put me on the air
live from the hospital bed

1111
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,836
if they didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

1112
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,915
But I'm also here as someone
who has dealt with this issue for years,

1113
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,231
years on the side of women.

1114
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,636
I don't wanna see
sexual violence trivialized.

1115
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,157
I don't wanna see it become
some damn political football.

1116
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,832
In that spirit, I need to ask,

1117
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,756
will an investigation find anything,
well, uncomfortable?

1118
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,749
Well, define uncomfortable.

1119
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,200
Roger, quote,

1120
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,876
"I think you and I should have had
a sexual relationship a long time ago.

1121
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,634
And then you'd be good and better
and I'd be good and better."

1122
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,918
- Did you say that?
- No, I'm not a fool.

1123
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,799
"You missed your chance
for me to harass you"? Come on.

1124
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,519
I think they'll argue it's solicitous.

1125
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,116
Telling a woman
she was fuckable "a long time ago."

1126
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,759
Who the hell thinks that works?

1127
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,354
Why's she suing, Roger?

1128
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,957
Gretchen is a very competitive woman
facing a severe likability issue.

1129
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,198
One that I shielded her from for years.

1130
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,556
Her career's over, I'm afraid.

1131
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,896
And she can't take a joke.

1132
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,718
Roger is very salty.

1133
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,714
I find it amusing.
It's my fault. I encourage it.

1134
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,992
James Murdoch could be behind this.

1135
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,197
His wife openly supports Hillary.

1136
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,396
And it could go deeper.

1137
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,958
I have good reason to believe

1138
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,192
that inside the Obama White House
there have been discussions,

1139
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,272
on what level I do not know...

1140
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,474
of having me killed.

1141
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,320
Oh, Jesus.

1142
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,755
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

1143
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,036
Roger needs you.

1144
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,593
Your silence is being noticed.

1145
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,471
Well, the whole point of an investigation
is to find the truth, Jeanine.

1146
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,597
Until that happens,
I don't have a lot to say.

1147
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,916
If this charge sticks,

1148
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,478
the working assumption will be
every woman at Fox got down on her knees.

1149
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,560
Even you.

1150
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,751
If we sweep this thing under the rug,
Jeanine, and it happens again,

1151
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,399
under Title Seven,

1152
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,632
Fox will be liable
for compensatory and punitive damages.

1153
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,632
That could be hundreds of millions.

1154
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,076
Let's worry about the law
before we do the PR, okay?

1155
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,919
Does Roger want us?

1156
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,674
Yes. He's a man.

1157
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,233
He also gave us time.

1158
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,232
He gave us opportunity.

1159
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,232
We benefited from that kind of attention.

1160
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,598
I mean, Jeanine Pirro?

1161
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,434
She's the founding member of Team Roger.

1162
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,989
- You're not answering your phone.
- No, I'm holding it.

1163
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,594
Everybody's still looking for you.

1164
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,117
Where were any of these people
to defend me from Trump?

1165
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,475
Bill Shine told them not to.

1166
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,190
What the fuck?

1167
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,796
Our boss.

1168
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,839
Why are you guys in the hall?

1169
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,436
I got a call from Roger's lawyer
saying to, quote, "relax."

1170
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,480
They're convincing Rupert to limit the
investigation to Gretchen and her team.

1171
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,074
That's only five or six women.

1172
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,112
Are you gonna let that happen?

1173
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,676
I like Roger. I do.

1174
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,876
I know.

1175
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,350
Even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

1176
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,160
Those sins aren't really the problem, Meg.

1177
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,836
I mean, there were hundreds of stories
of Roger paying an employee's rehab,

1178
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,151
or keeping somebody terminally ill
on payroll.

1179
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,074
You remember when Shep came out.

1180
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,755
All Roger said was,
"I don't care where you put your pecker,

1181
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,536
as long as you don't
tell me where to put mine."

1182
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,234
Again, not the most redeeming.

1183
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,558
He promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

1184
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,439
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation.

1185
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,876
He handed me the power to hurt him.

1186
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,079
- Morning.
<i>- Hi, Megyn.</i>

1187
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,879
We need to get
Gerson Zweifach on the phone.

1188
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,872
<i>Gerson, I'm calling for Roger.</i>

1189
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,872
<i>He wants me
to be part of your investigation.</i>

1190
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,633
We've decided on an outside firm.

1191
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,316
No, why?
Gerson, we can handle this ourselves.

1192
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,960
- I'm asking Paul/Weiss.
<i>- Paul/Weiss?</i>

1193
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,033
You tell them
that I can actively participate.

1194
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,079
Mr. Giuliani,
you're an old friend of Roger.

1195
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,230
You married them.

1196
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,030
<i>Sharing information with you will remove
the cloak of attorney-client privilege,</i>

1197
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:59,353
making the testimony of any woman
who comes forward subject to discovery.

1198
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,830
I understand. You get me a waiver.

1199
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,914
I will not structure this investigation
so Roger isn't perceived of as its target.

1200
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,480
<i>You want him to look guilty?</i>

1201
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,794
Well, that depends on what we find.

1202
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,080
You know a reporter, Gabe Sherman?

1203
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,837
- No.
- You're about to.

1204
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,958
He's found six women
who claim Roger Ailes harassed them.

1205
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,595
All from before Roger founded Fox News.

1206
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,515
<i>This was years ago.</i>

1207
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,276
<i>He said he would put me on the show,
but I had to go to bed with him.</i>

1208
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,432
<i>And I just said,
"Yeah, right. You and who else?"</i>

1209
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,514
<i>And he said, "Just me
and a few of my preferred friends."</i>

1210
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,160
<i>I came in and he closed the door,
turned, and kissed me.</i>

1211
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,833
<i>Like I was his girlfriend.</i>

1212
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,354
<i>Like he knew it was coming.</i>

1213
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,233
<i>He grabbed my tits and he said,</i>

1214
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,631
<i>"Look, no girl gets a job here
unless they're cooperative."</i>

1215
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,754
<i>"If you wanna make it
in New York City in the TV business,</i>

1216
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,274
<i>you're gonna have to fuck me.</i>

1217
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,920
<i>And you're gonna have to do that
with anyone I tell you to."</i>

1218
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,477
<i>He finishes the test,
which is me pretending to cook,</i>

1219
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,677
<i>then he pulls out a garter belt
and stockings</i>

1220
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,433
<i>and says, "Put these on."</i>

1221
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,479
<i>So, yeah, well, I put them on.</i>

1222
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,474
<i>And he said,
"You know, I can really help you,</i>

1223
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,634
<i>but if you wanna play with the big boys,
you have to lay with the big boys."</i>

1224
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,518
<i>It was very transactional.</i>

1225
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,552
<i>It was quiet. He stared at me.</i>

1226
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,757
<i>He undid his pants</i>

1227
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,117
<i>and took out his penis very gingerly.</i>

1228
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,637
<i>I had never seen one. I was scared.</i>

1229
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,875
<i>Then he said, "Kiss it."</i>

1230
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,153
<i>I was 16.</i>

1231
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,360
<i>Former anchor Gretchen Carlson</i>

1232
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,400
<i>filing a sexual-harassment lawsuit
against Fox News chief Roger Ailes.</i>

1233
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,960
<i>More women are coming forward.</i>

1234
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,635
<i>Ailes is denying the allegations
and getting some high-profile...</i>

1235
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,856
<i>The accusations
against Roger Ailes...</i>

1236
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,758
<i>I have never run
a goddamn Dairy Queen.</i>

1237
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,151
<i>You don't get to go
and get whatever you want.</i>

1238
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,358
<i>Everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency,</i>

1239
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,511
<i>and I do mean everybody.</i>

1240
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,037
A TV outfit needs tough, confident women.

1241
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,555
Do I push them? You bet your ass I do.

1242
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,553
But have I ever demanded sex
during a casting session?

1243
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,917
Have I offered extra pay for blow jobs?

1244
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,720
Give me a goddamn break!
Why the hell would I do that?

1245
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,480
You know the look in a woman's eye
when she's interested.

1246
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,792
Walk into casting
back then as the decider.

1247
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,519
There was a look they gave.

1248
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,831
I did not always look like this.

1249
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,593
I never had to harass anybody

1250
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,149
and it's fucking offensive
to say that I did!

1251
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,879
Well, they're trying to change history.

1252
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,960
For their families.

1253
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,350
Some of them probably
don't even remember what happened.

1254
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,551
That's gracious of you, Beth.

1255
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,800
But this is political.

1256
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,832
I defy you to find any evidence

1257
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,389
that a single part
of what these women are saying is true.

1258
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,231
Get ready. More will come.

1259
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,915
We need to let Rupert know
what it means if I lose.

1260
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,118
Gretchen Carlson could kill Fox News.

1261
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,396
This is a fight for your jobs.

1262
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,073
If I go, you go!

1263
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,960
If you'd asked me what type of
sexual fetish Roger Ailes had,

1264
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,840
I never would have come up with
garter belts, but it's fucking perfect.

1265
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,798
Their stories are so similar.

1266
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,996
That doesn't prove much.

1267
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,072
Sherman met them all
through Gretchen's lawyer.

1268
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,197
They could have been coached.

1269
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,033
The blow job thing feels real to me.

1270
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,716
Does Roger seem like a guy who would
get off on that particular power dynamic?

1271
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,800
Yes.

1272
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,998
A guy who maybe thinks
oral doesn't really count? Maybe.

1273
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,677
A guy who has reasons to prefer a sex act
that lets him keep his clothes on?

1274
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,240
Sure.

1275
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,879
Still doesn't make it true.

1276
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,194
Well, if true, these incidents
all happened before Fox started.

1277
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,276
Should that matter?

1278
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,396
No.

1279
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,480
Yes.

1280
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,760
I talked to Gerson Zweifach.

1281
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,876
And?

1282
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,833
He asked me to encourage women
who have claims to come forward.

1283
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,118
You remember what happened last time
you got between Rupert and Roger?

1284
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,596
Before I speak out,

1285
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,434
I need to know if this happened
to other women at Fox.

1286
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,800
You understand that?

1287
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,152
Is this one where you really wanna know,

1288
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,675
or you wanna look like
you really wanna know but don't?

1289
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,240
I really wanna know.

1290
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,796
I'm not always like that.

1291
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,792
No one around here believes
Roger would want to harass Gretchen.

1292
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,475
I will send you
some of her soapy notes to Roger.

1293
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,640
"Last night Sandra filled in for Megyn.
Why not me? Smiley face."

1294
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,633
Who sends a harasser a smiley face?

1295
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,640
Martin.

1296
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:58,951
- Hey, Nancy. Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1297
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,120
Hi, Nancy. Coffee?

1298
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,078
Thank you.

1299
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,553
So, what do you got?

1300
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,193
So, no one from Fox has come forward.

1301
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,760
No one?

1302
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,840
Rudi Bakhtiar.

1303
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,239
But no one who's still there?

1304
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,915
There's been nothing but praise for Roger.

1305
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,151
Except from Megyn Kelly.

1306
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,360
She's been unusually silent.

1307
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,797
Right. Well, something must've happened
to Megyn in the past with Roger.

1308
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,839
She's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1309
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,990
Possibly.

1310
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,520
Should you call?

1311
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,559
Tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1312
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,552
Megyn, share?

1313
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,154
No. She wouldn't do it.

1314
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,152
- What makes you say that?
- Because I wouldn't.

1315
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,392
I mean, Roger plays his women
off against each other.

1316
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,712
He's always done it. He'll say, "Megyn
thinks that Lisa should get your spot."

1317
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,110
Or, "Megyn suspects
that you're screwing Cal."

1318
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,320
And then he'll offer advice on how to
get back at her, as if you brought it up.

1319
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,914
She's renegotiating her deal.

1320
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,317
I can think of roughly 15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1321
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,392
We do need some collaboration.

1322
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,279
Well, that would certainly help
with the other networks.

1323
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,272
Oh, God. What?

1324
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,240
What, Marty?

1325
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,349
Well, we've not had
a lot of incoming job interests from them.

1326
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,120
What's not a lot?

1327
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,720
None.

1328
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,800
They're afraid of Roger.

1329
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,080
No.

1330
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,951
No woman gets to sue her boss.

1331
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,034
Rule number one of corporate America,
you don't sue your boss.

1332
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,755
I jumped off a cliff.

1333
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,831
I thought one of them would stand with me.

1334
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,360
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, we're home.

1335
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,440
God.

1336
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:50,875
Hey, honey.

1337
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,360
There's a snack in the kitchen.

1338
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,556
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1339
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,514
We're gonna get him.

1340
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,696
Megyn doesn't want to release
a statement.

1341
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,951
It could be seen
as influencing the investigation.

1342
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,760
Have her say that to Roger's face.

1343
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,277
Look, let us know
who else hasn't spoken up for him,

1344
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,717
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1345
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,759
No! Jesus.
We need our anchors. We need her.

1346
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,560
Let me talk to her.

1347
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,839
Yes, please.

1348
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,477
Look, sweetheart.
This is an island of safety and truth.

1349
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,631
I wear pants.

1350
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,479
No one has ever told me not to wear pants.

1351
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,712
I wear pants.
I'd love to know where that came from.

1352
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,874
It's obnoxious. It's toxic.
We need everyone on Team Roger.

1353
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,960
Everyone.

1354
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,759
- Hi.
- Good morning.

1355
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,960
Come on.

1356
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,920
No one makes me wear short skirts.

1357
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,038
He was the first to put a female on
as host of a prime-time show.

1358
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,311
Roger Ailes champions women.

1359
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,312
No. There is no leg cam.

1360
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,471
No. Could you just hold on for one sec?

1361
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,232
Maggie? I have to wear pants tomorrow.

1362
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,960
Not without authorization
from the second floor you don't.

1363
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,633
We never fitted her for pants!

1364
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,096
You can print whatever story you like,
but there is no leg cam.

1365
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,270
Lily?

1366
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,238
Beth needs me to talk to Megyn.

1367
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,754
I'm gonna do an on-air statement

1368
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,336
while all the Fox women come out
one by one behind me for Roger.

1369
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,874
That will never happen.

1370
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,993
Ains?

1371
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:35,439
Hm. Well, you know why Roger's got
that door blocking his office?

1372
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,395
Well, yeah, 'cause a Bangladeshi from
Accounting wandered in one day by mistake.

1373
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,119
Hm. Please.

1374
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,920
It's so girls can come in from
the back elevator and no one sees 'em.

1375
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,230
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1376
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,234
We get talent coming here all the time
looking to get their faces done.

1377
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,676
"I'm going to see Roger.
I gotta look my best."

1378
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,599
Yeah. One came back out
with it rubbed off her nose and chin.

1379
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,590
Who was that?

1380
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,160
My memory's horrible.

1381
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,952
You should go see Janice in Weather.

1382
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,072
I mean, nobody wants to talk.

1383
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,910
Can you blame them?

1384
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,514
No.

1385
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,954
Where'd you disappear to?

1386
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,400
I've got names.

1387
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,352
Women rumored to have stories about Roger.

1388
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,397
- From who?
- Janice.

1389
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,234
- Weather Janice?
- Everybody confides in her.

1390
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,720
Nobody from Weather wants your job.

1391
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,256
- What are you gonna do with them?
- Tell them this time's different.

1392
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,636
- Wait.
- No, don't wait. Don't listen to him.

1393
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,235
Look, it's not only your job here.

1394
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,279
I got kids, okay? Lily has a baby now.

1395
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,034
Julia'll lose her visa
and have to go back to Canada.

1396
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,919
And we know that
you've been talking to broadcast networks.

1397
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,674
Yeah, you can get a job anywhere.
But we can't.

1398
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,880
And no offense,
but who the hell will you be?

1399
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,752
Nobody leaves Fox, Megyn.

1400
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,840
Not really.

1401
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,276
It's in your DNA now.

1402
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,558
So, think about
what you're blowing up here.

1403
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,791
I say find the truth.

1404
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,951
Well, that face tells me nothing.

1405
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,354
Well, if they come after you,
it won't be you they come after.

1406
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,280
<i>Gretchen Carlson,
your old colleague at Fox News,</i>

1407
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,589
<i>has issued some allegations,</i>

1408
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,912
<i>some sexual-harassment allegations
over your boss, Roger Ailes.</i>

1409
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,761
<i>What is your position on this?
What did you think when you heard this?</i>

1410
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,670
<i>In this country, every famous,
powerful or wealthy person is a target.</i>

1411
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,240
<i>You're a target. I'm a target.</i>

1412
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:48,031
<i>Anytime, somebody could come out
and sue us, attack us,</i>

1413
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,576
<i>go to the press or anything like that.</i>

1414
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,319
<i>And that's a deplorable situation.</i>

1415
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,235
<i>I've worked for Roger Ailes for 20 years.
Best boss I've ever had.</i>

1416
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,312
Well, I've never been told
what I can't wear.

1417
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,353
Well, I know you didn't ask,
but I think it needs to be said.

1418
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,717
It's a very confusing time right now.

1419
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,393
Tonight is Manhattanhenge.

1420
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,075
Sunset will align perfectly
with the city's grid.

1421
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,677
The best viewing streets are 14th, 34th
and 57th. Good day, New York.

1422
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,816
And clear.

1423
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,160
- See you tomorrow, Jimmy.
- Yep. Have a good one.

1424
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,799
A babe with no geezer?
This can't be a Fox affiliate.

1425
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,918
Megyn. My God. How are you?

1426
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,434
Good. How about you?

1427
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,318
Good. How's your mom?

1428
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,835
She's good.
She's training to be a security guard.

1429
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,071
Is that because of the Trump stuff,
or is that...

1430
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,629
No. She just wants a job
where she gets to carry a gun.

1431
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,791
So, did you come up here
to talk about Roger?

1432
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,312
What would make you say that?

1433
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,279
I've been at local for two years,
nobody's ever come to see me.

1434
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,435
You miss us?

1435
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,951
The network I worked at for 14 years?

1436
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,874
That my dad helped build?
Where my brother's a reporter?

1437
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,154
Juliet, did Roger ever...

1438
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,680
No.

1439
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,480
I heard things, but nothing firsthand.

1440
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,275
Good.

1441
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,079
- I miss you.
- I miss you more.

1442
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,436
- We should go have a drink.
- Yes.

1443
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,596
Um...

1444
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,955
Roger...

1445
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,553
he... he has detectives on staff.

1446
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,040
Up on 14.

1447
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,559
They look into enemies, follow them,
post negative stories online.

1448
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,040
It's called the Black Room.

1449
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,759
I don't want you in danger, all right?

1450
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,718
No, no. I'm not talking about me.

1451
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,234
I'm talking about you.

1452
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,398
Be careful who you ask questions
about Roger Ailes.

1453
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,277
My lawyers are negotiating with Fox.

1454
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,118
Not that Bill will pay any of it.

1455
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,759
Bill?

1456
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,035
O'Reilly.

1457
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,636
And Jack.

1458
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,076
Jesus.

1459
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Sorry.

1460
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,272
Fish rots from the head.

1461
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,198
I'm gonna talk to the outside firm
investigating this, Paul/Weiss.

1462
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,711
I heard you had some issues over here.

1463
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,516
I did.

1464
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,114
If you have a name to give.

1465
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,710
Roger.

1466
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,392
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't think it was safe.

1467
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,910
Roger.

1468
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,879
<i>Jack. Roger. Roger.</i>

1469
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,110
<i>Doug. Roger. Jack.</i>

1470
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,271
<i>Roger. Francisco. Doug. Bill. Jack.</i>

1471
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,397
<i>Jack. Francisco. Bill. Roger. Roger.</i>

1472
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,520
It's Kayla, right?

1473
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,280
Yeah.

1474
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,272
- Hi.
- Hi.

1475
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Megyn.

1476
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,715
I know.

1477
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,550
You used to work with Gretchen, right?

1478
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,640
Mm-hmm.

1479
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,393
Did you learn a lot from her?

1480
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,199
I did, yes.

1481
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,920
I have nothing but good things
to say about her.

1482
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,036
That's great.

1483
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,872
You know, I always find it so interesting

1484
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,158
who history chooses
to do something important.

1485
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,280
I guess.

1486
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,673
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

1487
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,790
I wanted to ask you
if Roger is harassing you.

1488
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
How did you know?

1489
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,560
We find each other.

1490
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,240
You too?

1491
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,550
Long time ago.

1492
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,640
Wow.

1493
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,120
You okay?

1494
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,719
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,431
You should report Roger.

1496
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,715
You'll be protected.

1497
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
Did you?

1498
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,199
I took it to his superior.

1499
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,760
Nothing happened. I had to drop it.

1500
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:41,990
Why?

1501
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,074
I wanted to be on television.

1502
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,632
Did you think
what your silence would mean?

1503
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,151
For us? The rest of us?

1504
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,231
Roger is not my fault.

1505
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,630
It would've been nice if...

1506
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,634
if somebody told us
that he's after more than legs.

1507
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,510
It's nobody's job to protect you, Kayla.

1508
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,671
That's all of our job.

1509
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,956
I don't get you. You're...

1510
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,554
You have power.

1511
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,951
Why are you still playing by old rules?
You're Megyn Kelly.

1512
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,832
Look around, snowflake.

1513
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,069
How do you think I succeeded?

1514
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,998
How do you think a woman
gets a prime-time Fox show?

1515
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,594
So, you had sex with him?

1516
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,070
Jesus fucking Christ.

1517
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,616
<i>One thing to keep in mind
about the prospect</i>

1518
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,600
<i>of Indiana governor, Mike Pence,
becoming Donald Trump's running mate...</i>

1519
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,880
Hello.

1520
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,593
Hey, it's me.

1521
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,037
Oh, my God. What the fuck? Kayla.

1522
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,278
<i>It said "Bill" in my phone. What the fuck?</i>

1523
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:10,152
Sorry. I saved my number
under his name in your phone as a joke.

1524
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,914
<i>- I forgot.</i>
- Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

1525
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,198
I had a heart attack.

1526
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,794
<i>Where are you?</i>

1527
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,191
Uh, I'm on a date.

1528
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,954
Oh. Okay.

1529
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,040
<i>Hey. Did you, um...</i>

1530
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,676
Did you give my name
to Megyn by any chance?

1531
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,832
I... I may have, um...

1532
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,750
worried about you out loud once or twice.

1533
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,069
Why didn't you just...

1534
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,640
support me?

1535
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,279
<i>I don't even know.</i>

1536
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,558
I don't... I just...
I couldn't do anything. And I...

1537
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:53,149
I can't fuck up
because I'm a lesbian at Fox News.

1538
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So?

1539
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,391
So, who's your date with, Kayla?

1540
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,436
<i>I can'tjust go on a date with a dude
and make it go away, you know?</i>

1541
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,640
I think I'm...

1542
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,238
I think I'm gonna call Paul/Weiss.

1543
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,596
Okay. That's good.

1544
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,560
<i>That's... That's really good.
I'm really glad you're doing that.</i>

1545
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,519
<i>I think that's absolutely
what you should do.</i>

1546
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,273
Okay, great.

1547
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,000
<i>I just, um... I just...</i>

1548
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,878
I didn't... I...

1549
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,792
I can't call anyone else and I just...

1550
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:43,114
I need someone right now
to tell me that that's what I should do.

1551
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,270
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

1552
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,797
I heard it was, like, an outside firm
and they're taking it really seriously.

1553
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,917
Okay, great. Thanks.

1554
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,873
Kayla.

1555
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,920
<i>What happened?</i>

1556
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,395
I did it.

1557
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,154
I, um... I...

1558
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,152
I did it. I gave in to him.

1559
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,760
<i>Kayla, I... I...</i>

1560
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,034
I'm so sorry.

1561
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,116
He kept talking.
He just kept talking.

1562
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,554
He kept saying...

1563
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,960
"Good girl.

1564
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,037
That's a good girl. Be a good soldier.

1565
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,559
Earn your place."

1566
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,915
Fuck.

1567
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,878
<i>He didn't even...</i>

1568
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,679
Didn't even unbuckle.

1569
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,235
He couldn't get...

1570
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,477
I feel so filthy.

1571
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,755
<i>No, Kayla.</i>

1572
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,797
You didn't do anything wrong.

1573
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,556
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1574
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,634
I better go.

1575
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,440
Roger can sense vulnerabilities.

1576
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,758
In those days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

1577
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,516
mixed with good advice
and comments like...

1578
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,559
The most basic thing is confidence.

1579
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,871
Feel at home in your own skin.

1580
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,395
If you're confident, you're sexy.

1581
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,520
I'm sure you have some sexy bras.
I'd love to see you in those.

1582
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,000
It was a cat-and-mouse game.

1583
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,436
But he always gave me good advice,
and let me deflect...

1584
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,754
tell him to dream on.

1585
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,839
The more I let him get away with...

1586
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,993
the more he pushed my buttons.

1587
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,599
<i>I don't know
if women can be good interviewers.</i>

1588
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,435
Men have that killer instinct.

1589
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,354
We do bad things.

1590
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,750
And we do not feel guilty about it.

1591
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,679
How can I be sure
you have that kind of drive?

1592
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,392
Finally, in January...

1593
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,630
This is '06?

1594
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,720
Yes.

1595
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,473
He grabbed me.

1596
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,473
Tried to kiss me.

1597
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,319
I pushed him away twice.

1598
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,959
<i>As I was leaving, he asked,</i>

1599
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,713
<i>"When's your contract up?"</i>

1600
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,472
After the third time, I left.

1601
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,439
And he never tried anything again?

1602
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,670
No.

1603
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,071
I ignored his calls. Stayed in DC.

1604
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,594
Two years later, I had a show.

1605
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,754
Any long-term consequences?

1606
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,400
Yeah, um...

1607
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,912
Am I Witness W?

1608
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,354
Yes.

1609
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,480
Why?

1610
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,152
It's the 23rd letter in the alphabet.

1611
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,671
Have 22 other women come forward
since I first spoke to you?

1612
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
Have they?

1613
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,030
Will there be more?

1614
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,736
<i>A major bombshell
this morning.</i>

1615
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,514
<i>Star anchor, Megyn Kelly
has informed lawyers</i>

1616
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,116
<i>that Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes,
sexually harassed her.</i>

1617
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,954
<i>For her to level these allegations
is devastating against Ailes.</i>

1618
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,396
<i>We are seeing
the end of an era at Fox News.</i>

1619
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,512
<i>The dagger in his heart, in some ways,</i>

1620
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,071
<i>was the notion that Megyn Kelly
was among his accusers.</i>

1621
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,880
What?

1622
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,679
Yes. Yes.

1623
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,437
Roger, what's the matter?

1624
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,160
- Megyn's claiming I harassed her.
- What?

1625
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,429
You saw Gabe Sherman's post?

1626
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,477
James has been feeding him bullshit.

1627
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,835
Comb through Megyn's press.

1628
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,151
Find every single positive thing
she's said about me

1629
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,720
and get it out, now.

1630
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,032
Roger, I can't discredit
an anchor I'm paid to promote.

1631
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,755
Glad I'm not in a foxhole with you.

1632
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,799
Well, we'll leak something
to Breitbart or to Drudge.

1633
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,030
I'm sorry, Roger.

1634
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,873
Well, do something!

1635
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,156
At least get some shit
about Gretchen out there.

1636
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,033
These women are trying to fuck me!

1637
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,336
I have no answers for you
that you don't already know.

1638
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,840
It's out of my hands at this point.

1639
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,389
We will be e-mailing you guys.
Please just hold tight.

1640
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,320
Thanks.

1641
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,996
Hey, Gil.

1642
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,196
Hey, Greta.

1643
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,794
What's Megyn's endgame?

1644
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,993
This part of her contract negotiation?

1645
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,596
It's not economic.

1646
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,280
Or political.

1647
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,880
Okay, Gil.

1648
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,275
No, this is scaring me.

1649
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,034
It's like the whole world's on fire
and no one can be trusted.

1650
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,430
- Hey, Geraldo. CNN, line six.
- Can't talk.

1651
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,920
These are the end-times.

1652
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,799
- Why aren't you on the phone?
- To comment on sexual harassment?

1653
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,439
We work for Bill.

1654
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,636
Team Roger.

1655
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,915
Hey. We need you to wear it.

1656
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,390
- No.
- Are you kidding?

1657
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,960
- Doesn't she have a job?
- Get it on.

1658
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,275
Megyn Kelly has no comment.

1659
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,476
She's traveling.

1660
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,550
To Cleveland.

1661
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,552
For the Republican convention, remember?

1662
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,158
Look, I've known him for 40 years,

1663
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,630
and he's about as flirty
as the grizzly from <i>The Revenant.</i>

1664
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:35,915
Let me tell you something.

1665
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,959
I called these allegations sick
because they are sick.

1666
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,520
Hey, why wasn't I let in on the pact?

1667
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,240
What pact?

1668
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,836
Breitbart is saying there's a pact
among our top 50 on-air talents

1669
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,296
- that if Roger gets fired, we all walk.
- Great. Where do I sign?

1670
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,674
Wait, I never heard of a pact.

1671
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,760
Me either.

1672
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,436
Roger placed it.

1673
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,434
Fake news.

1674
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,520
Come on.

1675
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,512
<i>How bad does it look for Roger?</i>

1676
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,240
<i>Bad.</i>

1677
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,953
Doesn't feel like I imagined it would.

1678
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,993
<i>Gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.</i>

1679
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,434
Yes, I did.

1680
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,120
Mom?

1681
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,790
I think it's time we finish this.

1682
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,678
<i>Okay. I'll let you know.</i>

1683
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,634
Mom, are you done with that?

1684
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,080
Mm-hmm. I'm done.

1685
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,514
I made the Murdochs 1.5 billion
in profit last year.

1686
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,600
Pure profit.

1687
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,594
Fox News is the most successful
cable franchise in history.

1688
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,194
Gretchen Carlson's lawyers.

1689
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,114
She wants to settle.

1690
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,476
It's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

1691
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,392
without Rupert's money behind you.

1692
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,600
Hey, Ken.

1693
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,960
Ken.

1694
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,039
- Hey! Look who's here.
- Oh, my gosh!

1695
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,271
- I brought you some small people.
- Yard! Yatesy!

1696
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,751
- I've missed you guys so much.
- We practiced that scare for two weeks.

1697
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,030
Look at you.

1698
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,395
- Hi.
- Hi.

1699
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,871
- I love you, Mama.
- My little chubble-wubbles.

1700
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,917
- We got her.
- All right.

1701
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,992
She was so scared.

1702
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,080
- Ah.
- Thank you.

1703
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,719
How are you, sweetheart?

1704
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,350
I'm either damned for doing it
or damned for not doing it sooner.

1705
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,150
Tell me my big mouth didn't ruin our life.

1706
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,760
Not yet.

1707
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,711
Can I speak to Roger alone, please?

1708
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,720
Are you sure you want Beth here?

1709
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,280
Well, of course.

1710
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,236
Gretchen taped your conversations.

1711
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,354
That's a goddamn lie.

1712
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,755
For over a year.

1713
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,076
But...

1714
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,554
you don't believe her?

1715
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,678
Your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from tapes.

1716
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,190
Wha...

1717
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,399
Why didn't they tell us before?

1718
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,392
So you'd issue complete denials.

1719
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,392
So you'd have no credibility.

1720
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,078
Apparently, she did her homework.

1721
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,954
<i>God bless our next President,
Donald Trump,</i>

1722
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,795
<i>and God bless
the United States of America!</i>

1723
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,720
<i>USA!</i>

1724
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,871
Mr. Giuliani's fired up.

1725
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,076
When we come back,

1726
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,550
we'll discuss his speech
with the man who helped write it.

1727
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,349
Clear.

1728
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,194
- <i>Don't react, okay?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

1729
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,350
<i>Roger's out.</i>

1730
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,320
Is that sourced, Gil?

1731
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,914
<i>Yeah. The New York Post.</i>

1732
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,194
<i>They put him on the cover.</i>

1733
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,839
<i>Rupert's telling him to let go.</i>

1734
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,110
Then it's a scoop.

1735
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,080
<i>We're gonna win.
We're gonna win so big.</i>

1736
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,873
<i>Thank you very much, everybody.</i>

1737
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,953
There is some breaking news tonight
in the worlds of media and politics.

1738
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,713
A blockbuster shakeup at Fox News.

1739
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,280
A dramatic fall from grace.

1740
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,716
Roger Ailes is out as top boss.

1741
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,976
They want us to circle the block.

1742
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,195
No. Hold on.

1743
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,518
- What's going on?
- Go around.

1744
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,998
I've been shut out.

1745
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,636
<i>It's true.</i>

1746
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,996
Everything Gretchen said, it's all true.

1747
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,150
Roger lied to me.

1748
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,357
Why? Because I'm a manager here,

1749
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,750
so I have concerns
my public defense of Roger

1750
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,513
could be construed as coercive.

1751
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,592
Hey. Huh. Pants.

1752
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,240
Fuck off, Neil.

1753
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1754
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,840
No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

1755
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,156
Appreciate you driving up here, Roger.

1756
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,276
Susan Estrich.

1757
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,360
Susan.

1758
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,435
I hate that it's come to this.

1759
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,874
Me too.

1760
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,597
We gave these women jobs.

1761
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,476
Put them on the air, made them famous.

1762
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,434
Do you think for a goddamn second
I did any damage to any of them?

1763
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,954
No, you don't.

1764
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,994
You don't, Rupert.

1765
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,953
There's no audience
for that side of the story.

1766
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,556
To begin with,

1767
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,314
half this you already owe him
from last year's bonus.

1768
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,153
And we're paying it.

1769
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,833
And paying off your contract.

1770
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,149
Consider yourself lucky.

1771
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,596
It's a contractual obligation.

1772
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,837
I created the Murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

1773
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,592
A third of your margin.

1774
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,351
There are three of you.

1775
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,036
I guess that means I pay for the food
that one of you puts in your mouth.

1776
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,755
What if it's you?

1777
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,479
I'd have fired you for cause.

1778
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,520
Roger, you built an amazing business.

1779
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,592
No one can take that away from you.

1780
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,519
But under the circumstances,

1781
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,273
this is a lot of money.

1782
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,397
And it won't look good to the people
that don't know your worth.

1783
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,520
Take it.

1784
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,873
Honor your non-compete.

1785
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,199
I never cared about the money.

1786
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,629
We know, Roger.

1787
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Okay.

1788
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:11,960
Okay.

1789
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,637
I'd like to go to the newsroom with you.

1790
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,040
I'd like us to announce
my leaving together.

1791
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,160
No.

1792
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,635
The end of the leg man.

1793
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,999
I won't miss him.

1794
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,920
Boys.

1795
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,872
Hope you two know what you're doing.

1796
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,191
Once Roger's office
is cleared of handguns, I'll move in.

1797
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,715
I'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

1798
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,390
Donald.

1799
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,320
How's our speech coming?

1800
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,596
Yeah.

1801
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:21,194
<i>Megyn's gotta go!
Ho, ho, ho!</i>

1802
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,397
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

1803
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,080
<i>Megyn's gotta go!</i>

1804
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,136
- Please.
- Convention's downstairs, folks.

1805
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,256
- What's going on at Fox?
- Would you say people are shocked?

1806
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,680
Can Rupert afford to dump Roger?

1807
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,672
What did he do to you? Megyn. Come on!

1808
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,912
<i>Of all the ways this could end,
I didn't see this one coming.</i>

1809
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,591
<i>Gretchen Carlson got the Murdochs
to put the rights of women above profit,</i>

1810
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,313
<i>if only temporarily.</i>

1811
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,439
<i>And I found myself
with a job I didn't want</i>

1812
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,279
<i>or couldn't really leave...</i>

1813
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,714
<i>even when I did.</i>

1814
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,559
You should keep that out.

1815
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,736
People, can I get your attention, please?

1816
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,036
Mr. Murdoch is joining us today.

1817
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,160
He has a very important statement
he'd like to say.

1818
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,518
Excuse me, everyone.

1819
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,829
I won't take long.

1820
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,558
Roger Ailes is leaving Fox.

1821
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,360
Now, I want to start by thanking Roger

1822
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:21,080
for his remarkable contribution

1823
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,436
to our company and to our country.

1824
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,715
Twenty years ago...

1825
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,672
<i>Here's the thing about
being sexually harassed at work.</i>

1826
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,273
<i>It condemns you to questions.</i>

1827
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,400
<i>You keep asking yourself,</i>

1828
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,749
<i>"What did I do?</i>

1829
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,710
<i>What did I say?</i>

1830
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,193
<i>What did I wear?</i>

1831
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,396
<i>What did I miss?</i>

1832
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,040
<i>Am I seen as weak?</i>

1833
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,672
<i>Will they say I'm after money?</i>

1834
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,950
<i>Will they say I'm after attention?</i>

1835
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,560
<i>Will I be left out?</i>

1836
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,234
<i>Will I be defined by this
for the rest of my life?"</i>

1837
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,117
I will take over
as Chairman and acting CEO

1838
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,318
with the support of our
existing management team,

1839
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,073
under Bill Shine.

1840
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,959
<i>If I stay, do I just
have to put up with it?</i>

1841
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,999
<i>Will the next place be different?</i>

1842
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,596
<i>Or can I make it different?</i>

1843
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,199
<i>Roger always said, "Everyone
on television only has one real job.</i>

1844
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,555
<i>To be likable."</i>

1845
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,393
<i>Well, I don't care if you like me,</i>

1846
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,918
<i>only that you believe me.</i>

1847
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,592
<i>A lot of people, even women,</i>

1848
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,592
<i>are skeptical of harassment claims</i>

1849
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:07,799
<i>until they experience it themselves,
or know someone who has.</i>

1850
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,997
Let me be that person for you.

1851
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,192
As you can see, it's 20 million.

1852
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,790
Plus the apology.

1853
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,400
Correct.

1854
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,355
I can't believe Fox agreed to the apology.

1855
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,590
I mean, it's unheard of.

1856
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,558
I mean, that never happens.

1857
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,677
But you will have to sign that.

1858
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,679
It's a strict confidentiality agreement.

1859
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,558
Money will establish you told the truth,

1860
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,797
but no one can ever hear it
directly from you.

1861
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,076
You will be muzzled, Gretchen.

1862
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,760
Maybe.
