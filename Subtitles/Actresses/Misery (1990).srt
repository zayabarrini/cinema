1
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:08,897
Still got it.

2
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,334
What's that?

3
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,526
An old friend.

4
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:51,510
I was rummaging through a closet,
and it was just sitting there.

5
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:53,225
It's nice, Paul.

6
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,475
It's got character.

7
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,096
When I wrote my first book,
I used to carry it around in this

8
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,186
while I was looking for a publisher.

9
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:03,006
- I was a writer then.
- You're still a writer.

10
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,460
I haven't been a writer
since I got in the <i>Misery</i> business.

11
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,619
Not a bad business.

12
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,993
And it would still be growing, too.

13
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:15,594
The first printing for <i>Misery's Child</i>
was the most ever, over a million.

14
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,857
Marcia, please.

15
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,429
Misery Chastain put braces
on your daughter's teeth

16
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,030
and is putting her through college,

17
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,407
bought you two houses
and floor seats to the Knicks.

18
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:27,379
And what thanks does she get?
You go and kill her.

19
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,474
I never meant for it to become my life.

20
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,943
And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now,
I'd have ended up writing her forever.

21
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,743
Now I'm leaving for Colorado
to try to finish the new book.

22
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,658
If I can make this work,

23
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,994
I might just have something
I want on my tombstone.

24
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,045
<i>I'm your number one fan.</i>

25
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,346
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

26
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,282
<i>You're gonna be just fine.</i>

27
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,813
<i>I'll take good care of you.</i>

28
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,183
<i>I'm your number one fan.</i>

29
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,799
Where am I?

30
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,837
We're just outside Silver Creek.

31
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:37,965
How long?

32
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:40,228
You've been here two days.

33
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:42,132
You're gonna be okay.

34
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:45,011
My name is Annie Wilkes.

35
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,733
My number one fan.

36
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,186
Yes. That's right.

37
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,871
I'm also a nurse.

38
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,220
Here. Take these.

39
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,653
Here.

40
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,375
What are they?

41
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:34,400
They're called Novril. They're for your pain.

42
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,531
Thank you.

43
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,520
How come I'm not in a hospital?

44
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,106
The blizzard was too strong.
I couldn't risk trying to get you there.

45
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,822
I tried calling,
but the phone lines are down.

46
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,230
You mustn't tire yourself.

47
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,451
You've gotta rest.

48
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:12,117
You almost died.

49
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,502
Open wide.

50
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:35,088
Your legs just sing grand opera
when you move, don't they?

51
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:38,980
It's not gonna hurt forever, Paul.
I promise you.

52
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,035
- Will I be able to walk?
- Of course you will.

53
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,526
And your arm will be fine, too.

54
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,937
Your shoulder was pretty badly dislocated.

55
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:51,239
It was a little stubborn,
but I finally popped it back in.

56
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:54,212
What I'm most proud of
is the work I did on those legs.

57
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,804
Considering what I had around the house,

58
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:59,433
I don't think there's a doctor
who could have done any better.

59
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,290
It's not nearly as bad as it looks.

60
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,213
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs,

61
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,481
and the fibula in the right leg
is fractured, too.

62
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:16,368
I could hear the bones moving, so it's best
for your legs to remain immobile.

63
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:20,374
And as soon as the roads open,
I'll take you to a hospital.

64
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:23,672
In the meantime,
you've got a lot of recovering to do,

65
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:27,260
and I consider it an honor
that you'll do it in my home.

66
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:38,009
This is Marcia Sindell,
I'm calling from New York City.

67
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:41,151
I'd like to speak to
the Silver Creek Chief of Police or Sheriff.

68
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,924
- <i>Which one of them do you want?</i>
- Whichever one's not busy.

69
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:48,735
Well, I'm pretty sure they're both not
busy, Miss Sindell, since they're both me.

70
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:53,457
<i>I also happen to be President of
the Policeman's Benefit A ssociation,</i>

71
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,236
Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund,

72
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,768
and if you need a good fishing guide,
you could do a lot worse.

73
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:02,270
Call me Buster, everybody does.

74
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,111
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

75
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:08,577
I'm a literary agent, and I...
I feel like a fool calling you,

76
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,688
but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon,

77
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,158
might be in some kind of trouble.

78
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,377
You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?

79
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,688
- He's your client, huh?
- <i>Yes, he is.</i>

80
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:22,622
Everybody sure likes those <i>Misery</i> books.

81
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,827
Yeah.

82
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,568
I'm sure you know that Paul's been coming
to the Silver Creek Lodge for years

83
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:28,958
to finish his books.

84
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:32,045
I understand he's been up here
the last six weeks.

85
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,635
<i>Well, not quite.</i>

86
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,649
I just called there and they...

87
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:40,836
They said he checked out last Tuesday.
Isn't that a little strange?

88
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,949
I don't know. Does he usually phone you
before he checks out of a hotel?

89
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,051
No. No, of course not.

90
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,528
It's just that his daughter
hasn't heard from him,

91
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,227
and when he has a new book coming out,
he usually keeps in touch.

92
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:57,122
<i>So when there wasn't any word from him, I...</i>

93
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,456
You think he might be missing, huh?

94
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:03,965
I hate that I made this call.
Tell me I'm being silly.

95
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,771
Oh, a little overprotective maybe,

96
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,974
but tell you what I'll do.

97
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,921
Nothing's been reported out here,
but I'll put his name through our system,

98
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,309
and if anything turns up,
I'll call you right back.

99
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,724
<i>I'd appreciate that. Thanks a lot.</i>

100
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,648
Goodbye, Miss Sindell.

101
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:27,785
We got a phone call? Busy morning.

102
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,755
Yeah. Work, work, work.

103
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,338
Virginia, when was that blizzard?

104
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,133
Last Tuesday. Why?

105
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,862
No reason.

106
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:52,492
I guess it was kind of a miracle,
you finding me.

107
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,124
No, it wasn't a miracle at all.

108
00:12:56,994 --> 00:13:00,514
- In a way, I was following you.
- You were following me?

109
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:04,059
Well, it wasn't any secret to me
you were staying at the Silver Creek,

110
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,494
seeing as how
I'm your number one fan and all.

111
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:11,296
Some nights I'd just tool
on down there and sit outside

112
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,233
and look up at the light in your cabin,

113
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,978
and I'd try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the world's greatest writer.

114
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,779
Say the last part again. I didn't hear you.

115
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,970
Don't move now.
I wouldn't wanna hurt this neck.

116
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,174
Well, the other afternoon,

117
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,478
I was on my way home,

118
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,464
and there you were, leaving the lodge.

119
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,286
And I wondered why a literary
genius would go for a drive

120
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,381
when there was a big storm coming.

121
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,984
I didn't know there was a big storm coming.

122
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,835
Well, lucky for you I did.

123
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,671
Lucky for me, too.

124
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:47,579
'Cause now you're alive
and you can write more books.

125
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,062
Oh, Paul, I've read everything of yours.

126
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,317
But the <i>Misery</i> novels.
I know them all by heart. All eight of them.

127
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,911
I love them so.

128
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:00,517
- You're very kind.
- And you're very brilliant.

129
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,860
Like a baby.

130
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:06,353
- All done.
- Thank you.

131
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,167
When do you think the phone lines will be up?

132
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,819
I have to call my daughter,
and I'd like to call my agent in New York

133
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,873
and let her know I'm still breathing.

134
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,738
It shouldn't be too much longer now.

135
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,075
Once the roads are opened,
the phone lines will be up in no time.

136
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:22,479
If you give me their numbers,
I'll keep trying them for you.

137
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,867
Thank you.

138
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,607
Could I ask you a favor?

139
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,716
I noticed in your case
there is a new Paul Sheldon book,

140
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,046
and I wondered if maybe...

141
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,521
- You wanna read it?
- Well, if you wouldn't mind.

142
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,456
Well, I do have a very hard and fast rule

143
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:46,084
as to who reads my stuff at this early stage.

144
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,307
Only my editor, my agent,

145
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,892
and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death in a car wreck.

146
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,912
You'll never realize
what a rare treat you've given me.

147
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,645
Boy, it's like clockwork,
the way your pain comes.

148
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,096
I'll get you your Novril, Paul.

149
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:15,590
Forgive me for prattling away
and making you feel all oogy.

150
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:22,903
What's your new book called?

151
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,193
I don't have a title yet.

152
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,858
What's it about?

153
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:29,767
I don't know.

154
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,074
I know it sounds crazy, but I haven't
written anything but <i>Misery</i> for so long.

155
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,735
Why don't you read it?

156
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,778
And you can tell me
what you think it's about.

157
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,009
Maybe you can come up with a title.

158
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,959
Like I could do that.

159
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:51,665
Nothing unusual about
Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

160
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,833
- You can tell by the champagne.
- Maybe you can, Libby.

161
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:59,073
See, he always orders a bottle of
Dom Perignon when he's ready to go.

162
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:01,158
Then he pays up and he's out the door.

163
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,573
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

164
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:08,166
Anything out of the ordinary?

165
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:12,421
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes
for things to be out of the ordinary.

166
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:15,951
Considering who he is,
and all famous and all,

167
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,884
he doesn't put on airs.

168
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:22,197
Drives up from New York
in the same car each time.

169
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,854
A '65 Mustang. Says it helps him to think.

170
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,303
He's always been a good guest.

171
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:32,733
Never makes a noise. Never bothers a soul.

172
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,666
I sure hope nothing's happened to him.

173
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,544
So do I.

174
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,939
I bet that old Mustang
is pulling into New York right now.

175
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,655
- I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Libby.
- My pleasure.

176
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,137
I know I'm only 40 pages
into your book, but...

177
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:05,861
But what?

178
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,842
- Nothing.
- No, no, no. What is it?

179
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,165
It's ridiculous.

180
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:17,109
Who am I to make a criticism
to someone like you?

181
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,408
It's all right, I can take it.

182
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,057
Well, it's brilliantly written.

183
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,759
But then everything you write is brilliant.

184
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,528
Pretty rough stuff, huh?

185
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:32,300
The swearing, Paul.

186
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,155
There, I said it.

187
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,576
Yeah. The profanity bothers you.

188
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,908
It has no nobility.

189
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,650
These are slum kids.

190
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,332
I was a slum kid.

191
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:49,884
- Everybody talks like that.
- They do not!

192
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:53,123
What do you think I say
when I go to the feed store in town?

193
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:56,914
"Now, Wally, give me a bag
of that f-ing pig feed

194
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:59,625
"and 10 pounds of that bitchly cow corn!"

195
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,453
And the bank, do I tell Mrs. Bollinger,

196
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:06,564
"Here's one big bastard of a check,
give me some of your Christing money"?

197
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,495
There! Look, there! See what you made me do?

198
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,243
Oh, Paul, I'm sorry.

199
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm so sorry.

200
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,741
Sometimes I get so worked up.

201
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,462
Can you ever forgive me?

202
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,177
It's fine.

203
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,785
I love you, Paul.

204
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:48,144
Your mind, your creativity.
That's all I meant.

205
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,643
Well, this sure is fun.

206
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:46,262
Virginia, when you're in this car,
you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

207
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:52,642
Well, this deputy'd rather be home
under the covers with the Sheriff.

208
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,138
- Stop.
- What?

209
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,613
- Stop!
- What?

210
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:09,514
See that broken limb?

211
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,249
Could've been the weight of the snow.

212
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:15,518
Yeah, could've been a rotten branch,
could've been the wind.

213
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,934
Could've been a lot of things.

214
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:54,185
Need some help?

215
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,775
No, I'm enjoying myself! Thank you.

216
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,658
- You really think Sheldon's out there?
- I hope not.

217
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,487
If he is, he's dead.

218
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:28,973
Let's go to the newspaper office.

219
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:03,624
Oh, I hope I didn't wake you.

220
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:06,634
No, it's fine.

221
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:10,965
Look what I got.

222
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,168
They had it at the store, Paul.
There was a whole batch of them there.

223
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:16,381
And as soon as I saw it,
I slammed my money down.

224
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,549
I got the first copy.

225
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,148
Then the roads are open.

226
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:22,627
Well, the one to town is,
but that's about it.

227
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:26,565
I called the hospital and I talked
to the head orthopedic surgeon,

228
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:29,660
and I told him who you were
and what had happened.

229
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:34,426
And he said as long as there's
no infection, you're not in any danger.

230
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:39,199
And as soon as the road to the hospital is
open, they'll send an ambulance for you.

231
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,836
The phone's working?

232
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,214
Well, mine's still out, but the ones
in town were working just fine.

233
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,082
I called that agent of yours.

234
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:51,341
Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.

235
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,758
What a wonderful first page.
Just to read the name, Misery Chastain...

236
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,351
My daughter's gotta be going nuts.

237
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,317
...it's like a visit
from my oldest, dearest friend.

238
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,755
I'm supposed to be home
for her birthday. It's today.

239
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,400
The agent said she would tell her
you were okay,

240
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:09,830
but I'm afraid you'll have to wait till
tomorrow if you wanna talk to her yourself.

241
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,701
Oh, Paul, what a poet you are.

242
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:29,856
I made you my specialty.
Scrambled eggs à la Wilkes.

243
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:32,360
And I'm on page 75.

244
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,050
I guess that means it's okay.

245
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:37,952
No.

246
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,458
No, it isn't. It's...

247
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:43,903
Oh, pooh. I can't think of any words.

248
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,824
Would "great" be insulting?

249
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,174
I can live with "great."

250
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,261
No.

251
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,541
It's not just great,

252
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,687
it's perfect.

253
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,861
A perfect, perfect thing.

254
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,996
I thought it was time you two should meet.

255
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:56,170
Paul, say hello to my favorite beast
in the whole world.

256
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,772
My sow, Misery.

257
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:00,811
Misery?

258
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,857
Yes. I told you I was your number one fan.

259
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:07,109
Yeah, I'm starting to believe you.

260
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:11,028
This farm was kind of dreary, what with
just a few cows and chickens and me.

261
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:14,364
But when I got Misery here,
everything changed.

262
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,857
She just makes me smile so.

263
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:20,726
She's a fine pig, is what she is.

264
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:25,656
I'm on page 300 now, Paul.

265
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,517
And it's better than perfect. It's divine.

266
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:35,369
- What's the ceiling that dago painted?
- The Sistine Chapel.

267
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,983
Yeah! That and <i>Misery's Child,</i>

268
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:42,575
those are the only two divine
things ever in this world.

269
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,769
When my husband left me, I wasn't prepared.

270
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,119
It wasn't an easy time.

271
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,786
For a while, I thought I might go crazy.

272
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,080
I know how that can be.

273
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:19,425
I don't know about you,

274
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,186
but what I did to get through it
was I dove into work.

275
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,237
Days, nights.

276
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,761
Night shifts can be lonely at a hospital.

277
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,532
I did a lot of reading.

278
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:36,534
That was when I first discovered Misery.

279
00:26:37,415 --> 00:26:39,203
She made me so happy.

280
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,634
She made me forget all my problems.

281
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:47,673
Of course, I suppose, you had
a little something to do with that, too.

282
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,227
Yeah, well...

283
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:55,462
I just kept reading them over and over.

284
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,899
I've only got two chapters to go in this one,

285
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,633
and I know when I finish,
I'll just turn right to the first page

286
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:02,857
and start reading it all over again.

287
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:05,727
I'm...

288
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,747
- Done?
- Yeah.

289
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:12,716
No problem.

290
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,937
Thanks.

291
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:19,722
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not against marriage per se,

292
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:21,852
but it'd take a pretty special guy

293
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,898
to make me wanna walk down that aisle again.

294
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:28,686
Yeah, it's not something
you should enter into lightly.

295
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,020
It boils down to respect.

296
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:34,257
People just don't respect
the institution of marriage anymore.

297
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:36,969
They have no sense of real commitment.

298
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,245
Well, I'd love to stay here and chat,

299
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:45,707
but I'm right at the end
and I gotta find out what happens.

300
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,219
You.

301
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,775
You dirty bird.

302
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:16,671
How could you?

303
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,566
She can't be dead.

304
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:23,182
Misery Chastain cannot be dead.

305
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,208
Annie, in 1871,
women often died in childbirth.

306
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,753
But her spirit is the important thing,
and Misery's spirit is still alive.

307
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:33,799
I don't want her spirit!

308
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:35,481
I want her!

309
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,820
And you murdered her!

310
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:40,362
No. I didn't.

311
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:43,170
- Who did?
- No one.

312
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,178
She died. She just slipped away.

313
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:48,578
"Slipped away"?

314
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,468
"Slipped away"?

315
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:53,281
She didn't just slip away! You did it!

316
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:57,486
You did it! You did it!

317
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:59,525
You did it! You did it!

318
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:02,323
- You murdered my Misery!
- Annie! Annie!

319
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:12,274
I thought you were good, Paul,
but you're not good.

320
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,673
You're just another lying, old dirty birdie,

321
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:19,099
and I don't think
I better be around you for a while.

322
00:29:27,985 --> 00:29:30,924
And don't even think
about anybody coming for you.

323
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,680
Not the doctors, not your agent,
not your family

324
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:38,345
because I never called them.

325
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:40,797
Nobody knows you're here.

326
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:43,689
And you better hope nothing happens to me.

327
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:47,573
Because if I die, you die.

328
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,985
No, Miss Sindell, there's no point
in coming up here now.

329
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,892
Everything that can be done is.

330
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,655
Yes, we're working close
with the State Police

331
00:32:26,764 --> 00:32:29,133
and the FBI's been informed.

332
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:31,500
Right. Right.

333
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:34,507
As soon as we know anything,
we'll let you know.

334
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,006
No bother at all.

335
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:38,590
Call anytime. Goodbye, Miss Sindell.

336
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:43,372
All right. Well, I sure appreciate it.
Thank you.

337
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:48,109
According to the check
on Sheldon's credit charges,

338
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,123
there's nothing after the Silver Creek.

339
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,853
And no calls about the article either.

340
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,626
You poor, dear thing.

341
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:02,064
What are you doing on the floor?

342
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,823
It's all my fault.

343
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:08,694
If I'd had a proper hospital bed,
this never would've happened.

344
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,868
Here, let me help you back in.

345
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,868
I know this hurts,
but it will only take a few seconds.

346
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:21,508
Upsy-daisy.

347
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,260
- Oh, please. Wait. Wait.
- Oh, you're such a crybaby.

348
00:33:37,702 --> 00:33:39,491
There you go.

349
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,814
- Comfy?
- Perfect.

350
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,398
Such a kidder.

351
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,395
I have a big surprise for you.

352
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,483
But first there's something you must do.

353
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,273
You don't suppose I could have a little
snack while I'm waiting for the surprise?

354
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:58,109
I'll get you everything you want,
but you must listen first.

355
00:33:58,923 --> 00:34:01,190
Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy.

356
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,511
I accept that.

357
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,223
It's why I couldn't remember
all the things they were asking me

358
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,358
on the witness stand in Denver.

359
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,600
But this time, I thought clearly.

360
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,433
I asked God about you,

361
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:17,069
and God said, "I delivered him unto you
so that you may show him the way."

362
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:19,601
- Show me the way?
- Yes.

363
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:54,864
When I mentioned a snack,

364
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:59,342
I was thinking more along the lines
of a cheese-and-crackers kind of thing.

365
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,719
Paul, this is no time for jokes.

366
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,189
You must rid the world of this filth.

367
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:10,079
You want me to burn my book?

368
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:13,884
I know this may be difficult for you,
but it's for the best.

369
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:19,737
It's really not difficult at all.

370
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:24,175
My agent made dozens of copies.
There's gonna be an auction in New York.

371
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,758
Every publishing house in New York
is reading it now.

372
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:29,178
So if you want me to burn my book, fine.

373
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,674
You're not really ridding
the world of anything.

374
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:35,335
Then light the match, Paul.

375
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,184
It's no big deal.

376
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:39,019
So you've indicated.

377
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:41,142
Do it.

378
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:52,290
I know this is the only copy, Paul.

379
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,918
When you were 24, you wrote your
first book and you didn't make a copy

380
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:57,340
because you didn't think
anybody would take it seriously.

381
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:59,561
But they did. And ever since,
you've never made any copies

382
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:01,135
because you're superstitious.

383
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,513
It's why you always come back
to the Silver Creek Lodge.

384
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:06,006
You told that story to Merv Griffin
11 years ago.

385
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,045
Merv Griffin.

386
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:18,024
I'll tell you what,
it doesn't ever have to be published.

387
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:21,124
No one ever has to read it.
I'll just keep it for myself.

388
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:23,533
No one will even know it exists.

389
00:36:24,535 --> 00:36:28,191
As long as it does exist,
your mind won't ever be free.

390
00:36:32,743 --> 00:36:35,466
I think you should light the match, Paul.

391
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:46,740
Can't you see it's what God wants?

392
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:48,076
You're so brilliant,

393
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:51,348
I would think you'd certainly
be able to see that.

394
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:56,669
We're put on this Earth to help people, Paul.

395
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,564
Like I'm trying to help you.

396
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:04,872
Please, help me help you.

397
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,443
You're doing the right thing.

398
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:38,627
Oh, my goodness! Goodness gracious! Oh, my!

399
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:46,268
Oh, my goodness! Heavens to Betsy!

400
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:48,935
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

401
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:54,516
Heavens to Betsy! Oh, goodness!

402
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,631
Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

403
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,354
That's the Steadman place down there.

404
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:43,704
And that's the Wilkes farm straight ahead.

405
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:49,039
That's no '65 Mustang.

406
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,317
Well, there's nothing else out this way.
Let's circle back.

407
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:11,423
I do believe the winters
are getting shorter and shorter every year.

408
00:39:11,536 --> 00:39:15,261
People say it has something to do
with the ozone layer.

409
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:16,990
What do you think?

410
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:19,444
I don't know.

411
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,593
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

412
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,819
Here's your Novril.

413
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:14,382
<i>Hi, we're back. Now, you're gonna have
to remind us who the audience chose.</i>

414
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,047
- <i>They chose Kevin.</i>
- <i>They chose Kevin.</i>

415
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:18,760
<i>Congratulations! Say hello to Kevin Andrews.</i>

416
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:20,851
- <i>Hi, Kevin.</i>
- <i>Hi, how you doing, Chuck?</i>

417
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:25,414
<i>Fine, make yourself at home back there
and Sheri will tell us about the date.</i>

418
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,269
<i>Okay. First of all,
I picked out a very classy restaurant.</i>

419
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,378
<i>It was so classy,
and he shows up without no tie...</i>

420
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:34,571
See, isn't this nice?

421
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:38,129
Great, I always wanted to visit
the other side of the room.

422
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,345
Look what I got for you.

423
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:45,747
An electric razor,
so you can shave yourself now.

424
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:53,095
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise,
I'd have burned all my books.

425
00:41:53,197 --> 00:41:55,658
Now, don't poke fun.

426
00:41:57,034 --> 00:42:01,488
This is a very big day for you, Paul.
You just sit tight and I'll set everything up.

427
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:05,864
- Set what up?
- That's the big surprise.

428
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:08,728
Your new studio.

429
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:12,818
After all, writers do need a place to work.

430
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:15,604
Work? You mean, write?

431
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:20,215
What in the world do you think I'd write?

432
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,024
Oh, but, Paul, I don't think.

433
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:24,381
I know.

434
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,978
Now that you've gotten rid
of that nasty manuscript,

435
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:29,854
you can go back to doing
what you're great at.

436
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:33,931
You're gonna write a new novel,
your greatest achievement ever.

437
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,587
<i>Misery's Return.</i>

438
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:38,424
<i>"Misery's Return "?</i>

439
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:41,613
I know you didn't mean it
when you killed her,

440
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,899
and now you'll make it right.

441
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,478
It'll be a book in my honor

442
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:51,070
for saving your life
and nursing you back to health.

443
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:55,961
Oh, Paul, you're gonna make me
the envy of the whole world.

444
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,124
You just expect me to whip
something off, is that it?

445
00:42:59,229 --> 00:43:02,100
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

446
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,737
You do understand

447
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,662
that this is not the ordinary way
in which books get written.

448
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:13,340
I mean, some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation.

449
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:15,745
I have total confidence in your brilliance.

450
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,933
Besides, the view will inspire you.

451
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:21,840
You just inhale that. I'll be right back.

452
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:36,352
I guess you don't get bothered
by neighbors much.

453
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,084
Don't you worry about that.

454
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,927
You'll have total solitude
so you can concentrate on your work.

455
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,167
Great.

456
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,972
I got you this expensive paper to type on,

457
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:52,516
and I got a great deal on this 50-pound
clunker on account of it's missing an "N."

458
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:56,490
I told the sales lady, "N" was one of
the letters in my favorite writer's name.

459
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,132
It's two of the letters
in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.

460
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:06,793
You fooler.

461
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:10,024
- Did I do good?
- You did great.

462
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,339
There is just one little thing.

463
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:21,126
I can't work on this paper.

464
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:24,673
See, it's Corrasable Bond and it smudges.

465
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:28,621
So I thought maybe if you
went back into town,

466
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:31,840
you could bring me
some white long-grained mimeo.

467
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:37,043
But mine cost the most,
so I don't see how it can smudge.

468
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:40,434
Come here, I'll show you.

469
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:01,901
It does smudge after all.

470
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:04,355
Isn't that fascinating?

471
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,642
I thought you'd be interested.

472
00:45:06,757 --> 00:45:09,126
I'd like for you
to be in on everything, Annie.

473
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:12,348
Not just the finished book,
but how it's written.

474
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,084
Thank you for thinking of me.

475
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,458
Anything else I can get while I'm in town?

476
00:45:23,574 --> 00:45:26,775
Any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

477
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:29,098
Would you like a tiny tape recorder?

478
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:32,084
Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

479
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:34,279
Just the paper will be fine.

480
00:45:35,253 --> 00:45:36,415
Are you sure?

481
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,823
'Cause if you want,
I'll bring back the whole store for you.

482
00:45:39,924 --> 00:45:43,011
Annie, what's the matter?

483
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:45,588
"What's the matter?"
I'll tell you what's the matter!

484
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:47,188
I go out of my way for you!

485
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,086
I do everything to try and make you happy!

486
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,626
I feed you! I clean you! I dress you!

487
00:45:51,736 --> 00:45:53,171
And what thanks do I get?

488
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:56,665
"Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie.
I can't write on this paper, Annie."

489
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,440
Well, I'll get your stupid paper,
but you just better start showing me

490
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:02,415
a little more appreciation
around here, Mr. Man!

491
00:47:31,669 --> 00:47:32,763
Shit.

492
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:58,032
Come on, you've written
about this, now do it.

493
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,258
What do you know? It actually works.

494
00:48:39,604 --> 00:48:41,153
What a surprise.

495
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,468
You crazy bitch.

496
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,177
Paul, I've got your paper!

497
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,644
I hope it's enough.
Three reams of long-grained mimeo.

498
00:54:57,247 --> 00:54:59,367
Just the kind you asked for.

499
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:01,813
Paul.

500
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,491
You're dripping with perspiration.

501
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,991
Your color is very hectic.

502
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:09,062
What have you been doing?

503
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:11,859
You know damn well what I've been doing.

504
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:13,990
I've been sitting here suffering.

505
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:16,126
I need my pills.

506
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,601
Poor dear.

507
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:20,254
Let's get you back in bed,
and I'll get them for you.

508
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:21,954
I want my pills now!

509
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,260
- It'll only take a second.
- No!

510
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:28,507
I want my pain to go away, Annie.

511
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,172
Please, make it go away.

512
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:35,176
Please, Annie.

513
00:55:36,554 --> 00:55:37,716
Please.

514
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:44,187
It just breaks my heart to see you like this.

515
00:55:54,339 --> 00:55:56,526
I've done a lot of thinking on the drive.

516
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:57,928
Here you go.

517
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:00,734
And I'm absolutely certain.

518
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:05,048
The main reason I've never been
more popular is because of my temper.

519
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:07,815
You must be so mad at me.

520
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:09,411
The truth, now.

521
00:56:10,521 --> 00:56:14,781
Well, who doesn't let off a little steam
every once in a while?

522
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,386
My genius needs his rest before he writes.

523
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:26,437
Footsies up.

524
00:56:27,872 --> 00:56:29,331
There you go.

525
00:56:30,274 --> 00:56:31,368
Okay.

526
00:56:42,753 --> 00:56:43,938
Here.

527
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:47,089
In case you think of any ideas.

528
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:50,295
Well, I wouldn't expect too much.

529
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:54,197
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant.

530
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:56,600
Think of me as your inspiration.

531
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:04,163
I have faith in you, my darling.

532
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:05,608
Catch this.

533
00:57:16,787 --> 00:57:18,245
"My darling."

534
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:53,282
The presumption must now be
that Paul Sheldon is dead.

535
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:57,412
We know that he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle,

536
00:57:57,528 --> 00:58:01,697
but we have been unable to find his body
anywhere in the vicinity of the accident.

537
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:06,257
We also know that if anyone had found him,
they would've taken him to an area hospital.

538
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:10,094
Undoubtedly, he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow.

539
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:12,098
We'll find him after the first thaw.

540
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:16,813
That is, unless the animals didn't get to
him first, which is a distinct possibility.

541
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:21,212
That was a statement from
Colorado Police Chief, Sherman Douglas.

542
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:22,538
We will be updating you...

543
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:34,731
You don't think he's dead, do you?

544
00:58:34,832 --> 00:58:38,261
Well, he might well be,
but not the way they say.

545
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:41,091
He never crawled out of that car by himself.

546
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:43,837
You can see the dents on the door there.

547
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,730
Someone pulled him out.

548
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:40,815
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong.

549
01:00:40,925 --> 01:00:43,557
- What?
- You'll have to do it over again.

550
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:46,087
It's not worthy of you. Throw it all out.

551
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:48,224
Except for that part of naming
the gravedigger after me.

552
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,734
You can leave that in.

553
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:56,800
I really value your criticism, but maybe
we're being a little bit hasty here.

554
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,425
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

555
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,844
- Not fair?
- That's right.

556
01:01:01,946 --> 01:01:04,942
When I was growing up in Bakersfield,
my favorite thing in all the world

557
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:07,954
was to go to the movies on
Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays.

558
01:01:08,052 --> 01:01:11,025
- Cliffhangers.
- I know that, Mr. Man!

559
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:14,516
They also call them serials.
I'm not stupid, you know!

560
01:01:17,828 --> 01:01:20,163
Anyway, my favorite was <i>Rocket Man.</i>

561
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,052
And once it was a no-brakes chapter,

562
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:24,467
and the bad guys stuck him
in a car on a mountain road,

563
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:26,267
and knocked him out
and welded the doors shut,

564
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,353
and tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

565
01:01:28,473 --> 01:01:31,195
And he woke up and tried to steer
and tried to get out.

566
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:33,496
But the car went off a cliff
before he could escape

567
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:36,607
and it crashed and burned,
and I was so upset and excited!

568
01:01:36,714 --> 01:01:39,140
And the next week, you better believe,
I was first in line.

569
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:41,471
And they always start
with the end of the last week.

570
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:45,375
And there was Rocket Man, trying
to get out, and here comes the cliff.

571
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:48,793
And just before the car
went off the cliff, he jumped free!

572
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:51,160
And all the kids cheered!

573
01:01:51,262 --> 01:01:52,754
But I didn't cheer.

574
01:01:52,863 --> 01:01:55,050
I stood right up and started shouting,

575
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:59,038
"This isn't what happened last week!
Have you all got amnesia?

576
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,961
"They just cheated us! This isn't fair!

577
01:02:02,072 --> 01:02:05,831
"He didn't get out of the cock-a-doodie car!"

578
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:16,170
They always cheated like that in...
Chapter plays.

579
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:17,688
But not you.

580
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:20,538
Not with my Misery.

581
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:23,449
Remember Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary
at the end of the last book,

582
01:02:23,561 --> 01:02:25,019
but his horse fell jumping that fence.

583
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:27,647
And Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs
and lay all night in the ditch,

584
01:02:27,765 --> 01:02:28,950
and he never reached the doctor.

585
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:33,373
So there couldn't have been any experimental
blood transfusion that saved her life.

586
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,863
Misery was buried in the ground
at the end, Paul,

587
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:38,160
so you'll have to start there.

588
01:03:18,182 --> 01:03:19,550
Is it fair?

589
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:21,848
Should I continue?

590
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:23,753
You better.

591
01:03:24,455 --> 01:03:26,152
Oh, Paul!

592
01:03:26,257 --> 01:03:29,081
When Ian realized that the reason
they'd buried Misery alive

593
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:32,166
was because the bee sting
had put her in that temporary coma.

594
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:35,087
And when gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier

595
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:37,830
the same thing had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

596
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:39,917
And then old Dr. Cleary deduced

597
01:03:40,037 --> 01:03:42,521
that Misery must be
Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter

598
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,338
because of the rarity of deadly bee stings.

599
01:03:44,442 --> 01:03:46,561
My heart just leapt!

600
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:49,741
I've known from the very first book
that Misery had to be born of nobility,

601
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:52,182
- and I was right!
- Yeah.

602
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:54,550
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter
when you finish?

603
01:03:54,652 --> 01:03:56,418
I can fill in the "N's."

604
01:03:57,522 --> 01:03:59,982
Will she be her old self,
now that Ian has dug her out,

605
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,492
or will she have amnesia?

606
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:02,811
Have to wait.

607
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:06,128
Will she still love him
with that special, perfect love?

608
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,598
You'll have to wait.

609
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,362
Not even a hint?

610
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:14,508
Misery's alive! Misery's alive!

611
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:16,131
Oh, it's so romantic!

612
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,305
Oh, this whole house
is gonna be filled with romance!

613
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,870
I'm gonna put on my Liberace records!

614
01:04:26,183 --> 01:04:28,337
You do like Liberace, don't you?

615
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:30,238
Whenever he played Radio City,

616
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:32,906
who do you think was right there
in the front row?

617
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,019
I'm gonna play my records
all day long to inspire you.

618
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:37,949
He's my all-time favorite.

619
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:39,190
Annie?

620
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,851
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

621
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:47,156
To celebrate Misery's return.

622
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:52,276
I couldn't have done it without you.

623
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:55,798
Oh, Paul.

624
01:04:57,915 --> 01:04:59,681
It would be an honor.

625
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:08,815
No, he's not here.

626
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:12,321
I don't know where he is.
He never tells me anything anymore.

627
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:15,631
He's probably out having an affair somewhere.

628
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:18,399
Wait a minute. He's coming in now.

629
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:19,597
It's Jim Taylor.

630
01:05:19,704 --> 01:05:22,643
He wants to know
who you're having an affair with.

631
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:25,479
Hello, Jim. What's doing?

632
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:30,735
Jim, we've been through this before.

633
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:33,275
If you're gonna have benches
out in front of your store,

634
01:05:33,384 --> 01:05:35,867
people are gonna wanna sit on them.

635
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:41,607
Well, I don't like him either, but I'm not
gonna come over there and tell him to move.

636
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:44,885
Give my best to Denise. Bye.

637
01:05:46,129 --> 01:05:49,365
Well, whoever she is,
she sure likes to read a lot.

638
01:05:50,668 --> 01:05:55,167
Virginia, I'm flattered that you think
I've got that much energy.

639
01:05:57,074 --> 01:05:59,501
I figured that if I can't find Paul Sheldon,

640
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,731
at least I can find out what he wrote about.

641
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,397
What do you expect to find?

642
01:06:04,515 --> 01:06:08,479
A story about a guy who drove
his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

643
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:14,912
You see, it's just that kind of sarcasm
that's given our marriage real spice.

644
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,039
- I hope you like it.
- It looks wonderful.

645
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,396
So do you.

646
01:07:03,908 --> 01:07:07,177
I've never had meat loaf this good.
What do you do to it?

647
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:10,638
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes,
never canned.

648
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:15,042
And to give it that little extra zip,
I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

649
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:21,026
Can't get this in a restaurant in New York.

650
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:29,924
Let's have a toast.

651
01:07:30,034 --> 01:07:33,429
- A toast?
- Yes. To Misery.

652
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:35,200
Let me pour you some wine.

653
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,890
No.

654
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:54,323
To Misery.

655
01:07:58,263 --> 01:07:59,323
Wait.

656
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,801
Let's do this right. Do you have any candles?

657
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,197
I don't know. I...

658
01:08:07,305 --> 01:08:09,674
I think so. I'll go look.

659
01:08:17,748 --> 01:08:21,051
Did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair?

660
01:08:21,151 --> 01:08:22,974
Oh, you!

661
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,990
I just picked things up over the years.

662
01:08:27,091 --> 01:08:29,153
Well, it certainly says you.

663
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,529
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

664
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:38,166
Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay.
I just thought it'd be nice.

665
01:08:38,836 --> 01:08:40,169
Are you kidding?

666
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:43,699
If anyone had ever told me that one day
I'd be having a candle-lit dinner

667
01:08:43,808 --> 01:08:45,836
with Paul Sheldon in my own house,

668
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:49,509
I would've checked both legs
to see which one was being pulled.

669
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:54,872
- Will this do?
- It's perfect.

670
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:06,286
To Misery and to Annie Wilkes,
who brought her back to life.

671
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:10,555
Oh, Paul, I get goosebumps
every time I think about it.

672
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:14,908
Oh, my God. What have I done?

673
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:17,307
I'm so sorry, Paul.

674
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:19,595
I ruined your beautiful toast.

675
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:24,905
Will you ever forgive me?

676
01:09:25,015 --> 01:09:27,168
Here, let me pour another one.

677
01:09:33,424 --> 01:09:35,793
Can we pretend this never happened?

678
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:43,226
- To Misery.
- To Misery.

679
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:31,950
Paul, this is positively
the best <i>Misery</i> you've ever written.

680
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:42,769
Here's your pills.

681
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:45,683
Annie?

682
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:50,911
Annie, what is it?

683
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:53,482
The rain.

684
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:57,867
Sometimes it gives me the blues.

685
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:03,343
When you first came here,

686
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:07,447
I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon.

687
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:12,518
But now, I know I love the rest of him, too.

688
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:21,060
I know you don't love me.

689
01:12:22,427 --> 01:12:24,010
Don't say you do.

690
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:30,570
You're a beautiful, brilliant,
famous man of the world,

691
01:12:33,838 --> 01:12:36,059
and I'm not a movie star type.

692
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:45,314
You'll never know the fear
of losing someone like you

693
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,398
if you're someone like me.

694
01:12:48,586 --> 01:12:50,409
Why would you lose me?

695
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:56,322
The book's almost finished.

696
01:12:58,696 --> 01:13:00,849
Your legs are getting better.

697
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,669
Soon you'll be wanting to leave.

698
01:13:05,403 --> 01:13:07,385
Why would I leave?

699
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:09,031
I like it here.

700
01:13:09,474 --> 01:13:11,411
That's very kind of you.

701
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:15,007
But I'll bet it's not altogether true.

702
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:33,813
I have this gun.

703
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:40,838
Sometimes I think about using it.

704
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:48,994
I better go now.

705
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:54,131
I might put bullets in it.

706
01:14:42,433 --> 01:14:45,634
"There is a justice higher than that of man.

707
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:48,037
"I will be judged by him."

708
01:14:48,138 --> 01:14:51,260
- What?
- They're hauling Misery into court.

709
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:54,312
That's nice.

710
01:15:02,453 --> 01:15:07,111
"There is a justice higher than that of man.

711
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:13,117
"I will be judged by him."

712
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,262
<i>Welcome to</i> Love Connection!

713
01:19:20,312 --> 01:19:23,968
<i>Where old-fashioned romance
meets modern-day technology.</i>

714
01:19:25,816 --> 01:19:29,871
<i>Where you hear all
the intimate details of the date.</i>

715
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,918
See you in the morning.

716
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:35,176
<i>I'm supposed to be in the finale
of my show right now,</i>

717
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:38,260
<i>but I'm having such a wonderful time...</i>

718
01:20:38,356 --> 01:20:39,450
Paul.

719
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:48,121
I know you've been out.

720
01:20:53,137 --> 01:20:55,621
- What?
- You've been out of your room.

721
01:20:57,742 --> 01:20:59,200
No, I haven't.

722
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:01,112
Paul.

723
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:05,050
My little ceramic penguin
in the study always faces due south.

724
01:21:07,252 --> 01:21:10,339
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

725
01:21:11,122 --> 01:21:12,672
Ceramic penguin?

726
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:16,493
Is this what you're looking for?

727
01:21:18,929 --> 01:21:21,230
I know you've been out twice, Paul.

728
01:21:21,332 --> 01:21:23,815
At first, I couldn't figure out
how you did it,

729
01:21:23,935 --> 01:21:26,533
but last night I found your key.

730
01:21:30,775 --> 01:21:33,475
I know I left my scrapbook out.

731
01:21:33,578 --> 01:21:35,970
I can imagine
what you might be thinking of me.

732
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,598
But you see, Paul, it's all okay.

733
01:21:38,716 --> 01:21:41,199
Last night, it came so clear.

734
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:43,620
I realized you just need more time.

735
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:47,776
Eventually, you'll come to accept
the idea of being here.

736
01:21:47,892 --> 01:21:51,981
Paul, do you know about the early days
at the Kimberley diamond mines?

737
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:55,821
Do you know what they did to
the native workers who stole diamonds?

738
01:21:55,933 --> 01:21:58,417
Don't worry, they didn't kill them.

739
01:21:58,536 --> 01:22:02,135
That would be like junking a Mercedes
just because it had a broken spring.

740
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:05,512
No, if they caught them, they had to
make sure they could go on working,

741
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,606
but they also had to make sure
they could never run away.

742
01:22:08,713 --> 01:22:11,265
The operation was called "hobbling."

743
01:22:21,058 --> 01:22:22,346
Annie,

744
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:26,713
whatever you're thinking about doing,
please don't do it.

745
01:22:31,769 --> 01:22:35,858
- Anne, for God...
- Darling. Trust me.

746
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:38,899
- God's sake!
- It's for the best.

747
01:22:39,009 --> 01:22:40,194
Annie, please!

748
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:45,986
Almost done. Just one more.

749
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:57,043
God, I love you.

750
01:23:27,492 --> 01:23:29,258
You cock-a-doodie!

751
01:23:43,274 --> 01:23:45,370
- Sit on this!
- You poop!

752
01:24:01,392 --> 01:24:04,991
- Just leave it, all right?
- Oh, I like that tone.

753
01:24:05,763 --> 01:24:09,157
How many times do I have to tell you?
I have a system here.

754
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,636
- Where the hell is that thing?
- What thing?

755
01:24:11,736 --> 01:24:13,103
The thing!

756
01:24:14,305 --> 01:24:16,572
Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.

757
01:24:16,674 --> 01:24:18,406
What is it?

758
01:24:18,509 --> 01:24:20,935
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

759
01:24:21,045 --> 01:24:24,372
- Well, I'm glad you found it.
- There's that spice again.

760
01:25:40,725 --> 01:25:43,425
Come on, Mizzy. Come on!

761
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:45,996
Hi, pumpkin!

762
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:50,525
Such a kidder.

763
01:25:51,168 --> 01:25:52,718
Come on, Misery!

764
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,032
Come on, Mizzy.

765
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:03,934
Hey, Pete.

766
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:05,868
Buster.

767
01:26:05,983 --> 01:26:09,104
- Answer me a couple of things.
- If I can.

768
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:12,439
Do you have any new Paul Sheldon books?

769
01:26:12,557 --> 01:26:16,076
Well, we had a batch.
Sold them all out in three days.

770
01:26:16,193 --> 01:26:20,218
You wouldn't happen to know if Miss
Wilkes bought one of them, would you?

771
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:22,269
Are you kidding?

772
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:26,695
Every time that fellow writes a new book,
she has me set aside the first copy.

773
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:31,241
Has she been buying anything odd lately?

774
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:32,777
Miss Wilkes?

775
01:26:33,611 --> 01:26:35,707
Same old stuff.

776
01:26:35,813 --> 01:26:38,513
Lest you call paper odd.

777
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:42,341
- Newspaper?
- No. The typing kind.

778
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:45,618
Oh, that kind. Nothing odd about that.

779
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:49,487
- Miss Wilkes done something?
- Not a thing.

780
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:52,285
I don't think I'll ever understand you.

781
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:56,388
I cook your meals,
I tend to you practically 24 hours a day

782
01:27:56,494 --> 01:27:58,556
and you continue to fight me.

783
01:27:58,663 --> 01:28:01,032
When are we going
to develop a sense of trust?

784
01:28:30,328 --> 01:28:31,854
Oh, my.

785
01:28:31,962 --> 01:28:36,257
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,
but you didn't give me a chance to knock.

786
01:28:36,368 --> 01:28:40,298
I guess you can tell from my reaction,
I'm not all that used to visitors out here.

787
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:41,738
What can I do for you?

788
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:43,092
Well, I was wondering,

789
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:46,032
do you happen to know anything
about Paul Sheldon?

790
01:28:46,777 --> 01:28:48,543
What do you wanna know?

791
01:28:48,846 --> 01:28:51,546
Well, anything you could tell me might help.

792
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:55,488
Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts 45 years ago,

793
01:28:55,587 --> 01:28:57,251
the only child of Franklin
and Helene Sheldon,

794
01:28:57,355 --> 01:28:59,018
mediocre student, majored in history.

795
01:28:59,123 --> 01:29:02,119
Well, that... That isn't exactly
the kind of information I'm after.

796
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:04,949
You see, he's been missing
for quite some time now...

797
01:29:05,062 --> 01:29:07,967
I know. It's so upsetting.
I'm his number one fan.

798
01:29:08,065 --> 01:29:10,697
I've got all his books,
every sentence he ever put down.

799
01:29:10,802 --> 01:29:13,593
I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection.

800
01:29:15,873 --> 01:29:19,928
Well, here I am, prattling on
and my manners have just flown away.

801
01:29:20,044 --> 01:29:23,040
- I haven't invited you in. Please.
- Thank you.

802
01:29:24,649 --> 01:29:28,043
Of course, you must know
all about that horrible accident.

803
01:29:28,152 --> 01:29:31,125
- Mind if I take a look around?
- Of course not.

804
01:29:32,423 --> 01:29:34,906
That accident almost killed me, too.

805
01:29:35,025 --> 01:29:36,882
I prayed when I heard the news.

806
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:40,423
I got down on my knees
and I begged for it not to be true.

807
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:44,396
You're gonna laugh at what I'm about
to say, but go ahead, I don't care.

808
01:29:45,537 --> 01:29:48,567
When I was praying, God told me to get ready.

809
01:29:49,707 --> 01:29:52,612
- Get ready for what?
- To be his replacement.

810
01:29:53,378 --> 01:29:56,168
He gave so much pleasure to so many people.

811
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,037
There's a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days,

812
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:01,245
in case you hadn't noticed.

813
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:04,052
God told me, since I was his number one fan,

814
01:30:04,155 --> 01:30:07,641
that I should make up new stories
as if I was Paul Sheldon.

815
01:30:07,759 --> 01:30:12,121
So I went to town and I bought
a typewriter and paper to type on,

816
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:14,622
the same kind Paul Sheldon used.

817
01:30:14,732 --> 01:30:17,455
And I turned the guest bedroom
into a writing studio.

818
01:30:17,569 --> 01:30:19,904
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

819
01:30:20,004 --> 01:30:21,736
It's right this way.

820
01:30:31,283 --> 01:30:34,347
I know how he wrote,
the kinds of words he used,

821
01:30:34,452 --> 01:30:36,753
the wonderful stories he told.

822
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:40,180
I've spent the last four weeks
trying to write like Paul Sheldon,

823
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:42,227
but I can't do it right.

824
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:47,133
I try and I try and I know all the words,
but it's just not the same.

825
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:49,954
Well, maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

826
01:30:51,035 --> 01:30:53,496
I could give you a couple
of hundred pages of mine,

827
01:30:53,604 --> 01:30:55,062
and you could tell me what you think.

828
01:30:55,172 --> 01:30:58,442
- I'm not much of a critic.
- Well, I just thought...

829
01:30:59,677 --> 01:31:02,228
Oh, look at me,
you'd think I'd never had a guest before.

830
01:31:02,347 --> 01:31:05,046
- Would you like a nice hot cup of cocoa?
- No, really, I...

831
01:31:05,149 --> 01:31:08,122
It's no trouble. There's some already made.

832
01:31:15,593 --> 01:31:18,714
Must get lonely,
living out here all by yourself.

833
01:31:20,731 --> 01:31:23,363
Well, I always say
if you can't enjoy your own company,

834
01:31:23,468 --> 01:31:25,587
you're not fit company for anyone else.

835
01:31:25,703 --> 01:31:27,970
Well, you've got a point there.

836
01:32:35,106 --> 01:32:36,508
Here you are.

837
01:32:36,608 --> 01:32:37,861
Thanks, Miss Wilkes

838
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:41,062
but I don't wanna take up
anymore of your time.

839
01:32:42,313 --> 01:32:44,101
I best be going.

840
01:32:44,214 --> 01:32:47,416
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

841
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:51,358
Well, I'm sure it's wonderful,
but I really should be getting back.

842
01:32:56,928 --> 01:32:58,215
Well, if you wouldn't mind,

843
01:32:58,329 --> 01:33:00,698
perhaps I could pay you
another visit sometime.

844
01:33:00,798 --> 01:33:03,282
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way.

845
01:33:22,086 --> 01:33:23,454
Miss Wilkes?

846
01:33:24,856 --> 01:33:27,123
Miss Wilkes, are you all right?

847
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,219
Here!

848
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,792
Here! I'm down here!

849
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,323
I'm down here!

850
01:33:37,635 --> 01:33:39,292
Mr. Sheldon?

851
01:33:49,747 --> 01:33:51,536
Don't feel bad, Paul.

852
01:33:52,384 --> 01:33:55,106
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

853
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,288
It's a sign.

854
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:03,297
You see, I've known for some time
why I was chosen to save you.

855
01:34:04,094 --> 01:34:06,965
You and I were meant to be together forever.

856
01:34:07,565 --> 01:34:10,025
But now our time in this world must end.

857
01:34:11,202 --> 01:34:13,230
But don't worry, Paul.

858
01:34:13,338 --> 01:34:15,559
I've prepared for what must be done.

859
01:34:16,774 --> 01:34:19,326
I put two bullets in my gun.

860
01:34:19,444 --> 01:34:21,779
One for you and one for me.

861
01:34:23,415 --> 01:34:25,875
Oh, darling, it'll be so beautiful.

862
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:46,996
Now, don't be afraid.

863
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,206
I love you.

864
01:34:53,811 --> 01:34:55,338
I love you, too.

865
01:34:58,483 --> 01:35:00,454
And you're right.

866
01:35:00,552 --> 01:35:02,614
We are meant to be together.

867
01:35:03,721 --> 01:35:05,578
And I know we must die.

868
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:11,786
But it must be so that Misery can live.

869
01:35:13,998 --> 01:35:18,452
We have the power
to give Misery eternal life.

870
01:35:20,204 --> 01:35:22,141
We must finish the book.

871
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:27,442
But the time is now.

872
01:35:28,012 --> 01:35:29,835
Soon others will come.

873
01:35:31,215 --> 01:35:32,981
It's almost finished.

874
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:36,039
By dawn,

875
01:35:37,489 --> 01:35:42,056
we'll be able to give Misery
back to the world.

876
01:36:05,049 --> 01:36:07,236
I'll fix you something to eat.

877
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:25,972
Oh, Paul, I'm dying.

878
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:29,134
Does she wind up with Ian or Winthorne?

879
01:36:29,239 --> 01:36:31,210
You'll know very soon.

880
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:34,133
I've just thought of the last chapter.

881
01:36:34,244 --> 01:36:36,910
You know, when I finish,

882
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:40,646
I'd like everything to be perfect.

883
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:42,722
I'll need three things.

884
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:44,221
What things?

885
01:36:45,623 --> 01:36:47,446
You mean you don't know?

886
01:36:49,026 --> 01:36:50,997
I was fooling, silly.

887
01:36:51,529 --> 01:36:53,864
You need a cigarette
because you used to smoke,

888
01:36:53,965 --> 01:36:56,631
but you quit except when you finish a book.

889
01:36:56,734 --> 01:36:58,500
And you have just one.

890
01:36:58,603 --> 01:37:00,335
And the match is to light it.

891
01:37:00,438 --> 01:37:04,527
And you need one glass of champagne.
Dom Perignon.

892
01:37:05,843 --> 01:37:07,700
Dom Perignon it is.

893
01:37:27,832 --> 01:37:28,892
Annie?

894
01:37:30,568 --> 01:37:31,730
Annie?

895
01:37:32,703 --> 01:37:33,956
Yes, Paul.

896
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,476
I'm almost done.

897
01:37:38,242 --> 01:37:41,033
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic.

898
01:37:41,145 --> 01:37:44,301
Ian and Winthorne dueling
for the right to Misery's hand.

899
01:37:44,415 --> 01:37:47,320
Does Ian win? Oh, don't tell me.

900
01:37:47,418 --> 01:37:49,001
It's Winthorne, right?

901
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,842
You'll know everything in a minute.

902
01:37:51,956 --> 01:37:53,574
Get the champagne.

903
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:31,453
Did I do good?

904
01:38:33,197 --> 01:38:34,724
You did perfect.

905
01:38:37,134 --> 01:38:38,570
Except for one thing.

906
01:38:40,338 --> 01:38:43,060
This time we'll need two glasses.

907
01:38:44,576 --> 01:38:46,159
Oh, Paul.

908
01:39:21,546 --> 01:39:25,681
Remember, how for all those years,
nobody knew who Misery's real father was

909
01:39:25,783 --> 01:39:28,449
or if they'd ever be reunited?

910
01:39:28,553 --> 01:39:29,988
It's all right here.

911
01:39:30,087 --> 01:39:33,960
Does she finally marry Ian
or will it be Winthorne?

912
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,789
It's all right here.

913
01:39:38,263 --> 01:39:39,698
Paul, you can't!

914
01:39:40,498 --> 01:39:42,799
Why not? I learned it from you.

915
01:39:44,935 --> 01:39:47,533
No, no, no! Not Misery!

916
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:49,428
Not my Misery!

917
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,023
No! Not my Misery!

918
01:39:55,179 --> 01:39:56,393
No!

919
01:40:04,154 --> 01:40:06,911
I'm gonna kill you, you lying cocksucker!

920
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:49,160
Here, you want it? You want it? Eat it!

921
01:40:49,267 --> 01:40:53,959
Eat it till you choke,
you sick, twisted fuck!

922
01:42:46,984 --> 01:42:50,014
This is it, the very first copy.

923
01:42:50,355 --> 01:42:53,476
The word I'm getting is the <i>Times</i>
review's gonna be a love letter.

924
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:55,026
That'll be a first.

925
01:42:55,126 --> 01:42:58,430
And my contacts at <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>
tell me they're both raves.

926
01:42:58,530 --> 01:43:02,369
And don't laugh, but for the first time,
I think you've got a shot at some prizes.

927
01:43:02,466 --> 01:43:03,594
Great.

928
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:06,264
I thought you'd be thrilled.

929
01:43:06,371 --> 01:43:08,159
You're being taken seriously.

930
01:43:08,273 --> 01:43:12,840
I'm delighted the critics are liking it,
and I hope the people like it, too.

931
01:43:12,944 --> 01:43:15,280
But I wrote it for me.

932
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,732
Now, don't think I'm completely nuts,

933
01:43:20,518 --> 01:43:24,277
but, in some way, Annie Wilkes,

934
01:43:25,222 --> 01:43:27,159
that whole experience,

935
01:43:28,559 --> 01:43:29,846
helped me.

936
01:43:30,962 --> 01:43:32,899
Paul, since you brought her up,

937
01:43:32,997 --> 01:43:36,426
I have to ask you this or I'll be
drummed out of the agents' union.

938
01:43:36,534 --> 01:43:40,494
How would you feel about a non-fiction
book about what went on in that house?

939
01:43:40,605 --> 01:43:41,858
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better,

940
01:43:41,973 --> 01:43:44,571
I'd think you were suggesting
I dredge up the worst horror of my life

941
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:46,863
just so we could make a few bucks.

942
01:43:48,212 --> 01:43:50,001
I thought you were over it.

943
01:43:50,114 --> 01:43:53,714
I don't know if anyone could ever
totally get over something like that.

944
01:43:53,818 --> 01:43:55,151
It's weird.

945
01:43:56,854 --> 01:43:59,315
Even though I know that she's dead,

946
01:44:00,492 --> 01:44:03,157
I still think about her once in a while.

947
01:44:03,661 --> 01:44:04,641
Excuse me.

948
01:44:04,762 --> 01:44:07,553
I don't mean to bother you,
but are you Paul Sheldon?

949
01:44:07,665 --> 01:44:08,793
Yes.

950
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:12,273
I just wanna tell you
I'm your number one fan.

951
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:14,841
That's very sweet of you.
