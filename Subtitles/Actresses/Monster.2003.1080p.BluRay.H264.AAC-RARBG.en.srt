1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,718
I always wanted to be
in the movies

2
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:29,913
When I was little I thought for sure
1 day, I could be a big big star...

3
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,184
Or maybe just beautiful...

4
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:35,759
Beautiful and rich,
like the women on TV

5
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,055
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams

6
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,689
And I guess you can
call me a real romantic

7
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,531
Because I truly believe that
one day... they'll come true

8
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,429
So I dream about it for hours

9
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:52,277
As the years went by,
I learnt to stop sharing this with people

10
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:53,869
They said I was dreaming

11
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:57,709
But back then, I believed
it whole heartily

12
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:01,508
So whenever I was down,
I would just escape into my mind

13
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:04,877
To my other live, where
I was someone else

14
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,248
It made me happy to think
that all these people...

15
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,789
just didn't know yet
who I was gonna be

16
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:12,721
But 1 day they'll all see

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,861
I heard that Marilyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

18
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:18,092
And I thought for sure,
it could be like that

19
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:20,130
So I started growing up
real young...

20
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,394
And I always secretly looking
for who is gonna discover me?

21
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,367
Was it this guy?

22
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,398
Or maybe this one?

23
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:32,542
You never knew

24
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:36,868
But even if they couldn't take me
all the way... like Marilyn

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,710
They would somehow
believe in me just enough

26
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:44,946
They would see me for what I could
be, and think I was beautiful

27
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,217
Like a diamond in the rough

28
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,283
They'll take me away...

29
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:53,952
To my new life

30
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:56,220
And my new world

31
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:58,490
Where everything
would be different

32
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:07,371
Yeah, I lived that way
for long long time

33
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:11,372
And my head dreaming
like that

34
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,035
It was nice

35
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,075
1 day it just stopped

36
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,087
By the time I met
you all...

37
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:39,932
Shame...
all I want is a beer

38
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:57,937
How are you doing?
- Great

39
00:02:57,982 --> 00:02:59,108
Anyone sitting here?

40
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:00,683
No

41
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,871
Madam our services
are for patrons only

42
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,972
Give me a beer
whatever cheapest

43
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,879
So what it is like,
a gay place or what?

44
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,877
Yeah

45
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,076
Hey, whatever, man

46
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,205
Can I buy you that drink?

47
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,103
I got my own money

48
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:15,478
I'll have a pitcher, whatever
she's having

49
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,448
Look, I'm not gay alrite?

50
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:23,014
Well, it makes sense

51
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,418
So what are you doing
here then?

52
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:26,487
My truck broke down, I'm a...

53
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,116
I got a pressure cleaning
business

54
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,624
What's pressure cleaning?

55
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:33,591
You know steam clean?

56
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,495
Upholstery, carpets,
you know, shit like that

57
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,522
So I'm just getting out of the rain

58
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:42,292
My name is Selby

59
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,440
You owe me change!

60
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:57,111
Fuck!
I'm out of here

61
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:58,046
Oh, are you sure?

62
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,679
Get your fucking hands off
me! you dumb dyke...

63
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,376
I'm not gonna fuck you
for fucking beer ok

64
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:05,079
Stop wasting your fucking
time!

65
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,951
I wasn't trying to fuck
you!

66
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,351
I just wanna talk to you

67
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:12,051
I thought that if I bought you
some beer maybe you'll talk to me

68
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,354
I just trying to have one
decent night out, you know..

69
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:20,391
Just talk to someone before
I've to go back to my parents closet

70
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,497
I'm sorry

71
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,605
You don't have to stay

72
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:41,617
So are you really a
steam cleaner?

73
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,080
No, I'm not

74
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,621
No man, actually it's
a real good job...

75
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,089
Pressure cleaning

76
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:56,089
You want some?

77
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,135
Oh come on don't
let me down now

78
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,633
You ready?

79
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:10,301
1... no, you don't get
to do this

80
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,001
Shit, I don't fucking
trust you

81
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,270
You ready?

82
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,373
1, 2, go!

83
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,878
You do suck

84
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,715
You're just a sore winner

85
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,288
Yeah, winner though,
man

86
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,255
Oh, man that's all
my cast

87
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,289
You spilled some good
shit there

88
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,893
I'm gonna lick it up
like a dog

89
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,723
We need 2 more

90
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:38,166
What's that bullshit?

91
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:38,962
What time is it?

92
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,330
The bar is closed

93
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,596
Then why don't you take
that stick out of your ass...

94
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,535
Now would be a good time,
don't you think huh?

95
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,664
Now that the bar's closed

96
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,802
What you do for is that?

97
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,742
We had a good time
though

98
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,615
Yeah, I know, it was fun

99
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,518
I'm sorry, I called you
dumb dyke

100
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:09,086
I don't care

101
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,520
And thanks for the drinks

102
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:15,289
No... No Problem.

103
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,892
So see you around ok

104
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,488
Do you wanna stay with
me?

105
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,397
I didn't mean... you know
you don't have to do anything

106
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:24,365
Shit I know

107
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,107
Fuck it

108
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,037
Yeah? My truck's
broken down

109
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:38,539
Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

110
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:43,520
All I wanted was a beer

111
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:47,850
But the day I met Selby I'd spent most of the
afternoon sitting in the rain, about to kill myself

112
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:49,252
So you can understand

113
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:53,727
I was flexible, I mean everybody
gotta have faith in something

114
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,955
For me? For me all I had left
was love

115
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:59,293
And I was getting pretty sure that,
I wasn't gonna love a man again

116
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,900
So I was gonna do it

117
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:04,068
And the only reason I did it
was a five dollar bill

118
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:06,865
I knew I probably given some
asshole a blowjob for it

119
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:10,907
So really tried to piss me off that
if I killed myself without spending it

120
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,307
Basically I sucked
him off for free

121
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,969
So I made a deal

122
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:17,411
I said God, I gotta spend
this 5 bucks

123
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,210
But when it's gone
so am I

124
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:23,752
If you've got something for me
in this life, you better bring it on

125
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,984
And there she was

126
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,093
Just some friends my parents
and I are staying with

127
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,564
You wanna take a shower
or anything?

128
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,259
Goodnite
- Goodnite

129
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:32,645
I can't believe you
are here

130
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:36,113
Me neither

131
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,513
Can I touch your face?

132
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,855
Sure

133
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,980
Honey!

134
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:29,819
God Donna!
Donna sorry, just a sec!

135
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,196
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be ready for church

136
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,755
Hey, where's my shirt?

137
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:45,465
Look at this, it's 5 o'clock in
the morning and she ain't dressed yet

138
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,343
I'm sorry about that

139
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:51,708
No, it's alrite

140
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,572
Hey thanks for letting me crash

141
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,411
No, that was nice

142
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,777
So when are you leaving?

143
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,218
Tuesday

144
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,722
But you know, I'm gonna be hanging out
at the Moon Nite, around 5

145
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,251
About 2 blocks up
- Yeah yeah yeah

146
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,791
Maybe I'll swing by

147
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,865
Alrite

148
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,733
You have fun at church,
alrite

149
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,943
Who was that person?

150
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:34,413
She's just a friend I made

151
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,515
Honey, I think she was a
straight person

152
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,908
Did you check your stuff,
because she might have stole something

153
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,682
No... I checked it, she didn't
take anything

154
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:51,316
Listen, honey, you cannot bring people
like that here, what if Charles had seen her?

155
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,294
I'm sorry

156
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,921
A person like that... no Mdm

157
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,332
We have no business with
people like that

158
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,612
I'm just getting some stuff

159
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,175
You'll give it to me when you get it

160
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,308
Want some sandwich?

161
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:25,012
Ham don't do it for me
- Thanks, man

162
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,618

163
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,588
It's alrite

164
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,195
You'll pay me when
you get it

165
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:37,299
How are you doing?

166
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,490
I'm good

167
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,163
I met a friend
- Really? good for you

168
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:46,039
Hope it's not some
asshole like the last guy...

169
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,971
who almost trampled you half to death

170
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,304
No, she is... real nice,

171
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,675
Thanks, man

172
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,890
Hang on a sec

00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,494
Hang the fuck on!

174
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,649
You look good

175
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,876
Thanks

176
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,821
Man, you know what
I'm going to give you the $5...

00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,766
I got it. I got it

178
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,066
So you came

179
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:11,870
Yeah I was around,

180
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:18,382
So where's your friends?

181
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:23,153
Well, I... I'm not...

182
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,118
You're mean

183
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,827
Can I ask you a question?

184
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,390
Are you a prostitute?

185
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,526
Yeah

186
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,062
I don't know

187
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,267
People like pay to be
with you, it's wild!

188
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:54,201
Men must just line up
to be with a girl like you

189
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:58,550
I guess, I don't know,
not really, you know!

190
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:02,310
What do you do to them?

191
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,887
All kind of things, you know,
whatever they want

192
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,320
How do you know what
they want?

193
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:07,890
Well they ain't shy
to tell you

194
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:08,855
Really?

195
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,552
Well shit, men are real
easy to read anyway

196
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,592
Well, how about that guy?

197
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,033
How about him?

198
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,933
Oh, he's gay

199
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,299
No way

200
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,804
Yeah, man, look at him,
he tries too hard

201
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,069
Oh man you see that
little fucker over there?

202
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:34,078
Well he, he's straight up, S&M

203
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,717
That's Trevor,
That's the son of the people I'm staying with

204
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,351
Shit I'm sorry

205
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,077
I don't care about that

206
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:46,113
I don't realise he was gonna
be here

207
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:58,931
This girl in my church, she told
everyone that I tried to kiss her

208
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,365
So my parents
basically disowned me

209
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,098
And I decided to come down here
and try to figure somethings out

210
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,333
Then this happened
before I could get a job

211
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,345
How long do you have to stay on?

212
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,378
Not too much longer

213
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,511
But my dad had to pay my medical bills

214
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,775
So I made a deal with him,
that I would go back

215
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:25,912
Which... you know... it... probably
for the best... maybe it'll work

216
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:31,221
Maybe he'll be able to save my
soul and all that

217
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,729
Well I bet you twenty, I'll beat
your ass in a race, rite now

218
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,695
Oh no...

219
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,632
Oh yeah, me and you are gonna
hit the floor rite now

220
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,500
Serious I can't skate

221
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,373
You gotta help me

222
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,171
I know, I've gotcha, come on

223
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,078
There you got it

224
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,012
You better not let
me break my other arm

225
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,844
See you can do this

226
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,046
Your're very good, man

227
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,745
You think you can you do by yourself?

228
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,287
Ok
- There you go

229
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,782
Feel the music

230
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,661
You having fun?

231
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:28,207
There you go turn, turn

232
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:36,115
Oh, man I love this song

233
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:37,841
Oh I love it too

234
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:41,577
Just like that

235
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,845
Oh I can't do that

236
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:43,954
Yeah you can

237
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:46,215
No, no, no,come on,
come with me

238
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,451
Trevor

239
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,387
Who cares about him?

240
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:52,127
Come on are you ready?

241
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,207
So we don't hit anyone

242
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:10,203
Are you ok?

243
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,302
I can't, I can't do
this here

244
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,205
Maybe we can go somewhere

245
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,886
How about the yard
over there?

246
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:57,190
I thought you didn't like gals

247
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,072
I don't like men anymore,
really

248
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,106
I like you

249
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,210
Maybe... maybe we
could go somewhere

250
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,346
Where we can get
a room or something

251
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,357
Oh I don't have any
money

252
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,932

253
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,236

262
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:21,119
It's real hard to get help
around here, you know

263
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:23,821
I was getting lost

264
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,923
So where are you headed?

265
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,525
Just where you can take me,

266
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,155

00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:41,164
They are down in Miami,

00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:44,667
But I'm kind of broke,

So just trying to make...

Sorry it was me

324
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:25,983
You didn't hear nothing?

325
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:29,054
No, it's me I fell out of bed

326
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,366
If that woman's in here, Selby, so help me god..

327
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:45,838
I had a talk with Trevor, and I really
don't appreciate what he told me

328
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:48,170
I don't think your father
will either

329
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:53,103
If she's in here, I want you
to get her out rite now!

330
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:56,542
Or Charlie bound to blow
her head off

331
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:10,824
What the hell are
you doing here?

332
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:16,064
No man, I just wanted to see you

333
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:24,969
I got in a fight

334
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,373
It must have been a really long fight

335
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,378
I got a man really
beaten me up, ok

336
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:35,877
It wasn't my fault

337
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,218
Are you ok?

338
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:51,458
But it's cool now

339
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:53,929
It's cool

340
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,961
I was thinking...

341
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,630
You know I want you to
stay a little longer

342
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,506
Cause I can't

343
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,564
Why not?

344
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,336
Cause I told you
I promised my dad

345
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:12,406
Well, he's your dad rite,
wouldn't he understand

346
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:15,940
So I'm sure he can save
your soul a week from now, rite?

347
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,415
See, I told you...
no problem rite?

348
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:32,663
I was goona use it to take you
out tonite, but...

349
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:36,367
That's enough to rent
a hotel for whole week

350
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:40,800
We can party, hang out,
whatever you wanna do, you know

351
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,975
Maybe I can come back

352
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:55,345
No, you can't come back

353
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,810
Cause I'll be gone

354
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,321
Listen to me,

355
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:12,856
This is a once in a life
time opportunity

356
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,600
Give me a week, I'm gonna go
later I'll buy you fucking ticket

357
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:21,603
I'll take you there
myself, just give me a week

358
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:27,205
You'll never meet someone
like me again

359
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:40,514
Ok
- Alrite

360
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,364
Where did you get this car?

361
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,500
I just borrowed it

362
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,530
So what do we do now?

363
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,539
Whatever?

364
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,647
Cheers
- Cheers

365
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,730
It's getting late

366
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,306
Oh My God Selby!
We thought you were dead

367
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:48,843
Donna, I'm sorry,
I just came and get some stuff

368
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,970
No, honey, you are gonna
talk to your father

369
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,213
You stand rite here!

370
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:56,977
John, yes she's back

371
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,020
She's here

372
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,289
Ok, hang on, hang on

373
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,188
Talk to your dad

374
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,358
Hello?

375
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,391
I found a roomate and...

376
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,998
I can't dad

377
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:23,573
I'm not even staying
here anymore

378
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:32,215
I just came by to pick up some stuff,
I'm not even staying at Donna's anymore

379
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:46,550
Ok.. ok.. I'm an adult now,
I'm gonna stay...

380
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,062
And I gotta go

381
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,958
What are you doing?

382
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:58,465
She's not even... gay

383
00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:02,836
She's just some old street
hooker, she's just using you

384
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:13,012
I quit

385
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,812
What?

386
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:18,114
What're your bags doing here?

387
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,745
I'm staying

388
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:24,721
Holy shit girl, you just
made my day

389
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:27,458
How did you get them huh?

390
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,357
I took a cab

391
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:32,489
But Leen, you can take care
of me rite? cause...

392
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,600
I've spent all our money

393
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,765
It don't even matter

394
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:42,039
What you said?
You quit?

395
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:44,869
Hooking... I quit hooking

396
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:46,236
Why?

397
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:49,872
Why? because it's shit, it's time man,
I fucking hate it

398
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:51,804
I thought you said
it wasn't that bad

399
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:55,213
Oh.. it is, you know, but,
not always, it's not the point

400
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:57,047
I got you now

401
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,346
I got everything going for me

402
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,747
So I'm gonna do a broil

403
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:04,257
This time I'm doing
it a broil

404
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,451
How about that?

405
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,456
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

406
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,526
Exactly... I'll get a job

407
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:16,295
Go clean... straighten up, you know,
fuck it, man, I'll get a career

408
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:22,370
House, car... you know,
how about that

409
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,241
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

410
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:28,706
I've been thinking
about that

411
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,347
I was thinking maybe like
a veterinarian, you know

412
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,451
Cos I fucking love animals,
you know

413
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,143
Yeah...

414
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:40,549
But that's a doctor...
you gotta get a degree for that

415
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:45,983
No, I'm not, no

416
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:50,729
Shit, I know, you know
what I always wanted to be?

417
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,332
What?

418
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,866
President of the US

419
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:13,347
I just haven't been feeling too good
lately, you know

420
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:18,480
But I will though, man

421
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,952
I'll be feeling great

422
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:28,685
It's fucking
celebration time

423
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:33,124
Oh yes this is...
this is big

424
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:36,497
I once heard this thing that
always stuck with me

425
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:38,064
I must've been around
13 years old

426
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:41,435
Cause I remember I just
put the baby up for adoption

427
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,598
They call the assembly
of my junior high

428
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,869
Cause this guy who played
drum for certain workmen...

429
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:47,841
Was coming to talk to
us about success...

430
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,345
and making your mark
on the world

431
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,206
I don't have any experience,
per se...

432
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,616
I'm a real... I mean
I'm a reaI hard worker

433
00:40:57,787 --> 00:41:00,983
I was real excited, cause he was
the 1st real celebrity I've seen...

434
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,054
And this was exactly the
kind of thing I wanted to learn...

435
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:04,955
How to follow in the
footsteps of...

436
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,320
I don't even write it
down, you know

437
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,088
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

438
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,527
And you should know that
I've worked with people all my life

439
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:14,561
So I'm real good with
people and...

440
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:17,902
I know how to work the roledex

441
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:19,765
So I listen real hard to any advice he had

442
00:41:21,307 --> 00:41:24,743
For sure he said something
that stuck rite in my real mind

443
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:28,039
It was all you need in
life... is love

444
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,578
And to believe in
yourself

445
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:31,814
then there's nothing you can't do

446
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:37,016
To make sure that i have all
this straight

447
00:41:37,187 --> 00:41:40,587
Basically, you've no experience,
no college degree...

448
00:41:40,723 --> 00:41:43,487
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

449
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,059
And now you would
like to be... a lawyer

450
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:50,427
No, see... I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

451
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:52,429
It said you were looking
for a secretary

452
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:55,297
Ok, well you need to
learn how to type...

453
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:57,027
You'll need computer skills

454
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,967
Most of our secretaries
have college degree

455
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:02,131
Infact most of them have
specialised in law

456
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:06,802
I don't mean to sound harsh, but
frankly this is a little insulting

457
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,010
All that looks great,
It must be wonderful, but...

458
00:42:11,149 --> 00:42:12,446
Can I tell you something?

459
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:16,177
When the beach party is over, you
don't get to say, you know what

460
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:19,413
I think now I would like to have what everybody
else has worked their entire life for...

461
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:21,114
It doesn't work that way

462
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:23,923
Fuck you, man!

463
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:25,424
Yeah fuck you!

464
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:27,461
You don't fucking
know me

465
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:29,655
Ok, great, that's great, see?

466
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:34,564
Now I'm so sorry I didn't hire you before.
Leslie could you please escort miss...

467
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,432
I don't even know her name, because of course
she doesn't have a resume...

468
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,062
No need, you fucking asshole,
you piece of shit

469
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:42,140
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

470
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:44,775
Take your fucking job and fucking shove it!

471
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:48,071
Fuck you Leslie!

472
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,479
All I need is love and to
believe in yourself

473
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,181
Nice idea, it doesn't exactly
work out that way

474
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,313
But I guess it was better to hear
flat out lying then to know the truth at thirteen

475
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:09,492
Fuck this phoney shit, told him to fuck himself,
kiss my fucking sweet ass

476
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:12,726
Slamped me out of the fucking
door, just like that, man

477
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:14,835
What did he do?

478
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:17,993
Not a fucking thing

479
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:20,871
Not one fucking thing

480
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:22,005
Stupid mother fucker

481
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:24,734
I've bet nobody fucking ever talked
to him like that in his whole life

482
00:43:24,877 --> 00:43:28,039
Fucking office job, who the
fuck wants a job like that

483
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,514
You gotta fucking sitting
in a little desk...

484
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:30,446
You got your little phone...

485
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:32,379
You got your piece of paper,
your little pen...

486
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,245
You write shit down,
bla bla bla

487
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,515
Fucking a monkey can
do that shit, man, fuck!

488
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,516
I thought you wanted a
job like that

489
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:41,247
You know what?

490
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:43,585
No. Toby, 2 more

491
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,428
Honey, Al says I can't give you
any tab

492
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:50,145
Toby, how long have I
been the customer here?

493
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,761
Would you cut me some
fucking slack here?

494
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:56,193
Go get me 2 more

495
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:01,667
Fucking lazy bastard,
it's no big deal, man

496
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:04,332
Al runs a tab all the time
you know...

497
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,376
he just probably doesn't
know it

498
00:44:06,512 --> 00:44:09,447
Leen, what are you
gonna do?

499
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:11,912
I got it on fucking
control, man

500
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,143
I'm kind of starving here

501
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:25,460
There's no way, you could
maybe ah...

502
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,623
I don't know, call your
dad or...

503
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:35,327
Yeah I know I know,
I'm just saying for you, you know?

504
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:40,567
Fuck it, man, I got shit
line up, you know

505
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:43,937
It's not a fucking big deal

506
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:49,539
Can I just give it to
you straight

507
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:53,277
The truth is,
I'm... I'm a hooker

508
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,610
I'm trying to clean my life up
here, you know...

509
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:58,050
Go straight and questions
and all, so...

510
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:01,214
If there's any link that you
can help me with...

511
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:06,394
That's because I was...
- That's not even matter gonna matter

512
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:07,596
Because the best you're gonna get is
factory work

513
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:10,258
Hey Todd, do we even have any
factory work?

514
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,221
Fuck!

515
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,467
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to talk to you here...

516
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:24,102
You don't have any
change, do you?

517
00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:47,094
Madam, I'm afraid I've to
ask you to come with me

518
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:48,835
Why?

519
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:51,065
Well we've had some complains
out here, so...

520
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,607
So what they complained about?

521
00:45:56,815 --> 00:46:00,376
Cause I just got out,
it's my day off

522
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:02,950
A day off?

523
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:07,489
And what's a day off for a
whore, you go to church or something?

524
00:46:21,938 --> 00:46:23,803
Don't you remember me?

525
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,567
No

526
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,545
I busted you not eight months ago for
tricking up on 95

527
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:35,511
It seems to me you might
owe me one

528
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:39,150
Yeah, you sure went easy
on me

529
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:42,084
You almost broke my
fucking jaw

530
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,724
Please, you do time

531
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:48,460
Climb over

532
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:34,066
Sel?

533
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:37,631
Selby?

534
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:41,971
Selby? Jeses Christ,
what're you doing

535
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:43,445
What the fuck are you doing?

536
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,577
Please drop the fucking blade

537
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:50,586
I take you to a fucking
doctor, ok

538
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:52,152
Just stop it

539
00:47:56,494 --> 00:47:58,393
What are you talking about?

540
00:47:58,628 --> 00:47:59,720
You can stop Leen.

541
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:00,761
Stop what?

542
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:02,728
You can stop the game

543
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:06,525
I'm out there trying
my best, ok?

544
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:08,671
Why did you quit
hooking?

545
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:12,801
Cause I needed to,
alrite?

546
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,307
Because you thought I was stupid,
enough to support you?

547
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,842
No, Selby

548
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,776
That you wouldn't even
have to fuck me to get it

549
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:19,903
Because I'm so hard-up

550
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:22,073
No! no! Selby, that's
not the reason

551
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:24,344
You said we were gonna
party, party, party...

552
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,248
Well there hasn't been a fucking party!

553
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:31,624
Nothing! when I told you
that I'm starving

554
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,858
Cause you're using me
- No! I just...

555
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:39,025
Because I fucking killed
someone, alrite?

556
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:49,270
My last john, alrite,
I fucking killed my last john

557
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:52,239
I was raped and beat to
fuck and was gonna get killed

558
00:48:52,411 --> 00:48:54,936
But I won't... I didn't wanna
lose you, you know...

559
00:48:55,047 --> 00:48:56,844
All I could think about was that for the rest of
your fucking life

560
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,713
And you never know that
I fucking meant to be there

561
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:05,086
I didn't wanna die,
thinking that maybe

562
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:07,682
Maybe you could love me

563
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:10,951
So I killed him

564
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:17,630
I shot him, alrite...
I fucking shot him

565
00:49:25,242 --> 00:49:27,710
I'm sorry, I let you
fucking down alrite

566
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:30,641
Now, you know me Sel,
now you fucking know me alrite

567
00:49:35,216 --> 00:49:36,582
No, I don't wanna go

568
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:38,811
Sure you do,
sure you fucking do!

569
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:42,481
Leave me fun,
leave me fucking fun!

570
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:50,694
I'm sorry

571
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,794
I know...

572
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:27,022
He would have killed killed you

573
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:44,975
I need to get this taken off and
I'm gonna get a job

574
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:51,250
No, I understand that
if you can't get a work

575
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:53,318
I don't even mind

576
00:50:56,493 --> 00:50:59,985
I wanted to go back before
it was just... so shit scared of getting caught

577
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,359
You know that was the
only reason

578
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,071
I'm a hooker

579
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,394
You got a wet pussy?

580
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:49,037
Yes, sure

581
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:51,801
You like to fuck?

582
00:51:55,014 --> 00:51:56,446
Yup

583
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:02,820
Jesus Christ, you'll think nobody
ever talked dirty to you before

584
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:08,056
I just like to settle
first, you know

585
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,954
Call me daddy,
while I fuck you

586
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,599
I try, what you like
to fuck your kids?

587
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:28,974
What? I'm just kidding
with you

588
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:31,612
I'm just messing with you

589
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,472
I'll call you daddy

590
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,982
Daddy, see?

591
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,712
See, I'm calling you daddy

592
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,449
I do it all the time

593
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,419
$20 huh?

594
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:46,723
Yup

595
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:51,563
Some good shit here!

596
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:02,798
Come on, you wanna suck it for me

597
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:07,045
Come on baby

598
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:27,453
Life is funny... it's hard

599
00:54:27,922 --> 00:54:32,085
But it's also strange, how things can
be so different than you think

600
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,922
I remember I was just a
kid in before age club...

601
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:42,399
Set up this beautiful gigantic red and yellow ferris
wheel. It lit up to nite sky

602
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:46,402
They called it... the Monster

603
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:49,669
You want some money?

604
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,603
Oh my god,
are you serious?

605
00:54:56,147 --> 00:54:59,116
When I was a kid I thought that was
about the coolest thing I ever seen

606
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:01,116
Then I couldn't wait to ride it

607
00:55:01,286 --> 00:55:04,687
Sure enough, when I finally got my
chance I got so scared and nauseous...

608
00:55:04,856 --> 00:55:08,188
I threw up all over myself
before it even made 1 full turn

609
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:10,991
I gonna go and wash up ok

610
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:22,438
Just hang on a sec, babe, I gotta
wash up here, ok?

611
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:24,031
Ok

612
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:28,400
Hey where did you
get the car?

613
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:38,508
My friend, Thomas, saw me on my way
home, he let us borrow it to move

614
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:40,446
We're moving?

615
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:42,352
Yes, fuck this place, rite?

616
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:44,583
This no place for my girl

617
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:48,657
Oh, man, a real place?
an apartment?

618
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:51,888
Ya what you happy now?
- Yeah, I'm happy

619
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,128
I know baby, I know

620
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:57,562
We're good now,
I told you

621
00:55:57,672 --> 00:55:59,401
And that's what I mean

622
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:03,408
In my life, it has always been the
harmless stuff that hurt the most

623
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:07,508
When there're things so horribly,
you can't even imagine it

624
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:10,172
It's usually a lot easier
than you think

625
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:16,013
You never really know,
until you're the one standing there

626
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:52,419
No problem

627
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:57,782
How is your arm?

628
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:01,820
It looks weird

629
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,508
So ok?

630
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,275
Cos I knew I was coming
home to you

631
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:39,198
I love you

632
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,844
Waitress

633
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,855
This stuff is so good
thanks for taking me here

634
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:04,893
It's ok, it's ok you know

635
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,892
It's pretty fine, but.. man, someday
I'm gonna take you to some...

636
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:12,666
Real top places in the
Keys, like some reaI classy joints

637
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:14,708
Keys?
- Yeah

638
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:16,504
I always wanna go to Keys

639
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:19,578
I always wanna have a
house on the beach, you know

640
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:22,273
But I haven't even been to the beach
since I've been here

641
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,543
So gal I'll buy you a house
on the beach, how about that?

642
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:29,648
Those places are like thousands
of thousands of dollars

643
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:33,453
So what? You think I can't
get you a house on the beach?

644
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:36,585
What else you want?

645
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,157
You want a little purple porsh huh?

646
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:44,592
This is no-smoking area

647
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,002
You have to put the cigarette out

648
01:00:47,273 --> 01:00:49,297
What are you doing, man?
you gonna sing us a song or what?

649
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,567
Let me have that

650
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:51,303
Get your fucking hand off her

651
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,206
You piece of shit!

652
01:00:57,648 --> 01:00:59,708
We're paying fucking
customer here

653
01:00:59,885 --> 01:01:02,682
What? what you got?

654
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:04,482
You wanna bring it on?

655
01:01:06,057 --> 01:01:07,717
You all better watch your
fucking food...

656
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:10,794
Cos there was a fucking cockroach
in mine, size like this

657
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:13,521
This is not how you run a
fucking establishment man

658
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:41,214
So what's your deal, man?

659
01:01:41,723 --> 01:01:43,282
Where you like to fuck

660
01:01:44,759 --> 01:01:46,659
Like to fuck in the back?

661
01:01:47,095 --> 01:01:49,063
So really like to get
real rough?

662
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:55,597
Shit, I bet you get real
rough back there huh?

663
01:01:55,737 --> 01:01:57,499
Real nasty

664
01:01:57,971 --> 01:01:59,632
You like that huh?

665
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,240
Maybe you wanna slap me
round a little bit huh?

666
01:02:06,546 --> 01:02:08,706
Don't think I don't
see it, man

667
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:11,910
What, you can't speak?
what the fuck?

668
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:12,774

669
01:02:12,985 --> 01:02:14,111
Cat got your fucking tongue huh?

01:02:14,586 --> 01:02:17,522
I don't like it rough

671
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:26,455
I've never done this before,

672
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,781
Take your pants off

673
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:36,088
Thank you.

You are welcome

675
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:31,809
You wanna have a
beer with me?

676
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,307
Don't you wanna
come to bed?

677
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:39,817
In a minute

678
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:02,167
Wake up

679
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,007
Wake up, I wanna go out

01:05:27,098 --> 01:05:29,589
Hey, mind if I angle in on those nuts?

Flick his chair over,

Fucking office job rite?

And talking to people all day long,

01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:50,813
Sounds like you're at fun world

686
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,751
What's fun world?

689
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:19,346
Get the fuck in here!

692
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,477
In that fucking car?

693
01:06:25,086 --> 01:06:27,417
So? What are you doing?

694
01:06:27,787 --> 01:06:31,587
I'm just cleaning

695
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,249

01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:39,188
We don't need this

698
01:06:39,532 --> 01:06:41,966
Who the fuck told you

01:06:42,434 --> 01:06:43,923
Leen what difference

700

01:07:00,518 --> 01:07:02,678
Not in my fucking friend's
car, you are not!

706
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:05,049
Fine, fine, then I'll walk

707
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,954
Ok, I don't wanna sit
here alone all the time,

708
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,991
I wanna go out I wanna
meet people

709
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:15,553
I wanna hang out with people
without you fucking scaring them off

710
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,930
Where would you like to go?

711
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,468
I don't know...

712
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:27,870
Travel... see different
places

713
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:30,803
We could go to Fun World

714
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,177
You wanna go to Fun World?

715
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:36,312
Not now

716
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:38,817
No, now I gotta take the
fucking car back

717
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,185
And now we don't have any
fucking money like usual, Selby

718
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,484
So, you're leaving?

719
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,938
Hey Selby, check it out

720
01:08:07,146 --> 01:08:08,943
Hey, there're my friends

721
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:13,174
Hey remember me?

722
01:08:13,452 --> 01:08:15,250
I figure you guys would be here

723
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:25,261
I loved her...

724
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:28,230
But the thing no one ever
realised about me...

725
01:08:28,332 --> 01:08:30,732
Was believe that I could learn

726
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:33,998
I could train myself into
anything

727
01:08:35,605 --> 01:08:38,439
People always look
down their noses at hookers

728
01:08:39,176 --> 01:08:42,736
Never give you a chance because
they think you took the easy way out

729
01:08:42,912 --> 01:08:47,315
And no one could imagine the
will power it took to what we do

730
01:08:47,484 --> 01:08:51,147
Walkin the streets,
nite after nite

731
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:54,612
Taking the hitch and still
getting back up

732
01:08:54,657 --> 01:08:56,386
We wanna go again

733
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:59,689
But I did,
and they don't miss out

734
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:04,197
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipline myself to

735
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,524
And I believe in something

736
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:09,763
And I believed in her

737
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:15,239
I need to sit down

738
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:18,133
Oh there she is
- Who is she?

739
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:20,680
I gotta talk to her

740
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:22,646
Hey you wanna ride
the Ferris Wheel?

741
01:09:23,051 --> 01:09:24,483
Nope

742
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,215
We're gonna go sit down

743
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:53,908
Are you ok?

744
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,221
My brothers and sisters,
screwed me royal

745
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,854
After my daddy killed
himself, we were out on the streets

746
01:10:12,096 --> 01:10:15,826
And the neighbors would let them stay
over but only if I didn't tag along

747
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:17,264
So I stayed clear

748
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:19,630
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

749
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:21,903
I was having a hook
anyway...

750
01:10:22,071 --> 01:10:26,707
So I always made sure they had new cloths,
cigarettes, and stuff like that

751
01:10:26,742 --> 01:10:30,803
But then there's 1 nite, we're at this party and this
guy comes in and he's like...

752
01:10:30,912 --> 01:10:32,573
She fucked so and so

753
01:10:33,014 --> 01:10:34,982
And they're are all embarrassed..

754
01:10:35,217 --> 01:10:37,776
They were fucking standing
in the corner, all...

755
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:42,985
So they... you know they
threw me out of the snow

756
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:46,555
Screaming out, I'm a whore,
and they were so embarrassed...

757
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:48,854
And they hate me
and all that

758
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:51,197
And that was it

759
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:54,859
I just took off never
went back

760
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:56,962
That's really sad

761
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,938
Your own family doing that to you

762
01:11:00,073 --> 01:11:02,268
That's how people are,
Selby

763
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,900
Yeah... I know

764
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:07,409
Fuck them,
who need them?

765
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:08,973
Right

766
01:11:09,214 --> 01:11:10,306
Yeah, fuck them!

767
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:12,349
No, right, Selby, right!

768
01:11:24,263 --> 01:11:26,696
Get out!
get the fuck out!

769
01:11:28,966 --> 01:11:30,092
You all ok?

770
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:35,763
I'm gonna call an ambulance

771
01:11:35,807 --> 01:11:37,297
That's ok

772
01:11:37,775 --> 01:11:39,173
We don't have any insurance

773
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:42,005
We just rather...
do it ourselves

774
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:58,818
You know, she's good

775
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:01,455
You have yourselves a
good day now, ok

776
01:12:15,075 --> 01:12:18,374
Let's go, Selby, now!
- No! no! I wanna drive

777
01:12:22,182 --> 01:12:24,582
He's fucking dead,
let's go, now!

778
01:12:25,452 --> 01:12:27,476
No!
- Selby!

779
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:44,029
Who killed that man?

780
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:47,498
What do you think?

781
01:12:48,006 --> 01:12:52,339
Oh my god, they're coming for us

782
01:12:54,246 --> 01:12:55,178
What are you talking
about?

783
01:12:55,313 --> 01:12:57,440
You fucking killing people

784
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:05,581
Now listen to me,
they are not coming

785
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:11,791
I never wanted you in this
shit to begin with

786
01:13:11,928 --> 01:13:14,158
But I know what
I am doing

787
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,922
And you'll never gonna
understand it, alrite?

788
01:13:16,065 --> 01:13:18,033
You gotta trust me

789
01:13:25,307 --> 01:13:28,044
They don't have
1 fucking thing

790
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:29,203
They got nothing

791
01:13:29,344 --> 01:13:33,075
They are not even looking, man,
this shit is long over already

792
01:13:33,215 --> 01:13:37,344
I didn't want wreck the fucking car in public
but we did you know, we did

793
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:41,012
So if they'll gonna call the cops,
they would've done it by now!

794
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:45,024
How could you?

795
01:13:46,193 --> 01:13:47,625
You knew

796
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:56,297
No... I knew about 1... 1

797
01:13:56,436 --> 01:14:01,032
No, Selby... no Sel

798
01:14:09,915 --> 01:14:11,382
Come in here

799
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:20,482
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget about all this alrite?

800
01:14:20,558 --> 01:14:22,150
Cheers

801
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,558
Leen, this isn't funny

802
01:14:24,762 --> 01:14:27,026
You don't know what's
going on, Sel

803
01:14:27,298 --> 01:14:31,393
I do, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whole world...

804
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:34,530
The least you can do
is hear me out

805
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,486
It's not what you
think it is, alrite

806
01:14:50,521 --> 01:14:51,453
I know what it is

807
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,953
No, you don't know
my life, Selby!

808
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,426
But I know yours

809
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,792
And I've done everything
in the whole wide world

810
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,493
Hoping that you'll never
have to know

811
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:11,499
So that you can go on
thinking that people are good

812
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:15,309
And kind and that it should
make sense, you know?

813
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,539
Cause I love that
about your, Sel

814
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:18,440
But I can't

815
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:21,537
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

816
01:15:22,182 --> 01:15:23,547
But you need to

817
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:26,514
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kill people

818
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:39,463
I'm good with the Lord

819
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:41,189
I'm fine with him

820
01:15:43,702 --> 01:15:45,567
And I know how you were raised alrite

821
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,469
And I know how people fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

822
01:15:49,573 --> 01:15:50,540
They gonna tell you that 'thou shall not kill' and
all that

823
01:15:53,211 --> 01:15:55,201
But that's not the way the
world works, Selby

824
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:58,543
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day living it

825
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,616
Who the fuck knows,
what god knows?

826
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:09,292
People kill each other everyday

827
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:10,919
And for what?

828
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:17,089
For politics, for religion,
and they're heros...

829
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:21,032
No.. no... there are a lot of
shit I can't do anymore

830
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,503
But killing's not one of them

831
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:26,302
And letting those fucking bastard going out
there raping somebody else isn't either

832
01:16:26,508 --> 01:16:28,373
No, no, Leen there
was 1 man

833
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,569
They can't all
has been bad

834
01:16:31,913 --> 01:16:36,350
You know me, you think
I could do it otherwise?

835
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:40,951
I'm not a bad person,
I'm a real good person

836
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:48,094
So, don't feel bad,
it's life, Sel

837
01:16:48,196 --> 01:16:52,461
People like me and you go
down every fucking... day

838
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,768
It's almost over,
look at this

839
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:05,602
See this?
it's everything

840
01:17:05,744 --> 01:17:07,939
Everything you ever
wanted

841
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:11,083
Just a little more, and a car
we're out of here

842
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:12,980
We have a shot, Sel

843
01:17:14,186 --> 01:17:19,282
We have a shot, at a real life,
not this, a real one

844
01:17:25,096 --> 01:17:26,427
You know what to do, rite?

845
01:17:28,932 --> 01:17:30,797
See you later
- Ok

846
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:35,928
So everything is working out,
and we are real happy

847
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,233
But I just thought that you
can tell my family

848
01:17:41,377 --> 01:17:45,507
So you're choosing to go
this way

849
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:48,515
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

850
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:51,517
This is the way I am

851
01:17:51,653 --> 01:17:53,621
And I'm not gonna feel
bad about it anymore

852
01:17:53,688 --> 01:17:55,850
You can tell him that too

853
01:17:57,826 --> 01:18:01,193
I know you think you're all romantic
about that girl

854
01:18:09,803 --> 01:18:13,136
What? I'm saying it's
not their fault

855
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:16,402
Blacks or whoever you wanna
call them, Selby

856
01:18:17,478 --> 01:18:20,675
The point is, people make
bad choices

857
01:18:21,482 --> 01:18:24,780
And they pay for it, you can see
all these miserable straight people...

858
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:28,018
And we see you choosing, this life..
this gay life

859
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:30,486
And even more than that, the easy life with this...

860
01:18:30,657 --> 01:18:33,785
No.. she has had a real hard life

861
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,491
Lots of people have bad lives, and they
still choose to move towards the light...

862
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:41,725
Otherwise we all be
hookers and druggies...

863
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:45,266
I don't wanna hear this

864
01:18:45,537 --> 01:18:47,265
This is not the point

865
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:50,169
Don't fight the world, honey

866
01:18:50,742 --> 01:18:53,608
There's so much more than just love out there

867
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:59,171
And someday all you gonna want is a roof over your
head even if you do have to sleep with a man to get it

868
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:01,116
And that's your choice

869
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:03,776
Yeah, it is my choice

870
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:06,479
Cos we're in love

871
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,751
What? We you going on a hike?

872
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:13,854
Man, just get rite here

873
01:19:14,197 --> 01:19:16,256
The car was good

874
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,563
Not when there's a
fucking gun in it

875
01:19:21,704 --> 01:19:25,470
So, lots of people have guns

876
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,940
Well you gonna undress or what?

877
01:19:32,113 --> 01:19:33,808
No, you 1st

878
01:19:37,752 --> 01:19:43,280
So... you married rite?
you don't get that fucking shit

879
01:19:43,757 --> 01:19:46,693
Come out here with strange gals,
do dirty things with them

880
01:19:48,295 --> 01:19:50,286
Why, man, so you can rape them?

881
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:55,426
No, Good lord
- Fucking man

882
01:19:55,635 --> 01:19:57,432
I fucking hate them

883
01:19:57,637 --> 01:19:59,435
Then why are you a hooker?

884
01:19:59,573 --> 01:20:03,008
I'm not a hooker, see,
I don't fuck, man

885
01:20:03,743 --> 01:20:06,973
Used to, mostly against my will though

886
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:09,775
This old guy used to rape me when I was eight

887
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,578
Real good friend of my
dad's, you know

888
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:17,348
So I go to my dad,
tell him what's going on...

889
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:19,649
My dad don't fucking
believe me, so...

890
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:21,782
His friend keeps raping
me for years

891
01:20:24,262 --> 01:20:28,721
And that's my dad... fucking
beats me up for it

892
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:33,501
Where the fuck do you
think you are going?

893
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:37,807
I'm not doing it,
but I feel sorry for you

894
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:40,275
If you want a ride
you better come on

895
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,606
I don't need a ride, man

896
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:45,971
I don't need a ride

897
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:52,142
Cause I wanna take
your car

898
01:20:52,988 --> 01:20:54,047
You fucking think I'm stupid
enough...

899
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:57,955
To get back into your fucking car
with you when there's a gun?

900
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:01,959
Please!

901
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,699
Victor Borne,
that was his name

902
01:21:07,802 --> 01:21:11,829
My dad's friend...
some friend

903
01:21:14,574 --> 01:21:17,237
Years later I found out he
died in a car accident

904
01:21:19,313 --> 01:21:22,748
It's like God finally strike him down
for all his evil

905
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:26,542
No, you can't get away
from your shit forever

906
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:31,013
Soon or later,
it's gonna catch up with you

907
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:32,949
Motherfucker!

908
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:35,326
Where's the car?

909
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:38,829
Got all fucked up!

910
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:41,923
Is that everything?

911
01:21:42,101 --> 01:21:45,866
Got beer? fucking man,
I think we should just go

912
01:21:45,937 --> 01:21:46,665
How?

913
01:21:46,838 --> 01:21:48,328
Take the bus

914
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:49,872
We have enough money, rite?

915
01:21:50,075 --> 01:21:50,836
We do?

916
01:21:50,908 --> 01:21:53,342
I don't know whatever,
I'll fucking hook down there whatever

917
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,510
We can't take all our shit
on the bus

918
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,542
I can't get one rite now,
ok, Sel

919
01:22:01,386 --> 01:22:02,613
What happened?

920
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:05,812
Fucking cop, the guy
I wasn't even gonna do it...

921
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,287
Then he has a fucking
gun in his car...

922
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:09,754
So I popped him sure enough
he's a fucking cop

923
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:12,687
I think he was retired or
something but still, man...

924
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:14,296
I can't take the fucking car,
it was a cop car

925
01:22:14,498 --> 01:22:16,294
It got some fucking tracking device in there

926
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:17,056
Shit!

927
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,963
Fucker, tried to fucking trick me,
while he's got a fucking gun in there

928
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:21,831
Keep it down

929
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:28,208
Well you just have to go
and get us another one

930
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,316
No... no... not changing your
mind on me

931
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:36,510
Please

932
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:40,610
Leen... this isn't my plan
this is your deal, ok

933
01:22:40,754 --> 01:22:43,052
Your plan, the house
and the beach

934
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:45,915
Self-employed,
just like you said, your plan

935
01:22:46,026 --> 01:22:47,857
So you just have to go and
get us another car...

936
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:49,929
We are leaving now

937
01:22:50,831 --> 01:22:52,593
Get up!

938
01:22:55,935 --> 01:23:02,306
Alrite... you just give
me a sec

939
01:23:18,622 --> 01:23:21,319
I'm gonna try to get out of
here before the end of the week

940
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,721
That's good,
I'm proud of you

941
01:23:24,895 --> 01:23:27,420
Yes, I just wanted to say
good bye to you, Tom

942
01:23:27,565 --> 01:23:29,088
You've been real
good to me

943
01:23:33,938 --> 01:23:35,097
Are you alrite?

944
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,762
Yes, it's nothing

945
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:43,706
Sometime, I feel like everybody
just think I'm just a fat shitty fucking person

946
01:23:45,014 --> 01:23:47,783
All I'm fucking trying
to do is survive, you know

947
01:23:47,818 --> 01:23:49,808
I know
- Yeah

948
01:23:49,985 --> 01:23:51,612
I know exactly

949
01:23:52,054 --> 01:23:54,181
I know what you
do for living

950
01:23:54,356 --> 01:23:55,914
But It doesn't bother
me at all

951
01:23:56,024 --> 01:23:59,459
I know you didn't dial it up
on a god dammed telephone

952
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:02,688
That's where you lended,
that's what you've had to do

953
01:24:02,864 --> 01:24:06,595
What you're feeling rite now,
is just guilt

954
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:09,904
Over something you've had
absolutely no control over

955
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,770
You know how many of us
came back from the war?

956
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:14,237
And almost kill ourselves...

957
01:24:14,407 --> 01:24:17,740
Because we felt exactly the
samething you do rite now!

958
01:24:18,111 --> 01:24:20,045
Yeah?
- Yeah

959
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:21,238
And I never get it

960
01:24:21,381 --> 01:24:23,405
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

961
01:24:23,549 --> 01:24:26,576
And they sure as hell wouldn't
ever get fucking circumstances

962
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:31,019
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactly it, that's exactly it

963
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,015
You know, it's like I feel
like I never had a fucking choice

964
01:24:34,126 --> 01:24:36,491
You never did,
but you got a live

965
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,160
You got a live

966
01:24:57,981 --> 01:25:01,974
We are not able to positively
confirm a profile at this time...

967
01:25:02,052 --> 01:25:04,520
However the evidence does
suggest that...

968
01:25:04,555 --> 01:25:09,014
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the Central Act

969
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,057
Perhaps that's the act
prostitution?

970
01:25:17,733 --> 01:25:20,860
Yeah, that's exactly right

971
01:25:30,545 --> 01:25:32,068
Get the fuck out of here

972
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,906
Get the fuck out of here!

973
01:26:35,372 --> 01:26:37,704
These here my kids

974
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,607
They are down in Miami...

975
01:26:39,808 --> 01:26:43,006
So I'm just trying to make
a couples of extra bucks, you know what i'm saying?

976
01:26:45,848 --> 01:26:47,440
They ok?

977
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:51,881
They are fine

978
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,851
I'm just trying to
make some money

979
01:26:56,491 --> 01:26:58,186
Can you help me out?

980
01:26:59,394 --> 01:27:03,023
Maybe I can help you
out, you know?

981
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:07,295
If you need some help, I'll do what
I can to get you back with your kids

982
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:12,561
Maybe you need a room,
shower, some warm clothes...

983
01:27:12,773 --> 01:27:14,469
My son's room is empty
if you want it

984
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:17,700
And I'm sure my wife
wouldn't mind a bit

985
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:19,239
Pull the car over
- I'm sorry

986
01:27:19,379 --> 01:27:20,846
No, just pull the car over

987
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,579
The car's still rolling,
you can't get out

988
01:27:23,749 --> 01:27:25,115
Stop... the car

989
01:27:25,786 --> 01:27:29,152
Listen, they can't barely see
you out there

990
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:45,164
Are you in some kind
of...

991
01:27:47,205 --> 01:27:49,400
Just drive the car

992
01:28:04,687 --> 01:28:06,177
Stop rite here

993
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:11,021
Look there ain't othing that we can't fix

994
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,698
Get out of the car

995
01:28:26,274 --> 01:28:30,607
The keys in the car,
that's my wallet

996
01:28:34,782 --> 01:28:36,215
Turn around

997
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:38,410
No, madam... no

998
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:41,914
You don't have to do this

999
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:43,046
Get down

1000
01:28:44,759 --> 01:28:46,749
You really don't

1001
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:51,627
I can't

1002
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:53,263
You don't have to

1003
01:28:53,432 --> 01:28:57,199
You just having a hard time
- No, I can't let you live

1004
01:28:59,972 --> 01:29:03,806
Oh God, my wife...
my wife

1005
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:08,239
My daughter is having a baby
- Shut the fuck up!

1006
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:13,347
Oh God I'm sorry

1007
01:29:46,182 --> 01:29:47,649
I got a car, Sel

1008
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,381
We gotta go, alrite,
you gotta drive

1009
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:55,947
It's out
- What, what's out?

1010
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,285
Sketches of us

1011
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:24,073
You're all set

1012
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:29,552
So you'll gonna get in tomorrow
alrite?

1013
01:30:32,257 --> 01:30:36,319
I always said I'll take you to the
bus, I'll take it, you know

1014
01:30:36,495 --> 01:30:38,325
Where I wanted to go

1015
01:31:19,736 --> 01:31:24,536
I know I did...
I did the fuck up!

1016
01:31:42,556 --> 01:31:47,993
Maybe you can...
help me?

1017
01:32:00,105 --> 01:32:04,098
I don't know... if I can
forgive myself for...

1018
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:18,389
You'll come back to me,
You'll come back

1019
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:35,161
I mean, you come back here
and we go far far away

1020
01:32:41,477 --> 01:32:42,671
Go

1021
01:32:53,088 --> 01:32:56,182
No

You take it, and

1025
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:21,197

1026
01:34:21,336 --> 01:34:25,328
Hey, this is my only
friend, Tom

1027
01:34:29,143 --> 01:34:32,670
We've got a fire outside,
the old conversation pit

1028
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:35,905
Oh come on

1029
01:34:49,929 --> 01:34:52,455
You run away fast
- What?

1030
01:34:52,632 --> 01:34:55,691
Yes you are, I wanna
drive you out of here

1031
01:34:58,137 --> 01:35:02,095
I gotta stay here by the
phone for my girl

1032
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:04,234
Cause I gotta call her

1033
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:07,440
Cause she left, Tom

1034
01:35:08,313 --> 01:35:12,079
But she's gonna come back, ok

1035
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,512
You've got a fucking wife and
you tell me to come with you...

1036
01:35:16,621 --> 01:35:19,145
What the fuck are you
doing, man?

1037
01:35:19,289 --> 01:35:24,192
Not you, Tom,
not fucking you, Tom

1038
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:26,258
Fuck, man!

1039
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:42,270
You got some bucks

1040
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:43,941
You want change?

1041
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:45,408

01:35:45,514 --> 01:35:47,414
Let's go, I got some

01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:48,709
So if you want, come

My car is over there

01:35:54,723 --> 01:35:57,555
Yes, rite over there,

1046
01:36:07,634 --> 01:36:10,035
Man, what the fuck

1049
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,858
Oh man, it's good to
hear your voice

1050
01:36:36,995 --> 01:36:38,189
Yeah you too

1051
01:36:38,362 --> 01:36:39,989
So, you back down
here huh?

1052
01:36:40,264 --> 01:36:44,564
Yeah, I came down to
see what was going on

1053
01:36:47,171 --> 01:36:51,163
Oh man, am I glad to hear that

1054
01:36:53,677 --> 01:36:56,737
Yeah?
- no, we all rite, because...

1055
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,180
They caught in here with some old
warrant or something, you know

1056
01:37:02,519 --> 01:37:04,315
But, I'm...

1057
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:07,347
Where are you now?

1058
01:37:07,524 --> 01:37:09,184
In a motel room

1059
01:37:10,726 --> 01:37:13,718
I wished I was there
with you rite now

1060
01:37:17,366 --> 01:37:22,132
But Leen... they went
up to see my parents

1061
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:24,337
They were asking all
kind of questions

1062
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:27,131
Yeah, you now well

1063
01:37:27,774 --> 01:37:30,642
I rather not talk on the
phone here, you know...

1064
01:37:30,745 --> 01:37:35,238
Because, because I don't
know if they're, you know...

1065
01:37:35,415 --> 01:37:38,475
But... don't worry about
that, Sel

1066
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:42,247
I mean that's just some mistaken identity
or something, you know

1067
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,884
They've got nothing

1068
01:37:44,057 --> 01:37:46,257
So just talk about
us, you know?

1069
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:49,853
I can't Leen, my picture's
on the paper

1070
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:52,424
From when we crashed the car

1071
01:37:53,432 --> 01:37:57,596
Selby... what are you
talking about?

1072
01:37:57,770 --> 01:38:00,932
I'm talking about when
we crashed the red car

1073
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:03,801
Why are you saying that?

1074
01:38:03,976 --> 01:38:06,773
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know Leen

1075
01:38:07,512 --> 01:38:11,572
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

1076
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:19,588
No, Selby, I wouldn't do that,
you know, I would never do that ok

1077
01:38:19,923 --> 01:38:23,881
So... just chill out
here, ok?

1078
01:38:24,028 --> 01:38:25,723
How am I supposed
to do that?

1079
01:38:25,896 --> 01:38:28,296
You gonna let me go down for
something you did

1080
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,391
Selby, I didn't do anything

1081
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:40,132
Leen, you know what
I'm talking about

1082
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:45,371
What are you doing?

1083
01:38:47,215 --> 01:38:49,046
I'm not doing anything

1084
01:38:54,055 --> 01:38:56,285
Where's the money, Sel?

1085
01:38:58,126 --> 01:38:59,854
What money?

1086
01:39:00,728 --> 01:39:04,357
The money I gave you

1087
01:39:05,532 --> 01:39:07,796
What are you talking about?

1088
01:39:09,537 --> 01:39:12,130
I don't know what are
you talking about, Leen

1089
01:39:19,011 --> 01:39:21,674
Nothing, just some change

1090
01:39:21,815 --> 01:39:24,749
Yeah, I got that

1091
01:39:30,455 --> 01:39:33,186
I just wanna leave, Leen

1092
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:37,194
I just want a normal
happy life

1093
01:39:37,328 --> 01:39:39,660
I don't know why you
did this

1094
01:39:42,867 --> 01:39:44,801
Cause I love you

1095
01:39:47,071 --> 01:39:52,838
Cause I love you, and I never
wanted to lose you that's all

1096
01:39:54,112 --> 01:39:59,105
I love you with all my heart,
my soul, my mind

1097
01:39:59,883 --> 01:40:04,012
And I never let you
down, alrite

1098
01:40:07,656 --> 01:40:09,453
Cause it was me

1099
01:40:10,793 --> 01:40:13,818
It was only me

1100
01:40:14,028 --> 01:40:16,088
And I'll tell them that, ok

1101
01:40:16,365 --> 01:40:18,356
But it's over for me now

1102
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:20,898
I'm never gonna see you again

1103
01:40:39,253 --> 01:40:41,585
That people could forgive you for
something like this, you know?

1104
01:40:44,157 --> 01:40:45,852
But they can't...

1105
01:40:45,992 --> 01:40:47,789
They can't end

1106
01:41:42,811 --> 01:41:44,210
Thank you Judge

1107
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:47,642
And may you rot in hell...

1108
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:51,479
Sentence a raped women to death

1109
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:55,314
And you all, you are just
bunch of scum, that's what you are

1110
01:42:04,498 --> 01:42:06,329
Faith can move mountains

1111
01:42:07,367 --> 01:42:09,767
Love would always run away

1112
01:42:11,071 --> 01:42:13,596
Everything happens for a reason

1113
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:17,976
For when there's life, there's hope

1114
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:23,742
Hope...

1115
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,184
They've gotta tell you something
