- Her health's fragile.

172
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,284
lt's her cornea. She has keratitis.

173
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,787
ls she blind?

174
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,331
lt's an inflammation.

175
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,043
Be patient. lt takes months.

176
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,672
Take this to the pharmacy.

177
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,299
Thank you.

178
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,301
Whose child is she?

179
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,847
Nobody's.

180
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:39,223
"Lisieux, Normandy"

181
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,063
Theresa, l rarely ask anything of you,

182
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,482
l only ask that you hear little Edith.

183
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,819
Go on, Edith. Speak to her. She'll listen.

184
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,321
Go ahead.

185
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,364
Theresa,

186
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,910
l don't want to be blind. l want to see.

187
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,203
She's all bruised.

188
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,496
Go on.

189
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,416
l want to learn to read, and run like before.

190
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,001
l don't want to be blind.

191
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,214
Saint Theresa,
tell baby Jesus to look after Edith.

192
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,007
Go ahead.

193
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,636
Thank you Saint Theresa and Jesus.

194
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,971
Thank you.

195
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,677
This is it. You're here, Edith.

196
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,890
She can see. . .

197
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,976
She can see!

198
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,487
Titine, get up!

199
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,322
What is it?

200
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,366
He's back. He's taking Edith.

201
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:44,951
Get dressed.

202
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,037
They can't do that to me!

203
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,456
How can you go back to that job?

204
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,583
She'll see the country.

205
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,335
Go then.

206
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,546
Edith!

207
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,466
Titine!

208
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,927
Don't take my little girl!

209
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,221
Let her go!

210
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,056
Enough!

211
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,683
She's mad!

212
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,643
Stop it or you're out!

213
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,853
You have no right!

214
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,569
Don't do this to me!

215
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,571
Go!

216
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,124
l'll kill myself.

217
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,589
We're at Orly airport.

218

"Paris, Orly June 1 959"

219
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,011
Passengers are disembarking.
l see her. lt's Edith Piaf!

220
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,971
A young man's on her arm.

221
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,223
What did you bring from America?

222
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,474
An American.

223
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,809
What's his name?

224
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,396
Edith, please!

225
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,650
Like her song,
she's "carried away by the crowd"...

226
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,695
She steps into her elegant black and white car.

227
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,824
She looks tired, but is all smiles.

228
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,250
Silence! l propose a toast. . .

229
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,419
What a slob!

230
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,129
Slob yourself.

231
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,632
lndulge the invalid.

232
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,513
Watch out accordion man or you'll get a shiner!

233
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,475
Perfect timing!

234
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,895
Call the boss. l want free champagne!

235
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,190
l'm Edith Piaf, and l made a mess.

236
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,736
Everyone kiss. Even enemies!

237
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,237
Kiss me, Claude.

238
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,916
- Who's that broad?
- No idea.

239
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,834
Who gets the steak tartare?

240
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,504
Where did your handsome friend go?

241
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,255
Don't embarrass her. . .

242
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,883
Butt out Coquatrix, who rang your bell?

243
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,594
Well. . . Mademoiselle!

244
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,932
Miss Piaf, a pleasure! What can l do for you?

245
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,851
A lot. l want a present.

246
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,144
Naturally.

247
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,604
Well...

248
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,274
l wanted champagne, but l'll take a ring,

249
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,861
a big ring with diamonds studded everywhere.

250
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,072
Don't trouble yourself, we'll have champagne.

251
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,327
Here's a toast to the love l have for you all.

252
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,746
And l'll stand up for that.

253
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,248
Give me a hand.

254
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,172
l'd like to make a toast to Marguerite.

255
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:51,262
My composer, and my most loyal friend
in the business.

256
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,016
Don't blush like that, you'll make us cry.

257
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,742
You want an autograph?

258
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,619
l don't think so.

259
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,959
Bubbles and booze, perfect.
This is Claude's influence.

260
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,752
You're irritating, Loulou.

261
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,631
We're just back to Paris, we had some fun.

262
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,095
Don't play the broken hearted lover.

263
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,602
l'm waiting for someone. Get lost.

264
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,396
Let me remind you, you have commitments.

265
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,440
You're not alone.

266
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,027
Remember the first night at Gerny's?

267
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,199
l was a bum. She looked at me like a princess.

268
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,160
You were a princess. My princess!

269
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,163
To Marguerite!

270
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,333
To those who want to see me fall on my face.

271
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,294
They think l don't notice! Cheers.

272
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,052
Something wrong, Louis?

273
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,596
He's having a tantrum.

274
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,848
Get lost, we're busy.

275
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,735
You don't watch the show. Get busy.

276
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,405
You must work. There are no kids here.

277
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,117
You have to earn your keep. That's enough.

278
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,499
Little turd! You ruined my exit!

279
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,379
Go to the trailer. Make dinner.

280
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:16,091
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Louis,

281
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,261
the contortionist!

282
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,140
She's cute.

283
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,851
How old is she?

284
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,645
Ten.

285
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,147
No mother?

286
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,566
What for?

287
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,985
You must be lonely.

288
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,323
How about some brandy, in your trailer?

289
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,535
Come on over.

290
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,585
Do you know who l am?

291
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,798
l'm Theresa.

292
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,844
Are your eyes well, my angel?

293
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,221
Yes.

294
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:31,101
You're so sweet. Who'd you like to pray for?

295
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,646
l'll pray for Titine.

296
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,275
Good girl. l'm watching over you.

297
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,235
Never forget.

298
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,697
When you're alone, l'll always be there.

299
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,468
l've had it! l told you to change that wheel.

300
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,971
Don't argue. Just help.
We're all in the same shit.

301
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,726
- l don't give a damn!
- Then get lost!

302
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,525
You can't quit. Not over a spat!

303
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,237
Who needs a boss! l can't stand Caroli anymore.

304
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,864
- You're drunk!
- l'll go solo.

305
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,826
Fat chance! Circuses aren't on every corner.

306
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,745
Don't worry. l always land on my feet.

307
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,957
You were growing on me.

308
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,500
You'll get over it!

309
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,300
Saint Theresa, make him change his mind.

310
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,344
l want to stay in the circus.

311
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,808

312
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,406
He's all in knots!

313
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,799
ls the girl in the act?

314
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,634
Just a minute.

315
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,052
Do something.

316
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,555
They'll leave, do something.

317
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,935
Come on, do something.

318

l'm fed up with carrot juice.

322
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,191
As long as l'm your nurse,
you'll have carrot juice.

323
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,155
l prefer it dark, Simone.

l know it's hard,

327
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,759

lt's no use.

00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,603
What makes me sick. . .

332
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,272
is that l overdid it.

333

The last three years have been disastrous.

00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,657
What are you looking at?

339
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,034
l want some chow.

340
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,608
We sing for a bit, then we eat.

341
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,612
Singing alone's like begging.
With you, it's a show.

342
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,117
l want to sing there.

343
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,755
Hey you!

344
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,758
You can't sing in the street.

345
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,593
ls that so?

346
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,929
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

347
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,513
What's that?

348
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,350
She barely had a sip.

349
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:09,976
Come here.

350
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,062
You know "Du Gris"?

351
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,606
- Oh Mister. . .
- Shut your trap!

352
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,317
lf you sing it, l'll let you go.

353
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,570
My beat's over there. l'll look the other way.

354
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,702
"Mister, could l have a cigarette?"

355
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,705
"A smoke, that's all l ask"

356
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,167
"lf you like me, we can chat"

357
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,712
"You're sweet, you seem like a good egg"

358
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,549
"lf you were ugly, l'd say the same"

359
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,970
"l'd still say you were handsome"

360
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,640
"You can easily guess why"

361
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,811
"All l ask for is a butt, just a smoke..."

362
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,399
Next week's the 21 st. Sisters for five years now.

363
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,362
Prefer working with me or the factory?

364
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,573
l'd rather slit my throat
than work in the factory.

365
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,075
And you?

366
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,535
What about me?

367
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,662
Slaving in a shitty cheese shop?

368
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,415
Shut up! We're eating.

369
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,293
Anetta, don't make trouble.

370
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,004
There's your lush of a mother.

371
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,636
Edith. . .

372
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,182
Any spare change?

373
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,525
That's it?

374
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,653
Yep, l'm no Rockfeller, as you know.

375
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,489
- Give me bills.
- Don't have any.

376
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,785
l'm your mother. . .

377
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,245
Get lost!

378
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,541
Want me to sing for it?

379
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,501
Throw her out!

380
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,465
l'm an artist! What are you?

381
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,133
You'll see!

382
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,843
- You'll see!
- See what?

383
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,511
When you're down and out!

384
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,181
Pipe down or get out!

385
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,224
A piece of shit!

386
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,559
Go to hell!

387
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,982
Don't count on your daughter feeding you!

388
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,442
That's enough!

389
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,236
l'm going. You can finish my plate.

390
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,238
You're no singer, you shit!

391
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,616
Leave her be or l'll sock you!

392
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,578
Let's lose these bums.

393
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,789
Eat shit!

394
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,667
Go on, streetwalk,

395
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,754

"lt'll fall on the cold cruel stone"

00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,402
"Then to spend, in a hospital bed"

402
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,737
"An anguished night"

403

Thanks.

411
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,769
You'll hurt your voice that way.

412
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,396

413
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,690
Of course you do.

414
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,776
Here, my name's Louis Leplee.

415

We'll see what we can do with you.

417
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,283
You sing too?

418
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,910
No, but l have other talents.

419
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,539
Bring your sheet music... your usual songs.

420
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,792
And if l don't?

421
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,880
Suit yourself, sweetheart.

422
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,530
You're out all day
and this is what you bring back?

423
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,657
l trust you and this is it?

424
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,244
l keep some for my father. He's sick and broke.

425
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,288
l'm no social worker!

426
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,956

l'll throw you to the street, then you'll see!

428
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,130
Let her go!

429
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,090
Never! Never!

430
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,968
l'd rather croak than turn tricks.

431
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,263
- lf she dies, it's on your head!
- Shut up!

432
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,767
l want more, understand?

433
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,229
Or you'll spread your legs like the rest!

434
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,356
You'll spread yours first.

435
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,117
Albert, l'm sorry...

436
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,912
Stay, please stay!

437

Drop that asshole.

438
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,712
Etienne, give her a drink.

439
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,508
Coming to the Chinaman's?

440
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,634
Who's going?

441
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,469
The two Wops, Fats and Pops.

442
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,889
There'll be lots of coke and poppy.

443
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,350
How about some human warmth...

444
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,978
Because l screwed you once,

445
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,313
doesn't mean l'll do it again.

446
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,857
- Get it?
- Give me a break.

447
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,442
You know what?

448

l don't give a shit about all that, know why?

449
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,949
No? Too dense?

450
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,660
Because l'm an artiste.

451
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,246

471
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,382

You're like a bird.

478

You think so?

00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,473

Not now, hurry up.

510
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,616
A few days ago, on my way home,

511
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,953
perhaps luck or fate led me
to tonight's performer.

lt's her fault!

612

00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,638
They're friends. . . they're not mixed up in this.

625
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,808
Aiding and abetting is a crime.

What you're doing is disgusting!

632

This isn't the stage!

633
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,246
lt seems you have some unsavory friends,
like Albert.

- Hey Sparrow, a statement?
- Not now.

637
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,882
Let her stew in her shame.

638
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,719
Go back to the gutter, little bitch!

639
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,263

lt's not her. Get it?

641
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,267
Did you sing to get off?

642
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,686
lt's a funeral. Show some decency!

643
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,276
- One last question.
- Vultures!

644
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,694
Clear off!

645
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,447
Out of the way! Get lost!

646
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,240
lt's over. l'm finished.

647

They dragged me through the mud.

654
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,059
Yes.

655
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,188
Miss Berteaut, you must come with us.

656
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,940

For the last time, get your things.

You want to kill me!

664
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,591
You want to kill me, is that it?

665
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,593
Let me go, l said.

666
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,094
She's not leaving.

667

00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:58,116
Momone, no!

672
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,245
Daddy Leplee.

673
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,584
Oh, Daddy Leplee!

674
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,971
You killed him! Where's the dough?

675
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,184
What do you expect from a former slut?

676
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,604
Everyone out of my dressing room!

677
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,564
Mamie, stay.

678
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,866
l need a shot, it hurts too bad.

679
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,727
Call the American.

680
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,068
You can come in now.

681
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,241
What a triumph. lt was divine.

682
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,868
Doug. . .

683
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,955
l need some air.

684
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:12,292
l want to go back to Chalons, with you.

685
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:14,628


686
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,131
lt's four hundred kilometers away.

687
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,926
Go to hell, all of you!

688
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,220
l've had it with you all!

689
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,473
You're exhausted. lt's a long journey.

690
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,102
lt's always no this and no that.
To hell with that!

691
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,479


692
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,122
Let's go back.

693
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,374
Turn around.

694
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,502
Turn around! You spoiled it for me!

695
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,670


696
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,936
Her blood tests are catastrophic.

697
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,647
She has two broken ribs we can't set.

698
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,107
lt'll take weeks.

699
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,276
lf she has engagements,

700
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,570
cancel them, Mr. Barrier.

701
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,706
lt's tight enough. Get away.

702
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,418
Doctor, give me a shot so l can sing.

703
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,546
Sorry, but my admiration has limits.

704
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,924
Theirs has no limits, neither do l.

705
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,344
Cancel. You're playing with your life.

706
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,514
So? You have to play with something.

707
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,893
You want a new life? Get a new you.

708
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,645
- New what?
- New you.

709
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,356
Why didn't you call sooner?

710
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,861
l was busy. l didn't know
what you wanted with me.

711
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,323
l saw you sing. You've a lot to learn.

712
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,367
You're the first to say so.

713
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:14,206
ln three months no one will call you Kid.
Cabaret life's over.

714
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:19,753
"He had bright blue eyes
that flashed like lightning. . ."

715
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:20,962
"Like a storm in the night. . ."

716
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,758
Like a storm in the night! Articulate!

717
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,802
Again!

718
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,347
"He had bright blue eyes. . ."

719
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,099
He had bright blue eyes. . .

720
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,644
Are they words or sounds?

721
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,605
- What do You want?
- Perfect diction!

722
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,774
l sing the way l speak!

723
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,067
Badly.

724
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,279
You slur the words, and you don't understand them.

725
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,283
Slower, Marguerite.

726
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,828
lt's been 6 hours. Can we open a window?

727
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,162
We'll breathe later.

728
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,498
Again.

729
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,673
"He had bright blue eyes that flashed
like lightning. Like a storm..."

730
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,843
You don't listen! You're not living the song.

731
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,472
You have to be that woman in love.

732
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,058
Think like an actress.

733
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,647
He's mocking me.

734
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,108
We're tired. We need a break.

735
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,238
He makes me feel like l can't sing.

736
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,532
Who do you think you are?

737
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,702
You can't rest on your laurels.

738
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,080
l started singing at nine!

739
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,334
lt's okay. Don't worry. This is new and difficult.

740
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,296
You must become a performer, understand?

741
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,131
Live the song!

742
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,759
No one ever minded my diction.

743
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,596
No one. . . like who?

744
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,932
Creeps at Gerny's or on the street?

745
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,652
Do what l say or go back to the gutter.

746
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,661
Edith!

747
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:26,838
To my little girl who never forgot her daddy.

748
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,965
To the Kid!

749
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,344
Heard you got a mentor. Does he have bucks?

750
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,763
Not a cent... it's art for art's sake.

751
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,515
Art for your ass's sake.

752
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,935
Come on, Kid, sing something.

753
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:50,820
Give us a song!

754
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,366
"A woman that looks like a man"

755
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,286
"Stands no chance of making a killing"

756
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,957
"'Cos it's really the swish of her skirt"

757
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:05,710
"That makes any young lady so thrilling!"

758
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,673
"When a fella hears this swish swish"

759
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:13,176
"What he'll dare do is amazing"

760
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:17,055
"His view of the world gets all rosy"

761
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,892
"With excitement, his pulse starts racing!"

762
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,479
"Swish swish, swish swish"

763
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:28,024
"When she starts her little swish"

764
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,695
"Swish swish, swish swish"

765
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,406
"She's quite a dish. . ."

766
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,533
That's the way to handle her.

767
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,202
l let her get away.

768
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,956
l was too good to her!

769
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,735
You're stiff as a poker.

770
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,695
Lifeless.

771
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:14,863
Like a champ brawling in the street.

772
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,364
Performing is an art.

773
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,534
Grab them with all you've got.

774
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,078
You have great hands.

775
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,788
Use them.

776
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,498
Sing with them.

777
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,167
Again, Marguerite.

778
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,590
Put some life in it.

779
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:36,968
Your hands, your hands.

780
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,140
That's it.

781
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,394
- l feel stupid.
- Keep going.

782
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,448
Put this on.

783
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,328
People don't care about that. They like my voice.

784
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,915
How can you be so talented and so pig headed?

785
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,444
- Open up.
- l'm going to throw up!

786
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,029
What's up, is she drunk?

787
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,364
No, she's panicking.

788
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,326
The audience is waiting!

789
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,082
For weeks you bugged me for this show.

790
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,836
Get her on stage before there's a riot!

791
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,379
She's coming.

792
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:56,589
Edith. . .

793
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,758
You have three minutes.

794
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,470
This isn't a cabaret, it's a music hall.

795
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,764
What have l gotten myself into?

796
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,269
lt's stage fright. lt's a good sign.

797
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,859
Edith?

798
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,278
What?

799
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,531
This is it.

800
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,908
This is what we've worked for.

801
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,994
You can't crack up now.

802
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,498
Open this door.

803
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,585
No, l can't.

804
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,338
Open it, please.

805
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,927
Stand up.

806
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:36,392

The conductor has been waiting three hours.

823
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:01,769
So?

The premiere's in less than 48 hours.

- Miss?
- Yes, Suzanne.

Paul Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau is at 8:00 pm.

You see.

829
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,953
Ask him to come back at midnight.

Are you sure?

831
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,708
You're worse than Raymond. Do this, do that.

832

Stop it.

833

- She fired that pain in the ass!
- Stop it.

834
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,338
Shall l show you the gowns?

Yes, the gowns.

836
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,684
They're all here, Miss Piaf.

837
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,561
Careful of the pins.

838
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,189
The simplest one, no collar.

839
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,154
A man's been calling. . . He has something for you.

840
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,198
- What's he like?
- A soldier.

841
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,200
l said you couldn't see him.

842
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,077
He's on the landing. lt's awkward.

843
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,913
Since he's here, show him in.

844
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:11,797
Follow me.

845
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:15,134
Put it there.

846
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:20,681
Here she is.

847
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,267
Much better with no collar.

848
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,394
Well...

849
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:29,190
My name's Michel Emer, l'm a corporal.

850
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,484
This isn't the army. What do you want?

851
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,031
l have a song for you.

852
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,117
Another? l have plenty.

853
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,370
l premiere at the Bobino in two days.

854
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,913
l'll take this one.

855
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,665
l go to the front tomorrow.

856
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,463
There's the piano. You have five minutes.

857
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,678
Edith. . .

858
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:03,391
We'll have to wait.

859
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:14,819
"The hooker's quite a looker,
standing in the corner"

860
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:19,615
"She's got plenty of customers,
and money in her garter"

861
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:24,078
"When she calls it a day, she too goes away"

862
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:30,251
"ln search of some romance
at a working class dancehall"

863
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,796
"She listens to the Java,
but doesn't do the" dance

864
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,465
"ldling near the dance floor"

865
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,552
"Her love struck gaze is
on the artist who plays"

866
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,554
"And his long and flashing fingers. . ."

867
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,805
Stop.

868
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,142
l want it.

869
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,227
Everybody out.

870
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:53,232
You can't do this. We're already late.

871
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,775
What can't she do?

872
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,528
Play it. l want it for the Bobino.

873
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,363
Get moving.

874
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,200
You can't do this.

875
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,204
l can't? Then what's the point
of being Edith Piaf?

876
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,340
ln French, please.

877
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:19,925
She's too desperate, too poor. . .

878
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,011
Spit it out, Charles.

879
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,095
l'm not a translator.

880
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,096
"New York 1 947"

881
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,432
Pathetic.

882
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:30,061
Not in the tradition of
the French Cancan and Gay Paree.

883
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:31,812
A complete flop.

884
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,232
lt's not the first time you've had to fight.

885
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,236
Americans want beauties, not me.

886
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:42,448
l'm not the Parisian bombshell they expected.

887
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,700
Can you see me as a chorus girl?

888
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,411
Where's my feather up the ass!

889
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,338
Go on laugh. l don't connect to them.

890
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,674
l'm too sad, they're too dumb.

891
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:01,425
Yeah, too dumb.

892
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:07,848


893
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,228
You're on the front page.

894
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:13,396
Two columns.

895
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:21,821


896
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,913
lt's Greek to me, translate this shit.

897
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:35,459
He says they shouldn't let you go.

898
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,670
lt would be a grave mistake.

899
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,715
The Americans don't deserve you.

900
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,885
l knew something would happen! l must get changed.

901
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,804
Ginou, help me choose a dress.

902
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,892
Tonight l'm going out. l have a date.

903
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,486


904
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:07,742
What's this, Marcel?

905
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,785
Beef... go on, taste it.

906
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,081
lt smells like a wet dog.

907
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,501


908
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:19,503
What?

909
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:24,258


910
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,345
Your English is as good as the meat.

911
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:37,354
Don't like the place?

912
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,442
l'm a bit surprised. l didn't expect...

913
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:45,112
When you called to invite me out and said

914
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,531
we were two Frenchies alone in New York,

915
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,658
why not go out to eat,

916
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,745
l imagined something different.

917
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,789
lt's my local spot.

918
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,754
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

919
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,768


920
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,561
Two pastrami sandwiches. . .

921
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,854
Oh no!

922
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,858
l'll handle this. Two tournedos Rossini,

923
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:27,154
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1 938... please.

924
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,035
You must be starving.

925
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,955
Better that than boiled dog meat.

926
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,290
l'm sorry.

927
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,752
Let's start over. Okay?

928
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,923
How long have you been in New York?

929
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:47,800
Eight weeks.

930
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:49,718
Do you like America?

931
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,596
l couldn't care less about America.

932
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,391
l don't get them, and they don't get me.

933
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,018
- You must miss Paris.
- Terribly.

934
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,188
What do you do when you're not singing?

935
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:05,442
You could be a police investigator.

936
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,278
l knit.

937
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,823
Tell me your size, l'll knit you a sweater.

938
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,992
No thanks, really...

939
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,329
Those people recognized you.

940
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,539
Really?

941
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:26,547
They're saying that chump lost
his last two fights. He's washed up.

942
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,007
l'll shut them up good.

943
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,133
No!

944
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,012
Don't get worked up. l was kidding.

945
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:46,525
Very good.

946
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,121
Let's not be so formal.

947
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,372
Of course.

948
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,250
And when you're not boxing?

949
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,169
l train, l run.

950
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,795
And after training?

951
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:10,591
When l'm home in Morocco, l work on my farm.

952
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,593
You have a farm!

953
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,304
l raise pigs.

954
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:21,101
What?

955
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,311
Why not?

956
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,232
lt's true, why not?

957
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:31,028
lt's a lovely farm...
very modern with fine fat pigs.

958
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,529
Who works it when you box?

959
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:33,906
My wife.

960
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:43,791
You have. . .

961
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:46,919
magnificent hands.

962
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,631
Did you hear that Momone?

963
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:52,841
You do have nice fingers.

964
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,220
Listen.

965
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,263
What color are your eyes?

966
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,892
He leaned over to have a closer look.

967
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,394
And his breath stunk!

968
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,104
You can be such a jerk.

969
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,106
He is a pig farmer after all.

970
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,440
He said...

971
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,109
Violet blue.

972
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:11,902
Of course, violet blue.

973
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,530
lt was the way he said it.

974
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,740
He seemed like a child.

975
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,660
Then he said...

976
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,870
You look like a fairy.

977
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,082
That's a bit much.

978
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:55,988
Did you kiss him?

979
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,073
l didn't dare.

980
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,244
- lt was a very lovely evening.
- Too short.

981
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,041
Will you watch me fight?

982
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,334
Of course.

983
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,505
Did he try to kiss you?

984
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,592
Don't know if it crossed his mind.

985
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,303
Yeah sure. l believe that.

986
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:20,846
l'll come hear you sing.

987
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:27,478
Well. . . good night.

988
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,650
He's the love of my life!

989
01:24:44,120 --> 01:25:27,996


990
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,288
You were wonderful!

991
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:13,292
Mr. Lucien Roupp who is Mr. Cerdan's manager.

992
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,377
Mr. Jameson

993
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,713
from CBS television network...

994
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,674


995
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:33,979
Marlene. . .

996
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:41,445
Good evening. l'm sorry.
l simply wanted to have a word.

997
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,533
l haven't been to Paris for ages.

998
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,704
But this evening, when you were singing, Edith,

999
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,414
l was there...

1000
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,709
in the streets, beneath its sky.

1001
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:59,254
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

1002
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,798
You took me on a journey.

1003
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,134
You made me cry.

1004
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,846
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1005
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,224
Thank you.

1006
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,055
Come on up.

1007
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,397
l'm starting to like this city.

1008
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:01,108
The stars are out tonight.

1009
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,652
Let's go.

1010
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,085
Marc,

1011
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,462
do you know how long a frog lives?

1012
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,757
ln fairytales or in life?

1013
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:32,556
l've never read fairytales. . . to anyone.

1014
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,975
You haven't had the opportunity.

1015
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,688
Yes, but l didn't do it.

1016
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,282
"Dreux December 1 3, 1 959"

1017
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,242
Excuse me. l'm a bit tired.

1018
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,161
l'll be back.

1019
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:39,808
Lay her down there.

1020
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:49,109
l'm going back.

1021
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,485
lt's out of the question.

1022
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,821
Nobody tells me when to stop!

1023
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:54,781
What do we do?

1024
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:57,576
l'm sorry. Have everyone leave.

1025
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,036
- l'm going back!
- No, Edith!

1026
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:01,288
l must go on.

1027
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:02,622
lt's suicide.

1028
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,249
She must be hospitalized.

1029
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:09,463
No! Louis, l'm begging you!

1030
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:12,549
You were just in the hospital three weeks ago.

1031
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:14,384
There will be other galas.

1032
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:18,638
Take me back on stage!

1033
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,475
Take me back. l must sing!

1034
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:24,686
l must sing, Louis. l have no choice!

1035
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,190
Edith, please.

1036
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,818
- Do You hear them?
- Stop...

1037
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:34,571
Close that door!

1038
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:36,865
Take me back, Louis.

1039
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,994
Take me back. lf l don't sing tonight. . .

1040
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,831
lf l don't sing at least one song,

1041
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,543
l'll lose all faith in myself. Do you understand?

1042
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,310
Doctor,

1043
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,146
do what you must.

1044
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,884
Not this time, you guys.

1045
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:41,721
You expect me to fall on my face,
l'm in great shape.

1046
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:45,058
Tell your papers it's not my suicide tour!

1047
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,773
Padam.

1048
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:25,575
Saint Theresa, first of all thank you...

1049
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,412
l know you're behind all this.

1050
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:31,623
You sent him to me.

1051
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:36,336
l've found love, and l know it's your doing.

1052
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,590
Sweet Jesus, protect Marcel.

1053
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:58,460
Go, Marcel!

1054
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:01,921
Go now!

1055
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:03,757
lt's too soon, Edith.

1056
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:05,842
No, he'll win. l feel it.

1057
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,636
- lf there's a problem, you'll look bad.
- What problem?

1058
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,975
lf there's a problem, l'll call you. Now go.

1059
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,572
Hurry up!

1060
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:49,344
Go, Marcel!

1061
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:04,317
One round!

1062
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,084
Go on, Marcel!

1063
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,382
Kill him!

1064
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,840
- What's happening?
- Zale's injured.

1065
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,078
He did it? He's world champion!

1066
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:42,892
You look like an angel.

1067
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:47,105
Not like a fairy anymore?

1068
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,030
You are my champion.

1069
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,533
l want you to be mine for life.

1070
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:02,453
Nothing existed before you. lt's all gone.

1071
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,876
Stay with me.

1072
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:18,094
My beloved, yesterday before bed,
l crossed off a day,

1073
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:20,888
a long day, but also short.

1074
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:24,767
When the plane took off it took with it my heart,

1075
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:27,437
my life, my breath. . .

1076
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:30,773
My sweet boy, my child, my love,

1077
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:32,942
your scent lingers in my sheets

1078
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:36,029
and my heart sleeps constantly

1079
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:38,239
in the arms of sadness.

1080
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:39,615
My Darling,

1081
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:43,119
l love you. What have you done
to put me in this state?

1082
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:44,579
l miss you.

1083
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:49,000
l'm blank, listless,
as though waiting for something. . .

1084
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,586
Hold me tight against your heart

1085
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:55,965
and know nothing in the world
counts more than you.

1086
01:40:56,633 --> 01:41:01,888
- Return my heart to me.
- l think the French know about us.

1087
01:41:02,097 --> 01:41:06,517
When l'm in a restaurant,
they play "La Vie en Rose"...

1088
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:08,686
When l see, my love,

1089
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:12,857
how attached you are to your wife
and your 3 children,

1090
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:15,610
l feel like going far away,

1091
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,822
thinking someday you'll be grateful to me.

1092
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:24,494
l can't have you all for myself,
and can't live without you.

1093
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:28,498
God is my witness,
in this affair l ask for nothing.

1094
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:30,833
l'm ready to sacrifice all.

1095
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:35,963
"lf one day life tears you from me,"

1096
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,424
"if you die or are far away"

1097
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:41,219
"though you may love me, l will die too."

1098
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:46,099
"Paris, February 1 960"

1099
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,934
ln three months,

1100
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:50,394
that's right, in April. . .

1101
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:52,271
l'll be a hit at the Olympia.

1102
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:55,108
With a full house. We'll be flush.

1103
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:59,445
Edith, your liver cells
are not functioning normally.

1104
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:02,907
You've been ill. You need rest. lt's serious.

1105
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,743
l'm just 44. l'm not in the tomb yet.

1106
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,038
With the cancellations, we have no more assets.

1107
01:42:09,248 --> 01:42:11,332
You're saying it's my fault.

1108
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:15,128
That's not it, Edith. lt's the tax authority.

1109
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:18,089
We owe 1 20,000 francs as a first installment.

1110
01:42:18,882 --> 01:42:22,051
lt's jaundice! l don't need

1111
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,636
That's pushing it.

1112
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:27,557
l want to perform at the Olympia!

1113
01:42:34,606 --> 01:42:35,690
Anything else?

1114
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,860
Yes, we must stop giving in to her.

1115
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:41,445
l can't always keep an eye on her.

1116
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:43,698
She left the hospital too soon.

1117
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,952
The Olympia in 3 months...
lt's a disaster waiting to happen.

1118
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,787
She needs these challenges.

1119
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:51,873
lt's a losing proposition.

1120
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:55,418
Then l have to tell the insurance guys
it's all cancelled.

1121
01:42:56,378 --> 01:42:58,462
We must decide for her, that's final.

1122
01:42:58,672 --> 01:42:59,964
Whether she likes it or not.

1123
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,246
Edith. . .

1124
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:57,480
l said to myself, Edith it's all over!

1125
01:43:58,023 --> 01:43:59,899
He's got someone else. You lost him.

1126
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:01,067
He was having an affair?

1127
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:04,362
Would l be telling you this if he were?

1128
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:07,156
He left the restaurant. l was hiding.

1129
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:09,283
My Marcel crossed all of New York

1130
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:14,038
to eat with an old blind black boxer

1131
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:17,625
he had met a few years earlier. lmagine that.

1132
01:44:18,877 --> 01:44:21,128
Guys like that are hard to come by.

1133
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,880
My Marcel. . .

1134
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:26,384
My Marcel! That's all you talk about.

1135
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:28,177
Nothing else matters.

1136
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,975
But let me tell you, Ginou,

1137
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:36,185
l'll never have him.

1138
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,773
He'll never be mine.
He won't leave his wife and kids.

1139
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,614
He calls her every single day.

1140
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,576
l pretend not to notice.

1141
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,328
l want him to be happy.

1142
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:58,332
l'll be back.

1143
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:05,798
l could've been Edith Piaf.

1144
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:08,676
There's more to life than songs.

1145
01:45:20,772 --> 01:45:22,648
lt's been too long, Marcel!

1146
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:25,067
Call Orly. Catch a plane tonight.

1147
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:27,820
A long boat journey would kill me.

1148
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:29,739
l miss you, Marcel.

1149
01:45:30,907 --> 01:45:32,908
l can't be apart from you anymore.

1150
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:35,953
Maybe l should go back to Paris.

1151
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,164
Hold on.

1152
01:45:38,373 --> 01:45:40,458
l'm just Madame's lapdog.

1153
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:41,876
Stop.

1154
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:46,714
Rum, Coke! Whiskey!

1155
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,133
People think l'm a piece of shit.

1156
01:45:50,427 --> 01:45:52,219
Boozing it up in Belleville was better.

1157
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:57,266
You've dropped me, Edith.

1158
01:45:58,393 --> 01:45:59,393
Enough, Momone!

1159
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:03,898
Get her out of my sight.

1160
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,321
l'll be taking the boat.

1161
01:46:11,823 --> 01:46:13,449
Here's to your career, Edith!

1162
01:46:19,414 --> 01:46:22,291
Please Marcel. Leave tonight. For me!

1163
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:15,636
You sleep late when l'm not here.

1164
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,680
Thank God, Marcel.

1165
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:19,765
Thank you.

1166
01:47:29,901 --> 01:47:32,903
l'll make you some coffee. Don't move.

1167
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:41,412
Let me serve you.

1168
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:00,681
What are you doing there?

1169
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:20,910
l knew you'd come!

1170
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,207
Lucien had a rough time buying the tickets.

1171
01:48:32,088 --> 01:48:33,255
l have a present for you.

1172
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:38,636
You're in bad shape.

1173
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:40,846
You need sun. You're so pale.

1174
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:51,607
Ginou!

1175
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,819
Ginou. l'm looking for the watch!

1176
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:05,162
What's gotten into you? l'm looking for the watch!

1177
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,165
lt was here, in a long red Cartier package,

1178
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:09,959
it was here, dammit!

1179
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:20,636
What is wrong with you all?

1180
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:24,473
l'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

1181
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:31,647
l'm looking for Marcel's watch!

1182
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:34,066
What?

1183
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:36,569
Louis?

1184
01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:38,862
What's going on?

1185
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:43,617
You must be brave, Edith.

1186
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,870
ls it Marcel?

1187
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:50,082
What?

1188
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:54,670
The plane crashed. . .

1189
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:20,487
Marcel!

1190
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:36,253
"Come what may,"

1191
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:41,175
"lf your love is true"

1192
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:45,512
"For l will die too"

1193
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:48,557
"We will live on eternally"

1194
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:54,938
"ln the vast sky of blue"

1195
01:50:55,315 --> 01:51:02,029
"ln heaven all is harmony"

1196
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:05,324
"My love,"

1197
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:15,668
"Do you believe we love each other?"

1198
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,898
"God reunites"

1199
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:49,284
"Those who loved before"

1200
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:57,918
What more can l tell you, Miss Piaf?

1201
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:01,171
They say you're the best psychic...

1202
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:02,923
That may be,

1203
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:06,468
it's your third time this week.
What more can l say?

1204
01:52:07,137 --> 01:52:08,429
Why do you come back?

1205
01:52:10,765 --> 01:52:12,558
So that you can tell me again,

1206
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:17,187
so l can remember why l must go on living.

1207
01:52:18,982 --> 01:52:21,692
He died in the sky, so he must be up there...

1208
01:52:34,664 --> 01:52:37,207
"California, August 1 955"

1209
01:52:45,508 --> 01:52:49,136
Hey Jack Pills! Can you step on it?

1210
01:52:49,345 --> 01:52:50,679
l need some air.

1211
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:53,056


1212
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:54,391
That's lovely.

1213
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:57,227
Step on it. Our pin up's melting!

1214
01:52:58,646 --> 01:53:00,564
l'll get a sore throat.

1215
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:02,399
Then you'll take care of me

1216
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:03,859
like a good husband.

1217
01:53:04,152 --> 01:53:06,320
The best hubby l've had.

1218
01:53:06,571 --> 01:53:08,071
The first you've had!

1219
01:53:09,491 --> 01:53:12,576
You plan on gawking at us all day?

1220
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,206
l'm sick to my stomach.

1221
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:21,293
Watch it, you'll ram us into the scenery.

1222
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:25,130
Let me drive. Stop, l'll drive.

1223
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,466
That way Ginou can throw up.

1224
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:34,014
Go on, Ginou.

1225
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,934
May l help Madame. . .

1226
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:40,646
Go on, Ginou!

1227
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:44,775
Very good. Bravo!

1228
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:51,114
Bye Ginou.

1229
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:53,534
Wait for me!

1230
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:59,540
You sure know how to drive.

1231
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:04,962
At least our outing wasn't for nothing,

1232
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:07,005
we killed a tree!

1233
01:54:15,723 --> 01:54:17,724
Unbelievable, what shitty service!

1234
01:54:18,142 --> 01:54:20,143
Anybody here to take our order?

1235
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:24,898
Calm down, dear. Don't play the star.

1236
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:26,441
Tonight you play the Mocambo.

1237
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:27,568
Really?

1238
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,571
Remind me who's invited us tomorrow?

1239
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:34,658
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rodgers, Mr. Chaplin...

1240
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,038
What is that?

1241
01:54:42,208 --> 01:54:43,959
We never ordered that crap!

1242
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:56,346
Don't touch me!

1243
01:54:56,681 --> 01:54:58,682
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me, l said!

1244
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:00,767
Wipe yourself off.

1245
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:05,522
We'd better get a divorce.

1246
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:13,989
How many injections per day, Madame?

1247
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:16,617
About ten. . .

1248
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,455
Sorry to be so direct,

1249
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:23,665
but why are you doing this?

1250
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:28,962
So my body will shut up!

1251
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:34,551
When did you start

1252
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:36,678
these daily injections?

1253
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:40,557
Five years ago, after the plane crash. l. . .

1254
01:55:41,225 --> 01:55:45,187
l was becoming arthritic. l couldn't knit anymore.

1255
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:50,817
You are seriously dependant.

1256
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:52,986
An addiction. . .

1257
01:55:53,196 --> 01:55:54,446
Doctor,

1258
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:57,574
l'd like my wife to go to rehab.

1259
01:56:00,745 --> 01:56:02,162
l want to get better.

1260
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:03,705
l can.

1261
01:56:08,836 --> 01:56:13,048
"October 1 960 - 5 years later"

1262
01:56:34,445 --> 01:56:36,196
Danielle, a chair.

1263
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:47,165
Edith. . .

1264
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:56,049
Here, Edith.

1265
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:58,593
Sit down.

1266
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:10,647
Bruno. . .

1267
01:57:16,779 --> 01:57:18,155
There'll be no Olympia.

1268
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:26,788
l understand, Edith.

1269
01:57:39,343 --> 01:57:40,552
No!

1270
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:51,688
l want you to meet Charles Dumont, composer,

1271
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:54,399
and Michel Vaucaire, lyricist.

1272
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:57,110
They've come back to play their song.

1273
01:58:05,787 --> 01:58:07,579
Be quick. l'm tired.

1274
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:30,811
"No, no regrets"

1275
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:36,274
"No, l will have no regrets"

1276
01:58:36,818 --> 01:58:41,530
"Neither the kindness received"

1277
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:43,949
"Nor sorrows grieved"

1278
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:45,784
"l've forgotten the past"

1279
01:58:45,993 --> 01:58:47,077
Stop!

1280
01:58:48,704 --> 01:58:49,871
l like it.

1281
01:58:51,082 --> 01:58:52,040
Go on!

1282
01:58:53,167 --> 01:58:56,253
And the memories l had

1283
01:58:56,462 --> 01:58:58,755
"l no longer desire"

1284
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:01,424
"Both the good and the bad"

1285
01:59:01,634 --> 01:59:03,885
"l have flung in the fire"

1286
01:59:04,095 --> 01:59:06,429
"Swept away past loves"

1287
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:09,182
"With the heartaches l've withstood"

1288
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:11,935
"Swept away for good"

1289
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:13,728
"Like starting from the unknown"

1290
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:15,438
You're marvelous!

1291
01:59:16,023 --> 01:59:18,066
Exactly what l've been waiting for.
lt's incredible.

1292
01:59:18,276 --> 01:59:19,276
lt's me!

1293
01:59:19,527 --> 01:59:22,696
That's my life. lt's me!

1294
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:26,032
Call Coquatrix. The Olympia is on!

1295
01:59:26,534 --> 01:59:28,493
Play it again. lt's so beautiful.

1296
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:33,957
"No, no regrets"

1297
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:38,920
"No, l will have no regrets. . ."

1298
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,735
"Take care my favorite sparrow.
Your friend Marguerite"

1299
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:07,115
Everyone's here:
Aznavour, Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

1300
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:10,202
Montand's here? l read he wasn't in France.

1301
02:00:10,453 --> 02:00:11,661
He came for you!

1302
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:14,164
They've been waiting for 30 minutes.

1303
02:00:14,373 --> 02:00:16,208
The place is heating up.

1304
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:29,387
They're not too tight?

1305
02:00:32,516 --> 02:00:33,350
Who is that?

1306
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:35,018
A friend.

1307
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,583
Come on Edith,

1308
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:00,543
stand up.

1309
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:07,634
My cross?

1310
02:01:09,845 --> 02:01:14,224
My cross. . .

1311
02:01:14,642 --> 02:01:16,184
We forgot it. l'll get it.

1312
02:01:16,477 --> 02:01:18,436
l won't sing without it!

1313
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,481
Out! Everybody out!

1314
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:59,185


1315
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:34,637
"Grasse, October 1 963"

1316
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:36,973
"Her last night"

1317
02:02:37,391 --> 02:02:38,475
See you tomorrow.

1318
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:40,518
Go on. l'll handle it.

1319
02:02:45,983 --> 02:02:47,525
l'm afraid, Simone,

1320
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:51,237
l'm losing my memory. lt's very serious.

1321
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:55,033
My thoughts are muddled.

1322
02:02:56,077 --> 02:02:58,745
l'm trying to remember. . .

1323
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:01,164
but l can't.

1324
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,961
Other memories are surfacing,
not the ones l want to see.

1325
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,008
l wanted to see his watch.

1326
02:03:12,218 --> 02:03:14,677
Do you remember? Marcel's watch?

1327
02:03:14,887 --> 02:03:16,554
No Edith. l didn't know him.

1328
02:03:17,098 --> 02:03:19,307
l wanted to see his watch.

1329
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:39,911
That's some face!

1330
02:03:42,331 --> 02:03:43,540
You've got wild eyes.

1331
02:03:47,628 --> 02:03:49,003
The kid's not so bad.

1332
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:25,206
Simone.

1333
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:26,749
Yes, Edith?

1334
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:31,129
l didn't pray.

1335
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:36,843
l want to pray on my knees.

1336
02:04:38,429 --> 02:04:41,848
No one will reproach you
if you're not on your knees.

1337
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:45,435
l want to pray for my daddy.

1338
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:53,044
Marcelle. . .

1339
02:05:54,338 --> 02:05:55,922
My little ghost.

1340
02:05:58,425 --> 02:06:01,010
Only Momone knows about it.

1341
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:03,304
l need to tell you about my child.

1342
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,556
Take it easy, Edith.

1343
02:06:04,765 --> 02:06:15,191
Marcelle!

1344
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:18,820
Marcelle, go to bed. l've had enough today.

1345
02:06:19,029 --> 02:06:22,574
Think l can keep an eye out
for the cops and your kid?

1346
02:06:23,033 --> 02:06:24,826
What the hell's Louis doing?

1347
02:06:26,662 --> 02:06:28,162
lt's him. Your father.

1348
02:06:33,002 --> 02:06:33,918
Did she eat?

1349
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:37,213
They said you were on the street with her!

1350
02:06:37,631 --> 02:06:38,339
Who said?

1351
02:06:38,674 --> 02:06:41,676
You get her twice a month and you screw up!

1352
02:06:41,885 --> 02:06:43,928
l said not the streets!

1353
02:06:53,647 --> 02:06:54,647
Come quick!

1354
02:06:57,318 --> 02:06:59,068
lt's Marcelle! Come on!

1355
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:04,616
Marcelle's in the hospital!

1356
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:28,431
Are you her mother?

1357
02:07:29,933 --> 02:07:32,518
Meningitis. Nothing could be done.

1358
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,354
l'm sorry.

1359
02:08:09,431 --> 02:08:10,431
Edith,

lt's odd to see you so far from Paris.

1366
02:08:44,466 --> 02:08:46,175

1367

lt's already the case.

1375
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:20,418
Who are your most faithful friends?

1376

l could no longer live.

1379
02:09:33,682 --> 02:09:35,057
Are you afraid of death?

1380
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:38,686
Less than solitude.

1381

02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:00,249
What is your fondest career memory?

1388
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:03,961
Every time the curtain goes up.

The first kiss.

1391
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:28,444

Yes, with a lot of light.

1393
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:33,115
Dawn?

1394
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:36,536
With a piano and friends.

1395
02:10:37,037 --> 02:10:38,079
The evening?

1396
02:10:38,789 --> 02:10:41,249
For us, it's dawn.

1397

Love.

Whoever will wear my sweater.

1408
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:12,757
That's all. l hope it wasn't too long.
