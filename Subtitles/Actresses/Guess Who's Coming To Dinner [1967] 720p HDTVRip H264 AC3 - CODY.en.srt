1
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
You know,
I just had a thought.

2
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
Why don't I check in a hotel
and rest.

3
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,120
- You go find your folks.
- Oh, John.

4
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
You wanted to meet them.
Let's go meet them.

5
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
The sooner we get it over with,
the better.

6
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Mom may not even be at the gallery.
She'll probably be out to lunch.

7
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,920
Dad's at his office. You may not
meet them till dinner anyway.

8
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You may be wrong about them.

9
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,560
You should have called
and told them we were coming.

10
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,760
You may be in for the biggest shock
of your young life.

11
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,280
After 23 years living
in the same house with them...

12
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
don't you think I know
my own mother and father?

13
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
I hope so.

14
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
There's no problem.

15
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,160
We'll only be a minute, and then
we'd like to go out to Claremont Drive.

16
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,760
Right.

17
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll see if Mom's
in the office.

18
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,960
- Joey!
- Hilary, hi! How are you?

19
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,600
What a surprise.

20
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
- I'll be with you in just a moment.
- Okay.

21
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
- Strange.
- One of Hilary's favorites.

22
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,200
It's called a kinetic sculpture.

23
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
- A what?
- Look.

24
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,840
Why, isn't that something?

25
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,600
- Darling, what are you doing here?
- I thought Mother might be here.

26
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,680
Mrs. St. George, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Prentice.

27
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,920
Dr. Prentice,
I'm so pleased to meet you.

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,280
Mrs. St. George.
Pleasure to see you.

29
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,800
Christina's lunching
with Mr. Cazalet.

30
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,280
I can ring up.

31
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
No. Just tell her I'm back
and that I'll be home.

32
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Has something happened?
I mean, is anything wrong?

33
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
Something's happened,
but everything's right. Thanks.

34
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,960
How was Hawaii?
Was it fun?

35
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,200
Hawaii was simply unbelievable.

36
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,320
Do you live in San Francisco, Doctor,
or are you just visiting?

37
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,280
- I'm just passing through.
- I see.

38
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,720
- It was a pleasure to have met you.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,840
Bye-bye.

40
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
No, Hilary runs the gallery now,
but it's Mom who has all the ideas.

41
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,480
Her idea for filling hotel rooms
with originals is brilliant.

42
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
It gives people who stay there
time to decide if they want them.

43
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
The hotel gets supplied
with free decor.

44
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,800
The guests get to look at good paintings
instead of bad reproductions.

45
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,120
The painter gets a chance to make a sale
and Mom gets her commission.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,240
Next right.

47
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,080
- Isn't that clever?
- Oh, that is clever.

48
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,320
- What do I owe you?
- 10.50, mac.

49
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Twelve bucks, right?

50
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Right.

51
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,840
Right.

52
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,640
Oh, John.
Come meet Tillie.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,120
Tillie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss Matilda Binks.

54
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,120
Pleased to meet you, Miss Binks.

55
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I've certainly heard
a great deal about you.

56
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,560
What are you
doing home unexpected?

57
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,440
Your folks didn't know you was coming.
You told them you're back already?

58
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,560
I left a message for Mom
at the gallery.

59
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
It's lovely to see you.
I missed you.

60
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,720
You still ain't told me
why you're home early.

61
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,640
- You want those bags to go upstairs?
- Not my two. I'm not staying.

62
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,600
It's personal reasons.
I'll tell you all about it.

63
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,520
You eat any lunch yet,
or you expecting it now?

64
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,640
Could you make us sandwiches and coffee?
We'll have it on the terrace.

65
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
Do you like it?

66
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,520
It's beautiful.

67
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Come out
and look from the terrace.

68
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
- What?
- Hey, who's that?

69
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,720
That's Dorothy. Isn't she a knockout?
She helps Tillie during the week.

70
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,120
- Which days?
- Never mind.

71
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
You know, I ought to call my folks
and get that out of the way.

72
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay. Use the phone in the study.

73
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,800
- Are you gonna introduce me?
- Not on the phone.

74
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,120
- Aren't you gonna tell them about me?
- I'd rather write to them.

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,640
I have to meet them, don't I?
Before I come to Geneva?

76
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Or are we going to keep our marriage
a secret from them?

77
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Why didn't I think of that?
See, that's a thought.

78
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,720
I'll shut this
in case Dorothy goes by.

79
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
Los Angeles, please.
Area code 213.

80
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,320
Axminster, two, four, six, nine, nine.
Time and charges.

81
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, I got a right
to my own opinions.

82
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,800
And you want my opinion?

83
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,120
I don't care to see a member
of my own race getting above hisself.

84
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Then I don't want your opinion,
and if I ever do, I'll ask for it.

85
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Oh, Tillie, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,000
I didn't mean that, but you can't mean
what you're saying either.

87
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
And you're so wrong.
Look.

88
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,280
You're the last person I'd have expected
to take such a silly attitude.

89
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,280
You know I've always loved you,
and you're just as black as he is.

90
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,080
How could it be all right for me to
love you and wrong for me to love him?

91
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Will you just stop
and think about that?

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,680
Listen. What are we having
for dinner tonight?

93
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,120
- Gotta make it something special.
- Celery soup and rump steak.

94
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,360
Oh, now, come on.
Turtle soup and tournedos...

95
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,160
and one of your best pies.

96
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,120
It's Mom!

97
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,440
Joey, darling.
What the hell? Joey!

98
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,880
- Mom, I'm here!
- Hello, darling. Are you all right?

99
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,960
- There's nothing wrong, is there?
- Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.

100
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,480
I rang the gallery to tell Hilary
that Cazalet agreed to our scheme.

101
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,560
He has? That's marvelous.
I knew he would.

102
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
She said you were back. She thought
you might have a surprise for me.

103
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,440
What did she mean?
Do I hear someone?

104
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,440
- Is there someone here?
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy.

105
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,400
I've never been so happy in all my life.
I'm just...

106
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Bursting. Yeah, I can see that.

107
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,920
And I'm already feeling happy for you.
Do I know him?

108
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,040
No. That's just it.
I only met him myself ten days ago.

109
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,960
You wouldn't believe what's happened
in just ten days.

110
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,600
I think I might if you'd pipe down
long enough to tell me.

111
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
- Mom...
- Lots of wonderful things happen...

112
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
He's so wonderful!

113
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,640
I've never known anyone like him.
Never known anything like this.

114
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,440
I fell in love with him
in 20 minutes.

115
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,160
Well, that was quick.

116
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,080
Well, Dad, I wanted to stop
on the way back...

117
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,840
but time got so short
and I've got to get to work.

118
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,080
Yeah, but I still don't understand
why you couldn't spend one day with us.

119
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Well, the fact is, Dad,
I met this girl.

120
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,440
You what? You met a girl?
Why didn't you say so?

121
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,880
Mary, he says he met a girl.
Why, that's good news.

122
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,280
- She live up there in San Francisco?
- She lives up here. I'm at her house.

123
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
He says he's at her house now,
the girl's house.

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,280
Well, that's different, son.
Where'd you meet her? Hawaii?

125
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes, in Hawaii,
and I wanted to meet her folks, see?

126
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,840
That sounds good, son.
I mean, serious.

127
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes, it's serious.

128
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Well, this is quite a surprise.

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,280
Yeah, she's surprising
in a lot of ways, Dad.

130
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,280
Your mother says,
"Is she pretty? '

131
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
- Yes, she's very pretty.
- She's pretty. What?

132
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
Your mother says,
"How old is she, son?"

133
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Mary, what the hell difference
does that make?

134
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,720
Well, she's only 23, Dad.

135
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,760
Twenty-three. Well, that's good.
You want my opinion?

136
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
You're 37.
That's just the right difference.

137
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,440
Women age faster than men,
you know what I mean?

138
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,200
- You reckon to marry the girl, son?
- Well, we've been talking about it.

139
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,360
But...

140
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,720
Dad, there's one or two problems,
you see?

141
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
That I'll write to you about...

142
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,040
on the plane to New York tonight,
all right?

143
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
He's so calm...

144
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
and sure of everything.

145
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,040
He doesn't have
any tensions in him.

146
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960
He knows what he believes...

147
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,520
and what he thinks is right
and why and where he's going.

148
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,520
Oh, Mom, there's one thing
I must tell you.

149
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,360
He was married before,
and he had a son.

150
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,040
It was so tragic.

151
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,440
Both his wife and his son were killed
in a train accident...

152
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,400
in Belgium eight years ago.

153
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,800
And John...

154
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,280
I haven't even told you
his name.

155
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,680
Mom, it's John Wade Prentice.

156
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,600
Isn't that a lovely name?

157
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,400
John Wade...

158
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
Joanna Prentice...

159
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,560
I'll be.

160
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,720
But Mom...

161
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,000
there's something else
that I must tell you...

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,760
that John's been concerned about,
very deeply concerned.

163
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,240
He's been worrying for the past week
whether you and Dad would be upset if...

164
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Well, it's about time.

165
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
I was wondering where you'd been.

166
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,600
Mom...

167
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
this is John.

168
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,600
Doctor Prentice...

169
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm so pleased to meet you.

170
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Drayton.

171
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,600
I take it Joanna's already busted out
with the big news.

172
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,400
Well, she has told me a good deal
and all very quickly too.

173
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
Well, she's only known me
for ten days...

174
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,440
so she can't tell you
when I'm blushing.

175
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
That could be another problem
for us.

176
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,440
Mrs. Drayton,
I'm medically qualified...

177
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,920
so I hope you wouldn't
think it presumptuous if I say...

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,120
you ought to sit down
before you fall down.

179
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,320
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

180
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Well...

181
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,640
I don't think
I'm going to faint.

182
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,680
But I'll sit down anyway.

183
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
Can't we all sit down?

184
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,600
Well...

185
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,400
I suppose it would be all right
if I said, "My goodness," wouldn't it?

186
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,080
Well, my goodness.

187
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,200
- Do we mind her saying, "My goodness"?
- I don't mind.

188
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,200
What did they say?
Did you tell them about me?

189
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,360
- Yes.
- What'd they say?

190
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
They said I sounded serious
and asked if you were pretty.

191
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
I said you were.

192
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,840
They said this was a big surprise.

193
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,640
I said it was.

194
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Well, what did they say when you
told them I wasn't a colored girl?

195
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't. It felt like
too big a shock for the telephone.

196
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,120
After all, a lot of people will think
that we're a very shocking pair.

197
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
Isn't that right?

198
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,160
I know what you mean.

199
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,160
Tillie's made us some sandwiches.

200
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,120
- Let's go outside.
- Yes, let's.

201
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,040
- Come on, Dr. Prentice.
- I can explain it all in two minutes.

202
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
You see, John was invited to lecture
at Hawaii University...

203
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,280
and we met at this big party
at the dean's.

204
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,640
After the party,
we went for a long drive.

205
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,640
- Thank you.
- And since then, we've been together.

206
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,120
We've been swimming every day.

207
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Then John was supposed to fly back to
Los Angeles Saturday to see his parents.

208
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
That's where they live.

209
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,720
Thank you, Tillie.

210
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Try one of these.
They're great.

211
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,520
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks. No coffee.

212
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
Does your father know
that you're back?

213
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
No, I was going to phone him.
Do you think he'd come back early if...

214
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,400
He's coming back early, all right.
He's playing golf with Monsignor Ryan.

215
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
That's marvelous.

216
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,760
Then he can meet John
and we can all talk over dinner...

217
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,560
because John has to fly
to New York tonight to see a friend...

218
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,080
at Columbia University.

219
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,080
Then tomorrow night,
he's flying to Geneva...

220
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,560
to do three month's work
for the World Health Organization.

221
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,760
And I intend to fly to Geneva next week
so that we can be married.

222
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,680
And that's the whole situation.

223
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,800
In a nutshell.

224
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,360
Except that he thinks...

225
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,960
that the fact he's a Negro and I'm not
creates a serious problem.

226
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Does he?

227
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,280
I've told him 97 times...

228
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,680
that it wouldn't make the slightest
difference to you or Dad.

229
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,880
But he just wouldn't believe me.
So that's why we're here.

230
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,840
And that's why he's watching you
so closely right now...

231
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,240
while he's pretending
not to watch you at all.

232
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,680
She's absolutely right, Mrs. Drayton.
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
I told her not to spring all this
on you so suddenly.

234
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,080
But... Look,
if your father's coming home...

235
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
you could at least say
that I'm somebody you met in Hawaii.

236
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,080
- Now, really?
- Give him a half hour to get adjusted.

237
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,360
But what for?
He still has to be told, doesn't he?

238
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Well, you should make up your minds
because I think I just heard his car.

239
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
Mr. Matt.

240
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
- Hi. How are you?
- All hell's done broke loose.

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,720
- That waste disposal out again?
- It ain't that.

242
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,440
Just remember,
all hell's done broke loose.

243
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,800
- What's happened? Where's Christina?
- She's on the terrace with little Joey.

244
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,040
- With Joey?
- And somebody called Dr. Prentice.

245
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,240
Doctor? There's a doc...

246
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,360
Well, what's wrong?
What's happened? Joey!

247
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,400
Here he comes.

248
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,000
- Daddy! How are you?
- What's happened? What are you doing?

249
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,240
- Tillie said there was a doctor here.
- There is! Dr. John Wade Prentice.

250
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
- This is my dad.
- Pleased to meet you.

251
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,760
How are you? Nice to know you.
But what is it?

252
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,880
- Is something wrong?
- There's nothing wrong.

253
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,320
I decided to come home early.

254
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, Dr. Prentice and I
met in Hawaii...

255
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,920
and we flew back in the same plane
this morning.

256
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,320
Oh, well, sit down.

257
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,000
I thought something was really wrong.
Tillie said...

258
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,720
Tillie's behaving very strangely today.
Would you like coffee?

259
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,960
No, thanks. I have a date to play golf
with Monsignor Ryan.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,680
How are you? What's the matter,
you having a chill?

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
No, darling, I'm fine.

262
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,520
I...

263
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,960
Doctor, where are you practicing?
In San Francisco?

264
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,120
- Sit down.
- No, sir.

265
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,680
I'm just here for one day.

266
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,560
Oh, where is your practice?
Hawaii?

267
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, no, not...
I'm not established in any one place.

268
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm in tropical medicines, mostly,
in Africa...

269
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,040
these past few years.

270
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,240
Well, that sounds interesting.

271
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,480
Everything about Dr. Prentice
is interesting.

272
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,320
I'm sure it is.

273
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I wish I had more time,
but if you'll excuse me.

274
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,560
Couldn't you be a half hour late
and stay and talk with us?

275
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,000
I'd love to, but I mustn't keep
the Monsignor waiting.

276
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,360
No, I'm gonna be late as it is.
Will I be seeing you later, Doctor?

277
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,560
You certainly will.

278
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,040
Good.
Well, that's good.

279
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Dr. Prentice will be here
for dinner, Matt.

280
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,760
Oh, fine. Then you can tell me
all about the African...

281
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,880
There's a great deal to tell too.
Isn't there, Mom?

282
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,640
Well, fine.
See you all later.

283
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,520
What the hell
is going on here?

284
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,600
- This doesn't make sense either.
- Well, I told you, didn't I?

285
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
What'd you tell him?
Look, Chris...

286
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,600
if you don't explain to me
in the next few minutes...

287
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,920
I can explain it, Mr. Drayton.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,880
You can?
Well, let's have it

289
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,800
Well, it's my fault.

290
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
You see,
we have sort of a situation here.

291
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,840
Joanna and I didn't just meet
in Hawaii.

292
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,760
We spend a good deal of time
together.

293
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,160
I mean, all the time
after we met.

294
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,560
And, well, we have this problem:

295
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
I fell in love with your daughter.

296
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
And, as incredible
as it may seem...

297
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
she fell in love with me.

298
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,920
And we flew back
to San Francisco...

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,760
to see if you or Mrs. Drayton would have
any objections if we got married.

300
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,400
Joanna told her mother
as soon as she walked in...

301
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,240
and I had the stupid idea,
that maybe...

302
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,160
there was some way to...

303
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,360
break this gently.

304
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Daddy, you're making
John and me nervous.

305
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Am I?
Well, I wouldn't want to do that.

306
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,720
I wouldn't want to make anybody nervous.
How about you? Are you nervous?

307
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Sit down, Doctor,
before you make me nervous.

308
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Would anybody like
a cup of coffee?

309
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,200
What did she say
when Joanna told her?

310
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,160
- Did she raise any objections?
- None, so far. There hasn't been time.

311
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,160
What objections?

312
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Dad, I know this is sort of a shock
because it's sudden and unexpected...

313
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,120
and it never occurred to me
that I might fall in love with a Negro.

314
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
But I did, and nothing in the world
is gonna change that.

315
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,440
Even if you had any objections,
I wouldn't let him go now if...

316
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,360
you were the governor of Alabama...
I mean, if Mom were.

317
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,240
Tell him, will you?

318
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,520
Tell John if you have any objections
and then you could go play golf.

319
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,320
Well, what is it
you expect me to say?

320
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,280
If you want me to think about this,
you'll have to give me time to think.

321
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,080
The doctor says you have a problem.
You certainly have.

322
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,840
If you're expecting a sensible
statement, you'll have to give me time.

323
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
Does that sound reasonable?

324
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,160
It's reasonable, Mr. Drayton,
but not quite practical.

325
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
You see, Matt...

326
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,080
there's sort of
a special problem.

327
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,720
See, I've got to fly
to New York tonight...

328
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,680
and on to Switzerland
tomorrow night.

329
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Yes, and what Joey wants...
what she proposes...

330
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,880
is to go to Geneva herself
so they can be married...

331
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,840
within the next couple of weeks.

332
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,880
What the hell is all the rush?

333
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,840
We know that we want
to get married.

334
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,400
And unless somebody does have any
objections, why should we waste time?

335
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,320
John and I aren't gonna
change our minds.

336
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,840
Are you saying...
Are you telling me...

337
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,600
that you want an answer today...

338
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,520
about how your mother and I feel?

339
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,760
Of course. We want you and Mom
to state absolutely clearly...

340
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,400
that you have
no objections whatever...

341
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,840
and that when we do get married,
we'll have your blessing.

342
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,520
Now, are you gonna play golf
or not?

343
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,080
No.

344
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,520
I'll just call it off.
Excuse me, Doctor.

345
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,600
And that's my dad.
Do you like him?

346
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,760
- I don't know. Does he like me?
- I don't know either.

347
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,720
When he puts on
his American eagle face...

348
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,960
nobody can tell what he's thinking,
except Mom.

349
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,360
I don't think he liked any of us
after the silly way we began.

350
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,040
Excuse me, will you?
Give John some more coffee.

351
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,320
She's beautiful, Joanna.

352
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,640
She's even better looking than you.
You know that?

353
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,040
Hello, Edie?

354
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,600
Two things, Edie.
Both of them urgent.

355
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Call up Monsignor Ryan and tell him
I can't play this afternoon.

356
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,560
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

357
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,960
Then call the library...

358
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,280
and see if they've got any dope
on a John Wade Prentice.

359
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,000
Prentice. He's a doctor of medicine.
Fellow about 35, 36...

360
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,600
- Oh, Matt.
- He's a colored fellow.

361
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,440
Yeah.
If they haven't got anything...

362
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,000
call up the medical association
and see what they've got.

363
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,680
Get anything you can, will you, Edie?
All right. Hurry and call me back.

364
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,160
Surely there can't be
any necessity for that.

365
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,880
- It can't do any harm, either.
- But Joey said he was lecturing...

366
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,440
at the university in Hawaii.

367
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,320
Tell me something. This ever occur
to you that this might happen?

368
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,280
Never occurred to me either.
Not once.

369
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,760
Can you tell me your reaction?

370
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,000
- How do you feel about it?
- Oh, I don't know.

371
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
I was shaken at first.
I still am, I suppose.

372
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,760
But, Matt, they're serious.
They mean what they're saying.

373
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,680
Both of them.
They know what they're doing.

374
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,360
No, they may mean what they're saying,
I accept that.

375
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,080
But they don't know what they're doing.
I won't accept that.

376
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,480
If I'm not intruding...

377
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
Of course not.
Please, come in.

378
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,840
I'd like to have a couple of minutes
with the two of you, if I may?

379
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,760
Sure, Doctor.
Come on in.

380
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,040
There's something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.

381
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,720
Joanna doesn't know about it,
and I don't see why she should.

382
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,040
What is it, Doctor?

383
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,160
Joanna thinks she's committed...

384
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,440
and that our whole future
is settled...

385
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,680
but there is no real commitment.

386
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,320
And up to now,
nothing is settled at all.

387
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,760
I don't understand.

388
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,720
Joanna said you're going to be married
no matter what we think about it.

389
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,560
Well, that's not the case.

390
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,520
Unless you two approve...
and without any reservations at all...

391
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,920
there won't be any marriage.

392
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,960
Well, why, John?

393
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,880
Why have you decided that?

394
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Well, Mrs. Drayton...

395
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
this thing has happened so quickly...

396
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm just as startled
as you must be.

397
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,280
Two weeks ago, I would have said
such a thing was inconceivable.

398
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
But two weeks ago...

399
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,280
I had not met Joanna.

400
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,920
She's not at all
like anyone I've ever known.

401
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,920
It's not just that our color difference
doesn't matter to her.

402
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,800
It's that she doesn't seem to think
there is any difference.

403
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
The trouble is,
this thing has come up...

404
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,120
at a time when I already have
all the problems I need.

405
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,200
And I feel that I couldn't afford
to get married...

406
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,240
if it meant that I would have to take
on any special problems...

407
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,080
in addition to those
we're obviously going to have.

408
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,960
When you say "special problems,"
Doctor, what do you mean?

409
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,680
Well...

410
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,080
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...

411
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,040
and yours, Mrs. Drayton.

412
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,160
Joanna is very close
to both of you.

413
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,960
If, by marrying me, she damaged
her relationship with either of you...

414
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,640
the pain of it
would be too much for her.

415
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,480
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

416
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,920
In any case,
I wouldn't even want to try.

417
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Well, I'm glad you told us,
Doctor.

418
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,520
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

419
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,640
There is nothing I wouldn't do to keep
her as happy as she was the day we met.

420
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,880
But it seems to me,
without your approval...

421
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,800
we will make no sense at all.

422
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,160
That is why I'm asking for...

423
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,800
the clearest possible statement
of what your attitude is going to be.

424
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,760
I appreciate that, Doctor.

425
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,160
It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

426
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,640
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.

427
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,480
All you have to say
is good-bye.

428
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,920
Well, that's where it's at.

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,760
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my peace.

430
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,600
Well...

431
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,960
still think you ought to have someone
check on him?

432
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,880
No.

433
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,800
He's right about Joey too.

434
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,960
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

435
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,880
Thank God he is. That's the way I feel.
Thank God he's right.

436
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,800
She's 23 years old,
and the way she is...

437
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,320
is just exactly the way
we brought her up to be.

438
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,960
We answered her questions.
She listened to our answers.

439
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,160
We told her it was wrong
to believe...

440
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,080
that white people were somehow
essentially superior to black people...

441
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,000
or the brown or the red
or the yellow ones, for that matter.

442
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,920
People who thought that way
were wrong to think that way.

443
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Sometimes hateful, usually stupid,
but always wrong.

444
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,280
That's what we said...

445
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,480
and when we said it,
we did not add...

446
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,960
"But don't ever fall in love
with a colored man."

447
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,000
Edie, Mr. Drayton.
Do you want the whole story?

448
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
- Yeah, what is it, Edie?
- He's an important guy.

449
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Just the main points:
Born Los Angeles, 1930...

450
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
graduated maxima cum laude
John Hopkins, '54...

451
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,760
assistant professor,
Yale Medical School, '55...

452
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,600
three years professor,
London School of Tropical Medicine...

453
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,560
three years assistant director,
World Health Organization...

454
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,200
two textbooks and a list of monographs
and medical society honors...

455
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,760
as long as your arm.

456
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,040
Married Elizabeth Bowers, 1955,
one son, John Wade.

457
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,800
Oh, both killed in an accident
in 1959.

458
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
- There's a lot more here.
- No, that's all right. Thanks.

459
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,960
What's the $2.20?

460
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,760
He made a call to Los Angeles
to his parents.

461
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,800
I guess he doesn't bum
free telephone calls either.

462
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,160
I can certainly understand why he didn't
have much to say about himself.

463
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,680
Who the hell would believe him?

464
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,600
I beg your pardon, lady.

465
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,520
He loves me, he loves me not.

466
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,960
Tell me, what do you think? Aren't they
exactly the way I said they were?

467
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,120
I must admit,
they are very special people.

468
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
- Shall I tell you something?
- What's that?

469
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,920
For a whole week,
I've been nervous.

470
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,320
No. I don't believe it.

471
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,440
Not about what they'd ultimately feel.
Just about their first reaction.

472
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,440
I thought it was just possible
for the first time in 23 years...

473
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,640
they might let me down
for the first half hour.

474
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,200
You're a phony. You know that?
You're a big phony.

475
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,560
Well...

476
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,680
She's always been
a happy human being.

477
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,000
She laughed out loud
before she was six months old.

478
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,280
She was happy as a baby.

479
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,120
Happy as a little girl.
Happy all through school and college.

480
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,960
But I don't think
I've ever seen her...

481
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,160
quite so happy
as she is right now.

482
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,240
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt.

483
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,840
And I am.

484
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,840
I feel happy for her.

485
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,520
And proud of the fact
that we helped make her.

486
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
And whatever happens now,
I feel glad...

487
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,120
that Joey's Joey.

488
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,560
How are you today?
Having a steak fry, huh?

489
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,280
Well, now, there she is.
How are you today?

490
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,600
Wanna give me a lift to Market Street?
Save me a cab.

491
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,520
You know it, doll.

492
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
I hope these is better
than the last we had, hotshot.

493
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,600
Lady, don't look at me. I deliver it.
I don't rustle the cattle.

494
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,280
You said to remind you
to open the wine.

495
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,280
Civil rights is one thing.

496
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,280
This here is something else.

497
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
I went out on to the terrace.

498
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,240
Oh, I'll never forget it.
It was so beautiful.

499
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,040
It was already dark
and the moon was rising.

500
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,960
I guess I didn't see him at first
because I was looking at the view.

501
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,520
But he was standing there.

502
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,720
Then all of a sudden
he moved or something, and I jumped.

503
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,400
And he just stood there,
looking at me and sort of...

504
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,680
- Ah, you're burning your shirt.
- Oh, yes. Sort of smiling.

505
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,360
"Hello," I said.
"Who are you?"

506
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,360
And I think he thought I was...

507
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
you know, attractive.

508
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,680
Anyway, finally, he said...

509
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,000
"Well, do you think
it could possibly matter?"

510
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,200
- And it's just crazy, and I admit it.
- You'd better let me do this.

511
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,560
But 20 minutes later,
I felt I was in love with him.

512
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,400
Mom, how long did it take you
to fall in love with Dad?

513
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Oh, well, nothing like
so long as 20 minutes.

514
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,160
- You mean, is that really true?
- Yes, that's really true.

515
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh, Mom.

516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,280
Joey, I want to ask you something.

517
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,360
How deeply are you and John in...
No, I have no right to ask.

518
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
How deeply involved? Do you mean,
have we been to bed together?

519
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,800
I don't mind you asking me that.
We haven't.

520
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
He wouldn't.

521
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,960
I don't think he was in doubt
about my feelings, but he wouldn't.

522
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
You're burning my shirt.

523
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,760
He's been concerned the whole time
about my getting hurt somehow.

524
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
They're still talking.

525
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
Wouldn't you think
they'd have said everything by now?

526
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,520
Are you saying they don't have
any special sense of rhythm?

527
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,200
That's right.

528
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
But, hell, you can see it.

529
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,720
You can't turn on the television set
without seeing those kids dancing...

530
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
and I say the colored kids
are better than the white kids.

531
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,360
But there's an explanation for that.
It's our dancing, and it's our music.

532
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
We brought it here.

533
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,400
I mean, you can do the Watusi...

534
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
but we are the Watusi,
if you know what I mean.

535
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,880
I remember,
when I was about your age...

536
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,880
my sports editor telling me that Negroes
would never be able to play baseball.

537
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
Now, I suppose if he wanted to...

538
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,360
Willie Mays could be elected
mayor of San Francisco.

539
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,200
I own a newspaper,
but I couldn't be elected dogcatcher.

540
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,080
Well, I don't guess
you want to be dogcatcher any more...

541
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,120
than he wants to be
mayor of San Francisco.

542
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,040
No, I suppose that's right.

543
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,400
Doctor, we've talked about
a good many things...

544
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,160
but there's one thing
we haven't talked about.

545
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,600
Have you given any thought to
the problems your children will have?

546
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,440
Yes, and they'll have some.
And we'll have the children.

547
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,560
Otherwise,
you couldn't call it a marriage.

548
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Is that the way Joey feels?

549
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,160
She feels that all of our children will
be president of the United States...

550
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,080
and they'll all have
colorful administrations.

551
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
Well, you made her, Mr. Drayton.

552
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,080
I just met her in Hawaii.

553
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,520
But how do you feel
about that problem?

554
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,160
Well, frankly, I think your daughter
is a bit optimistic.

555
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,360
I'd settle
for secretary of state.

556
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,080
Would you think it was some kind
of cowardice if I told you...

557
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,920
that no matter how confident you two are
I'm just a little scared.

558
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,000
No, it wouldn't.

559
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,480
But you never know.
Things are changing.

560
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,840
I have a feeling they're
not changing anywhere else...

561
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,880
as fast as they are
in my own backyard.

562
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,240
Just tell me this.

563
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,160
Don't you think this quick decision...

564
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,920
about how we feel about this thing
is just a little unfair?

565
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,560
In a way, I do.

566
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
But it wasn't my idea
that everything be settled so quickly.

567
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,200
Your daughter said
there's no problem.

568
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,760
She says, "My dad is a lifelong fighting
liberal who loathes race prejudice...

569
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,560
and has spent his whole life
fighting against discrimination."

570
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,360
She said, "My parents...
They'll welcome you with open arms."

571
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,320
And I said...

572
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,640
"Oh, I sure want to meet them."

573
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Telephone!
It's Los Angeles!

574
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,440
- Take it in my study.
- Thank you.

575
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,960
- Hello?
- Dr. Prentice?

576
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,680
- Yes, this is he.
- Hello. That you, Little John?

577
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,560
Hi, Dad. What's up, man?
Dr. Graves call again?

578
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,200
Oh, no, it's not that, son.
I just had an idea.

579
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,800
What would you say to us
flying up there to spend the evening?

580
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,760
- This evening?
- We could be up there at 6:30.

581
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,520
I thought maybe we could take you
and your young lady friend for dinner.

582
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,640
- Tell them to come to dinner.
- Just a minute.

583
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,440
- I'm having dinner with her folks.
- Don't be silly.

584
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,080
- Tell them they're invited to dinner.
- Who's that speaking? The young lady?

585
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,680
Yes, that's her.

586
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,560
No, just a minute. You haven't asked
your mother, and there's Tillie.

587
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,000
Won't you come to dinner,
you and Mrs. Prentice?

588
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,560
John and I will meet your plane.

589
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,800
- Stop butting in.
- Who am I talking to? John?

590
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,240
Hi, Dad.

591
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Looks like she wants us
even if you don't. We want to meet her.

592
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,600
- So we'll see you at 6:30. What?
- Oh, no.

593
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,480
- See?
- Your mother says she's pleased.

594
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,400
Oh, hell, he knows that.
All right, son.

595
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,760
- Dad!
- We'll see you later. Bye.

596
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,160
What's the matter?

597
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
Mom!

598
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,000
John's father and mother
are coming to dinner.

599
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,920
Oh, good.

600
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,200
- Marvelous.
- We'll meet their plane at 6:30.

601
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,160
Fine.
You'll tell Tillie, won't you?

602
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,800
I told you,
my folks, they don't...

603
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,960
They think
you're a colored girl.

604
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,680
- Why didn't you tell them?
- I was gonna write to them.

605
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
What difference does it make?

606
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,480
Do you think they wouldn't come?
Call them back and tell them.

607
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,480
They're gonna know anyway at 6:30
because I'll go with you to meet them.

608
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,920
That's not a good idea.
I'll meet them.

609
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,880
It gives me a chance to explain.
I have to explain.

610
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
Why do you keep trying
to dramatize everything?

611
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,160
Look, I've told Pete and Judith that
we'll meet them for a drink at 5:30.

612
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,560
It gives us just enough time
to get to the airport.

613
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,920
She's my best and oldest friend
so you've just got to let them meet you.

614
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,240
Did he tell you
about this medical plan of his?

615
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,840
No. What?

616
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,640
It's the damndest thing
you ever heard of.

617
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,600
They put a whole medical school
on about 20 trucks.

618
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,400
Then they run
into some African country...

619
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,680
pick up the brightest native kids...
hundreds at a time...

620
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,400
and put them through courses just like
they do the U.S. Army Corpsmen.

621
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,200
Only his idea is
that they're all specialists.

622
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,640
You know, each one trained
to do one simple thing...

623
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,000
like sewing up a wound
or delivering a baby or what have you.

624
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,680
They go into places where people
have never heard of an aspirin tablet...

625
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,200
let alone a doctor.

626
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,640
Imagine what that means.

627
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,440
For every thousand kids they train,
they can save a million lives a year.

628
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,360
Now just think of that.

629
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,880
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

630
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,920
Yeah.

631
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,440
I asked him how he got so far.
You know, he's only 37.

632
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,120
He said he thought he got the best
breaks because everybody he met...

633
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,480
didn't want him to think
they were prejudiced against him.

634
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,600
Yeah, he made an impression, all right.
I wouldn't know how to fault him.

635
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,720
Are you trying to fault him?

636
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,160
No, I'm not trying to fault him.
You know, his father is a mailman.

637
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,600
Retired now.
Lives in Los Angeles.

638
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,920
Now how do you suppose
a colored mailman...

639
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,640
produced a son
with all the qualities he has?

640
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,600
- You'll find out this evening.
- What?

641
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,040
Guess who's coming to dinner?

642
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,760
Who?

643
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
You mean, his parents?

644
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,760
Now wait a minute.

645
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,400
- Whose idea was that?
- Joey invited them.

646
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,720
Yeah, Joey. We're being pressurized.
You know that, don't you?

647
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,960
First there wasn't gonna be a marriage
unless we approved.

648
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,560
Then we had one day
to make up our minds.

649
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,520
Now we have to spend hours entertaining
somebody we never heard of.

650
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,880
What the hell
is coming off here?

651
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,120
Oh, don't look at
those baby pictures.

652
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,520
That was at Klosters,
the year before last.

653
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,440
I'll get it!
Just a second.

654
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,560
Monsignor Ryan!
How wonderful to see you.

655
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,960
- Well, good afternoon.
- Come on in. Good afternoon.

656
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,400
Why are you here
when you should be in Hawaii?

657
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,520
What is the problem that caused your
father to chicken out on our golf game?

658
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,040
- Who is this gentleman?
- Monsignor, this is Dr. John Prentice.

659
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,000
We met in Hawaii 11 days ago.
The two of us are going to be married.

660
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,200
Are you, indeed?
I take it you mean to each other.

661
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,160
- Dr. Prentice.
- Monsignor.

662
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,520
Well, of course,
you're the problem.

663
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm afraid I am.

664
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,960
I knew nothing of this.
Why haven't your parents informed me?

665
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
They didn't know either.
We only flew back this morning.

666
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,160
Excuse me a second.
I forgot to tell Tillie something.

667
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,720
Well...

668
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
- This was all very sudden, was it not?
- Yes, it was.

669
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,360
I suppose you two have had time
to consider what you're doing.

670
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,600
No, we've not.

671
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,520
We'll be two more for dinner.
How many steaks did you get?

672
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,840
I got four
'cause I was told four.

673
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,240
Order two more because the doctor's
father and mother are coming.

674
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,080
- We'll be six.
- His father and mother! Here?

675
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,440
That's right.
If the butcher can't send 'em...

676
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,040
tell him to put 'em
in a taxi.

677
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,440
It's gettin' more like
a holy rollers meetin' every minute.

678
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,560
Of course!
I know about you.

679
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,040
I read an article about you
in "Common Wheel."

680
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,760
I shall want to talk to you
about that.

681
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,720
You know, this fellow you brought home
is a very important man?

682
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,120
- Are you aware of that?
- I'm wholly aware of it.

683
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,840
When I'm married to him,
I'll be important.

684
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,120
I guess you will,
as a matter of fact.

685
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,600
- Where's Arnold Palmer?
- Dad and Mom are in the garden.

686
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,960
Good. Well, just go on
with what you're doing. Fore!

687
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,280
Of all the friends we've ever had,
I guess he's the closest.

688
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,760
We're not Catholics, but he and Dad
and Mom have done things together.

689
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,760
You know,
sat on committees and things.

690
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,640
He's a wonderful man,
and we love him.

691
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,200
You're a remarkable fellow, Mike.

692
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,200
You get younger every minute.

693
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,320
- Did you...
- Yes, I've just seen him.

694
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Handsome fellow, isn't he?

695
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,360
Little Joey is nothing less
than radiant.

696
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,520
It warms me chilly old heart
just to look at her.

697
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,640
Aren't you just
a little shocked?

698
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,960
Shocked?
Why should I be shocked?

699
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,000
I've known a good many cases
of marriages between races in my time.

700
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,160
Strangely enough,
they usually work out quite well.

701
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,880
I don't know why.

702
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,080
Maybe because it requires
some special quality of effort...

703
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,360
more consideration and compassion...

704
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,160
than most marriages
seem to generate these days.

705
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,040
- Could that be it?
- Yes, it could.

706
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,320
I'm glad you said that.
That's a beautiful thought.

707
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,240
You do have beautiful thoughts.

708
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,160
That's my trade, you know.

709
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,040
What about laddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?

710
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,520
You know, this man is quite
a famous fellow in his own right.

711
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,000
He's done incredible work in Asia
and some awful place in Africa.

712
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,200
Mom! Hilary's here.
She wants to see you.

713
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,320
Excuse me, will you? Express some more
beautiful thoughts to the lad there.

714
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Thank you.

715
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,640
I hope you won't think
that I'm prying, Doctor...

716
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,600
but naturally
one is curious.

717
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
- Naturally.
- We are going to be married.

718
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,080
Are you?

719
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Well, I didn't even know.

720
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,360
I mean, Christina
hadn't even mentioned that...

721
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,680
She didn't know.
It was a surprise to her too.

722
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,680
A surprise.
Well, I should think it was.

723
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,800
My dear!

724
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,880
Joey tells me that congratulations
are in order, and you didn't even know.

725
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,600
What's the problem, Hilary?
What brings you all the way up here?

726
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,960
- Mr. Cazalet phoned about the pictures.
- Oh, that. Excuse us, will you?

727
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,080
I'll walk out to your car
with you.

728
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,600
- I hope I'll be seeing you shortly.
- Actually, no.

729
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,880
Dr. Prentice is leaving tonight...

730
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,840
and Joey within
the next couple of weeks.

731
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,280
Well, then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.

732
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,480
Come along.

733
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,080
My poor dear,
what a shock for you.

734
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,640
I knew something was up
when I came into the gallery.

735
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,040
But this!
Whatever are you going to do about it?

736
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,960
- I mean, the child is of age.
- Yes, the child is 23.

737
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,200
Why didn't you simply ring up
with the Cazalet information?

738
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,960
Well, I must admit,
I was intensely curious.

739
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,520
I couldn't believe it.

740
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,000
It's so unlike Joey to do anything
so appallingly stupid.

741
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,040
- Yes, come along.
- But what you must be going through.

742
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,400
You must try not to worry about it.

743
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,600
Now I have some instructions
for you.

744
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,520
I want you to go straight back
to the gallery. Start your motor.

745
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,440
When you to the gallery,
tell Jennifer...

746
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,400
she will be looking after things
temporarily.

747
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,440
She's to give me a ring if there's
anything she can't deal with herself.

748
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,400
Then go into the office
and make out a check for cash...

749
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,960
for the sum of $5,000.

750
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,400
Then carefully...

751
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,680
remove absolutely everything...

752
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,920
that might subsequently remind me
that you had ever been there...

753
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,320
including that yellow thing
with the blue bulbs...

754
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,240
which you have
such an affection for.

755
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,920
Then take the check for $5,000...

756
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,840
which I feel you deserve...

757
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,680
and get permanently lost.

758
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,360
It's not that I don't want
to know you, although I don't.

759
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,760
It's just that I'm afraid
we're not really the sort of people...

760
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,520
that you can afford
to be associated with.

761
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,400
Don't speak.
Just go.

762
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,440
You see that boy?
The tall one?

763
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,240
If he'd played his cards right,
you'd never even have met me.

764
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,920
But he fell for some girl
from Pomona.

765
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,200
- That'll teach him.
- Mom!

766
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,880
Do you know what Hilary was doing?
She was being an absolute bitch.

767
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,600
She was. I almost wish you'd fire her.
I really do.

768
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,040
Joey, how can you be so hard?

769
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,640
She has a really quite ruthless streak.
You ought to be warned about it.

770
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,640
She gets it
from her father.

771
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,640
They need all the help
you can give them...

772
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,240
because they're going to have
special difficulties.

773
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,760
No, don't budge.
Please, sit.

774
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,840
Of course, they know all that.

775
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,960
They're serious people.
Fine, intelligent people.

776
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
And if they know
what lies in store for them...

777
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,400
and they still want each other
enough to accept it...

778
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,280
I think it's plain as anything
that they love each other very much.

779
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,200
You'll have to agree that any two people
who love each other that much...

780
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,040
deserve all the best luck
in the world.

781
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,680
I don't know.

782
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,200
I wish I didn't have the feeling
that they'll never make it...

783
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,120
that the whole thing's
impossible.

784
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,120
You feel that way, do you?

785
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,440
You're really thrashing about then.

786
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,040
That's very interesting, indeed.

787
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,840
And rather amusing, too,
to see a broken-down...

788
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,640
old phony liberal come face-to-face
with his principles.

789
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,200
Of course,
I always have believed...

790
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,040
that in that
fighting liberal facade...

791
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,800
there must be some sort
of reactionary bigot trying to get out.

792
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,840
Oh, go to hell. You and your crowd
are still preaching hell.

793
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,480
Well, I'm off.

794
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,280
As much as I'm enjoying
your discomfiture...

795
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,160
I may be able to save a few souls
before supper.

796
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,920
But, I am, as it happens,
free for dinner.

797
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,240
Please, come, 7:30.

798
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,280
The doctor's family are flying up
from Los Angeles.

799
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,640
Oh, well, in that case,
you'll actually need me.

800
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,640
Otherwise, your side
won't even outnumber the blacks.

801
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,520
Thank you, my dear.

802
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,800
Half past seven.

803
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,960
What was that the Beatles sang?

804
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,000
We can work it out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

805
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
Mom did it.
Do you think it looks like him?

806
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,280
Well, it looks a little grim,
doesn't it?

807
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,640
- No, don't let me disturb you.
- Not at all.

808
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,360
I hope you don't mind, but I've wrangled
an invitation to dinner.

809
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,040
- Marvelous! I'm delighted you're coming.
- Thank you, my dear.

810
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,000
- I'm very delighted to have met you.
- My pleasure, Monsignor.

811
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,520
- See you this evening.
- Certainly.

812
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,800
You know,
you two make me feel...

813
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,000
quite extraordinarily happy.

814
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,720
I'd better tell Tillie. If you listen,
you'll hear her going through the roof.

815
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,640
I brought you
the latest bulletin.

816
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,960
Guess who's coming
to dinner now?

817
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,840
The Reverend Martin Luther King?

818
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,480
You're so close.
It's Monsignor Ryan.

819
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,640
Bake a second pie, will you?
You know how he loves your cooking.

820
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,680
Listen, is the big guest room
in order?

821
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
Dr. Prentice wants to have
a shower and change.

822
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,280
- He does?
- He does.

823
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,520
Well, she's 23 years old.

824
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,520
I guess she has
a right to do as she pleases.

825
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,960
Yes, but that's not the point.
The doctor said...

826
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,600
I know what the doctor said. Could we
get out of here for a few minutes?

827
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,080
- Sure.
- What are the others doing?

828
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,920
They're meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink...

829
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,880
and then they're going on
to the airport.

830
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,040
All right, come on.
Come on, will you?

831
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,080
Whatever happened to what's-his-name?
Homer?

832
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,360
That lawyer?
I thought she liked him very much.

833
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,720
Nothing happened to Homer.
Dr. Prentice just happened to Joey.

834
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,560
It was only last Christmas
she said Homer had the inside track.

835
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,000
Isn't that the place where we got
the good ice cream? Let's get some.

836
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,480
It's after 5:00.
You'll spoil...

837
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,400
A little ice cream can't hurt.

838
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,560
- Yes?
- When I had ice cream before...

839
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,330
I had a special kind of flavor
that I liked very much.

840
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,170
- But I can't remember what it was.
- I'll bring you the list.

841
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,330
No, you must know what it is.

842
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,610
Daiquiri Ice? Honeycomb Candy?
Cocoa Coconut? Jamoca Almond Fudge?

843
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,970
Mocha Jamoca? Peanut Butter and Jelly?
Cinnamon Banana Mint?

844
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,650
- Must have been some other place.
- Fresh Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet?

845
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,010
That's it.

846
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,770
I'm sure that's it. Bring me
a Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

847
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,690
- Bring me a big one.
- Right.

848
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,730
- Will you have some? It's delicious.
- No. Black coffee.

849
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:35,730
One double Fresh Oregon Boysenberry
Sherbet and one black coffee. Thanks.

850
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,770
You know, Matt...

851
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,690
I think Mike was right
that Joey is lucky.

852
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,210
The work he's doing
is so important...

853
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,330
she'll be able to help him with it
and share it all with him.

854
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,250
The best break
any wife can have.

855
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,690
You know, for us,
it's all been great...

856
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,490
but do you know
what was the best time of all?

857
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,490
It was in the beginning
when everything was a struggle...

858
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,090
and you were working too hard
and sometimes frightened...

859
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,850
and there were times
when I felt...

860
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:16,210
that I really knew
that I was a help to you.

861
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,970
That was the very best time of all
for me.

862
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,810
- One black coffee.
- Thank you.

863
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,210
And one Fresh
Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet.

864
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,130
Thank you.

865
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,090
This is not the stuff.

866
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,450
I never had this stuff
before in my life.

867
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,970
You know, it's not bad.

868
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,570
Not bad at all.
I kinda like it.

869
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,530
Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

870
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,330
Yes, sir.

871
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,570
Well, when I had
the ice cream before...

872
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,130
this isn't the stuff I had,
but I like it.

873
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,010
- It's very good. I like it very much.
- Okay.

874
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,970
- How do you do, Miss Binks?
- I got somethin' to say to you, boy.

875
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,610
Exactly what you tryin' to pull here?

876
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,330
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I was looking to find me a wife.

877
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,850
Ain't that just likely!
You wanna answer me somethin'?

878
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,490
What kinda doctor
you supposed to be anyhow?

879
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,450
Would you believe horse?

880
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,290
You make with witticisms
and all, huh?

881
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,170
Let me tell you somethin'.

882
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,250
You may think you're foolin'
Miss Joey and her folks.

883
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,410
But you ain't foolin' me for a minute.
I see what you are.

884
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,250
You're one of those smooth-talkin',
smart-ass niggers...

885
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,210
just out for all you can get,
with your black power...

886
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,130
and all that other
trouble-makin' nonsense.

887
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,210
And you listen here. I brought up that
child from a baby in her cradle...

888
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,730
and ain't nobody gonna harm her none
while I'm here watchin'.

889
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,930
And as long as you are anywhere around
this house, I'm right here watchin'.

890
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,370
You read me, boy?
You bring any trouble in here...

891
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:11,450
and you just like to find out
what black power really means!

892
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,730
And furthermore to that,
you ain't all that good-lookin'!

893
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,490
That was very good.

894
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:28,090
If I come in again, remind me about
the Oregon Boysenberry, will you?

895
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,170
Yeah, I sure will.
Thank you, sir.

896
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,810
Should we take home
a couple of quarts for dessert?

897
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,730
No, Tillie's baked some pies.

898
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,290
You stupid idiot!

899
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,050
Why can't you
look where you're going?

900
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,290
Sorry, son,
but your car is so low...

901
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,330
Of course you didn't see me!

902
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,410
You weren't even looking
where you were going!

903
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,730
Look what you did to my car!

904
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,450
It's my fault.
My insurance...

905
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,130
Yeah, yeah. Who cares
about your lousy insurance?

906
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,090
I worked over three months on that!

907
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,090
How much will it cost
to have it repaired?

908
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,530
Look at it! Thirty or forty bucks
it'll cost. Did you see it?

909
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,690
Stupid old man.
He oughtn't be allowed out.

910
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,090
He ought to be put away someplace
in a home or something.

911
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,770
There's fifty bucks! Don't bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!

912
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,610
Some of these old guys,
they're senile!

913
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,370
Stupid old man.

914
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,010
There oughta be a law!

915
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,250
What the hell is it today?

916
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,290
Less than 12'/. Of the people
in this city are colored people.

917
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,210
I can't even have a dish
of Oregon "Boosenberry"...

918
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,130
without runnin' into one of them.

919
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,610
You've

920
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:01,330
Got to

921
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,610
Give a little

922
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,250
Take a little

923
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,770
And let your poor heart

924
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,490
Break a little

925
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,210
That's the story of

926
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,890
That's the glory of love

927
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,650
You've gotta laugh a little

928
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,210
Cry a little

929
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,410
Before the clouds

930
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,890
Roll by a little

931
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,370
That's the story of

932
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,250
I can't tell you
how happy I am for you.

933
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,010
And the whole thing having
happened so quickly.

934
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,130
You remember what it was
with Peter and me.

935
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,090
It took us three years
to decide to get married...

936
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,810
and we'd been living together
for two.

937
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,170
To John and Joey.

938
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:54,090
John and Joanna. He won't call me
anything but Joanna.

939
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,330
- I'm beginning to like it too.
- To John and Joanna.

940
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,570
Where you're so lucky
is in Joey's folks... Uh, Joanna's folks.

941
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,130
You've only just met them,
but take my word for it.

942
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,690
Matt Drayton really stands
for something in this town.

943
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,490
Yes. I know the Guardian's
always been a very good paper.

944
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,010
It's a great paper,
and he made it what it is.

945
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:17,210
There's never been a public issue on
which Matt Drayton didn't take a stand.

946
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,090
When exactly are you flying over?
Sometime next week?

947
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,970
Just as soon
as I can arrange everything.

948
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,850
Why next week? Why aren't you
flying over with John?

949
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,690
Why am I not flying over with you?

950
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,490
- Is your passport in order?
- Yes.

951
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,090
- Do you need clothes or anything?
- Nothing I couldn't get over there.

952
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:39,810
Then it seems crazy for you to be
going alone when you could go together.

953
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,450
- Why don't you both leave tonight?
- Why not?

954
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,370
It's 6:00. In an hour
they'll all be here for dinner.

955
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,530
The doctor's plane leaves
at 10:45.

956
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:07,330
No matter what it is, you're going
to have to tell them how you feel.

957
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,090
I need more than one day
to make a decision like that.

958
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,250
It's the silliest thing
I ever heard of.

959
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,770
But I'll tell you this.

960
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,890
I am not going to try to pretend
that I'm happy about the whole thing...

961
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,370
because I'm not.

962
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,770
And if the doctor's decision
depends upon that, then too bad.

963
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,050
And I'm thinking only
of Joey's welfare.

964
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:29,450
I have nothing against him personally,
but he's a grown man.

965
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,490
He behaved irresponsibly in the first
place by letting this thing happen.

966
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,250
Now he wants me to be happy
about a situation...

967
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:39,850
when I happen to know that they'll both
get their brains knocked out.

968
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,890
I'm sorry,
but that's the way I feel.

969
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,690
And I know how you're reacting.

970
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:48,050
You're so wrapped up in Joey's
excitement over the whole thing...

971
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,690
that you are not behaving
in her best interest!

972
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:20,450
Yes, Mom.

973
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,650
But there wasn't any reason
not to go tonight.

974
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,610
You can understand,
can't you, Mom?

975
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,970
My passport's in order. There's
nothing at all that I really need.

976
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,050
And it won't
take me an hour to pack.

977
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:34,330
I'll be able to be with him.
We'll be together the whole time.

978
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,370
Mom, they're here.

979
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,050
I can see them.

980
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,170
They look like awfully nice people.

981
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,170
His mother looks lovely.

982
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,370
You break it to Dad for me,
will you?

983
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,450
Well...

984
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,970
I guess I should have called you back
because there is this one thing...

985
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,490
I should have...

986
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,290
I've been meaning
to write to you about it.

987
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:59,130
There was one thing
I didn't explain, Dad.

988
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,170
And...

989
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,210
I'm afraid it's gonna be
kind of a shock.

990
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,130
You see what I mean?

991
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:16,890
Mom, Dad,
this is Joanna Drayton.

992
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,690
Joanna, my mom and dad.

993
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,650
Mrs. Prentice, I'm so happy.

994
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,530
- Miss Drayton?
- Yes.

995
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,690
Mr. Prentice,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

996
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:34,330
I can explain.

997
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,730
I can imagine what's going on
in your mind...

998
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,010
but we can explain.

999
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,490
You can?

1000
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,730
Of course we can.

1001
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,170
You have bags?

1002
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,930
Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

1003
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,850
Mama?

1004
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,930
- What did your folks say?
- All's well.

1005
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,290
- Did you talk to your father?
- To Mom. But she'll tell him.

1006
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,530
Tonight?

1007
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,810
- I thought I ought to tell you.
- That's out of the question.

1008
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,290
This whole damn thing is...
No, that's out of the question.

1009
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,410
I'll tell you something else.
I couldn't do what you're about to do...

1010
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,650
so I don't begin to understand
how you propose to go about it.

1011
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,050
But you can't break their hearts
over a drink...

1012
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:22,010
and expect them
to sit down to dinner.

1013
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,770
Don't you think I know that?

1014
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,690
I have to talk to the doctor...
I'll talk to him after dinner.

1015
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:29,610
Tell him exactly how I feel.

1016
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,730
I'm not trying
to give you an argument.

1017
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,050
There's nothing I can say
that you don't know.

1018
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,410
It's important that you understand
just how wrong I think you...

1019
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,890
I believe you're making the worst
mistake you've ever made in your...

1020
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,610
You're gonna regret it with more
bitterness that you've ever known...

1021
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,250
for as long as you live.

1022
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:49,170
You're wrong.
You're as wrong as you can be.

1023
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,530
Because I'm thinking of her
and even the doctor is going to know...

1024
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,450
I'm thinking of her.

1025
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,370
There's something else.

1026
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,490
I'm surprised
it hasn't occurred to you.

1027
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,530
The doctor will accept
whatever you say to him...

1028
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,690
because he's a terribly sensitive man
and because he said he would.

1029
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,490
But Joey won't. The most obvious
mistake you're making...

1030
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,010
is in underestimating
your own daughter.

1031
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,410
She'll fight you and
your whole attitude...

1032
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,250
and everything you do and every
argument you ever try to give her.

1033
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,890
And one thing more.

1034
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:22,450
Until today, I would never have believed
that I could say such a thing...

1035
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,570
but when she fights you...

1036
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,490
and for what it may be worth...

1037
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,410
I'm going to be on her side.

1038
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,370
I never believed I'd hear you
say a thing like that.

1039
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,970
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I'll get it myself.

1040
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,650
I wish we had more time.

1041
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,050
What, Mom?

1042
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:59,330
I was going to ask Miss Drayton
how her father and mother reacted to...

1043
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,450
Yeah. I wanted to ask that too.

1044
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:04,650
Please call me Joanna.
They were shaken, all right.

1045
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,850
I don't think
I've ever seen them so surprised.

1046
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,770
The thing that really shook them...

1047
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:11,690
was that I wanted to marry anybody
they hadn't even heard about.

1048
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,610
I can't blame them
for being sort of stunned by it all.

1049
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:19,370
Well. Then you couldn't blame us if we
were a little stunned, too, could you?

1050
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,090
I mean, I wouldn't appear unreasonable
if I suggested...

1051
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:26,130
that the two of you were behaving like
a couple of escaped lunatics, would I?

1052
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,330
This whole thing...

1053
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,290
happened so quickly...

1054
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,210
it's like trying to ride a rocket.

1055
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,210
We didn't plan it that way.
It just happened that way.

1056
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,090
It's a little hard on Joanna's folks and
I'm sure it's gonna be hard on you.

1057
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,210
We've got one evening
to discuss it...

1058
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,210
and if you have any objections,
you'd better raise them in a hurry...

1059
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,490
because in exactly four hours
we're gonna be on that plane and gone.

1060
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:53,930
I don't think I could list
all my objections in four hours.

1061
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,170
I think I'd need
more like eight hours.

1062
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,530
Well, you've only got four hours.

1063
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:01,810
So you'll just have to talk
twice as fast.

1064
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,650
Hello, darling.
How are you?

1065
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,930
Forgive me.
I am a little bit early.

1066
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,770
Ego absolvo te.
Come in.

1067
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:28,330
I don't like to be
always repeating myself...

1068
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,730
but how long is it since
that I remarked that I thought...

1069
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,930
that you were the loveliest woman
I have ever known?

1070
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,450
You know, there is a kind of envy
that is no way sinful.

1071
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,050
That's what I've always
had for Matt all these years.

1072
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:45,610
- What can I give you to drink?
- Well, I like Scotch if...

1073
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,410
- Are we drinking wine?
- Yes.

1074
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:51,450
Oh. I'll have
a little drop of Scotch anyhow.

1075
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,250
Equal amount of soda, please.

1076
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,610
Thank you.

1077
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,810
My dear, what's the matter?

1078
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,250
Sorry.

1079
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,170
We're in trouble.

1080
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:15,890
Mike...

1081
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:19,090
we're in terrible trouble,
terrible trouble.

1082
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,810
John told us...
Matt and me...

1083
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:24,130
that he wouldn't marry Joey
unless we could say...

1084
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:27,250
that we approved the marriage
with no reservations whatever.

1085
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:29,610
Joey doesn't know
that he said that.

1086
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,770
Now she's suddenly decided to go
with him tonight. She has her tickets.

1087
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,330
The two of them are on their way in
from the airport with John's parents...

1088
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,970
and neither of them knows
that Matt has decided...

1089
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,010
Well.

1090
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:43,890
Matt has decided
that he can't approve.

1091
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:48,130
That's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.

1092
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,330
- Where is Matt?
- He's upstairs changing. He's...

1093
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,050
He's not himself.

1094
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,490
Excuse me.

1095
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,410
It's incredible!

1096
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,930
- Table all right?
- It's fine.

1097
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:17,290
- Thank you.
- Miss Christina, what's gonna happen?

1098
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:21,210
I don't know, Tillie.

1099
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:25,690
You and Mr. Matt, you gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense foolishness?

1100
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,770
I don't want to put a stop
to anything.

1101
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,290
He's a fine man.

1102
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:35,850
He's a wonderful man,
and Joey is very much in love with him.

1103
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:39,090
And it isn't just
damn nonsense foolishness.

1104
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,050
Well, I tell you, Miss Christina.

1105
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:44,890
The way you are talkin',
I don't understand nothin' no more.

1106
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,530
Nobody understands nothin' no more.

1107
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,250
No, I don't think you're butting
into something that doesn't concern...

1108
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,810
Damn blast these lousy laundries.

1109
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,730
I understand how you feel.

1110
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,490
I understand how everybody feels.

1111
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:06,090
But you have to
understand something too.

1112
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:08,370
They've boxed me
into a hell of a corner here.

1113
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,810
And no matter what Christina says
or what you say...

1114
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,170
I am not going to behave
irresponsibly.

1115
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,770
I'm not gonna tell them they can't get
married. I don't have the right.

1116
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,730
But they don't have the right
to come in here...

1117
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:21,210
and expect me to be happy
about something any normal man...

1118
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,090
Oh, for God's sake!

1119
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,490
You're on the point of destroying
all the happiness there is...

1120
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:29,770
in one of the happiest families
I've ever known.

1121
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,890
Have you any appreciation
at all for Christina...

1122
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,130
Have you any appreciation at all
of how that woman has behaved today?

1123
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:41,290
From the moment they walked in, she was
for it, as if there were no problems.

1124
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,370
But there are no problems that Joey
and young Prentice don't know about.

1125
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:49,010
Christina has more respect for Joey's
judgment than you have. I must say...

1126
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,570
Oh, come off it!

1127
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,250
If Joey came home with some fuzzy-wuzzy
and said "This is the man for me"...

1128
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,130
Christina would say,
"Oh, really? How wonderful.

1129
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:01,770
Where will we get enough roses
to fill the Rose Bowl?"

1130
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:05,090
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you so angry.

1131
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:08,570
Oh, yes. When you took
nine shots on the seventh green.

1132
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,050
Would you mind
getting the hell out of here?

1133
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,610
I think I know why you're angry too.

1134
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,250
Not with the doctor,
whom you obviously respect.

1135
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:20,290
Not with Joey or Christina,
not even with me.

1136
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:22,330
You're angry with yourself.

1137
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,330
You're a pontificating
old poop!

1138
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:28,650
You're angry because all of a sudden,
and in a single day, you've been thrown.

1139
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:32,210
You're the last man in the world I would
have expected to behave the way you are.

1140
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:35,010
You're not yourself.
You're off balance.

1141
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,290
You don't know who your are,
what you are or what you're doing.

1142
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:38,850
That's your trouble.

1143
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,490
You've gone back on yourself, laddie,
and in your heart you know it.

1144
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,610
Now, listen, there's a limit
to what I'll take, even from you.

1145
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:50,330
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

1146
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,490
You know that.

1147
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:57,410
And for the first time in all
those 30 years, I feel sorry for you.

1148
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,930
Damn it, that's enough!

1149
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,490
Are you really capable
of putting yourself in my position?

1150
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,410
Unless you've got
some kids of your own...

1151
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,730
hidden away somewhere
that haven't shown up in the record...

1152
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:11,730
how can you possibly know how a father
would feel in a situation like this?

1153
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,210
You don't know!

1154
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,130
I happen to believe they wouldn't
have a dog's chance...

1155
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:19,330
not in this country,
not in the whole, stinking world.

1156
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,050
They are this country.

1157
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,890
They'll change this stinking world.

1158
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,770
Yeah, sure. Fifty years, maybe,
or a hundred years.

1159
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,650
But not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

1160
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,050
My dear friend...

1161
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:35,130
I wish with all my heart
you could be restrained.

1162
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,010
And if I were ten years younger...

1163
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,450
to prevent you
from going downstairs...

1164
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,050
I believe I'd make some sort of effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

1165
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,250
That'll be the day.

1166
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,330
Is that the car?
Did you hear a car?

1167
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,690
Mrs. Prentice,
I'm Christina Drayton.

1168
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,090
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Prentice?

1169
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,450
I'm so pleased to meet you.
Come on in.

1170
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:06,250
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours?

1171
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,730
Thank you.

1172
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,890
How good of you to come
all this long way to see us. Do go in.

1173
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,570
What did Dad say? Did you tell him?
I'll bet he was shaken.

1174
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:16,490
- It was a surprise.
- Does he want to talk to me?

1175
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,130
Yes, I'm sure he does. Later.
Please come in.

1176
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:23,050
May I get you a drink?
What would you like?

1177
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:26,130
May I have some sherry, please?
What a lovely room.

1178
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,650
Thank you. John, would you be bartender?
I'll have some sherry too.

1179
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:31,130
- Of course.
- Shall we sit over here?

1180
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,210
What will you have, Dad?
Bourbon?

1181
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:37,530
- Thank you.
- You have such a magnificent view.

1182
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,810
Thank you. Please sit down.
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

1183
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,530
Did you have a pleasant flight?

1184
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,610
Very pleasant, thank you.

1185
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,770
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

1186
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,770
Only took forty minutes.
Four hundred miles.

1187
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,450
It's incredible, isn't it?

1188
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:05,490
My husband will be down directly,
I think.

1189
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,170
He's upstairs changing.

1190
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,730
And we have a friend of ours
who's coming to dinner with us.

1191
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,490
Monsignor Ryan.

1192
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,330
I'm sure theyll be down
in a minute.

1193
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,290
- Thank you.
- Mom.

1194
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,370
- Thank you.
- There you are, Dad.

1195
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:20,810
Thanks, son.

1196
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,010
Are you Catholics?

1197
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,130
Well, no, we're not.

1198
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,210
I'm afraid we're
nothing in particular.

1199
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:33,530
Monsignor Ryan just happens to be
a very old friend.

1200
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:37,210
Do you come often
to San Francisco?

1201
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,530
I've got to talk to your father.

1202
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,010
There he is.

1203
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,690
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

1204
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:48,330
- This is my father.
- Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

1205
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,250
- How do you do?
- Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.

1206
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,010
- How do you do?
- May I present Monsignor Ryan?

1207
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,370
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do you do?

1208
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,850
Glad to meet you, sir.

1209
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,530
- Are you and John tending bar?
- Yes.

1210
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:01,490
The monsignor and I
are both drinking Scotch.

1211
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,410
Coming up.

1212
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,330
Sit down.

1213
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:09,650
Well.

1214
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,810
Did you have a nice flight
from Los Angeles?

1215
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,850
Oh, yes. Very nice flight.

1216
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:17,650
Only 40 minutes.

1217
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,330
Only 40 minutes from Los Angeles.

1218
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,610
- Terrifying.
- If you're going to talk about flying...

1219
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,650
you could talk
about flying to Geneva...

1220
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,570
because John and I
are hoping to persuade...

1221
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,650
all of you to fly over
for the wedding.

1222
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:33,170
Would anybody like to talk about that
before I go up and start packing?

1223
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:39,050
I take it they've told you
all about their plans?

1224
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:42,450
Of course. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

1225
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:44,490
I don't know about you,
Mr. Prentice...

1226
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,210
but it seems to me that these two
are rushing it just a little bit.

1227
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,450
It seemed that way to me too.

1228
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:54,570
It seems like that to you too?

1229
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,210
That's right.

1230
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,490
I'm certainly relieved
to hear that.

1231
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:02,610
I was beginning to think I was the only
one around here who had any...

1232
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:05,690
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

1233
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,010
What the hell are you talking about?
What view?

1234
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:10,330
From the terrace.
Before it gets too cold.

1235
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,610
- Would you care to see the view?
- Oh, yes, thank you. I would.

1236
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,130
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink with you.

1237
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:28,890
Have you had any chance
to speak privately with John?

1238
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,530
Well, no.

1239
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,170
Because it's important that
you understand what's happened here...

1240
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,770
and what I'm terribly afraid
is going to happen.

1241
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:41,410
May I explain the situation to you
or try to?

1242
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,050
Yes, please.
I wish you would.

1243
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,370
First, I have to ask you...

1244
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,570
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.

1245
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:52,170
Are you shocked
by the fact that John...

1246
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:55,370
that your son is involved
with a white girl?

1247
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,810
Surprised.

1248
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,410
It never happened before.

1249
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,490
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

1250
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:07,170
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

1251
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,130
Are you?

1252
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,450
Well.

1253
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:16,330
I think I was at first
this afternoon.

1254
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:20,610
Because it came
as a complete surprise to us too.

1255
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,570
But now I know
how they feel about each other.

1256
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,130
Joey's still very young...

1257
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,050
but she's not a child.

1258
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,370
And they're...

1259
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,370
deeply in love
with each other.

1260
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,090
Are you about to tell me...

1261
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:42,690
that you'd be willing to approve
the marriage but your husband won't?

1262
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,610
Is that it?

1263
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,850
Yes, that's it.

1264
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,770
My husband won't either.

1265
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:55,010
I wish there were more time...

1266
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:58,370
if only so that we could adjust
to the situation.

1267
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,730
But the way things are,
there just isn't any time.

1268
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,730
If we're going to accept
the thing at all, it seems to me...

1269
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:08,570
we'll have to trust
the two of them...

1270
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,890
and accept that they know
what they're doing.

1271
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:14,010
And, Mrs. Drayton...

1272
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,490
my husband just won't do that.

1273
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:24,850
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

1274
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:30,090
It might do no harm
if we could have a few words.

1275
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,170
Yeah, sure.

1276
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,330
We can go in my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

1277
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,930
I'll have another drink
if you will, Doctor?

1278
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:58,010
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together.

1279
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,130
Like for the next ten years.

1280
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,410
Mr. Drayton...

1281
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,770
I don't know you at all, and
I certainly wouldn't want to offend you.

1282
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,690
But are you some kind of a nut?

1283
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,970
Are you going to tell me that you
approve of what's been going on here?

1284
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:24,570
- I wasn't going to tell you that at all.
- Because if you do...

1285
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,530
You may be a big, successful
newspaper publisher...

1286
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,890
and I'm nothing but
a pensioned-off mailman...

1287
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,970
but you are right out of your mind.

1288
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:43,090
I have a pretty good idea
of what my father is saying to him.

1289
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:47,330
But I wish I knew...

1290
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:50,290
You were talking with him upstairs.

1291
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,410
Have you any idea what
Mr. Drayton is saying to my father?

1292
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,210
I can tell you one thing.
I was very sorry to hear...

1293
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,410
that you intend
to withdraw from the situation...

1294
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:03,450
if you encounter any opposition.

1295
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,530
She's up there packing.

1296
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,730
Your mother
would like to speak to you.

1297
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,930
This is a mess.
Where's Joey?

1298
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,850
- She's upstairs, my dear.
- I'm going up.

1299
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,970
Everything is ready
whenever you all are ready.

1300
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:39,890
We're not ready, Tillie.

1301
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:43,410
Well!

1302
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:47,050
What you're saying is that you feel
practically the same as I do about this.

1303
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,650
That's right.
But even so...

1304
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:54,330
this is a hell of an unhappy situation
for both your son and my daughter.

1305
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,330
I think it would be best
if you talked to John yourself.

1306
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,010
I said that...

1307
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,010
if they didn't approve,
there'd be no marriage.

1308
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,930
I set the terms, Mama.

1309
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,610
They don't disapprove.

1310
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:23,730
Only Mr. Drayton.

1311
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,570
Are you sure?

1312
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,970
She said she'd even drive
the two of you to the airport.

1313
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:37,850
I've lived with your father
for almost 40 years.

1314
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,570
God willing,
there'll be a lot more.

1315
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,610
And even though...

1316
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:46,970
I've only known about this situation
for one hour...

1317
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,370
I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

1318
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,930
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

1319
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:57,130
I guess...

1320
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,370
it depends upon
how much you want her.

1321
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,650
Want her?

1322
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:07,970
I want her, Mama.

1323
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,170
You know what it's been like for me
these past eight years?

1324
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:16,210
I felt like I never wanted
anybody again.

1325
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,890
But, Mama...

1326
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:23,290
these last few days with her...

1327
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,850
it's like I'm alive again
and it's marvelous.

1328
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,730
Excuse me, Doctor.

1329
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,850
Your father wants to talk to you.

1330
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:37,970
- Does he?
- He's in my study.

1331
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:59,250
I've been talking to your husband.

1332
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:02,490
He seems pretty much upset
by all this.

1333
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,610
I know.

1334
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:06,890
Your wife says you are too.

1335
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:10,450
Not upset, exactly.
It's a very difficult problem.

1336
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:14,930
For whom?
For you and my husband?

1337
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,530
I think you'll solve your problem,
all right.

1338
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:22,330
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them.

1339
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:23,490
That's all.

1340
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,410
And you'll have no problem.

1341
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:31,010
You're not going to tell me
you're happy about this relationship?

1342
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,890
This is not a night
for talking about happiness.

1343
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,850
This is an unhappy night.

1344
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:42,730
You've been talking to Christina.
I know how she feels.

1345
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:46,930
Can you imagine for one minute that
I want to see either one of them hurt?

1346
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,890
No more than my husband does.

1347
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,610
But hurt they're going to be.

1348
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,210
Worse than my husband knows.

1349
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:02,810
I think worse than you know too.

1350
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,930
I tell you he's as much
against this thing as I am.

1351
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,410
Maybe more!

1352
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,770
Son, you've got to listen to me.

1353
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,570
I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life...

1354
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,450
but you've never
made a mistake like this before.

1355
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,450
You've been nothin'
but a source of pride...

1356
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,610
for me and your mother
your whole life.

1357
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:23,650
But you don't know what you're doin'.

1358
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:26,090
This affair here...
It all happened too fast.

1359
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:28,010
You said so yourself.

1360
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,450
But you've got to stop and think.

1361
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:32,850
Have you thought what people
would say about you?

1362
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:36,610
In 16 or 17 states you'd
be breakin' the law. You'd be criminals.

1363
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,570
And say they changed the law.

1364
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,450
That don't change
the way people feel about this thing.

1365
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:44,330
For a man who all his life never
put a wrong foot anywhere...

1366
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:45,850
you're way out of line!

1367
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:48,330
That's for me to decide, man.

1368
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,330
- So just shut up and let me...
- You don't say that to me!

1369
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,890
You haven't got the right to ever say
a thing like that to me.

1370
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,970
Not after what I've been to you!

1371
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,130
And you know that,
and I know that.

1372
01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:00,530
Yeah, I know what you are
and what you've made of yourself.

1373
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:04,250
But I worked my ass off to get the money
to buy you all the chances you had!

1374
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:08,450
You know how far
I carried that bag in 30 years?

1375
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:10,810
75,000 miles.

1376
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:14,130
And mowin' lawns in the dark so you
wouldn't have to be stokin' furnaces...

1377
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:16,530
and could bear down on the books.

1378
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:21,330
There were things your mother should
have had that she insisted go for you.

1379
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,410
And I don't mean fancy things.

1380
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:26,210
I mean a decent coat.
A lousy coat!

1381
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,330
And you're gonna tell me
that means nothin' to you...

1382
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,250
and you could
break your mother's heart?

1383
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:37,450
What happens to men
when they grow old?

1384
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,770
Why do they forget everything?

1385
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,810
I believe...

1386
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:47,450
those two young people
need each other...

1387
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,610
like they need
the air to breathe in.

1388
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:54,090
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

1389
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,730
But you and my husband are...

1390
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,850
You might as well be blind men.

1391
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,850
You can only see
that they have a problem.

1392
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,770
But do you really know
what's happened to them?

1393
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,690
How they feel about each other?

1394
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,650
I believe...

1395
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,490
that men grow old.

1396
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,330
And when the...

1397
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:23,090
When sexual things no longer matter
to them, they forget it all.

1398
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:27,330
Forget what true passion is.

1399
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,690
If you ever felt what my son...

1400
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:37,930
feels for your daughter,
you've forgotten everything about it.

1401
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,170
My husband too.

1402
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:42,130
You knew once...

1403
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:44,050
but that was a long time ago.

1404
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:46,010
Now the two of you don't know.

1405
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:50,250
And the strange thing...

1406
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,290
for your wife and me...

1407
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:56,570
is that you don't even remember.

1408
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,490
If you did...

1409
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,810
how could you do
what you are doing?

1410
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:11,410
I don't care what your mother says.
Maybe she's gone haywire too.

1411
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:13,050
This is between you and me.

1412
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,490
That's the first thing you've said
that makes any sense...

1413
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,010
because that's exactly where it's at.

1414
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:19,610
- And what I mean to say is...
- You've said what you had to say.

1415
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,010
You listen to me.

1416
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:29,650
You say you don't want to tell me
how to live my life?

1417
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,250
What do you think
you've been doing?

1418
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,610
You tell me what rights I've got
or haven't got...

1419
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,770
and what I owe to you
for what you've done for me.

1420
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,970
Let me tell you something.

1421
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:42,650
I owe you nothing.

1422
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,970
If you carried that bag
a million miles...

1423
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,730
you did what you
were supposed to do...

1424
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,370
because you brought me
into this world...

1425
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,890
and from that day you owed me...

1426
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,410
everything you could ever do for me,
like I will owe my son...

1427
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:56,770
if I ever have another.

1428
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,410
But you don't own me.

1429
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:02,690
You can't tell me when or where
I'm out of line...

1430
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:05,970
or try to get me to live my life
according to your rules.

1431
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,890
You don't even know
what I am, Dad.

1432
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:12,010
You don't know who I am,
how I feel, what I think.

1433
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:15,770
And if I tried to explain it the rest of
your life, you would never understand.

1434
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:19,690
You are 30 years older than I am.

1435
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:21,890
You and your whole lousy generation...

1436
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,850
believes the way it was for you
is the way it's got to be!

1437
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,850
And not until your whole generation
has lain down and died...

1438
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,930
will the deadweight of you
be off our backs!

1439
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:33,970
You understand?
You've got to get off my back.

1440
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,330
Dad.

1441
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:01,690
You're my father.

1442
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:04,970
I'm your son.
I love you.

1443
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:08,730
I always have
and I always will.

1444
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:13,770
But you think of yourself
as a colored man.

1445
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:17,250
I think of myself...

1446
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:19,170
as a man.

1447
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,850
Now, I've got a decision to make.

1448
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,050
And I've got to make it alone.

1449
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,970
And I gotta make it in a hurry.

1450
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,650
So...

1451
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,170
would you go out there...

1452
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,090
and see after my mother?

1453
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:36,610
You've just got to talk John's parents
into flying over with you.

1454
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,570
It would mean so much to John
to have them there...

1455
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:41,090
and I know they can afford it.

1456
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:44,290
You know, I think John's father
is gonna make it a bit rough for him.

1457
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:47,970
Did you see his expression when he
walked off to have a talk with Dad?

1458
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:49,810
But isn't she lovely?

1459
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,210
- Don't you like her already?
- Yes, darling, I do.

1460
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,850
She's a good one.

1461
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:56,210
When John's father first saw
that I was a white girl...

1462
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,130
I thought he was going to faint.

1463
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,330
What about your father?

1464
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:03,410
Yes, that was funny, wasn't it?

1465
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:06,770
Oh, Mom, isn't this thrilling?
Aren't you just...

1466
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:08,970
Yes, darling, I am. Just.

1467
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:58,650
I should be able to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.

1468
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:04,130
In my trade, there are
a hundred cliché phrases of comfort...

1469
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:06,890
for every human condition.

1470
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:10,450
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...

1471
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,410
I must admit...

1472
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,330
I'm completely stumped.

1473
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,330
There's simply
nothing I could say.

1474
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:23,010
Mary, you've just got to understand...

1475
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:26,050
Please, John.
The monsignor is right.

1476
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,970
Please say no more.

1477
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,170
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1478
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,530
Close the door, Mr. Drayton.

1479
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:25,210
You didn't have the guts
to tell me face-to-face, did you?

1480
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:28,970
Before you start telling me
how much guts I've got...

1481
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:32,290
I told you
I'd have something to say.

1482
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:34,210
Now I'm ready to say it.

1483
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,930
Are you gonna stay in here?

1484
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:56,530
You know that I'm
completely sympathetic, don't you?

1485
01:33:56,610 --> 01:34:00,090
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.

1486
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:03,330
And that whatever makes you happy
is my happiness too.

1487
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,250
Of course I know that.

1488
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:09,490
Then listen to me, darling.

1489
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:12,050
There's something
I have to tell you...

1490
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:14,210
about this situation...

1491
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,130
which you don't really...

1492
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,330
What are you doing up there?

1493
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:21,410
Come on down here, both of you!

1494
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,090
How about your glasses?

1495
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:28,090
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1496
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,010
No, you've had
enough as it is already.

1497
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,850
What's going on?

1498
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:36,170
There's something I want to say
and I'd like you to sit down...

1499
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,450
see if you can keep quiet
for once in your life.

1500
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:40,490
Please, sit down, John.

1501
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:42,410
Sit down, Chris, please.

1502
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:47,610
I have a few things to say and
you might just think they're important.

1503
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:53,130
This has been a strange day. I don't
think that's putting it too strongly.

1504
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,850
I might even say
it's been an extraordinary day.

1505
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:59,610
I've been out there
thinking about the day...

1506
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:01,610
and the way it has gone...

1507
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:04,570
and it seems to me that now...

1508
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:08,210
I need to make a few
personal statements.

1509
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,610
For a variety of reasons.

1510
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:18,690
The day began for me when I walked into
this house and Tillie said to me...

1511
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,210
Excuse me.

1512
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,890
Tillie!
This'll only take a second.

1513
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:27,530
- Everything's been ready for...
- I know.

1514
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:29,450
All right. Sit down.

1515
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,330
This is Miss Matilda Binks...

1516
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:35,690
who's been a member of this family
for 22 years...

1517
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,770
and who today has been
making a great deal of trouble.

1518
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:39,930
Sit down, Tillie.

1519
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:47,490
Now. The minute I walked
into this house this afternoon...

1520
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:52,570
Miss Binks said to me,
"Well, all hell's done broke loose now."

1521
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:55,090
I asked her, naturally enough,
to what she referred...

1522
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:57,370
and she said, "You'll see."

1523
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,010
And I did.

1524
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:04,650
Then after some preliminary guessing
games, at which I was never very good...

1525
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:07,570
it was explained to me
by my daughter...

1526
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:09,970
that she intended to get married.

1527
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:14,410
And that her intended was a young man
whom I had never met...

1528
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:17,370
who happened to be a Negro.

1529
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:21,730
I think it's fair to say
that I responded to this news...

1530
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:24,850
in the same manner that any
normal father would respond to it...

1531
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,770
unless, of course, his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

1532
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:34,130
In a word, I was flabbergasted. And
while I was still being flabbergasted...

1533
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:36,890
I was informed by my daughter...

1534
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:38,930
a very determined young woman...

1535
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:40,970
much like her mother...

1536
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:44,290
that the marriage was on...

1537
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:47,130
no matter what her mother and I
might feel about it.

1538
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:53,970
Then the next startling development
occurred when you walked in...

1539
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,450
and said that unless we...
her mother and I...

1540
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:59,850
approved of the marriage,
there would be no marriage.

1541
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,970
You didn't!
What a funny thing to do.

1542
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:08,050
This may be the last chance
I'll ever have...

1543
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,210
to tell you to do anything.

1544
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:12,530
So I'm telling you
shut up.

1545
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:18,130
Now.

1546
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:22,170
It became clear that we had one
single day to make up our minds...

1547
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,450
as to how we felt
about this whole situation.

1548
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,730
So what happened?

1549
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,970
My wife, typically enough...

1550
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,850
decided to simply ignore...

1551
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:33,650
every practical aspect
of the situation...

1552
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:37,170
and was carried away
in some kind of romantic haze...

1553
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,850
which made her, in my view...

1554
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:42,490
totally inaccessible
to anything in the way of reason.

1555
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:49,410
Now I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence...

1556
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:52,850
who began by forcing his way
into the situation...

1557
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:55,170
and then insulting my intelligence...,.

1558
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:57,930
By mouthing 300 platitudes...

1559
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:01,410
and ending just a half hour ago
by coming to my room...

1560
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:04,850
and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

1561
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:08,370
- What time is your plane?
- 10:45.

1562
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:10,850
Right.

1563
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,970
Now, Mr. Prentice...

1564
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:15,410
clearly a most reasonable man...

1565
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:17,330
says he has no wish to offend me...

1566
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:19,530
but wants to know
if I'm some kind of a nut.

1567
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:23,250
And Mrs. Prentice says...

1568
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:26,210
that like her husband,
I'm a burnt-out old shell of a man...

1569
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,370
who cannot even
remember what it's like...

1570
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:31,090
to love a woman...

1571
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:34,930
the way her son loves my daughter.

1572
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,650
And strange as it seems...

1573
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:46,290
that's the first statement
made to me all day...

1574
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:48,690
with which I am prepared
to take issue.

1575
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:54,170
Because I think you're wrong.

1576
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:56,570
You're as wrong as you can be.

1577
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:01,370
I admit that I hadn't considered it,
hadn't even thought about it...

1578
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:04,930
but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

1579
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:08,570
And there is nothing,
absolutely nothing...

1580
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,930
that your son feels
for my daughter...

1581
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,210
that I didn't feel for Christina.

1582
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:18,690
Old? Yes.

1583
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:20,650
Burnt out? Certainly.

1584
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:24,930
But I can tell you
the memories are still there...

1585
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:29,770
clear, intact, indestructible.

1586
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:33,810
And they'll be there
if I live to be 110.

1587
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:36,450
Where John
made his mistake, I think...

1588
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:40,090
was attaching so much importance
to what her mother and I might think.

1589
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:45,050
Because in the final analysis,
it doesn't matter a damn what we think.

1590
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:48,290
The only thing that matters
is what they feel...

1591
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:50,930
and how much they feel...

1592
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:52,850
for each other.

1593
01:39:56,330 --> 01:39:58,570
And if it's half...

1594
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:00,490
of what we felt...

1595
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:05,970
that's everything.

1596
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,810
As for you two and
the problems you're going to have...

1597
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:25,250
they seem almost unimaginable.

1598
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:27,450
But you'll have no problem with me.

1599
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:30,290
And I think...

1600
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:33,050
that when Christina and I
and your mother...

1601
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:35,050
have some time to work on him...

1602
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:37,330
you'll have no problem
with your father.

1603
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:44,210
But you do know...
I'm sure you know...

1604
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,570
what you're up against.

1605
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,930
There'll be a hundred million people
right here in this country...

1606
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,090
who'll be shocked and offended...

1607
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,690
and appalled at the two of you.

1608
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:59,890
And the two of you will just
have to ride that out.

1609
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:02,490
Maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

1610
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:07,570
You can try to ignore those people...

1611
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:10,650
or you can feel sorry for them
and for their prejudices...

1612
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:15,690
and their bigotry and
their blind hatreds and stupid fears.

1613
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,610
But where necessary...

1614
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:21,210
you'll just have
to cling tight to each other...

1615
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:24,170
and say screw all those people!

1616
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:29,650
Anybody could make a hell of a
good case against your getting married.

1617
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:33,570
The arguments are so obvious
that nobody has to make them.

1618
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,850
But you're two wonderful people...

1619
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:40,570
who happened to fall in love...

1620
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:45,010
and happen to have
a pigmentation problem.

1621
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:48,210
And I think that now...

1622
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:50,450
no matter what kind of a case
some bastard could make...

1623
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:52,370
against your getting married...

1624
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:54,290
there would be only one thing worse.

1625
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:58,170
And that would be if...

1626
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:00,410
knowing what you two are...

1627
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,570
knowing what you two have...

1628
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:05,730
and knowing what you two feel...

1629
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:07,930
you didn't get married.

1630
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:30,530
Well, Tillie, when the hell
are we gonna get some dinner?
