1
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,249
Good morning.
Good morning.

2
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,665
Here's the new dress
for Miss Sloper.

3
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,123
Thank you.

4
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,038
Miss Catherine,
it's your new dress.

5
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:13,162
Oh! Will you take it out of the box,
Maria, and hang it up?

6
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:14,705
Yes, miss.

7
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,160
Well, that's all, I think.

8
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:27,161
I'll be at the Harrisons'.
Yes, Doctor.

9
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,243
I may not get
to the clinic today at all.

10
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,284
Good morning, Lavinia.
Good morning, Austin.

11
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,284
Is Catherine starting
another of these things?

12
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,284
Yes. She embroiders
beautifully.

13
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,991
I hope she doesn't let it
become her life's work.

14
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,742
Austin,
yesterday I had the most exciting experience.

15
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,282
I met two people
from Poughkeepsie.

16
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:49,824
Oh, birth certificates.

17
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,281
They had been members
of my husband's congregation,

18
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,156
and when I told them I was stopping
with my brother, Dr. Sloper,

19
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,615
at 16 Washington Square,
they were so impressed.

20
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,571
It's just made my visit.

21
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:03,614
Lavinia, would you care
to spend the winter here?

22
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:06,154
The winter? Oh, gladly.

23
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:10,528
Good. I thought if you stayed on,
you might help Catherine.

24
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:14,445
Help her?
But help her how, Austin?

25
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,362
Well, for instance,
at Sister Elizabeth's party this evening.

26
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:21,194
Perhaps you could persuade Catherine to
join in freely with the young people.

27
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:22,569
Enjoy herself.

28
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:25,486
But of course she'll do that.
I hope so.

29
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:35,984
Six pounds.
That'll be 30 cents.

30
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,233
Could you please
cut off the head?

31
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,316
Yes, miss.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

32
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,983
There you are.
Thank you.

33
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,398
Yes, ma'am.
Fresh fish, fresh fish.

34
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,439
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Catherine.

35
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,897
I've bought a fine fish
for the chowder you like.

36
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:59,480
That's very thoughtful.
Next time, let the man carry it in for you.

37
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,145
Oh, yes, Father.
Coming.

38
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,605
It's a lovely morning.

39
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:08,105
Why don't you invite your Aunt Lavinia
or a friend to take luncheon with you,

40
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,187
perhaps go
to one of the park concerts?

41
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,018
I can't, Father.
I have some embroidery I'd like to attend to.

42
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,478
Yes.

43
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,561
Well,
I'll see you this evening.

44
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,437
Yes, Father. Goodbye.

45
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,933
Catherine?
Come in, Aunt Penniman.

46
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,390
Oh, you must hurry, dear.

47
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,348
You were a long time
at that hospital committee.

48
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,890
Too long.
Didn't you like it?

49
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh, some of the ladies on the committee
are so foolish they're useless.

50
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:56,681
They think it ill-bred to know anything
about food or what is done in the kitchen.

51
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,347
Such airs and graces.

52
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:01,387
Now, when I was young,
we took pride in our housewifery.

53
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,512
My, when I think
of the meals I used to set

54
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,678
before the Reverend Penniman,
rest his soul.

55
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:08,220
Then you have deceived me, Aunt.
Why, how so?

56
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:12,219
You led me to believe that you
and he lived on love alone.

57
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,428
Now, dear, you see,
some little witticism like that

58
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,676
would be of interest to the
young people this evening.

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,218
It's a very good way
to get started.

60
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,094
What I mean is,

61
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,509
don't go off by yourself tonight,
will you?

62
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:25,925
Stay with all of us
and enjoy the party.

63
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,801
You have been talking
to Father.

64
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:30,884
Well, yes, dear.
In a way, I have.

65
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,300
You see,
your father feels...

66
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:36,049
Father would like me to be composed
and to join in the conversation.

67
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,216
Yes.

68
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:38,674
I can't, Aunt Lavinia.

69
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,924
Oh, dear, perhaps
you don't try sufficiently.

70
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,756
Oh, I do, I do.

71
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,131
I would do anything
to please him.

72
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,589
There's nothing that means
more to me than that.

73
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,589
I have sat here in my room and made
notes of the things I should say

74
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,379
and how I should say them.

75
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,129
But when I am in company,

76
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,588
it seems that no one
could want to listen to me.

77
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:59,713
Now, Catherine,
if you will stay by me this evening,

78
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:03,712
you will see that what I say is not
always of the greatest importance.

79
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,295
But, dear,
that doesn't keep me from talking.

80
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:07,712
Yes, Aunt.

81
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,961
Now, I'll finish dressing
and meet you downstairs.

82
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:32,957
Father?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,331
Come in, Catherine.

84
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,290
Good evening, Father.
Do I disturb you?

85
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:41,082
You are not
a disturbing woman, my dear.

86
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:48,705
Do you like my dress?

87
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,537
Is it possible this magnificent
person is my daughter?

88
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:56,244
But you're sumptuous, opulent.

89
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:59,203
You look as if you had
$80,000 a year.

90
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,868
I thought you would like the color.
Yes.

91
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,535
It's cherry red.
So it is.

92
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:09,161
I believe
my mother used to wear it.

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,867
In her hair ribbons, Austin.

94
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:14,992
Yes.

95
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,284
But, Catherine,
your mother was fair.

96
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:22,033
She dominated the color.

97
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,574
Well, I must dress.

98
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,324
I'll try
not to keep you waiting.

99
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:35,865
Oh, I must pack our silver
punch cups for Aunt Elizabeth.

100
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,238
Now, Austin,
you do think it's entirely proper

101
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:44,072
for me to go
to Sister Elizabeth's party?

102
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,405
But of course. Why not?

103
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,237
Well, after all,
I'm still in mourning.

104
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,738
Lavinia, I know you'll bear your
sorrow with equal fortitude

105
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,611
whatever the surroundings.

106
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:53,737
That's right.

107
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,736
After all, I'm just as
grief-stricken no matter where I am.

108
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:27,315
You're wonderful.

109
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,731
Your Aunt Penniman has
made a conquest.

110
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:30,897
Yes.

111
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,564
Well, having a nice time,
Catherine?

112
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,898
Delightful,
Aunt Elizabeth.

113
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,315
So is Jefferson.

114
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,314
Well, Austin, who's sick?
Who's dead?

115
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,688
Who've you been
cutting up lately?

116
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,147
Yes, I can see
you're in good shape.

117
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,895
When your gout's troubling you,
you're more respectful to me.

118
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,229
Are you going to get up there
and make that announcement?

119
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,562
Yes, my dear.
Well, go on, go on.

120
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,478
All right, all right.

121
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:53,186
If he doesn't do it now,
he'll have to make it from under a table.

122
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,852
My good neighbors
and dear friends,

123
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:02,851
I am about to lose
the loveliest,

124
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,684
the most beautiful daughter,

125
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,726
the very dearest girl,

126
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,392
to a most wonderful young man,

127
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,224
to Arthur Townsend.

128
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:16,849
I am at once a sad
and a very lucky father.

129
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,391
I'd like you all
to toast my loss

130
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,431
and my gain.

131
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:27,264
To the happy couple.

132
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,389
Oh, Mama.

133
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:37,055
Oh, don't look so happy.
I'll be home for all my meals.

134
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:38,345
Uncle Austin.

135
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,513
Marian, my dear,
great happiness to both of you.

136
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,681
Thank you, sir.

137
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:44,845
Oh, Cathy, isn't it wonderful?
Isn't this a lovely party?

138
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,886
Come along, Arthur,
let's dance.

139
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,261
Excuse us.

140
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:55,385
Oh, Quintus,
you're not dancing?

141
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,677
No, ma'am.

142
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,843
You remember Catherine Sloper,
my niece?

143
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,385
Yes, indeed.

144
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,592
May I have the pleasure,
Catherine?

145
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,509
Thank you, Quintus.

146
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,258
Excuse me, Father.

147
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,715
Permit me, Catherine.

148
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,424
Oh, thank you, Father.

149
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:38,213
Do you suppose there's another Arthur
somewhere in this great city of ours?

150
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,546
Catherine will find a husband.
You think so?

151
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:42,921
Oh, she has the prospect
of $30,000 a year.

152
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,211
I see that you appreciate her.

153
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,335
I don't mean
it's her only merit,

154
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,753
but you always have a way of alluding
to her as an unmarriageable girl.

155
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:54,502
My allusions
are as kind as yours, Liz.

156
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,126
Do you suppose Jefferson has
left any of his French brandy?

157
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,501
Let's see.

158
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,792
May I get you some claret cup?

159
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,750
Oh, yes, thank you.

160
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:20,206
She's gone to the best schools
in the city.

161
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,997
She's had the finest training I
could get her. Music and dancing.

162
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,372
She's sat with me
evenings on end.

163
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:29,872
I've tried to make conversation with
her and give her some social adeptness.

164
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:32,121
I've given her freedom
wherever I could.

165
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,953
The result is what you see:

166
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,704
An entirely mediocre
and defenseless creature

167
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,703
with not a shred of poise.

168
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:42,579
But, Austin, you're so intolerant.
You expect so much.

169
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,786
You remember her mother, Liz?

170
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:48,244
Her mother,
who had so much grace and gaiety.

171
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:51,201
This is her child.

172
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:55,742
Austin, no child could compete with
this image you have of her mother.

173
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:59,367
You've idealized that poor dead
woman beyond all human recognition.

174
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,867
You are not entitled
to say that.

175
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:06,532
Only I know what I'd lost
when she died

176
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,157
and what I got in her place.

177
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,612
Catherine,
what are you doing here?

178
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm waiting for Quintus Seabury.
He's bringing me some claret cup.

179
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,237
Well, don't wait here, dear.
Make him look for you.

180
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,858
Dancing was the one thing
we disagreed about,

181
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,689
the Reverend and I.

182
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,856
Do you suppose
he's watching over me tonight?

183
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,564
That depends on where he is,
Aunt.

184
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,188
Good evening, Mrs. Penniman.

185
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:21,313
Oh, good evening.
Good evening!

186
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,730
Catherine, dear,
may I present Mr. Morris Townsend?

187
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:25,021
How do you do, Miss Sloper?

188
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:29,270
Mr. Townsend is Arthur's cousin, dear,
and he's just returned from Europe.

189
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:30,311
How do you do, sir?

190
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,521
Would you have a dance for me,
Miss Sloper?

191
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,936
I believe
she has a waltz left.

192
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,853
Excuse me, dear,
there is Mr. Abeel.

193
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,434
May I?

194
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:45,809
Yes.

195
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,058
Which one will it be?

196
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh.

197
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,306
The fifth?

198
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,680
The fifth? Thank you.

199
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,139
Two R's in Morris.

200
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,720
Miss Sloper,
I consider that you do me a great honor.

201
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:27,220
You see,
I'm rather choosy, too.

202
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:41,592
Catherine Sloper.

203
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,175
Catherine Sloper.
Catherine Sloper.

204
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,049
You know,
we don't have to wait until the fifth.

205
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,590
No?
No.

206
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,670
Miss Sloper,
we must make an arrangement.

207
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:25,919
I will not kick you
if you will not kick me.

208
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,628
Oh, dear, I'm so clumsy.

209
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,793
No, no,
it's only that I'm wearing Arthur's boots,

210
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:31,836
and he's a very bad dancer.

211
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:33,919
Now.

212
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,668
One, two, three, point.

213
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,582
Don't look at your feet.
Where shall I look?

214
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,333
Look at me.

215
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,331
No.

216
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,369
Very good.

217
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:54,490
And when we were boys,
Arthur was called Porridge Head.

218
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,405
Shall we sit down?

219
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:57,905
While I've been in Europe,

220
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,031
he's become
a promising young businessman.

221
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:05,155
And now, Miss Sloper,
I think it's time you said something.

222
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:11,320
Are you going to remain
in New York now, Mr. Townsend?

223
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,237
What a delightful question.

224
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:18,319
Well, I haven't been at all
sure what I was going to do.

225
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,445
But right now, I've decided.

226
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:24,693
Yes, Miss Sloper,
I am going to remain in New York now.

227
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,401
Are you warm?
Let me get you some claret cup.

228
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,651
Oh, no.

229
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,942
Are you a member
of the Temperance League?

230
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,983
Yes, I believe I am.
Oh.

231
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:42,024
Well, I'm not.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

232
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:59,646
Oh, Mr. Abeel,
I can't keep this up any longer.

233
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,438
I must rest.

234
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:06,520
Catherine, dear,
your old auntie is exhausted.

235
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:11,104
You finish this delightful polka for me,
dear. Mr. Abeel is an accomplished dancer.

236
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:14,186
I...
It would be a pleasure, Miss Sloper.

237
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:04,137
Mr. Townsend,
are you looking for my niece?

238
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,844
Yes, she must have been ambushed.
Will you console me?

239
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,553
She'll be back in a moment.

240
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:13,594
This is the sixth dance in a row.
Now, he just can't keep it up.

241
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,260
You know, I can dance most of these
young whippersnappers off their feet.

242
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,343
Lavinia?

243
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:27,550
Oh, Austin,
may I present Mr. Morris Townsend?

244
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,592
Mr. Townsend, my brother,
Dr. Sloper.

245
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,967
I've looked forward to meeting you, Doctor.
I'm honored.

246
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,925
Thank you.

247
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,174
Have you had a nice time?

248
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,298
Austin, I've had
a most wonderful evening.

249
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:40,840
And we had some difficulty
in persuading her to come.

250
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:44,465
The gentlemen here all owe
you a vote of thanks, Doctor.

251
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:47,379
Geier will be ready very soon.
Will you tell Catherine?

252
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,339
It's the best part
of the evening, sir.

253
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,922
It really is, Austin.

254
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:54,296
But you're used to those gay
nights at the parsonage, my dear.

255
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,796
I, alas,
must be an early riser.

256
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,128
Good night, Mr. Townsend.

257
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,795
Good night, sir.

258
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:04,921
Oh, Catherine, I have bad news.
We're leaving.

259
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,626
Yes, Aunt.

260
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,211
Where is Mr. Abeel?

261
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:09,752
He's having a nosebleed.

262
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:11,126
Oh, dear.

263
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,002
Good night, Mr. Townsend.

264
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,001
Good night, Mrs. Penniman.

265
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:18,793
I wish to apologize, sir.

266
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,792
You should, Miss Sloper.

267
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:25,375
Had Mr. Abeel kept his health,
I should have invited him out with sabers.

268
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:29,957
Well, I...

269
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,040
I must get my wrap.

270
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,624
Oh, I've just met your father.

271
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,622
Yes, I saw.

272
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:39,872
He left before I could ask him
when I might call.

273
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,665
His office hours
are in the morning.

274
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:44,206
Are you not well,
Mr. Townsend?

275
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:47,788
I am in the best of health.
I wish to call on you.

276
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,830
Oh.

277
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,037
Oh.

278
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:42,863
Good morning, Mr. Townsend.
Good morning.

279
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:45,031
Miss Sloper is
not at home, sir.

280
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:46,697
She isn't?

281
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:49,238
Why, Mr. Townsend.

282
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,779
Good morning, Mrs. Penniman.
Do come in.

283
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,112
I stopped by because Miss
Sloper told me yesterday

284
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:57,944
she'd be at home this morning.

285
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,277
Is she really out?
Oh, yes.

286
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,610
I think she has taken flight
at your third visit this week.

287
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:05,027
I wonder why.

288
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,525
Oh,
I cannot betray a confidence.

289
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:09,943
You must ask her that.

290
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,275
When?
Well...

291
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,275
I know she won't be long.

292
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:18,899
Thank you, ma'am.

293
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,606
The parsonage
was a veritable beehive,

294
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,899
with our spelling matches,
our taffy pulls...

295
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,065
Oh, and in the winter,
in the winter,

296
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,273
the sleigh rides
over the Poughkeepsie hills.

297
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,773
Mrs. Penniman,
do you suppose Catherine will...

298
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,273
I mean Miss Sloper.

299
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,648
My dear boy,
you may let yourself go when you're with me.

300
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,105
Yes, thank you, but...

301
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,979
She will be home.

302
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:40,813
Yes, but when?

303
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:44,021
Mr. Townsend, you remind me so
of the Reverend Penniman.

304
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:47,477
The same ardency,
the same passionate nature.

305
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,978
How I wish
I might have known him.

306
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:53,353
Tell me about the doctor,
ma'am. What sort of...

307
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:59,602
Oh, Catherine, is that you?
Yes, Aunt.

308
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:02,601
You have a visitor,
young lady.

309
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,101
Good morning.

310
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:07,185
It is a beautiful morning for me now,
Miss Sloper,

311
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:09,935
for I was afraid you might
not come back at all.

312
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:13,267
I would have to come back
sometime. I live here.

313
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,348
I know you do, Miss Sloper.
That is why I'm here.

314
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:24,557
Mr. Townsend wondered if his flowers
had been delivered in good condition.

315
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,890
Yes, thank you.

316
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:29,389
They were very fresh.
I mailed you a note this morning.

317
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,014
I shall treasure it,
Miss Sloper,

318
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:33,931
although I did not send the
flowers in order to be thanked.

319
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,805
I sent them
to give you pleasure.

320
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:37,180
Thank you.

321
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:40,595
Oh, I brought that song
I told you I found in Paris.

322
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:43,595
Pardon me, ma'am, I'll get it.

323
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,095
I will leave you alone
with him.

324
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,719
What will I talk about?
You will not have to do the talking.

325
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,761
My dear child,
he has come a-courting.

326
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,094
Courting me?
Well, certainly not me, miss.

327
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,927
Now, you must
be very gracious to him.

328
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,259
Oh, Mr. Townsend,
you must excuse me.

329
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:00,551
I have numerous duties
which call me.

330
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:02,591
I trust
that we shall see you again.

331
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,385
I'm your servant, ma'am.

332
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:07,551
Oh, Catherine,
you haven't forgotten about this evening?

333
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:08,715
No, Aunt.

334
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:12,215
Our girl is off to another
one of her endless parties.

335
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,175
It makes me very unhappy to hear that.
What?

336
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,464
That you are so sought after.
It makes my way harder.

337
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:23,714
I am not going to a party.

338
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,588
My father and I are dining with
Mr. And Mrs. Hone, that's all.

339
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:32,005
That's what I like you for.
You're so honest.

340
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:35,381
Tell me something.

341
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:39,254
Did you go out this morning
because you thought I might call?

342
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,836
Yes.

343
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,462
Do you not like to see me?

344
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:47,545
Yes, I like to see you,
Mr. Townsend,

345
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:50,170
but you have called so
frequently this week that I...

346
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:52,419
You're tired of me?
Oh, no.

347
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:55,084
You consider my behavior
improper?

348
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:59,000
I do not know. I am puzzled.

349
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,168
Good. I like that.

350
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,083
If you're puzzled,
you're thinking of me.

351
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,498
Is that the song?

352
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,541
Yes.

353
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,749
Will you play it for me?

354
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,957
I do not play.

355
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,541
May I?

356
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,289
I assure you I shan't harm it.

357
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,036
Can you hear me
way over there?

358
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:51,326
You know, on my tenth visit,
you might even sit here.

359
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,035
Mr. Townsend,
you are very bold.

360
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,987
Do you know what it means?

361
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,029
No.

362
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:37,279
The joys of love,

363
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:43,235
they last but a short time.

364
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:48,817
The pains of love

365
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,567
last all your life.

366
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:56,317
All your life.

367
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,107
It's a lovely song.

368
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:24,312
You know,
I think of you constantly.

369
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm not very good
at this kind of conversation.

370
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,021
Neither am I.

371
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,978
I'm afraid that is our trouble.
I'm not a glib man, Miss Sloper.

372
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:37,020
I think you talk very well.

373
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,518
Not when I need it most.

374
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,602
Oh, with Mrs. Penniman,
or in my room at home,

375
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:45,893
I can think of the most
delightful things to say.

376
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,559
Can you understand that?

377
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,558
Yes, I can.

378
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,184
But here with you,
I sound like a fool.

379
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,392
I don't think so.

380
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,849
You don't?

381
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:02,141
Well, if ever you do think so,
if ever I sound high-blown or false,

382
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,098
put it down to that, will you?

383
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:08,056
I will try.

384
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,805
And take pity on my situation.

385
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,514
What situation?

386
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:19,637
Miss Sloper,
I have fallen in love with you.

387
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:23,345
You have?

388
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,386
Catherine, are you receiving?

389
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:36,135
Yes, Father.
I have a visitor.

390
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,844
Good morning, my dear.
How do you do, Mr. Townsend?

391
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,009
Good morning, Dr. Sloper.

392
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,635
Is your cousin here with you?

393
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:45,135
No, I'm on my own.
I hope you don't mind. Delighted.

394
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,008
I've taken the liberty of calling
on a most attractive young lady

395
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,258
and her attractive father.

396
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:53,799
Oh, we're not that attractive.

397
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,883
Well, I'd like
my sherry and biscuits.

398
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,215
Perhaps Mr. Townsend
might enjoy some with me.

399
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:00,839
I'd be honored.

400
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,881
That's an excellent bay rum
you're using, Mr. Townsend.

401
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:08,048
I brought it with me
from France, Doctor.

402
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,755
Permit me
to share it with you.

403
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,796
Thank you. Very kind,
but I could hardly let you do that.

404
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,381
Well, have you been out
this morning, my dear?

405
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:22,544
Catherine?

406
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,170
Oh, yes. I stopped by to see
Mr. Rougini after breakfast.

407
00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:29,543
Oh, yes, about the lessons.
What did he say?

408
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,252
You need a very true ear
for the harp.

409
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:37,542
It seems that I have not
a very true ear.

410
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:40,709
Nonsense. That's impossible.
Your mother's ear was impeccable.

411
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,667
Yes, Father, I know.

412
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,751
She used
to tune her own piano.

413
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,625
Miss Sloper has a great
appreciation for music.

414
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,790
That is a talent in itself.

415
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:55,539
Is Cook's knee any better,
Maria?

416
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:57,624
It's a little easier
this morning, Doctor.

417
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:02,455
I'll be up to see her in a while.
Here, give that to Mr. Townsend.

418
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,247
You're very kind, sir.

419
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,789
Most great doctors are too busy to
see the illness under their noses.

420
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,079
Mr. Townsend, you're full of agreeable
and flattering observations,

421
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,662
both for Catherine and myself.

422
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:15,704
That is the way
you both strike me, sir.

423
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,704
I told Miss Sloper earlier,
I'm very candid.

424
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:20,203
Oh, yes, he is. Very candid.

425
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:26,203
How long do you plan to remain in our city,
Mr. Townsend?

426
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:28,119
Oh, my stay
is quite indefinite, sir.

427
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,702
Will you dine with us
one evening this week?

428
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:31,952
Doctor, I should
be delighted.

429
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:33,825
Shall we say
Thursday at 6:00?

430
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,409
Thank you, sir.

431
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,618
I was there quite a while. Of course,
not as long as I should have liked.

432
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:43,158
But I think you'll find Paris changed,
Doctor.

433
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:46,116
I hope not.
I should like it to be exactly as it was.

434
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,658
You see,
Dr. Sloper went there on his wedding trip.

435
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh, in that case,
Paris can never change for you, Doctor.

436
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:57,573
How do you keep busy since your
return to New York, Mr. Townsend?

437
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:59,780
I'm looking for a position.

438
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:03,489
Well, your studies abroad should
open many avenues to you.

439
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,988
I engaged in no studies, Mrs. Penniman.
I was merely idling.

440
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:12,862
You see, sir, I had a small inheritance,
and that was how I used it up.

441
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,946
What sort of position
should you prefer?

442
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:19,153
You mean, what am I fit for?
Very little, I'm afraid.

443
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:22,401
I have nothing but my good right arm,
as they say in the melodramas.

444
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:23,651
Oh, you're too modest.

445
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:26,360
In addition to your good right arm,
you have a very good mind.

446
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:29,985
I know nothing of you but what I see,
but I see that you are extremely intelligent.

447
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,400
Oh, yes.

448
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:35,941
Thank you very much.
You advise me, then, not to despair?

449
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:39,858
I should be very sorry to admit
that a robust, well-disposed man

450
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,566
need ever despair.

451
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:44,982
If he doesn't succeed in one thing,
he can try another,

452
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:47,649
only he should choose
with discretion.

453
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,690
Oh, yes, with discretion.

454
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:54,065
Were you kindly intending to
propose something for my advantage?

455
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:58,523
No, I have no particular proposal to make.
But I hear the West is opening up.

456
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:02,146
Many young men are turning
their eyes in that direction.

457
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,729
I'm afraid I shouldn't
be able to manage that.

458
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:08,146
You see, I have ties here.
My sister... Oh, yes.

459
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:12,436
A Mrs. Montgomery, Austin. Liz knows her.
They met at a charity bazaar.

460
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:15,978
She's widowed.
Now that I'm back, I'm staying with her.

461
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,518
She lives in the Second Avenue.
She's very dependent on me.

462
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,642
Naturally.

463
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:24,352
Mr. Townsend has five
little nephews and nieces.

464
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,183
He is helping
to bring them up.

465
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,059
Yes, I give them lessons.
I'm a kind of tutor.

466
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:30,309
Oh, that's very proper.

467
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:33,726
Family feeling is very proper,
but it's hardly a career.

468
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,974
No, it won't make my fortune.

469
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:40,057
You mustn't be too much bent
on a fortune.

470
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:43,432
Mr. Townsend,
I'd looked forward to an evening at home,

471
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:46,432
but the Hospital Commission is in
session and I am to address them.

472
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:49,014
I understand perfectly, sir.
Lavinia, I hope you'll excuse me.

473
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:50,847
Of course, Austin.
Catherine, my dear,

474
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:54,430
you will extend the honors of
the house to Mr. Townsend.

475
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:58,097
I'm very grateful
for your interest, sir.

476
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:00,305
Yes. Yes, indeed.

477
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,303
He doesn't like me.

478
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:13,010
He doesn't like me at all.

479
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:14,844
I don't see how you know.

480
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,927
I feel.
I'm very quick to feel.

481
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,676
Perhaps you are mistaken.

482
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,426
You ask him and you'll see.

483
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,384
Then I would rather
not ask him.

484
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,468
How nice.

485
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,800
But you wouldn't
contradict him?

486
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:33,466
I never contradict him.

487
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:44,506
Austin,
isn't he a charming young man?

488
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,048
I never dreamed he'd be so
interested in Catherine.

489
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,255
Nor did I. He's so agreeable,
so elegant.

490
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:53,088
He may find it hard to maintain
so much elegance in this city

491
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:54,295
without working for it.

492
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,630
But he's looking
for a position most earnestly.

493
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,421
I wonder if he's looking for it here,
Lavinia. What?

494
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:00,878
Wouldn't the position
of husband

495
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:03,128
to a defenseless young girl
with a large fortune

496
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,670
suit him to perfection?

497
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,669
How can you entertain
such a suspicion?

498
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,127
Suspicion?
It's a diagnosis, my dear.

499
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,836
But you're not
in your clinic now, Austin.

500
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:13,668
Why, Morris Townsend would be
a feather in any girl's cap.

501
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,585
You've only to use your eyes,
which are as good as mine.

502
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:17,668
Better.

503
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,875
Austin, you must help this along and
be thankful that it's come about.

504
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,042
Very well, Lavinia.
While I'm being thankful,

505
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:27,041
I hope you will not forget
your duties as chaperon.

506
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,333
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Austin.

507
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:37,582
Catherine,
have you any spirits of camphor in the house?

508
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:38,998
I have one of my headaches.

509
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,332
Headaches, Aunt?
Oh, I'm sorry.

510
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:43,455
I never talk about them.
They strike like a thief in the night.

511
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:45,497
You must permit me to retire.
Of course.

512
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:48,121
But, Aunt!
I know it's not like me to give in, dear,

513
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:51,620
but sometimes fortitude is folly.
Good night, dear.

514
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,328
Good night, Mr. Townsend.
Good night.

515
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,870
Poor Mrs. Penniman.

516
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:04,243
May I offer you your port
in the drawing room?

517
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:07,493
You see?

518
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,243
Yes?

519
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:14,951
Your aunt, she's on my side.
She wouldn't let your father abuse me.

520
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:18,784
My father won't abuse you.
He doesn't know you well enough.

521
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,741
You know,

522
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,324
I would have liked you
to say to me,

523
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:29,449
"If my father doesn't think well of you,
what does it matter?"

524
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:32,614
Oh, but it would matter.
I could never say that.

525
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,822
You could do anything
for one whom you love.

526
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:48,738
My dearest girl,

527
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,486
you must believe
how much I care for you.

528
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,445
You're everything I've ever
yearned for in a woman.

529
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:59,320
But I am... I am so...

530
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:12,817
Oh, Catherine,

531
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,692
will you marry me?

532
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:17,943
Yes.

533
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,731
You make me very happy.

534
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,274
Do you love me?
Yes.

535
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:29,899
Oh, Catherine.

536
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:43,313
I love you.

537
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,769
I will cherish you forever.

538
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,600
We must speak to my father.

539
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,642
I will do it tonight.
You must do it tomorrow.

540
00:37:09,726 --> 00:37:13,266
It's sweet of you to want to do it first.
The young man generally does that.

541
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:17,307
Oh, women have more tact.
They can persuade better.

542
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:20,641
You'll need
all your powers of persuasion.

543
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:25,264
Naturally, your father wants a
brilliant marriage for you, Catherine,

544
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:26,722
and I'm a poor man.

545
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,806
Oh, my father will not care
about that.

546
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:33,846
He might. He might fear that I'm mercenary.
Mercenary?

547
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:36,304
Oh, no.
He may say it.

548
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,221
Well, I shall simply say
it isn't so.

549
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,804
You must make a great point of that,
Catherine.

550
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,929
Why?

551
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:49,512
Because it's from the fact
of your having money

552
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:52,510
that our difficulties
may come.

553
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:57,760
Oh, Morris,
are you very sure you love me?

554
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,635
Oh, my own dearest,

555
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:04,717
how can you doubt it?

556
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:27,381
Catherine,

557
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:34,004
since your aunt has left us alone,
it's not proper that I stay any longer.

558
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:35,879
Yes, Morris.

559
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:42,795
I'll be back in the morning
to call on your father.

560
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:44,545
At what time?

561
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:46,045
At 11:00 sharp.

562
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:50,669
I will tell him, and please,
Morris, promise me this.

563
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:55,334
When you speak with Father,
you will be very gentle, very respectful.

564
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,751
Of course.

565
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,793
And there's something
you must promise me.

566
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:04,666
If your father is against me, you'll
still be faithful, no matter what comes.

567
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:09,125
Yes, Morris.
No matter what comes.

568
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:12,707
You know, you're your own mistress.
You're of age.

569
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,748
Oh, I love you.
I will always love you.

570
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,915
My dear girl.

571
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,903
Oh, Father!
Have you waited up for me?

572
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:43,610
Yes, Father, I...
I have something to tell you.

573
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,235
Have you?
Yes!

574
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,317
Well!

575
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:50,610
Let us go into the back parlor
and hear it.

576
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,400
Now, my dear, do you suppose
that we might both sit down?

577
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:18,188
Well, now?

578
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:20,022
I am engaged to be married.

579
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,270
You do right to tell me.

580
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,646
And whom have you honored
with your choice?

581
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:35,269
Mr. Morris Townsend.

582
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:39,435
You have gone fast.

583
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,810
Yes, I think we have.

584
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:47,059
Mr. Townsend ought to
have waited and told me.

585
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:50,768
Oh, he means to tell you,
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

586
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,559
It's not quite the same thing,
my dear.

587
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:57,891
You shouldn't be pleading for him.
He should plead for you.

588
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:02,392
Yes, Father,
but I think he is a little afraid of you.

589
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:04,306
Is he?

590
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,265
He fears that
you do not like him.

591
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:10,680
Well, I hardly know him,
Catherine.

592
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,389
But our liking each other
isn't important.

593
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:17,512
The only thing that is
important is that he love you.

594
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:18,555
He does.

595
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:21,304
He loves me and I love him.

596
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:25,970
It is a great wonder to me that
Morris has come into my life.

597
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:28,927
Oh, Father, don't you think

598
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:31,802
he is the most beautiful man
you've ever seen?

599
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,718
Well, he's very good-looking,
my dear.

600
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,218
Of course, you wouldn't let a
consideration like that sway you unduly.

601
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,092
Oh, no,
but that is what is so wonderful to me,

602
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:45,008
that he should have everything,
everything a woman could want,

603
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:47,091
and he wants me.

604
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,132
I'll see him tomorrow.

605
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:00,548
I knew you would.

606
00:43:01,174 --> 00:43:05,006
And you are so good that you will
be fair and honest with him.

607
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:09,005
I shall be as fair and honest
with him as he is with you.

608
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:12,006
Thank you, Father.
That is all we shall need.

609
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:57,706
Aunt Penniman.

610
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,456
Aunt Penniman.

611
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:06,205
Oh, Catherine.
He proposed to me.

612
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:09,079
Does your father know?
Yes.

613
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:11,579
What did he say?
He will see Morris in the morning.

614
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:13,205
Eureka!

615
00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:16,245
How is your headache now, Aunt?
Headache?

616
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,740
Good morning, my dear.

617
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:56,239
This is my brother,
Dr. Sloper, Mrs. Montgomery.

618
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:58,280
Mrs. Montgomery
has been good to come, Austin.

619
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:01,030
I'm very grateful to you, ma'am.
Oh, I'm glad to come.

620
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,405
She left a busy household just
on the strength of your note.

621
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:04,780
I should more properly
have gone to you,

622
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,404
but this is one of my mornings
at the clinic.

623
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,112
I dared not take the time off
to make a formal call.

624
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:11,195
Oh, I quite understand,
Doctor.

625
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:13,071
Elizabeth... Oh, certainly.
Will you excuse me?

626
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:15,402
Certainly. I should like to
see my sister while I'm here.

627
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:17,112
Mrs. Montgomery,
will you come into the study

628
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,027
where we may talk?
Yes, sir.

629
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,567
...understand my situation,
Mrs. Montgomery.

630
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:28,400
Your brother wishes
to marry my daughter,

631
00:45:28,484 --> 00:45:32,276
so I want you to tell me
something about his character.

632
00:45:32,984 --> 00:45:35,315
What sort of a gentleman
is he?

633
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:40,149
Well, Doctor, he's intelligent, charming.
He's a wonderful companion.

634
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:41,649
Yes, I know that.

635
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:45,690
But is he reliable?
Is he trustworthy? Is he responsible?

636
00:45:46,106 --> 00:45:50,023
Well, if you mean is he financially secure,
he is not, Doctor.

637
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:51,981
But I'm sure
you must know that.

638
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:53,897
Yes, he told me that
himself.

639
00:45:53,982 --> 00:45:56,355
That is another thing
about Morris. He's honest.

640
00:45:56,397 --> 00:46:01,147
Is he? Is he then honest in
his feeling for my daughter?

641
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:06,769
I don't know that, Doctor. I never could
say what goes on in people's hearts.

642
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:10,520
Could you?
Well, I have to try, ma'am.

643
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:14,645
He told me that he'd used
up a small inheritance.

644
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,560
Did he handle it well?

645
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:19,143
Probably you
would not think so, Doctor,

646
00:46:19,227 --> 00:46:22,060
but from his own point of view,
he did a great deal with it.

647
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:25,434
He saw Europe, he met
many interesting people,

648
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,433
he enlarged his capacities.

649
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:29,516
Did he help you, ma'am?

650
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:33,016
No.
Shouldn't he have?

651
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:34,433
Why, I don't think so.

652
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:36,433
You are a widow
and you have children.

653
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,683
I think so.

654
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:40,933
Oh, but if I'd needed it,
I know he would have helped me.

655
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,099
Are you sure?

656
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:45,639
You want me to complain
about him, sir,

657
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:47,889
but I have no complaint.

658
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,223
I brought him up
as if he were my child,

659
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:54,056
and I have accepted
the good and bad in him,

660
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:56,262
just as I accept them
in my children.

661
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,179
I have made you angry, ma'am.
I apologize.

662
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:05,054
I think, Doctor,
you expect too much of people.

663
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,220
If you do,
you'll always be disappointed.

664
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:11,594
I want you
to meet my daughter.

665
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:14,885
Will you excuse me?
Certainly.

666
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:23,884
Catherine? Catherine.

667
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:25,426
Yes, Father?

668
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,508
Will you come
into the study, please?

669
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:29,049
Yes, Father.

670
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,716
This is she?

671
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:36,673
No, that is a picture
of my wife.

672
00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:38,424
Oh, she's very beautiful.

673
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:41,173
Yes, she was very beautiful.

674
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,256
Oh.

675
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:46,464
Catherine, this is Mrs. Montgomery,
Mr. Townsend's sister.

676
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:48,130
Miss Sloper.

677
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:49,838
How do you do?

678
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:52,255
I am very happy to meet you.

679
00:47:53,046 --> 00:47:54,380
Thank you.

680
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:55,962
Isn't Morris coming?

681
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,962
His appointment is for 11:00,
Catherine.

682
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,419
Oh, yes.

683
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:10,711
Are your children well?

684
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:12,168
Quite well, thank you.

685
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:15,959
I hope Morris will bring you to
see me and my family very soon.

686
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:17,167
Yes.

687
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:23,084
My brother tells me that you have
an aunt visiting you, Miss Sloper.

688
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,209
Yes.

689
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,708
It is delightful to have someone
to whom one can show New York.

690
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,416
Oh, yes, it is.

691
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:40,998
Does she like our city?

692
00:48:41,956 --> 00:48:43,206
Yes.

693
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:47,538
Catherine, perhaps you'll offer Mrs.
Montgomery a glass of the Madeira.

694
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,662
Oh, yes, indeed.
Excuse me, ma'am.

695
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,994
She... She is very shy.

696
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:05,744
Yes, she is.

697
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:11,827
Perhaps she is less shy
with Morris.

698
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:16,202
Now, you said they have just fallen in love.
You were right about Catherine.

699
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,701
Were you right
about your brother?

700
00:49:18,783 --> 00:49:21,782
Well, I can only suppose

701
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:26,033
that Morris is more mature in
his feelings than I had thought.

702
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,949
This time he has not sought
out superficial charms.

703
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:34,114
Perhaps he's considered the
gentle character underneath.

704
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,031
Are you being honest?

705
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:37,531
I think I am.

706
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:40,863
Well, I believe her money
is the prime attraction.

707
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,280
What money?

708
00:49:42,363 --> 00:49:45,488
She's an heiress.
Didn't your brother tell you that?

709
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:47,945
No, he did not.

710
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:50,361
She has $10,000 a year
from her mother,

711
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,278
and on my death,
she will have twice as much more.

712
00:49:53,361 --> 00:49:54,320
She...

713
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:56,195
She will be immensely rich.

714
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:57,985
Yes, she will, of course.

715
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,528
If she marries a man I don't approve,
I shall leave my part to the clinic.

716
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,776
Yes, but she has
the $10,000 now.

717
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,651
Yes, she has.

718
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:11,025
That is still
a great deal of money, Doctor.

719
00:50:11,068 --> 00:50:14,234
It is. And consider
how he has behaved with money.

720
00:50:15,442 --> 00:50:17,483
He gratified his every wish.

721
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:20,316
Did he help you
with the children? No.

722
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:23,025
He enlarged
his capacities in Europe.

723
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:27,190
He left his gloves here last night.
The finest chamois.

724
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,690
Look at yours.

725
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,190
Will he help you with this
fortune he hopes to marry?

726
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:33,815
I would stake my life
he would not.

727
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,647
You must follow
your own dictates, Doctor.

728
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:42,104
Tell me she is not a
victim of his selfishness.

729
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:43,854
Tell me I am wrong.

730
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,187
I must go now.

731
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,225
Good day, Doctor.

732
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:10,975
Good day, ma'am.

733
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:18,598
Oh, has Mrs. Montgomery left?

734
00:51:18,682 --> 00:51:20,015
I wanted Lavinia to meet her.

735
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:21,348
Yes, Liz, she has left.

736
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:22,682
Did you like her, Austin?

737
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:23,972
Very much.
Oh, good.

738
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,223
You know, Catherine
has just asked Elizabeth

739
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:28,013
if Marian
might be her maid of honor.

740
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,722
Austin, Catherine is radiant.

741
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:31,472
I've never
seen her this way before.

742
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,681
Well, she must get over it.
He's worthless.

743
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:35,764
What?
The man's a fortune hunter.

744
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,929
All he's interested in
is her money.

745
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:41,720
Are you going
to tell that to Catherine?

746
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:43,804
No.

747
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:45,554
Oh, but, Austin...

748
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:47,135
Catherine.

749
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:48,677
Mrs. Montgomery has left.

750
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:50,303
Oh, I took too long.

751
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:52,510
I wanted to make the tray
especially nice.

752
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:56,011
It was not your fault, my dear.
We had concluded our talk.

753
00:51:56,053 --> 00:51:57,509
Concluded?

754
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:02,010
Did Mrs. Montgomery tell you something bad,
Father?

755
00:52:02,134 --> 00:52:03,466
No, Catherine.

756
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:05,134
I did not impress her
favorably?

757
00:52:05,217 --> 00:52:08,883
Oh, good heavens, Catherine,
don't hold yourself so cheaply.

758
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:12,174
I was embarrassed.
I won't be another time.

759
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,381
You had better go
to your room, Catherine.

760
00:52:17,464 --> 00:52:18,547
Yes.

761
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,756
Father, tell him about me.

762
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:28,212
You know me so well,

763
00:52:28,297 --> 00:52:32,796
it will not be immodest in you
to praise me a little.

764
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:50,627
How is it possible to protect
such a willing victim?

765
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,294
You will kill her
if you deny her this marriage.

766
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:56,168
You forget I am a doctor.
People don't die of such things.

767
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,251
Be very careful, Austin.

768
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,042
This man may take good care
of Catherine and her money

769
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:02,292
and make her very happy.

770
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:04,167
He will. I know he will.

771
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,542
But she's been taken in.

772
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,832
She's in love.

773
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:13,456
Mr. Townsend
is in the front parlor, sir.

774
00:53:41,453 --> 00:53:43,202
Good morning, Mr. Townsend.

775
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,494
How do you do, sir?
You expected me?

776
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:48,910
Yes, I did.
You are admirably prompt.

777
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:51,326
I could hardly be late
for so important an occasion.

778
00:53:51,368 --> 00:53:52,367
Yes.

779
00:53:52,451 --> 00:53:55,950
Catherine told me yesterday what
has been going on between you.

780
00:53:56,034 --> 00:53:58,492
Will you sit down?
Thank you.

781
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,199
I've been walking all morning,
and you know, sir,

782
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:03,824
I find New York as lovely as any
city in Europe this time of year.

783
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,073
Yes. You must allow me to say,
Mr. Townsend,

784
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:10,990
that it would have been becoming of you
to give me notice of your intentions

785
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,865
before they had gone so far.

786
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:16,073
It was only the other day that
Catherine made your acquaintance.

787
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:19,696
Yes, we've not been slow
to arrive at an understanding.

788
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:23,072
My interest in Miss Sloper
began the first time I saw her.

789
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:25,989
Did it not even
precede your first meeting?

790
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,987
I certainly had already heard
she was a delightful girl.

791
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:33,986
A delightful girl.
That's what you think her?

792
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,695
Otherwise,
I shouldn't be here.

793
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,985
Well, my dear young man,
as Catherine's father,

794
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,694
I hope I've a just appreciation
of her many good qualities,

795
00:54:43,777 --> 00:54:47,443
but I don't mind telling you I've never
quite thought of her in that light.

796
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:52,067
I don't know what I might think
of her if I were her father.

797
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:53,776
I speak
from my own point of view.

798
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:56,734
You speak very well.
Please sit down.

799
00:54:57,025 --> 00:55:01,691
But did you really expect that I would
throw my daughter into your arms?

800
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:04,649
No, I had an idea
you didn't like me.

801
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:07,607
What gave you that idea?

802
00:55:07,815 --> 00:55:09,731
The fact that I'm poor.

803
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:13,981
Well, that has a harsh sound,
but it's about the truth.

804
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:18,396
You've no profession,
means. Please sit.

805
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:21,604
No visible resources
or prospects,

806
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:25,772
and so you are in a category from
which not to choose a son-in-law,

807
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:29,685
particularly not for my daughter, who is
a weak young woman with a large fortune.

808
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,227
I don't think
Miss Sloper is weak.

809
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:33,769
Well, even if she were not,
you are still penniless.

810
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:35,853
Yes, that is my weakness.

811
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:37,810
And therefore,
you mean I'm mercenary.

812
00:55:37,895 --> 00:55:39,893
No, I don't say that.
You say that.

813
00:55:39,977 --> 00:55:41,893
But that's what you mean.

814
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:43,644
There are many poor men,
Mr. Townsend,

815
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:47,059
but they don't go through the streets
proclaiming that they are not thieves,

816
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:49,058
especially when no one
has accused them.

817
00:55:49,142 --> 00:55:52,100
I simply said
you are in the wrong category.

818
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:56,475
But your daughter doesn't marry a category.
She marries a man.

819
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:58,598
A man she's good enough
to say she loves.

820
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,181
A man who offers
nothing in return?

821
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:05,265
Is it possible to offer more
than the most tender affection

822
00:56:05,306 --> 00:56:06,806
and a lifelong devotion?

823
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,722
A lifelong devotion
is measured after the fact.

824
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:12,639
Meanwhile, it's usual to offer
a few material securities.

825
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,722
Well, what are yours?

826
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,929
A handsome face and figure
and a very good manner.

827
00:56:16,014 --> 00:56:19,678
Oh, they're excellent as far as they go,
but they don't go far enough.

828
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:20,763
You think I'm an idler?

829
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:22,138
It doesn't matter what I think

830
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,845
once I tell you I just don't
think of you as a son-in-law.

831
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:27,178
You think
I'd squander her money.

832
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:29,177
I plead guilty to that.

833
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,219
Because I spent my own,
I suppose.

834
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,637
Well, it was just because
it was my own that I spent it.

835
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:36,261
I've made no debts.
When it was gone, I stopped.

836
00:56:36,468 --> 00:56:38,260
I don't owe
a penny in the world.

837
00:56:38,301 --> 00:56:41,634
Allow me to ask,
what are you living on now?

838
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:46,467
The remnants of my property.

839
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:58,632
You left your gloves here
yesterday.

840
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:01,631
Thank you.

841
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:06,589
Doctor, don't you care
to gratify your daughter?

842
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,379
Do you enjoy the idea
of making her miserable?

843
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:12,421
I'm resigned to her thinking
me a tyrant for a few months.

844
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:13,838
A few months?

845
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:15,963
For a lifetime, then.

846
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:19,461
She may as well be miserable
that way as with you.

847
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:21,753
You are not polite, sir.

848
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:25,294
You push me to it.
You argue too much.

849
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:26,753
I have a great deal at stake.

850
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:29,293
I know, and you have lost it.
It is over.

851
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:32,293
I wouldn't be too sure
of that, sir.

852
00:57:32,544 --> 00:57:34,585
You are impertinent.

853
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:49,249
Dr. Sloper, if it were not
for my feeling for Catherine,

854
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,457
I should not have put up with the
indignities you have offered me today.

855
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,249
You have only to leave
my house to escape them.

856
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,623
Good day, Mr. Townsend.

857
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,207
Good day.
Morris, wait!

858
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:01,622
Morris!
You promised me, Morris.

859
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:05,331
You promised you would be
respectful when you saw my father.

860
00:58:05,413 --> 00:58:06,413
Catherine.

861
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:07,873
What is the matter, Father?

862
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:10,454
Catherine,
you are without dignity.

863
00:58:11,496 --> 00:58:12,911
Why are you angry?

864
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:15,328
Why are you and Morris quarreling?
Tell me, please.

865
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:17,204
I will tell you
when we are alone.

866
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:19,744
Your father does not approve
of me, Catherine.

867
00:58:22,744 --> 00:58:24,244
You want me to give him up?

868
00:58:24,285 --> 00:58:25,745
Yes, I do.

869
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:27,370
Why?

870
00:58:28,077 --> 00:58:29,743
What has he done?

871
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,033
What did Mrs. Montgomery
tell you?

872
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:34,409
My sister.
Have you spoken with her?

873
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,576
She paid me a visit this
morning on my invitation.

874
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:40,324
You see how painful this is
for me, Father.

875
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,741
Surely you will want me
to know your reasons.

876
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:44,366
He's a selfish idler.

877
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,448
My sister never said that.

878
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:46,990
No, I say it.

879
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:50,198
Father, I know he loves me.

880
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:53,198
I know that he does not.

881
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,447
In heaven's name, Father,
what makes you so sure?

882
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:02,947
My poor child, I can't tell you.
You must just take my word for it.

883
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:06,946
Father, I can't. I can't.

884
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:10,362
I love him.

885
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:13,528
I have promised to marry him,

886
00:59:14,402 --> 00:59:18,111
to stay by him
no matter what comes.

887
00:59:19,735 --> 00:59:23,901
So, he forearmed himself by getting
a promise like that, did he?

888
00:59:24,985 --> 00:59:27,193
You are beneath contempt.

889
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,400
Don't abuse him, Father.

890
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,983
I think
we shall marry quite soon.

891
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,066
Then it is
no further concern of mine.

892
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:46,691
I'm sorry.

893
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:48,233
Dr. Sloper,

894
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,981
we cannot marry
without your approval.

895
00:59:51,064 --> 00:59:53,856
It would bring unhappiness
to all of us.

896
00:59:54,106 --> 00:59:55,189
Do you mean that, sir?

897
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:56,397
Yes.

898
00:59:58,439 --> 01:00:02,021
Then will you put if off,
Mr. Townsend, for six months?

899
01:00:02,104 --> 01:00:04,354
I would like Catherine
to go to Europe with me.

900
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,395
Europe?

901
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:07,730
I would like you
very much to go, Catherine.

902
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,104
Why, Father?

903
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,478
Your father thinks
you will forget me, Catherine.

904
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:15,227
I shall still love him
when I come back.

905
01:00:15,352 --> 01:00:19,560
You are very sure of your love, but,
Catherine, do you dare to test him?

906
01:00:19,603 --> 01:00:21,018
You underestimate him.

907
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:23,017
I don't think so.

908
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:27,142
Catherine,

909
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,601
go to Europe.

910
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,433
Go to Europe with your father.

911
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,181
Sloper
is the name.

912
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:48,139
That way, sir.

913
01:00:59,597 --> 01:01:01,428
I'll be right back.

914
01:01:03,803 --> 01:01:06,595
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, ma'am.

915
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,220
Catherine.

916
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:11,093
I came because I felt sure you
would not deny me the opportunity

917
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:12,885
of wishing you both
a safe journey.

918
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,594
Thank you very much.

919
01:01:14,678 --> 01:01:16,594
Morris, I'm glad you came.

920
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,384
I have brought Miss Sloper
a small gift, sir.

921
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:23,051
Mr. Townsend, it is not usual for young
ladies in my daughter's situation

922
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:25,259
to receive gifts
from gentlemen.

923
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:28,175
Yes, Doctor, I know,
but this is a very humble gift.

924
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:29,592
It's only
a little hand warmer.

925
01:01:29,675 --> 01:01:32,091
Father,
I would like to have it.

926
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:40,466
You must put live charcoals in it,
Catherine.

927
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:45,630
I give it to you
with all my love.

928
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,590
Morris.

929
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:02,294
I will be thinking of you,
Catherine.

930
01:02:06,753 --> 01:02:09,420
Good day, ma'am.
Bon voyage, Doctor.

931
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:31,498
I never expected to hear a sermon
like that in New York City.

932
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:34,541
Now, when the Reverend Penniman
sermonized on the loaves and the fishes,

933
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:36,414
they were there,
right before you.

934
01:02:36,498 --> 01:02:37,914
You could
practically smell them.

935
01:02:37,998 --> 01:02:40,540
Look, Mrs. Penniman,
you've lost.

936
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:42,663
Why is it you always win?

937
01:02:42,747 --> 01:02:44,205
I cheat.

938
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:47,996
Mrs. Penniman,
had it not been for your invitations,

939
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:50,456
these past few months
would have been unbearable.

940
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,787
You like this house,
don't you, Morris?

941
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,537
Yes, ma'am, I do.

942
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:58,704
You know, the Doctor
is a man of fine taste.

943
01:02:58,912 --> 01:03:01,118
It is strange that although
we do not like each other,

944
01:03:01,203 --> 01:03:03,203
we seem
to like the same things.

945
01:03:03,244 --> 01:03:06,036
That can be a bond
between you in time.

946
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:07,577
I hope so.

947
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,410
But you see,
he's earned all this by his work.

948
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:12,409
He believes that every
man should do the same.

949
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:15,201
The trouble is
that some of us cannot.

950
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:17,742
You miss her,
don't you, Morris?

951
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:18,825
Very much.

952
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:20,908
Dinner is served,
Mrs. Penniman.

953
01:03:21,575 --> 01:03:22,949
Yes, Maria.

954
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:25,824
And the claret
is room temperature.

955
01:03:25,908 --> 01:03:27,532
Thank you, Maria.

956
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:52,195
I hope I haven't
kept you waiting, Father.

957
01:03:52,236 --> 01:03:53,778
No, my dear.

958
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:56,028
Wouldn't you prefer
to go inside?

959
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,695
I like this table.

960
01:03:59,571 --> 01:04:00,569
Oh!

961
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:04,569
Did you used to come here
with my mother?

962
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,276
Yes, Catherine, I did.

963
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:10,526
Would you like some chocolate?

964
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:12,692
No, thank you very much.

965
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:16,899
Oh, there's the Caf Riche.

966
01:04:17,275 --> 01:04:18,692
So it is. What about it?

967
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:21,606
Aunt Penniman mentioned it
in her last letter.

968
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,732
Lavinia?

969
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:25,524
She said
that all the best people

970
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:28,731
of Paris frequent it.

971
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:33,064
Her winter of loneliness
has given her second sight.

972
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:36,189
Something for mademoiselle?
No, thank you.

973
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,605
Bien, monsieur.

974
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:41,563
Have you given him up?

975
01:04:42,895 --> 01:04:44,270
No, Father.

976
01:04:44,937 --> 01:04:48,728
You mean that in all this time,
you have not yielded one inch?

977
01:04:49,563 --> 01:04:50,978
No, Father.

978
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:56,519
I see no reason
to prolong this trip. Do you?

979
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,852
I thought
you wanted to see England.

980
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:05,600
I've seen England.

981
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,889
The pilot's gone down the bay.
They are to dock within the hour.

982
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,180
We're almost ready.

983
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:42,512
Maria, did you
find my gloves?

984
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:44,804
As soon as I warm the beds,
I'll look again.

985
01:05:44,886 --> 01:05:47,678
Oh, Geier,
we have to be at the pier in half an hour.

986
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,012
I'm harnessed, ma'am.

987
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,715
What an inconvenient hour
to land.

988
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,382
Now, you will be careful to get
the details right, won't you?

989
01:06:20,464 --> 01:06:23,005
They're most important.
Of course.

990
01:06:23,298 --> 01:06:27,006
You will have a closed carriage
at the corner of MacDougal Street

991
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,547
tomorrow evening
as soon as it gets dark.

992
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:31,714
Tomorrow night at 9:00.

993
01:06:31,797 --> 01:06:35,504
Yes, at 9:00.
Oh, here they are.

994
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,671
Now, tell her everything.

995
01:06:40,711 --> 01:06:42,420
I will.
Tell her I love her.

996
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,585
I will, I will. Now,
you wait in the mews for my signal, Morris.

997
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,252
Giddap.

998
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,626
Oh, Catherine.

999
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:58,959
Oh, Catherine,
you look so French.

1000
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:02,541
Well,
no matter how fascinating distant places are,

1001
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:06,167
there's always someone at home
one misses, isn't there?

1002
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,207
I've caught a chill, Lavinia.

1003
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:11,375
Would you be so kind as to get
me some hot water for a toddy?

1004
01:07:11,457 --> 01:07:13,331
Why, of course, Austin.

1005
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:23,204
It's good to be home,
isn't it, Father?

1006
01:07:23,454 --> 01:07:26,289
You will feel better now
that we are back.

1007
01:07:27,955 --> 01:07:31,829
I wish you had let me try to
take care of you a little.

1008
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,788
Here you are, Austin.
Thank you, Lavinia.

1009
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,370
Your brandy decanter
is right there.

1010
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:42,952
Well!

1011
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,702
Have you taken to drink, Lavinia?
What...

1012
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,660
My heart. I thought
it would help my heart.

1013
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:51,826
Yes.

1014
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:57,992
I know I shouldn't ask you, Catherine,
but did you bring me something?

1015
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,576
We brought you
a silk parasol.

1016
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,659
Just exactly
what I wanted.

1017
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:02,990
Come and show it to me.

1018
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:07,323
Your heart would improve, Lavinia,
if you stopped smoking cigars.

1019
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:08,490
What?

1020
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,782
When I come home
to find empty brandy glasses

1021
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:13,614
and detect cigar bands,

1022
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,322
I can only think
of one person.

1023
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:21,031
Well, what's happened to Mr. Townsend?
Is he upstairs in my bed?

1024
01:08:21,156 --> 01:08:25,405
Oh, Austin, I forgot to tell you.
He did stop by this evening.

1025
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:28,155
This evening?
Was he here this evening, Aunt?

1026
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:31,569
Yes, yes.
So he's made my house his club.

1027
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:37,194
You should be in bed. Now, I'll just see
that everything has been attended to.

1028
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:44,402
What a ridiculous
position to be in.

1029
01:08:46,027 --> 01:08:49,651
Well, I suppose you'll be going
off with him any time now.

1030
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,317
Yes, if he will have me.

1031
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,691
Why not?

1032
01:08:54,358 --> 01:08:56,483
You'll be a most
entertaining companion.

1033
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,066
I will try to be.

1034
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:01,191
And your gaiety and brilliance
will make up the difference

1035
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:05,607
between the $10,000 a year you will
have and the $30,000 he expects.

1036
01:09:06,064 --> 01:09:09,482
He expects nothing.
He does not love me for that.

1037
01:09:09,564 --> 01:09:11,648
No? What else, then?

1038
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:15,605
Your grace? Your charm?
Your quick tongue and subtle wit?

1039
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:17,356
He admires me.

1040
01:09:17,397 --> 01:09:20,063
Catherine,
I've tried for months not to be unkind,

1041
01:09:20,147 --> 01:09:23,022
but now it's time for you
to realize the truth.

1042
01:09:23,063 --> 01:09:26,770
How many girls do you think he
might have had in this town?

1043
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:28,354
He finds me pleasing.

1044
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:30,187
Oh, yes, I'm sure he does.

1045
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,144
A hundred women are prettier,
a thousand more clever,

1046
01:09:34,185 --> 01:09:37,310
but you have one virtue
that outshines them all.

1047
01:09:38,477 --> 01:09:41,434
What... What is that?
Your money.

1048
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:44,475
Father!
You have nothing else.

1049
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:51,350
What a terrible thing
to say to me.

1050
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:54,432
I don't expect you
to believe that.

1051
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:58,683
I've known you all your life and
I've yet to see you learn anything.

1052
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:02,516
With one exception, my dear.

1053
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:05,640
You embroider neatly.

1054
01:10:31,762 --> 01:10:32,969
Morris.

1055
01:10:34,093 --> 01:10:35,301
Morris!

1056
01:10:43,092 --> 01:10:44,549
I haven't had
a moment alone with her.

1057
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,384
Where is she?
She's upstairs with Austin.

1058
01:10:46,466 --> 01:10:48,549
They had a bad crossing
and he's out of mood.

1059
01:10:48,633 --> 01:10:50,508
You'd better leave.
I'll tell her everything later.

1060
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:53,550
No, I want to tell her myself.
I'll wait until he's gone to bed.

1061
01:10:53,633 --> 01:10:56,132
Oh, no, no. Please go.
If Austin should see you...

1062
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:59,048
He won't. I'll stay right here.
No, no, you don't know.

1063
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:02,547
I'll take her shopping in the morning
and we'll meet you in the square.

1064
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:06,546
Oh, please go.

1065
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:27,461
Morris.

1066
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:31,085
Morris! Morris!

1067
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,625
Morris, Morris, I'm so glad...

1068
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:56,122
Catherine, my dearest.

1069
01:11:56,206 --> 01:11:58,956
You were waiting.
You were as anxious as I.

1070
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:06,330
Cathy.
Oh, Morris.

1071
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:10,954
Have you been true to me, Catherine?
Oh, yes.

1072
01:12:13,703 --> 01:12:15,953
Good. You've not
changed your mind?

1073
01:12:15,995 --> 01:12:17,579
No, no.

1074
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:20,995
Have you?
Oh, wait until you hear my plans.

1075
01:12:21,078 --> 01:12:22,494
Plans?
Yes.

1076
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:27,618
For our marriage.
Our elopement.

1077
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:30,409
Oh, our elopement.

1078
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:33,660
It's for tomorrow night,

1079
01:12:34,118 --> 01:12:36,117
in a country parsonage
up on Murray's Hill.

1080
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,783
There is a Reverend Lispinard there who
knows our story, and he'll help us.

1081
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:42,700
Do you hear me, Catherine?

1082
01:12:42,782 --> 01:12:45,241
Oh, I love you so.

1083
01:12:54,989 --> 01:12:56,822
Oh, tell me what to do.

1084
01:12:57,864 --> 01:12:59,614
I have
a closed carriage engaged.

1085
01:12:59,697 --> 01:13:03,614
I will come to the corner of the
square tomorrow night at 9:00.

1086
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:06,571
We'll drive to the parsonage,

1087
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:11,196
and after the marriage,
we'll spend the night at an inn up the river.

1088
01:13:12,945 --> 01:13:16,111
The next day,
we'll go to Albany on our honeymoon.

1089
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:17,861
Oh, Morris.

1090
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,486
My husband.

1091
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,152
You like my plan?

1092
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:28,235
Oh! And I've brought you such
a beautiful silk waistcoat.

1093
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:30,901
You must wear it for our wedding.
My dear girl.

1094
01:13:30,984 --> 01:13:33,609
I bought you a set of buttons
at Barrere's in Paris.

1095
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,065
Buttons?
They are rubies and pearls.

1096
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:39,108
They are quite nice.
Oh, my dear, dear girl.

1097
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,024
How happy we shall be.

1098
01:13:47,482 --> 01:13:48,981
Morris?
Yes?

1099
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:52,772
Take me tonight.
Tonight?

1100
01:13:55,105 --> 01:13:56,855
How can we?
We must.

1101
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:59,106
In another hour,
everyone will be asleep.

1102
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:01,646
We can get away quietly
and no one will know.

1103
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:06,436
But, Catherine, it's only one more day.
Morris, I beg you.

1104
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:10,603
Where would we go?
To the Reverend...

1105
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:13,311
Lispinard?
Yes. He knows about us.

1106
01:14:13,394 --> 01:14:16,268
He will not turn us away because
we've come one day early.

1107
01:14:19,018 --> 01:14:21,268
I implore you.
Catherine...

1108
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:23,017
If you love me...

1109
01:14:24,477 --> 01:14:26,351
Very well, we'll do it.

1110
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:35,057
I'll leave and find a carriage.
Let's see, it's almost 10:30.

1111
01:14:35,139 --> 01:14:38,932
I can be back here at 12:30 on
the dot in front of the house.

1112
01:14:39,473 --> 01:14:42,890
You must be ready and waiting for me.
Can you do that?

1113
01:14:43,349 --> 01:14:45,930
Oh, I can do anything,
my dearest.

1114
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:55,180
You must leave a letter for your father.
A letter?

1115
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:58,179
Yes. Shall I compose it for you?
No.

1116
01:14:58,804 --> 01:15:00,846
Well, you must think very
carefully of how to word it.

1117
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,928
You must melt his heart.
I will not write him.

1118
01:15:04,012 --> 01:15:06,345
Of course you must write him.
We want him to forgive us.

1119
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:08,802
He won't forgive us.
I know it.

1120
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:11,428
I know it now.
I have good reason to.

1121
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:15,301
What reason?
My father doesn't like me.

1122
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,552
Well, what an unhappy thing
to say. Of course he does.

1123
01:15:18,635 --> 01:15:20,718
No.
He must love you very much,

1124
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,384
or he wouldn't be trying so
hard to protect you from me.

1125
01:15:23,467 --> 01:15:26,382
No, Morris.
In this one thing, I know I am right.

1126
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:28,717
I couldn't say it
unless I was sure.

1127
01:15:28,799 --> 01:15:32,966
I understood it tonight
for the first time in my life.

1128
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:36,173
You can tell when a person
speaks to you as if... As if...

1129
01:15:36,257 --> 01:15:39,424
As if what?
As if they despised you.

1130
01:15:40,506 --> 01:15:41,548
Despised?

1131
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:46,296
We must be very happy together,
and you must never despise me, Morris.

1132
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:47,380
Oh, Catherine.

1133
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:51,088
We must never ask him for anything
or depend upon him for anything.

1134
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:55,962
We must be very happy and
expect nothing from him, ever.

1135
01:15:59,795 --> 01:16:00,962
No.

1136
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,337
I will try to be
the best wife in the world.

1137
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,294
I know you will.

1138
01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:09,294
I will get ready immediately.

1139
01:16:14,293 --> 01:16:15,875
Catherine, dear,

1140
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:20,959
he can't dislike you that much.
He's bound to come around.

1141
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:26,041
No, Morris, he will not,
but even if he would, I would not.

1142
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:32,916
I see.

1143
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:37,957
I will try to be punctual,
Morris. I know you like that.

1144
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,581
Till 12:30, then.
Hurry, my darling.

1145
01:17:54,195 --> 01:17:55,154
Catherine!

1146
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:57,360
What are you doing?

1147
01:17:57,444 --> 01:17:59,777
Aunt, I would like it if you
would please go back to bed.

1148
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,484
But I want to know
what you're doing.

1149
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,569
I am eloping with Morris.
That's impossible.

1150
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:07,193
It's for tomorrow.
Hush.

1151
01:18:07,276 --> 01:18:09,733
No, no,
you've got everything wrong.

1152
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,067
Now, Morris will be here
tomorrow evening.

1153
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:15,443
No, Aunt, he will be here
in the next two minutes.

1154
01:18:15,526 --> 01:18:16,982
Have you seen him?
Yes.

1155
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:21,191
Oh, Catherine!
Will you spend the night with him unwed?

1156
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:22,607
We are going directly

1157
01:18:22,692 --> 01:18:24,732
to the Reverend Lispinard
on Murray's Hill.

1158
01:18:24,774 --> 01:18:27,273
If he will marry us,
perhaps we may stay with him.

1159
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:31,522
If not, we will drive all night.
I don't care.

1160
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:35,480
Oh, Catherine, how romantic.

1161
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:37,812
Morris is so daring.

1162
01:18:38,354 --> 01:18:40,479
I think I heard a carriage.

1163
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:42,729
No.

1164
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:45,313
Now, wouldn't you like me to
dress quickly and come with you?

1165
01:18:45,396 --> 01:18:46,727
There's no time, Aunt.

1166
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,062
Morris will be here
any instant.

1167
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:51,228
But I think I should.
You must have a chaperon.

1168
01:18:51,312 --> 01:18:53,436
Your father would be shocked.

1169
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:55,727
It serves him right.
What?

1170
01:18:55,936 --> 01:18:58,518
Father, he finds me so dull.

1171
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,934
It will surprise him to have such
a dull girl disgrace his name.

1172
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:05,226
Catherine,
are you quite yourself?

1173
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,892
No, it's just
a shutter blowing.

1174
01:19:12,308 --> 01:19:16,017
Think of it.
I may never stand in this window again.

1175
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:20,807
I may never see Washington
Square on a windy April night.

1176
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,222
Why won't you?

1177
01:19:23,306 --> 01:19:25,515
Because I will never be
in this house again.

1178
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:29,556
Nonsense. You and Austin will
be reconciled within the year.

1179
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:34,221
I will never see him again
in my life.

1180
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:39,180
What?
I am leaving tonight instead of tomorrow

1181
01:19:39,554 --> 01:19:43,513
because it is one time less I will
ever have to lay eyes on him,

1182
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:44,970
or he on me.

1183
01:19:45,429 --> 01:19:48,052
We dislike each other
too much, Aunt.

1184
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:52,969
But good heavens, child,
you're disinheriting yourself.

1185
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:56,718
Yes, completely.

1186
01:19:57,717 --> 01:19:59,217
Have you told Morris this?

1187
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:01,427
Of course.
I told him everything.

1188
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:03,217
He is to be my husband.

1189
01:20:03,258 --> 01:20:05,009
Oh, you should have waited.

1190
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:07,883
Did... Did he understand?

1191
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:15,216
There he is. Goodbye, Aunt.
I will write to you, Aunt.

1192
01:21:21,247 --> 01:21:23,455
Aunt?
Yes, dear?

1193
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:26,746
Why shouldn't
I have told Morris?

1194
01:21:29,412 --> 01:21:30,953
Oh, dear girl.

1195
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:35,537
Why were you not
a little more clever?

1196
01:21:35,578 --> 01:21:37,203
Clever? About what?

1197
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:42,286
Oh, Catherine.

1198
01:21:44,952 --> 01:21:47,202
Why shouldn't I have told him?

1199
01:21:50,868 --> 01:21:56,492
Morris would not want to be the cause of
your losing your natural inheritance.

1200
01:21:58,574 --> 01:22:01,408
He could
not see you impoverished.

1201
01:22:01,574 --> 01:22:05,199
Impoverished?
I have $10,000 a year.

1202
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:08,072
That is a great deal of money.

1203
01:22:13,032 --> 01:22:16,072
Not when
one has expected $30,000.

1204
01:22:19,906 --> 01:22:22,780
You think
what my father thinks.

1205
01:22:23,822 --> 01:22:27,030
Well, you are wrong.
Morris loves me.

1206
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:31,029
I am everything he ever
yearned for in a woman.

1207
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:34,236
Oh, Catherine... I am, I am.
He has told me so.

1208
01:22:34,404 --> 01:22:36,986
He thinks I am pretty.
He wants me.

1209
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:40,444
He could not wait for tomorrow night.
He said we must go tonight.

1210
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:45,193
No, I said that, didn't I?
But he agreed. He was willing.

1211
01:22:45,235 --> 01:22:48,025
You can see that for yourself.
He was very willing.

1212
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:50,859
Well, then,
perhaps he will come.

1213
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:52,901
Perhaps?

1214
01:22:54,483 --> 01:22:58,275
He must come.
He must take me away.

1215
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,941
He must love me. He must!

1216
01:23:01,024 --> 01:23:03,483
Catherine, please
take hold of yourself.

1217
01:23:03,565 --> 01:23:07,357
No, no, Morris must take hold of me.
Morris will love me

1218
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,231
for all those who didn't.

1219
01:24:28,928 --> 01:24:31,469
Morris, Morris, Morris!

1220
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:36,510
Morris, Morris,
Morris, Morris!

1221
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:45,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
The doctor's office is closed.

1222
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:47,375
Why, I heard he came back
from Europe a week ago.

1223
01:25:47,457 --> 01:25:51,748
He did, but he's confined to his bed.
Try Dr. Isaacs in Great Jones Street.

1224
01:25:51,832 --> 01:25:53,457
Well, thank you.

1225
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:01,872
Doctor.
You shouldn't be up, sir.

1226
01:26:01,955 --> 01:26:03,788
Now stop fluttering about.

1227
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:05,622
Doctor, please go back to bed.

1228
01:26:05,705 --> 01:26:08,496
You just
go about your business, Maria.

1229
01:26:09,412 --> 01:26:10,661
Yes, sir.

1230
01:26:17,204 --> 01:26:21,827
Catherine. I haven't seen you
since our return.

1231
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:24,994
No, Father.

1232
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:49,399
Of course, if he were ill,
he could not write.

1233
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:55,564
Perhaps you should
send him a brief note.

1234
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:00,520
No, Aunt.
But I would gladly deliver it for you.

1235
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:03,145
Stay out of it, Aunt.

1236
01:28:04,519 --> 01:28:07,021
Oh, I want to help if I can.

1237
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:11,978
Can you bring him back
from California?

1238
01:28:13,353 --> 01:28:14,686
California?

1239
01:28:17,728 --> 01:28:20,976
I went to Mrs. Montgomery's
to see him.

1240
01:28:22,935 --> 01:28:24,351
You did?

1241
01:28:25,308 --> 01:28:26,684
She told me.

1242
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:31,141
He borrowed the passage money
from his cousin Arthur

1243
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:33,808
and left.

1244
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:41,474
You had better go
to your marketing.

1245
01:29:25,967 --> 01:29:28,841
Oh, one moment, Maria.

1246
01:29:29,509 --> 01:29:30,965
Yes, Doctor?

1247
01:29:31,341 --> 01:29:35,632
If you will interrupt your
embroidery for a moment, Catherine,

1248
01:29:36,965 --> 01:29:40,880
I think
you both should know this.

1249
01:29:42,506 --> 01:29:43,797
I am ill.

1250
01:29:44,465 --> 01:29:48,381
It's not just a simple congestion.
There are rales in the lungs.

1251
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,172
I shall need
very good nursing.

1252
01:29:52,338 --> 01:29:56,754
I shall not recover, but I wish
everything to be done as if I should.

1253
01:29:56,838 --> 01:29:59,254
I hate
an ill-conducted sickroom.

1254
01:29:59,338 --> 01:30:00,961
Well, maybe you will get well.

1255
01:30:01,003 --> 01:30:05,711
Now, in a few days you'll need a
doctor for me. Get Dr. Isaacs.

1256
01:30:06,877 --> 01:30:11,251
If the street noises make me restless,
see that tanbark is put down.

1257
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:16,835
Catherine, I don't want your
Aunt Lavinia in my room at all

1258
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:20,458
unless I should
go into a coma.

1259
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:26,458
As for food, don't overload me, Maria.
Keep me on soup, beef broth and gruel.

1260
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:28,417
Yes, sir.

1261
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:32,457
Find a small lamp. Put fresh wicks
in it so that it doesn't smell.

1262
01:30:32,748 --> 01:30:33,957
Doctor!

1263
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:38,165
Now, if you'll please make up my bed for me,
I'll be up in a moment.

1264
01:30:38,498 --> 01:30:39,664
Yes.

1265
01:30:41,664 --> 01:30:43,456
I will help you, Maria.

1266
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,331
Will you stay a minute,
Catherine?

1267
01:30:53,744 --> 01:30:57,162
I can only assume that your
departure is imminent.

1268
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,660
Is it soon?

1269
01:31:02,203 --> 01:31:03,702
This week?

1270
01:31:04,577 --> 01:31:05,785
No.

1271
01:31:07,327 --> 01:31:10,618
Has he asked you to keep
your plans secret from me?

1272
01:31:13,076 --> 01:31:14,701
I am not leaving.

1273
01:31:17,242 --> 01:31:19,866
Not leaving?
Will you excuse me, Father?

1274
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:22,532
Come here a moment, Catherine.

1275
01:31:25,865 --> 01:31:27,656
Here, in the light.

1276
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:30,781
You are flushed.

1277
01:31:31,948 --> 01:31:35,656
Your eyes look sick.
You've been weeping.

1278
01:31:38,655 --> 01:31:40,946
You have
broken your engagement.

1279
01:31:42,904 --> 01:31:47,863
Oh, if you have, I must tell you, Catherine,
that I admire you greatly for it.

1280
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:51,611
I know the effort
that you must have made.

1281
01:31:52,277 --> 01:31:56,028
Do you, Father?
But in time, Catherine, the pain will pass.

1282
01:31:56,403 --> 01:31:59,736
I cannot begin to tell you
how proud of you I am.

1283
01:32:00,777 --> 01:32:04,276
Are you? Oh, deeply.
Most deeply proud.

1284
01:32:07,193 --> 01:32:08,943
He deserted me.

1285
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:14,357
What?
Morris deserted me.

1286
01:32:15,982 --> 01:32:18,233
Now do you admire me, Father?

1287
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,732
Oh, Catherine.

1288
01:32:21,148 --> 01:32:24,023
Don't be kind to me.
It doesn't become you.

1289
01:32:24,356 --> 01:32:27,315
Catherine, are you blaming me
because I tried to protect you?

1290
01:32:27,356 --> 01:32:29,066
Yes.
Someday you'll realize

1291
01:32:29,148 --> 01:32:31,272
I've done you a great service.

1292
01:32:31,772 --> 01:32:35,146
I can tell you now what you have done.
You have cheated me.

1293
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:39,313
You thought that any handsome, clever man
would be as bored with me as you were.

1294
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:42,313
It was not love that made you protect me,
it was contempt.

1295
01:32:42,395 --> 01:32:45,020
Morris Townsend
did not love you, Catherine.

1296
01:32:45,103 --> 01:32:47,519
I know that now,
thanks to you.

1297
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,312
Better to know it now
than 20 years hence.

1298
01:32:50,395 --> 01:32:54,643
Why? I lived with you for 20 years
before I found out you didn't love me.

1299
01:32:54,727 --> 01:32:56,644
I don't know that
Morris would have hurt me

1300
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:58,811
or starved me for affection
more than you did.

1301
01:32:58,894 --> 01:33:02,184
Since you couldn't love me,
you should have let someone else try.

1302
01:33:02,892 --> 01:33:06,310
You have found
a tongue at last, Catherine.

1303
01:33:07,225 --> 01:33:10,309
Is it only to say
such terrible things to me?

1304
01:33:10,434 --> 01:33:13,433
Yes. This is a field where you
will not compare me to my mother.

1305
01:33:13,474 --> 01:33:15,349
Should I have
let him ruin your life?

1306
01:33:15,433 --> 01:33:18,141
You'll find some honest,
decent man someday.

1307
01:33:18,224 --> 01:33:19,766
You have many fine qualities.

1308
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:21,266
And $30,000 a year.

1309
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:24,764
Yes. That should make it possible
for you to choose with discretion.

1310
01:33:24,847 --> 01:33:27,472
If I am to buy a man,
I would prefer buying Morris.

1311
01:33:27,556 --> 01:33:32,306
Don't say such things.
You know him to be a scoundrel.

1312
01:33:34,012 --> 01:33:36,888
I love him.
Does that humiliate you?

1313
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,930
Catherine, promise me
you are done with him.

1314
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:40,471
I won't promise.

1315
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:43,803
Then I must alter my will.

1316
01:33:44,261 --> 01:33:47,512
You should.
You should do it immediately.

1317
01:34:06,217 --> 01:34:09,216
"I, Austin Sloper,

1318
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:14,089
"surgeon
of 16 Washington Square..."

1319
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:16,506
You had better tell me
how you wish it worded.

1320
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,423
I wish to consider
more carefully.

1321
01:34:18,465 --> 01:34:20,007
There is nothing to consider.

1322
01:34:20,089 --> 01:34:22,755
You want your money used for
purposes you approve, don't you?

1323
01:34:22,798 --> 01:34:25,089
If you leave it to the clinic,
it will do what you want it to do.

1324
01:34:25,172 --> 01:34:26,923
Catherine, I am ill.

1325
01:34:27,463 --> 01:34:32,004
"...do hereby make
my last will and testament..."

1326
01:34:32,086 --> 01:34:33,921
I don't want to do it.

1327
01:34:34,546 --> 01:34:37,128
I don't want to disinherit
my only child.

1328
01:34:37,212 --> 01:34:38,754
I know that you don't.

1329
01:34:39,462 --> 01:34:43,086
You'd like to think of me sitting
in dignity in this handsome house,

1330
01:34:43,127 --> 01:34:45,460
rich, respected and unloved.

1331
01:34:45,544 --> 01:34:49,627
But I may take your money and chase
after Morris and squander it on him.

1332
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:52,418
I don't know what you'll do,
Catherine.

1333
01:34:53,709 --> 01:34:55,167
That's right, Father.

1334
01:34:56,043 --> 01:34:59,168
You'll never know, will you?

1335
01:36:15,322 --> 01:36:18,696
Miss Catherine,
Dr. Isaacs says you'd better come now.

1336
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:21,822
Your father is...
He's very low, miss.

1337
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:27,112
He wants you, miss.

1338
01:36:27,195 --> 01:36:28,570
I know he does.

1339
01:36:31,988 --> 01:36:33,568
Too late, Maria.

1340
01:36:39,235 --> 01:36:40,860
Yes, miss.

1341
01:37:10,648 --> 01:37:13,563
Tell Lavinia I'm sorry we missed her.
I will, Aunt Elizabeth.

1342
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:15,647
Oh, and... Come along, Mother.
Arthur's waiting.

1343
01:37:15,731 --> 01:37:16,897
All right, dear, I'm coming.

1344
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,938
Say goodbye to Aunt Catherine.
Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.

1345
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,687
And thank her.
Goodbye, Andrew.

1346
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:24,021
Here, Mother, you take Andrew.
Goodbye, honey.

1347
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,061
Sit here at my side.
Now, that's right.

1348
01:37:26,103 --> 01:37:28,020
Why don't you come up
this August?

1349
01:37:28,104 --> 01:37:31,436
You'd love Newport, and Jefferson and
I have taken a big house this year.

1350
01:37:31,519 --> 01:37:32,852
Well, maybe I will.

1351
01:37:32,935 --> 01:37:35,685
We've asked you every year
since your father died.

1352
01:37:35,769 --> 01:37:38,685
You always say, "Maybe I will,"
and then you never do.

1353
01:37:38,768 --> 01:37:40,519
I like the square.

1354
01:37:41,477 --> 01:37:42,893
Goodbye, Catherine.
Goodbye, dear.

1355
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:44,768
Goodbye.
Say goodbye.

1356
01:37:44,851 --> 01:37:46,851
Goodbye, Andrew.
Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.

1357
01:37:46,933 --> 01:37:49,142
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

1358
01:38:27,594 --> 01:38:32,261
Oh, Miss Catherine,
you've changed into one of your Paris gowns.

1359
01:38:32,637 --> 01:38:35,676
You look very handsome in it.
Thank you.

1360
01:38:37,926 --> 01:38:42,717
It's such a hot night. Would you mind if
Cook and I took a stroll in the square?

1361
01:38:43,424 --> 01:38:47,049
Maria, you are as free
in this house as I am.

1362
01:38:47,425 --> 01:38:51,090
When you want a small favor, you need
not blandish me with false compliments.

1363
01:38:51,174 --> 01:38:55,215
But, Miss Catherine,
I meant what I said.

1364
01:38:55,923 --> 01:38:58,548
It was the coolest dress
I could find.

1365
01:38:59,882 --> 01:39:01,257
Yes, miss.

1366
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:15,045
Aunt Penniman, you're home quite early.
Yes, dear, yes.

1367
01:39:15,088 --> 01:39:17,254
Did you see your friends
from Poughkeepsie?

1368
01:39:17,336 --> 01:39:18,837
No, dear, I did not.

1369
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,544
Now, Catherine,
this will come to you as a great surprise.

1370
01:39:22,586 --> 01:39:24,502
Good. I like surprises.

1371
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:27,336
Well, then,

1372
01:39:29,628 --> 01:39:31,960
I have seen Morris Townsend.

1373
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:38,584
Oh, we met quite by accident.
He's only been home a week.

1374
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:42,709
Oh, Catherine,
he is so handsome.

1375
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:45,665
And he asked so many questions
about you, dear.

1376
01:39:45,749 --> 01:39:50,124
He had heard that you hadn't married.
He seemed very interested in that.

1377
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:56,456
He fears that you never understood him,
that you never judged him rightly.

1378
01:39:57,289 --> 01:39:59,372
How can you say that to me?

1379
01:39:59,998 --> 01:40:02,497
You were in this room
the night he deserted me.

1380
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,996
If you would hear him out.

1381
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,247
And if you would try to understand
his side of it, Catherine.

1382
01:40:07,329 --> 01:40:09,621
He meant it nobly.
Really, he did.

1383
01:40:09,704 --> 01:40:11,412
I can hear
that you have been with him.

1384
01:40:11,497 --> 01:40:13,786
He has beguiled you again
and you talk like a fool.

1385
01:40:13,871 --> 01:40:16,036
I don't care
what you think of me, dear.

1386
01:40:16,078 --> 01:40:19,536
I am convinced that you will be
happier after you've seen him.

1387
01:40:20,202 --> 01:40:23,453
Save your breath, Aunt Penniman.
I will not see him.

1388
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:31,409
Aunt Penniman, have you dared?

1389
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:35,532
He walked home with me.
He implored me to ask you.

1390
01:40:36,242 --> 01:40:38,868
Oh, I only want your happiness,
Catherine.

1391
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:43,657
Go to the door, Aunt,
and tell Mr. Townsend that I am not at home.

1392
01:40:43,742 --> 01:40:46,865
Please, Catherine, if you...
I am not at home.

1393
01:41:05,403 --> 01:41:07,528
She is not at home,
Morris.

1394
01:41:07,821 --> 01:41:08,820
Oh.

1395
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,362
I'm sorry.

1396
01:41:11,153 --> 01:41:12,862
Did you give her my message?

1397
01:41:12,946 --> 01:41:15,527
Yes,
but she is not at home.

1398
01:41:16,402 --> 01:41:17,569
I see.

1399
01:41:19,902 --> 01:41:23,276
It's been a long time since I stood here.
I know.

1400
01:41:24,567 --> 01:41:27,692
Well, I'm sorry.

1401
01:41:29,234 --> 01:41:32,359
Good night, Mrs. Penniman.
Goodbye, Morris.

1402
01:41:34,066 --> 01:41:35,565
Come in, Morris.

1403
01:42:00,646 --> 01:42:01,896
Good evening, Morris.

1404
01:42:02,188 --> 01:42:04,189
Good evening, Catherine.

1405
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:06,270
Do I offend you by coming?

1406
01:42:08,728 --> 01:42:10,644
You should not have come.

1407
01:42:11,519 --> 01:42:14,852
I had to.
I had to see you, Catherine.

1408
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:19,643
May we not sit down?

1409
01:42:19,726 --> 01:42:21,602
I think we had better not.

1410
01:42:23,393 --> 01:42:25,392
Can't we be friends again?

1411
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:28,350
We aren't enemies.

1412
01:42:30,142 --> 01:42:33,767
You don't know how happy it
makes me to hear you say that.

1413
01:42:35,807 --> 01:42:38,140
I've never ceased
to think of you.

1414
01:42:38,224 --> 01:42:40,265
Morris, if you cannot
be honest with me,

1415
01:42:40,348 --> 01:42:42,723
we shall have nothing more
to say to each other.

1416
01:42:42,764 --> 01:42:46,348
But it's true, Catherine.
Ever since the night I left,

1417
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:50,971
it's been the desire of my life that
you should understand my motives.

1418
01:42:51,055 --> 01:42:55,679
I have had years to think about them,
Morris, and I understand them.

1419
01:42:56,262 --> 01:43:00,012
So we have nothing further to discuss.
I will bid you good night.

1420
01:43:01,054 --> 01:43:05,803
But I've come all the way from California
to see you, to explain this to you.

1421
01:43:06,553 --> 01:43:08,552
It is late for explanations.

1422
01:43:08,595 --> 01:43:11,677
No, Catherine,
I would have been back long since,

1423
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:15,176
but I had to beg and borrow
the passage money.

1424
01:43:15,219 --> 01:43:17,843
It's been a real struggle
for me to get back here.

1425
01:43:17,926 --> 01:43:22,592
Why, between New Orleans and Charleston,
I worked as a hand, a common seaman.

1426
01:43:24,468 --> 01:43:28,549
Now that I'm here, you will give
me the chance to vindicate myself.

1427
01:43:28,799 --> 01:43:31,174
You must hear me out,
Catherine.

1428
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,299
You must.

1429
01:43:35,256 --> 01:43:37,506
For the sake of what
we've been to each other.

1430
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,131
What is it
you want to explain?

1431
01:43:42,965 --> 01:43:44,880
Many things, Catherine.

1432
01:43:46,755 --> 01:43:48,713
May we not sit down now?

1433
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:05,376
Catherine, it was because I loved
you that I disappeared that night.

1434
01:44:07,377 --> 01:44:11,043
Oh, I know how it looked.
It looked as if I behaved abominably.

1435
01:44:12,668 --> 01:44:17,167
But I knew that if I returned that night,
I might have done you great harm.

1436
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:20,917
You know, my dear, no man
who really loves a woman

1437
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,666
could ever permit her to give up
a great inheritance just for him.

1438
01:44:25,042 --> 01:44:26,833
That's only in storybooks.

1439
01:44:27,582 --> 01:44:30,373
My father
did not disinherit me, Morris.

1440
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:33,457
He threatened it to test you.

1441
01:44:34,207 --> 01:44:38,622
But I couldn't be sure of that
the night I went away.

1442
01:44:39,371 --> 01:44:41,538
No, you could not.

1443
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:46,995
Try to understand me,
Catherine.

1444
01:44:47,704 --> 01:44:51,163
Try not to think of what it looked like,
but of what it was.

1445
01:44:51,246 --> 01:44:55,745
I had to make a choice.
I chose your welfare rather than my own.

1446
01:44:57,078 --> 01:45:00,285
Can you think of it that way?
I will try.

1447
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:04,868
You know
that I've never changed.

1448
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:10,034
I believe your nature is such you
will always care for me a little.

1449
01:45:11,576 --> 01:45:14,327
Yes, Morris, that is true.

1450
01:45:15,783 --> 01:45:20,366
Then, Catherine, will you forgive
me for the pain I caused you?

1451
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:26,031
I forgave you a long time ago.

1452
01:45:30,657 --> 01:45:32,615
Oh, Catherine, my dearest.

1453
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:39,738
We've only waited and now...
Now we're free.

1454
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,488
Nothing stands between us,
Catherine.

1455
01:45:44,529 --> 01:45:46,528
Do you mean you love me?

1456
01:45:47,362 --> 01:45:49,861
I didn't dare to say it.
Why not?

1457
01:45:50,778 --> 01:45:53,279
I wasn't sure
you would believe me.

1458
01:45:53,528 --> 01:45:55,735
I believed you once, didn't I?

1459
01:45:57,027 --> 01:46:01,152
Then, Catherine, let us make the
rest of life happy for each other.

1460
01:46:02,653 --> 01:46:03,735
How?

1461
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:07,233
By picking up
where we left off.

1462
01:46:08,525 --> 01:46:10,400
By marrying, Catherine.

1463
01:46:12,692 --> 01:46:14,817
Would you like that, Morris?

1464
01:46:15,318 --> 01:46:18,524
You would make me the proudest
and happiest man in the world.

1465
01:46:18,607 --> 01:46:22,899
And I will try and be a good husband to you.
I'm older. I'm wiser now.

1466
01:46:25,023 --> 01:46:29,605
And I know that you love me. I need that.
I need it more than anything else.

1467
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:34,023
When would
you like to marry me?

1468
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:37,479
Oh, Catherine.

1469
01:46:40,022 --> 01:46:41,563
Then you will.

1470
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:45,521
Let's marry soon, very soon.
Next month.

1471
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:51,311
You are not as impetuous
as you used to be, Morris.

1472
01:46:52,394 --> 01:46:53,852
Impetuous?

1473
01:46:54,562 --> 01:46:57,935
Why, I would marry you tonight
if I could.

1474
01:46:59,267 --> 01:47:02,184
Come with me now.
We can find a carriage in the square.

1475
01:47:02,268 --> 01:47:05,476
Do you think the Reverend
Lispinard is still waiting?

1476
01:47:06,018 --> 01:47:08,558
We could tell him
we were detained.

1477
01:47:08,642 --> 01:47:10,059
Oh, Morris,

1478
01:47:10,516 --> 01:47:14,016
I have thought so many times
of that inn up the river.

1479
01:47:15,724 --> 01:47:17,307
My own dearest.

1480
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:21,015
Shall we have
the same honeymoon?

1481
01:47:22,765 --> 01:47:24,973
You must give me time to pack.

1482
01:47:27,555 --> 01:47:29,096
Yes, of course.

1483
01:47:33,514 --> 01:47:37,637
My things are at my sister's.
I'll... We'll pick them up on the way.

1484
01:47:38,387 --> 01:47:41,595
Why don't you get them now,
Morris, and come back for me?

1485
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,344
All right, I will.

1486
01:47:43,804 --> 01:47:47,636
We can be at Murray's Hill in an hour.
We can be there by 10:00.

1487
01:47:49,218 --> 01:47:52,427
You remember the buttons
I bought for you in Paris?

1488
01:47:52,511 --> 01:47:53,718
Buttons?

1489
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,467
Wait. I will get them.

1490
01:48:28,338 --> 01:48:31,712
I'm home. Really, truly home.

1491
01:48:32,087 --> 01:48:33,629
What, Morris, what?

1492
01:48:33,713 --> 01:48:35,295
She's magnificent.
Yes.

1493
01:48:35,379 --> 01:48:36,794
She's superb.
Yes.

1494
01:48:36,836 --> 01:48:39,004
She has such dignity now.
Well, tell me.

1495
01:48:39,086 --> 01:48:43,003
We're going to be married tonight.
Tonight? Oh, Catherine!

1496
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,752
My dear girl.

1497
01:48:47,669 --> 01:48:50,959
Here they are, Morris.
Your wedding present.

1498
01:48:51,627 --> 01:48:53,501
Thank you, my darling.

1499
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:59,208
Oh, Catherine,
they're rubies.

1500
01:48:59,292 --> 01:49:02,334
Look, Mrs. Penniman.
I've seen them. They sparkle so.

1501
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:05,208
They suit you, Morris.
Yes, they do.

1502
01:49:05,999 --> 01:49:08,749
They're the most beautiful
things I've ever had.

1503
01:49:16,081 --> 01:49:18,622
Catherine,
you will have no regrets.

1504
01:49:25,372 --> 01:49:26,954
Till 9:00, then.

1505
01:49:37,411 --> 01:49:40,452
Oh, Catherine,
we have him back.

1506
01:49:40,536 --> 01:49:44,118
I knew it would turn out this way.
You were not so sure as I.

1507
01:49:44,202 --> 01:49:46,701
But I have faith
in love like this.

1508
01:49:46,826 --> 01:49:49,535
Oh, I hope
I always stay romantic.

1509
01:49:49,617 --> 01:49:53,075
And you know, Catherine, you are much
more romantic than you think you are.

1510
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,159
Morris sensed that.

1511
01:49:55,325 --> 01:49:57,782
Don't bother about that, dear.
I'll do it.

1512
01:49:57,949 --> 01:50:01,823
Oh, that beautiful Paris lingerie.
How fortunate that you kept it.

1513
01:50:01,908 --> 01:50:06,533
I'm going to pack that for you.
I will sprinkle it with fresh lavender.

1514
01:50:06,616 --> 01:50:09,406
Catherine,
wouldn't you like me to come with you?

1515
01:50:09,573 --> 01:50:11,739
Oh, come, dear, we must pack.

1516
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:14,239
Catherine,
you haven't time for that.

1517
01:50:14,697 --> 01:50:16,198
There's not much left to do.

1518
01:50:16,281 --> 01:50:18,445
But you can
finish it afterwards.

1519
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:20,613
I must finish it now,

1520
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,779
for I shall never do another.

1521
01:50:23,572 --> 01:50:24,613
No?

1522
01:50:28,487 --> 01:50:32,069
He came back
with the same lies,

1523
01:50:32,236 --> 01:50:35,486
the same silly phrases.

1524
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:37,818
What are you saying?

1525
01:50:38,236 --> 01:50:41,568
He has grown greedier
with the years.

1526
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:44,527
The first time,
he only wanted my money.

1527
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:47,525
Now he wants my love, too.

1528
01:50:48,775 --> 01:50:53,275
Well, he came to the wrong house,
and he came twice.

1529
01:50:54,025 --> 01:50:56,650
I shall see that he never
comes a third time.

1530
01:50:57,109 --> 01:51:01,065
Catherine,
do you know what you're doing?

1531
01:51:01,482 --> 01:51:02,940
Yes.

1532
01:51:06,607 --> 01:51:08,939
Poor Morris.

1533
01:51:11,148 --> 01:51:13,023
Can you be so cruel?

1534
01:51:14,647 --> 01:51:17,064
Yes, I can be very cruel.

1535
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,230
I have been taught by masters.

1536
01:52:03,889 --> 01:52:05,015
Right here.

1537
01:52:06,805 --> 01:52:07,890
Wait.

1538
01:52:22,929 --> 01:52:26,553
I will attend to that.
It's for me. Yes, miss.

1539
01:52:33,969 --> 01:52:35,261
Bolt it, Maria.

1540
01:52:36,469 --> 01:52:37,469
Bolt it?

1541
01:52:38,675 --> 01:52:40,884
Bolt the door, Maria.

1542
01:52:41,592 --> 01:52:42,967
Yes, miss.

1543
01:53:12,421 --> 01:53:13,962
Good night, Maria.

1544
01:53:17,587 --> 01:53:18,920
Good night, miss.
