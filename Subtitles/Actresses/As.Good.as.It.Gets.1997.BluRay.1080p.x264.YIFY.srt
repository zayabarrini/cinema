
2
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,049
It's tulip season today,
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,733
Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,178
Yes, come on now, sweetheart.

5
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:03,384
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

6
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,348
Go for a ride.

7
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:09,020
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:14,724
Freeze!
Leg down, leg down.

9
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:19,732
That's it.
Come on now.

10
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:25,238
No, you monkey-eared
son of a bitch!

11
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:29,243
You have pissed your last floor.

12
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:33,353
Bet you wish
you were a real dog.

13
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:37,354
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

14
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,722
This is New York.If you can make it here.

15
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,427
you can make it anywhere...

16
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,595
you ugly, smelly...

17
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,772
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

18
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,949
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

19
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,112
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,628
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

21
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,324
Have you seen Verdell?

22
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,228
What does he look like?

23
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,768
My dog. You know, my...

24
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,107
My dog with the little,
adorable face.

25
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,911
Don't you know
what my dog looks like?

26
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,681
Oh, I got it.
You were talking about your dog.

27
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,157
I thought it was the name
of that colored man I see in the hall.

28
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,195
Which color was that?

29
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:44,633
Like thick molasses...

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,895
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

31
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:49,796
perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

32
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,038
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

33
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:55,439
How are you doin'?

34
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:58,442
Frank shows my work,
Mr. Udall.

35
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,710
- I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

36
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:05,152
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around me...

37
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:08,282
I don't give a rat crap
what or where you shove your show.

38
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,125
Are we done
being neighbors for now?

39
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:18,263
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

40
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:21,396
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

41
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:24,306
Okay.

42
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:29,134
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

43
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:33,575
You don't love anything,
Mr. Udall.

44
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,099
One, two, three, four, five.

45
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,267
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,543
Okay.

47
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,767
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

48
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,994
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

49
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,127
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

50
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:54,037
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

51
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,472
He's adorable.

52
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,340
Who buys more than me?
He isn't the only one working.

53
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,972
Good Lord.
Where have you been?

54
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,984
Oh, look at my boy.

55
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,750
Look at him.

56
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:16,023
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

57
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,129
Where was my little baby?

58
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:23,137
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

59
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,307
- Go ahead,John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

60
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:34,009
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

61
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,949
How did he get down
in the basement...

62
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,955
even if he got
in the elevator?

63
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:44,623
Maybe some nice neighbor
shoved him down the garbage chute?

64
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:47,100
Somewhere in the dark...

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,226
Somewhere in the dark...

66
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:53,067
she had confessed,
and he had forgiven.

67
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,040
"This is what you live for,"
he said.

68
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,977
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval...

69
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,071
and there is only the safety...

70
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:05,242
of being with each other."

71
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,719
How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

72
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:10,814
in the most shameful part of her?

73
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:16,624
At last she was able
to define love.

74
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:19,158
Love was...

75
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,224
Mr. Udall, I'd like
to speak to you, please.

76
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,931
Let me do this by myself.

77
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,168
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

78
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,573
Son of a bitch!

79
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,843
Pansy-ass stool pusher.

80
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,643
Yes?

81
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,680
Maybe this can wait.

82
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:41,779
I found Verdell.

83
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:51,498
Well, that's a load off.

84
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:55,697
Uh-huh.
Did you do something to him?

85
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,604
Do you realize
that I work at home?

86
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:01,702
I wasn't aware.

87
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:06,976
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your garden?

88
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,080
No. I actually...

89
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:15,089
will turn the ringer off on my phone
and put cardboard...

90
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:18,024
Well, I work all the time...

91
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:22,326
so never, never interrupt me,
okay?

92
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,027
Not if there's a fire.

93
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,367
Not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

94
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,962
and one week later there's
a smell coming from there...

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,873
that can only be
a decaying human body...

96
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,877
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face...

97
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:38,176
because the stench is so thick
you think you're gonna faint.

98
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,514
Even then,
don't come knocking.

99
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,851
Or if it's election night...

100
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,619
and you're excited
and you want to celebrate...

101
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,750
because some fudge packer
you date...

102
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:53,263
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States...

103
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,925
and he's going to have you...

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,662
down to Camp David...

105
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:01,865
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

106
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,432
Even then...

107
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:06,273
don't knock...

108
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,540
not on this door...

109
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,879
not for any reason.

110
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,043
Do you get me, sweetheart?

111
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:19,052
Yes.

112
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,220
It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

113
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,397
Okay then.

114
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:43,377
So the theory of confrontations says:
"Think twice before messing with me."

115
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,157
All right.

116
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,928
Love was...

117
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,400
What was love?

118
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:03,670
Love was...

119
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:12,937
Now I am pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

120
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,143
Don't touch! Don't touch!

121
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:20,347
Shut up! You think you can intimidate
the whole world with your attitude.

122
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:23,823
You don't intimidate me.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

123
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,156
My grandmother had more attitude.

124
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,790
Police!
Donut-munching morons.

125
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:33,063
Help me!

126
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,933
Shut up!

127
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,496
Assault and battery,
and you're black!

128
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,102
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

129
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,636
if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

130
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,219
Meantime...

131
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,747
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

132
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,555
I hate doing this!

133
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:00,062
I'm an art dealer.

134
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:04,732
Have a nice day.
Okay, party!

135
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,924
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

136
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,551
Get a life.

137
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,788
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

138
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,700
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

139
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,474
You know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no. I got a date tonight.

140
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,039
I'm walking out and he says,
"Mom, I promise not to get...

141
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,450
one of my fevers or coughs
during your date."

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,613
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

143
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:01,156
It came out of me: "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

144
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,890
As long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

145
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,898
That's terrific.

146
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,026
People that talk in metaphors
oughta shampoo my crotch.

147
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,472
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

148
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,702
- No, pay me next week.
- I owe you.

149
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,710
I told you today.
That's the rule.

150
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,804
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

151
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:27,114
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,491
Pardon me.

153
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,153
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

154
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,630
This way you take a cab home
so you can get ready for the date.

155
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,498
Ready is not my problem.

156
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,969
I'm starving.

157
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,338
Go on. Sit down. You know
you're not allowed back here.

158
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,171
Spence is more excited than I am.

159
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:52,078
He says, "I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

160
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:55,777
Sometimes this kid,
you just want to...

161
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:58,615
I've gotJews at my table.

162
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,281
It's not your table.
It's the place's table. Behave.

163
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:03,416
This once you can sit
at someone else's station.

164
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,356
Or you can wait your turn.

165
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,036
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

166
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:18,006
How much more you got to eat?

167
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:26,209
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

168
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:28,547
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

169
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,817
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

170
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,347
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

171
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:48,997
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

172
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:55,004
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

173
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,481
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

174
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,645
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

175
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,419
Three eggs over easy...

176
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:07,857
two sausage,
six strips of bacon with fries.

177
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:09,827
Fries today.

178
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:14,059
A short stack,
coffee with cream and sweetener.

179
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:16,227
You're gonna die soon
with that diet.

180
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,897
We're all gonna die soon.
I will, you will.

181
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,066
It sure sounds like
your son will.

182
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,627
If you ever mention my son again...

183
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,564
you will never be able
to eat here again, understand?

184
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,477
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

185
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,044
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

186
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,818
Do you?

187
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:22,630
Yes.

188
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,007
- Yeah?
- Yes.

189
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,504
I'll get your order.

190
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,016
Wear my earrings tonight.

191
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,181
It's just so interesting
what you said at dinner.

192
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,590
You said it
like it was nothing.

193
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,636
Where's the bedroom?

194
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:57,368
This is sort of it.
I sort of sleep in here.

195
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,720
Don't worry about it.

196
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,513
What?

197
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:38,916
I don't know.

198
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,557
Grandma.

199
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:53,190
Maybe you'd better check.

200
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,200
What did you think
I was gonna do?

201
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:01,234
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

202
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,243
I was hearing everything
that you were doing...

203
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:07,712
so I put these on
to give you privacy.

204
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:11,445
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

205
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,248
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

206
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:16,289
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

207
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,450
Scootch over.

208
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:22,586
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

209
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,094
I have him.

210
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:30,602
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

211
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:33,334
- Go.
- She has me.

212
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,740
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

213
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,211
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

214
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:42,307
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

215
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,957
Close the curtains.

216
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:56,765
No, you can't smoke!
He can't take smoke!

217
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:01,969
- Magic.
- Oh.

218
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:13,009
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

219
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,984
I don't even notice it anymore.

220
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,715
All right. Come here.

221
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,302
You don't have to get that embarrassed.
It's a little bit of throw up.

222
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:34,531
Little bit of throw up.

223
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,632
Well, what shall we do?

224
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:42,874
Want me to write which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down...

225
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,781
No, no.
I'll take a cab.

226
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,959
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

227
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:04,700
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

228
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:08,731
Carl, take me off the speaker,
Did I tell you these are house seats?

229
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,174
you could use a break,

230
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,805
Hello, Carl?

231
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,814
you there?

232
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:20,047
Okay. I just found a model.

233
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,856
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

234
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:27,859
Carl, right?

235
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,924
Hey, what's going on?

236
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:37,027
- Remember?
- I only need one.

237
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:40,837
You picked me up maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, some time ago.

238
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,104
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

239
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,041
Portrait?

240
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:49,948
I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

241
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,713
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

242
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,345
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

243
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:00,861
Who is it, baby?

244
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,734
Who is that, Verdell?

245
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:13,234
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

246
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,574
I was in the studio doing work,
and I just...

247
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,806
It's out here.

248
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:23,250
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

249
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,515
I usually make a big deal
about picking models...

250
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,579
but Carl is so thorough.

251
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:30,455
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

252
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,723
This is not a nude.

253
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,500
just kidding around.

254
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,836
So much for love.

255
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:47,909
Yet another pose.

256
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,948
Exactly what is
your previous experience?

257
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:55,316
How about that, hmm?
I'm running out of ideas here.

258
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,581
Then give me some direction.

259
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,522
Nothing.

260
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,857
I just watch until something
strikes me.

261
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,921
I mean, do anything
that you think of.

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,369
Wait for me to say "hold that pose,"
then try to comfortably hold it.

263
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,674
No direction.

264
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:20,344
Okay.

265
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,779
What I do is watch.

266
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,053
You ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

267
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:31,352
An old woman
sitting on a bus...

268
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:33,551
or kids going to school...

269
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:35,559
or somebody just waiting.

270
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:39,257
And you see this flash
come over them...

271
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:43,463
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external...

272
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,027
because that hasn't changed.

273
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:47,938
And when you see it,
they're sort of realer...

274
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,168
and they're more alive.

275
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:54,672
If you look at somebody long enough,
you discover their humanity.

276
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,684
Wow.

277
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:03,251
I know exactly what you mean.

278
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,888
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

279
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:18,100
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

280
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,244
- Sorry.
- I got on the third line of dialogue,

281
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:28,613
I blanked. I had no clue
as to what the next line was.

282
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:32,051
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

283
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,146
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

284
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,621
I came back in.

285
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,555
Here she comes
to ignore me again.

286
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:40,425
I messed up
on the exact same line.

287
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:43,021
- Guess what.
- What?

288
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,033
He cast me!

289
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:47,467
just what the world needs...
another actress.

290
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,630
Okay, okay.

291
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:59,614
Can't live without me, huh?

292
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:03,482
I'm finally gonna ask.

293
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:07,615
What's with the plastic
picnic ware?

294
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,887
Why don't you try ours?
You're afraid it isn't clean?

295
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,328
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

296
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,866
So give yourself
a little pep talk.

297
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,426
Must try other people's
clean silverware...

298
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,996
as part of fun
of dining out.

299
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,574
What's wrong with your son?

300
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,135
Yeah. What do you care?

301
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,622
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

302
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,423
He's allergic to dust.

303
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:47,089
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him whenever there's trouble.

304
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,659
So an ear infection...
Is this bothering you?

305
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:58,704
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to
the emergency room six times a month...

306
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:03,180
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

307
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,309
Nice chatting with you.

308
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,720
- His name?
- Spencer.

309
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:12,817
Okay.

310
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,155
Spence.

311
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:22,503
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

312
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:26,563
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

313
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:39,445
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

314
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,547
For two weeks all we've done is work.
Let's play!

315
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,260
Vincent!

316
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,404
So you're practically finished, huh?

317
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:04,712
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

318
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,615
Where you going?

319
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,748
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

320
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:30,763
- You want some chocolate?
- No, he's not allowed.

321
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,138
Wait.

322
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,475
I gotta take off.
You want to say good-bye or anything?

323
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:40,176
- He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

324
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,617
I'm gonna look
at the painting.

325
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,058
Where are you going, sweetheart?

326
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,356
You want some water?
What is the matter with you?

327
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,628
You want some water?

328
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:03,669
Simon, wait!

329
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:17,484
Why are you doing this?

330
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:22,119
No. No, wait.

331
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:23,685
See.

332
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,993
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

333
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,135
Excuse me.

334
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:41,045
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

335
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,978
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

336
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,400
So you call 9-1 -1
and don't leave your name?

337
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:01,730
That's right.

338
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:04,466
Even a dumb geezer should know
Emergency automatically...

339
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,700
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

340
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,207
Ask him.

341
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,642
What's wrong with you?

342
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,508
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name ya.

343
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:17,678
We will. If we can't, we'll come back
and ask you again and again.

344
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,847
What, you're trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

345
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:24,757
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

346
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:28,491
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

347
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:32,091
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

348
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:34,101
Get some tape on it.

349
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,873
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

350
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,239
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

351
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,904
If you could just
watch the dog tonight.

352
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:50,017
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

353
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,054
Old bitch.

354
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:54,056
Damn dog.

355
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:00,926
You're taking him.
Yes, you are!

356
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,262
Get the hell out of the way!

357
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:06,531
You're taking him.
This will even the books. One night.

358
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:09,737
Wait, wait.

359
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:13,607
Do you want to say no to me?

360
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:15,111
Huh?

361
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:21,051
I don't want to say nothing
to you.

362
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:26,154
Because I've never felt as crazy
as I do right now.

363
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:28,385
I almost want you to say no.

364
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,926
Thanks for looking after him.

365
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,834
Hey! Where are you going?

366
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:42,000
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

367
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:46,009
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before.

368
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,743
Hey, Frank.

369
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,726
You're dead.

370
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:46,807
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

371
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,638
You'll eat what we got,
what we eat.

372
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,849
All right.

373
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,855
Don't do anything.

374
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:19,675
Where's the trust?

375
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,679
Never a break.

376
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,951
Dogs.

377
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:47,035
Always look at the bright side
of your life

378
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:55,310
Always look at the lighter side
of your life

379
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:06,889
God.

380
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:07,093
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

381
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,926
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

382
00:30:09,996 --> 00:30:12,122
and we haven't sold
a single painting.

383
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:14,256
We can't reduce the price
at this stage.

384
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,928
What...
I'm in a free fall here.

385
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,800
- Yes?
- We can see him.

386
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:21,772
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

387
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:24,333
I will meet you in there.

388
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,343
Okay? One minute.

389
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:29,312
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

390
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:33,648
How are you doing, great one?

391
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,951
I haven't looked at myself yet.

392
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:38,320
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

393
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,189
Oh, God.

394
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,326
That bad, huh?

395
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,826
I talked to the doctor,
and... Oh!

396
00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:51,964
Okay. It's not that bad.

397
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,372
The doctors say you're gonna be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

398
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:57,035
The scars might take...

399
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,706
Oh, shit!

400
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:08,479
-Jackie.
- Yes?

401
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,649
Can you hand me a mirror,
please?

402
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:22,135
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

403
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,642
So how are things anyway?

404
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,347
How's Verdell?

405
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:40,855
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

406
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:43,017
Taking care of him.

407
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,425
How could you do that?

408
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,463
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

409
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:50,365
I promise. Not a chance.

410
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:53,268
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

411
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:55,201
I'm always on the move.

412
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,441
Trust me.

413
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:02,272
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

414
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:04,337
Your dog is fine, Simon.

415
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,084
Okay.

416
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,056
Waiting gives the devil time.

417
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,943
Oh, my.

418
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,623
Where did I go?

419
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:49,057
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

420
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:55,097
What are you doing
with a dog?

421
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:58,035
Suckered in, set up,
pushed around.

422
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:01,073
You're not worried
someone might take it?

423
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,337
No, not until now,
for Christ's sake.

424
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:08,847
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

425
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:12,143
Hey, puppy.

426
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,312
He's cute.

427
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,357
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

428
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:19,016
I wonder what breed he is.

429
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:26,298
He's a little dog.

430
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:29,496
Next time, if Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

431
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:34,269
How old are you?

432
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:36,867
If I guessed by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

433
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,340
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

434
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:44,317
So much for eyes.
How old are you?

435
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:46,149
You brought it up.

436
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,885
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

437
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:52,359
Yeah. Easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

438
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:56,125
But my knees knock when you
turn on the charm full blast.

439
00:33:57,334 --> 00:34:00,894
But I mean,
what's with the dark?

440
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,535
Dawn patrol.

441
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,569
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

442
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:14,015
This time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

443
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,815
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

444
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:22,418
The dog.
The bacon's for the dog.

445
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:28,396
Last week I was playing the piano
for him, and he likes it.

446
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,401
So I decided I'm gonna...

447
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,836
make a joke.

448
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,429
So you're all set here.

449
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,939
Yeah.

450
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,946
I think it's a beautiful day
for our walk today.

451
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,952
Very nice.

452
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:03,796
Look at that. Look at him.

453
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,632
I gotta give you something.

454
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:09,232
I gotta give you something
real good too.

455
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,268
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

456
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:17,448
Don't you be like me.

457
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:20,544
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man...

458
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,419
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

459
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:27,689
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

460
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:32,095
I'm gonna take you home right now
and get you something. Yes.

461
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,326
Let's go home
and do some writing.

462
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,661
He had made the girl happy...

463
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:40,901
and what a girl.

464
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:43,842
"You saved my life," she said.

465
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:48,582
"You'd better make it up to me."

466
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,286
Done.

467
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:58,020
Yes, I hate the doggie.

468
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,527
Ooh, 62 books.

469
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:02,790
Done.

470
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:02,998
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

471
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,490
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

472
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,799
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

473
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:13,535
These are the food receipts here,
the household expenses.

474
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,543
Here's one for the dog again.

475
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:18,205
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

476
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:21,147
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

477
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:25,377
Boy, look at that, huh?

478
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:29,551
Oh, he likes it
at Chez Melvin, hmm?

479
00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:34,157
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

480
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:38,633
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay,just sit. Good.

481
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:41,694
We don't want any company.
I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

482
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,705
Okay, have it your way.

483
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:55,542
How's Verdell doing?

484
00:36:56,922 --> 00:37:00,084
You know,
he's a pain in the ass.

485
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:02,859
Well.

486
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:05,055
Simon's home.

487
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,895
I was hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance...

488
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:10,559
to think and adjust.

489
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:14,731
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

490
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,933
No, he definitely
wants him back right away.

491
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,010
He'll be by tomorrow.

492
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:23,908
Okay.

493
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:25,916
Okay by me.

494
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:34,788
Hungry.
I'll be right with you, pooch.

495
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,730
One, two, three, four, five.

496
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,575
I'm okay.

497
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,829
Mr. Udall.

498
00:38:48,004 --> 00:38:50,768
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

499
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:53,036
Could you take it...

500
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,601
just...

501
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,170
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

502
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,281
Thank you.

503
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,722
Come here, my beautiful boy.

504
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:14,822
Come here, boy.

505
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,060
Let's go home and get well.

506
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:21,504
You can't blame him
for being weird.

507
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:25,799
Have a look at yourself
in the mirror.

508
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,571
Thank you.

509
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,385
Come on, sweetheart.

510
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:41,390
Come here, boy.

511
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:46,098
I know what you want.

512
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,236
Where's my boy?

513
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:00,411
Don't force him.

514
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,748
Over a dog.

515
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,484
Over an ugly dog.

516
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,362
Worst sidewalk in New York.

517
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,366
Look where they put it.

518
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,975
Help!

519
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,480
If you want to see me,
you will make an appointment.

520
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,482
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

521
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:12,521
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in?

522
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:14,818
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

523
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:18,826
You said you could help me.
What was that, a tease?

524
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:21,796
I can help you
if you take responsibility...

525
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:24,357
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

526
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,336
Two years ago.
I also regrew my beard.

527
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,998
But you're not interested
in changes in me.

528
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:34,101
I don't have this mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

529
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:37,670
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

530
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,874
- Yes.
- Thank you.

531
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,851
No, we're not doing this now.

532
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,857
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

533
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,400
What if this is
as good as it gets?

534
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:18,417
What the heck are those for?

535
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:23,887
No. Get Carol.

536
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:25,692
I'm filling in.

537
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:27,699
We don't know
if she's coming back.

538
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:30,760
She might be getting a job
closer to home.

539
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:36,007
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

540
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:39,902
What the heck do you mean?

541
00:42:39,947 --> 00:42:41,538
Look, elephant girl...

542
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:44,641
just go get Carol or something.

543
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:47,380
just have her do
my one meal here.

544
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,718
I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

545
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:54,888
Do it!

546
00:42:57,832 --> 00:43:00,528
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

547
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:09,306
Out!
just shut up and get out!

548
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:11,674
Do it!

549
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:14,078
I'll be quiet.

550
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,583
just let me stay here.

551
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:19,212
No problem.
Go get Carol.

552
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:22,415
Get her here.

553
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:26,326
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

554
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,556
I'm a great customer.

555
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:29,825
This day...

556
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,666
has been a disaster.

557
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:38,005
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

558
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,475
Get out immediately...

559
00:43:40,544 --> 00:43:42,943
or there's gonna be trouble.

560
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:44,946
Man, I mean it.

561
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:55,488
Okay.

562
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,331
See ya. Good-bye.

563
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:05,163
It's about time!

564
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:08,971
Carol's last name.

565
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,638
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

566
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:17,370
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

567
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,781
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

568
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:25,151
What can you do?

569
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:35,725
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

570
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:37,962
Why not? You're a good girl.

571
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:39,469
Hello.

572
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:56,247
Christ.

573
00:45:15,576 --> 00:45:16,702
I'm hungry.

574
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:21,379
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

575
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,076
What are you doing here?

576
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,210
This is not a sexist thing.
If you were a waiter...

577
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:29,189
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

578
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:35,024
I'm trying to keep emotion
out of this...

579
00:45:35,096 --> 00:45:37,587
even though it's
an important issue to me...

580
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,965
and I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

581
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:42,798
What subject?

582
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,567
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

583
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:48,871
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

584
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,814
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

585
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,280
And to prove it...

586
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,951
I have not gotten personal,
and you have.

587
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:07,990
Why aren't you at work?

588
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,657
You sick?

589
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,269
You don't look sick.

590
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,139
just tired and bitter.

591
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:24,004
My son is sick, okay?

592
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,610
What about your mother?

593
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,412
How do you know
about my mother?

594
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:36,317
I hear you talking
while I wait.

595
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,853
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

596
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:50,867
How're you doing?

597
00:46:57,783 --> 00:47:00,274
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

598
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:03,719
Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners!

599
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,894
Back to life.

600
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,804
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

601
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,775
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand...

602
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:27,006
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand...

603
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,514
bingo.

604
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:34,076
- 1 04.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

605
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:38,418
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

606
00:47:41,729 --> 00:47:44,823
- Mom!
- We're okay.

607
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,328
Melvin, wait!

608
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,831
Melvin, wait!

609
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,277
Shut up, kids!

610
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:04,584
Give us a lift,
would you, Melvin?

611
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:06,586
A lift. Okay.

612
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:12,117
Cover your mouth
when you cough, kid.

613
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:17,455
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
and quickly, please.

614
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,296
Okay.

615
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:21,062
- Hospital?
- Yes.

616
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:24,537
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

617
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:27,132
Stay away from me!
God!

618
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:30,813
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

619
00:48:30,813 --> 00:48:34,408
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

620
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:37,078
I feel terrible that I have to...

621
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:38,985
- Simon.
- Huh?

622
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:42,218
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

623
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,485
Sorry.

624
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:52,094
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

625
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,160
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right...

626
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,640
maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

627
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:04,073
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

628
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,752
Simon, you're broke.

629
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:17,292
The medical bills
are $61 ,000 now...

630
00:49:17,363 --> 00:49:19,263
and the show didn't go well.

631
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,628
I've spoken to your parents.

632
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,362
They didn't hang up
or anything...

633
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:27,768
but they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

634
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,106
Well, I can't call them.

635
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,270
Come here, baby.

636
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:39,516
Verdell. What's wrong?

637
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,181
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart!

638
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:47,521
Happy to see me,
you little pissant mop?

639
00:49:47,594 --> 00:49:50,461
How about another ride
down the chute?

640
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,022
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

641
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,192
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

642
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:57,065
Sorry. I'm sorry.

643
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,140
I'll be able to keep
my apartment and the studio...

644
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:04,142
won't I?

645
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:09,981
Wow.

646
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:12,177
Oh, my God.

647
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,683
Yes, you write more than everybody else
and make us a lot of money.

648
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:46,687
- But it's more appropriate...
- Look.

649
00:50:47,857 --> 00:50:51,054
I need this.
just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

650
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:52,789
Okay?

651
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:59,591
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

652
00:50:59,669 --> 00:51:04,766
On a pleasanter note, my son
just got accepted to Brown.

653
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:07,002
My husband was dying.

654
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:10,569
Yeah. Good, nice,
thrilled, exciting.

655
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:13,139
You don't have to wait with me.

656
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,723
I can't resist.

657
00:51:21,793 --> 00:51:24,056
You usually move
through here so quickly.

658
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:27,461
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

659
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:31,126
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

660
00:51:31,202 --> 00:51:33,102
What does it mean to you?

661
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:39,576
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

662
00:51:40,646 --> 00:51:43,273
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

663
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:48,013
just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

664
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:53,417
How do you write women so well?

665
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:55,721
I think of a man...

666
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:58,696
and I take away reason
and accountability.

667
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:17,544
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

668
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,787
"M.D."

669
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:31,755
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

670
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:34,562
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

671
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:36,865
What? Please,just tell me.

672
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,372
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

673
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:44,934
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

674
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,674
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

675
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:50,650
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

676
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,482
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

677
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:56,581
-I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
-What?

678
00:52:56,658 --> 00:52:59,821
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

679
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:04,525
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

680
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:09,495
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

681
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:12,301
She said I was to take excellent care
of this little guy...

682
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:15,105
because you are urgently needed
back at work.

683
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:17,271
What kind of work do you do?

684
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:21,009
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

685
00:53:23,653 --> 00:53:26,645
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

686
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:30,659
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

687
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:33,321
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

688
00:53:33,397 --> 00:53:36,662
Tell them I need CBC, differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

689
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:39,065
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

690
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:42,070
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna
get the results back today?

691
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,072
Sure. Let's sit down.

692
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:49,503
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions...

693
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,844
from the beginning of the year.

694
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:56,444
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

695
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,182
and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

696
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:02,818
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

697
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:05,590
Since forever. Six months old.

698
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:08,497
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

699
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:10,865
Only in the emergency room
or when he was well?

700
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:14,872
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

701
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:18,240
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

702
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:23,475
No. I asked. They said my plan
didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

703
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:26,109
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

704
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:29,586
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

705
00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:35,185
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

706
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:39,728
So, once the tests come back...

707
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,769
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results?

708
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:47,000
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

709
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:50,441
That's his home number.

710
00:54:56,718 --> 00:55:00,154
- What?
- It's your home number!

711
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:08,386
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

712
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:11,591
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

713
00:55:13,702 --> 00:55:16,364
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do...

714
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,496
a lot of things
I have to find out here.

715
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:22,441
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least...

716
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,674
from now on your son is going to feel
a great deal better, okay?

717
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:36,182
Doc!

718
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:44,032
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

719
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,691
That's good.

720
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:54,769
So, listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs.

721
00:55:54,844 --> 00:55:56,140
One way or another, we'll...

722
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:58,611
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

723
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:03,978
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

724
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,593
That's wonderful!

725
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:17,992
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

726
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:22,733
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

727
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:32,716
Huh? What's wrong?

728
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:36,310
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

729
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:58,141
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

730
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:04,373
Would there be any way
that you would be willing...

731
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:06,544
to walk his dog for him?

732
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,178
Absolutely.

733
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:11,752
You're a wonderful man.

734
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:18,262
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

735
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,391
in case he is asleep.

736
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:23,601
Open his curtains for him...

737
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,935
so he can see God's beautiful work.

738
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:31,239
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

739
00:57:32,414 --> 00:57:36,874
Did they teach you to talk like this
in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

740
00:57:36,951 --> 00:57:39,920
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

741
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,617
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

742
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:58,829
A seriously goofy man is behind this.
You're not allowed to block that out.

743
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,240
Do you really want to go
back to Emergency...

744
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,404
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

745
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,678
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

746
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,718
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

747
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,753
You know how this will turn out.

748
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,589
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

749
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,061
You don't send this one back.

750
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:26,662
Right?

751
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,307
No, I do, I understand,

752
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,870
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

753
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,154
Bye-bye.

754
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,662
What a day. Come here.

755
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,667
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

756
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:00,260
Thank you for walking him.

757
00:59:02,774 --> 00:59:05,140
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling so well.

758
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,202
This place smells like shit.

759
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,713
Go away.

760
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:14,612
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please,just leave!

761
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:20,084
What happened to your queer
party friends?

762
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,717
Get outta here!

763
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:31,129
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you.

764
00:59:31,204 --> 00:59:34,696
Nellie, you're a disgrace
to depression.

765
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,235
Rot in hell, Melvin.

766
00:59:41,347 --> 00:59:43,281
No need to stop being a lady.

767
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,874
Quit worrying.

768
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:47,978
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

769
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,263
Is this fun for you?

770
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:04,227
You lucky devil. It just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

771
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:06,933
I'm losing my apartment.

772
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:12,571
And Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

773
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:14,615
And I won't.

774
01:00:14,684 --> 01:00:18,051
I don't want to paint anymore.

775
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,680
So the life that I was trying for
is over.

776
01:00:21,757 --> 01:00:23,917
The life that I had is gone...

777
01:00:23,993 --> 01:00:28,224
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself
that it's difficult to breathe.

778
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:30,857
It's high times for you, isn't it?

779
01:00:30,933 --> 01:00:34,596
The gay neighbor is terrified.

780
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:35,967
Terrified!

781
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:51,147
I was just trying to give you a boost.

782
01:00:52,589 --> 01:00:54,523
Lucky you.

783
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:57,355
You're here for rock bottom...

784
01:00:57,428 --> 01:01:01,363
you absolute horror of a human being.

785
01:01:14,613 --> 01:01:18,844
The one thing I'll do for you...
I might cheer you up.

786
01:01:19,918 --> 01:01:21,408
Get out.

787
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:24,978
You wanna know
why the dog prefers me?

788
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,048
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

789
01:01:31,497 --> 01:01:34,090
I keep bacon in my pocket.

790
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,131
See?

791
01:01:37,936 --> 01:01:39,369
Oh, my gosh.

792
01:01:43,543 --> 01:01:46,477
We'll both call him.
You'll see.

793
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:47,978
It's a trick.

794
01:01:57,424 --> 01:01:58,857
Come here, Verdell.

795
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,190
Come on.

796
01:02:08,602 --> 01:02:11,934
Come here, baby. It's okay.

797
01:02:17,745 --> 01:02:20,009
just stupid. A stupid dog.

798
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,083
Could you leave now?

799
01:02:25,854 --> 01:02:27,286
Please?

800
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,823
I don't get it.

801
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:26,773
Taxi!

802
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:01,950
Watch again with Nick At Nite's
Classic TVRewind,

803
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:04,683
On repeat viewing,
one begins to suspect...

804
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:08,852
that might not really be Major Healy
in the phone booth after all,

805
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,165
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

806
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,827
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

807
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,837
If you're, uh...

808
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,711
If you're worried about thanking me...

809
01:04:46,084 --> 01:04:47,574
That's not why I'm here.

810
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:52,217
Though you have no idea what it's like
to have a real conversation...

811
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,953
with a doctor about Spencer.

812
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,158
Note. Put it in a note.

813
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:12,337
I have a hair dryer...

814
01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:15,716
Why did you do this for me?

815
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:21,255
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

816
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:25,727
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

817
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,230
Well, I mean...

818
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,234
I'm worried you did this be...

819
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:49,349
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

820
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,928
Look.

821
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,667
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

822
01:05:59,735 --> 01:06:03,263
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

823
01:06:04,508 --> 01:06:05,599
Clear what up?

824
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,178
I'm not going to sleep with you.

825
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:14,115
I will never sleep with you!
Never, ever!

826
01:06:15,688 --> 01:06:17,451
Not ever!

827
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:26,598
I'm sorry, but...

828
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,168
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths
until 9:00 a.m.

829
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:35,575
I'm not kidding.

830
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:38,744
Anything else?

831
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:44,042
just...

832
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:48,356
thank you.

833
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:54,530
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

834
01:06:59,037 --> 01:07:00,629
Yes.

835
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:17,714
"Never," she says.

836
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:40,383
I took a chance you were up.

837
01:07:41,786 --> 01:07:44,118
I brought you some Chinese soup.

838
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:48,884
Thanks.

839
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:08,578
I've never been this tired
in my life.

840
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,359
I haven't been sleeping.

841
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:23,825
I haven't been clear in my head...

842
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,164
or felt like myself.

843
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,264
I'm in trouble.

844
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:35,202
It's not just the tiredness.

845
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,011
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

846
01:08:39,084 --> 01:08:41,052
Sleepy.

847
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,281
Where everything looks distorted...

848
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:45,483
and everything inside you...

849
01:08:45,558 --> 01:08:49,927
kind of aches and you can barely find
the will to complain.

850
01:08:49,996 --> 01:08:51,759
Yeah.

851
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:58,370
I'm glad we did this.

852
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,867
Good talking to you.

853
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:12,987
You are not still writing
that thank-you note.

854
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:15,651
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

855
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:20,757
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

856
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:24,393
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

857
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,729
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

858
01:09:28,808 --> 01:09:31,901
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

859
01:09:31,978 --> 01:09:35,345
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

860
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,178
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

861
01:09:39,253 --> 01:09:41,686
All right. We got pizza.

862
01:09:41,756 --> 01:09:44,919
Carol and I are going out.
Sausage and pepperoni.

863
01:09:44,993 --> 01:09:47,222
You want to make this later
for you and Spencer?

864
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:51,956
We are going out, like people do.

865
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:57,801
If you can't feel good
about this break...

866
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:01,037
and step out a little...

867
01:10:01,112 --> 01:10:03,910
then I think you
ought to have Mr. Udall...

868
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:06,142
send you over a psychiatrist.

869
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:10,119
I don't need one, because I know
what's really going on here!

870
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,018
I gotta finish this letter
or I'll go nuts.

871
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:17,688
This can't be right.
"Con-science?"

872
01:10:25,572 --> 01:10:26,664
What?

873
01:10:43,593 --> 01:10:47,359
It's very weird now
not feeling that...

874
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:50,332
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

875
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:55,632
Without that, I just
start thinking about myself.

876
01:10:55,706 --> 01:10:58,641
And what good does that
ever get anybody?

877
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:06,076
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple...

878
01:11:06,152 --> 01:11:08,120
and I felt myself...

879
01:11:10,157 --> 01:11:11,488
giving them a dirty look.

880
01:11:14,495 --> 01:11:18,898
I just had no idea everything was...

881
01:11:27,643 --> 01:11:29,235
Go ahead.

882
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:34,417
Moving in the wrong direction.

883
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:37,647
Away from a time...

884
01:11:37,721 --> 01:11:41,680
when I remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything.

885
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:44,489
Hold fucking...

886
01:11:45,563 --> 01:11:47,758
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

887
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:51,166
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

888
01:11:54,306 --> 01:11:58,106
I felt almost really bad...

889
01:11:58,178 --> 01:11:59,736
that Dr. Bettes is married.

890
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:07,888
Which is probably why I make Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

891
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,960
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

892
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,963
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

893
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:22,137
Who needs these thoughts?

894
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:26,133
So what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

895
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,838
Leave me be!
Why are you doing this?

896
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,405
What is it you want?

897
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:33,609
I hope getting me to think about
everything that's wrong...

898
01:12:33,685 --> 01:12:35,653
when all I want to do
is not do that...

899
01:12:35,721 --> 01:12:37,655
has some purpose.

900
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:43,762
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
What?

901
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,161
I want us to go out.

902
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:56,806
Okay.

903
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,592
Thank you.

904
01:13:18,637 --> 01:13:20,900
Now I gotta send you
a thank-you note.

905
01:13:22,108 --> 01:13:25,669
Oh, look. Evelyn's here
and her giant,Joey.

906
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:29,148
That's really
why you brought me here?

907
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:31,446
That's really
why you brought me here?

908
01:13:31,518 --> 01:13:34,248
Well, you know,
it's not even mine.

909
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:37,381
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

910
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:41,589
But the dog did throw up
twice last night and his spark is off.

911
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:44,599
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

912
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:48,899
They say his stomach's out of whack
and they need him for a couple of days.

913
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:50,529
Well, do it!

914
01:13:51,742 --> 01:13:54,404
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

915
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:58,770
- This is for later.
- What's this?

916
01:14:00,051 --> 01:14:02,542
- It's a note.
- A note?

917
01:14:03,621 --> 01:14:05,350
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

918
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:07,551
Thank-you note? No, no.

919
01:14:07,626 --> 01:14:10,151
- You can read it later.
- No, thank you.

920
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,959
No thank-you note.

921
01:14:15,168 --> 01:14:16,965
Thank you.

922
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:24,936
She's nice.

923
01:14:26,847 --> 01:14:28,872
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

924
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,884
Really nice.

925
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:38,050
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

926
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:42,158
Sure looks like it went over too.

927
01:14:44,969 --> 01:14:46,903
Look at you!

928
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,868
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

929
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,217
- What?
- Look at you.

930
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:03,984
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

931
01:15:04,057 --> 01:15:06,923
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

932
01:15:06,994 --> 01:15:10,088
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

933
01:15:10,164 --> 01:15:13,292
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

934
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:17,030
Well, yeah. I mean,
if his parents are alive.

935
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:19,074
They have to help.
It's the rules.

936
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:22,235
That's great.
Let them help him.

937
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:26,845
Only, uh...

938
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:31,250
I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

939
01:15:32,323 --> 01:15:33,756
Can you drive him?

940
01:15:36,027 --> 01:15:38,120
Think white and get serious.

941
01:15:39,965 --> 01:15:41,523
Take my car. A convertible.

942
01:15:43,769 --> 01:15:45,498
Do you drive?

943
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:48,631
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

944
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:51,200
Gettin' loud.

945
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:55,676
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

946
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,445
I want your life for one minute,
where my big problem is...

947
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:02,115
somebody offers me a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

948
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:13,129
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

949
01:16:13,203 --> 01:16:14,829
I'll take him.

950
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:16,964
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

951
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,531
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

952
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:22,374
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

953
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:27,149
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

954
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:29,653
We don't enjoy one another that much.

955
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:37,930
If there is a mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

956
01:16:37,997 --> 01:16:40,056
please be sure to let me know.

957
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:42,899
Last-word freak.

958
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,599
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

959
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:50,076
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

960
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,113
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

961
01:17:00,624 --> 01:17:03,616
What I did for you,
it's working out?

962
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:10,292
What you did changed my life.

963
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:17,766
No thank-you note.

964
01:17:17,843 --> 01:17:21,210
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life...

965
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,248
which you won't read...

966
01:17:24,751 --> 01:17:26,879
is that somehow
you have done more...

967
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:29,252
for my mother, my son...

968
01:17:29,323 --> 01:17:32,655
and me than anybody else ever has.

969
01:17:32,727 --> 01:17:35,890
I'm just gonna read you
this part of it.

970
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:40,861
"And that makes you
the most important, surprising...

971
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:43,063
generous person
I ever met in my life...

972
01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:46,039
and that you're gonna be
in our prayers...

973
01:17:46,109 --> 01:17:48,043
our daily prayers forever."

974
01:17:49,513 --> 01:17:50,604
Lovely.

975
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:55,847
I also wrote one part
I'm just gonna say.

976
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,478
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

977
01:17:59,557 --> 01:18:04,688
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

978
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:08,029
when you came over and you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

979
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,035
So I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

980
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:15,439
I was sorry for busting you on that
and busting in on you that night...

981
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:16,942
when I said I was never...

982
01:18:19,781 --> 01:18:22,978
I was sorry, and I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold...

983
01:18:23,051 --> 01:18:25,987
and that you had to wait two seconds
for a coffee filler...

984
01:18:26,054 --> 01:18:29,023
and I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant...

985
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:33,153
the human being that had it in him
to do this thing for us.

986
01:18:34,698 --> 01:18:36,893
You know what?
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

987
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:39,333
"I have not been able...

988
01:18:39,403 --> 01:18:41,963
to express my gratefulness to you.

989
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:44,030
Even as I look
at the word 'grateful' now...

990
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,134
it doesn't begin to tell you
what I feel."

991
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:55,317
That's nice of you.
Thank you.

992
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,923
Thank you.

993
01:19:09,638 --> 01:19:11,696
Now I want you to do something for me.

994
01:19:20,283 --> 01:19:22,877
I'm sorry.
Didn't I say, "What?"

995
01:19:22,953 --> 01:19:25,547
I thought I said "What?"

996
01:19:28,358 --> 01:19:29,450
What?

997
01:19:29,527 --> 01:19:31,893
I want you to go on this trip.

998
01:19:32,865 --> 01:19:33,957
No, sir.

999
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,023
I can't do this without you.

1000
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:40,298
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff"one eye" on me.

1001
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:42,034
I need you to chaperone.

1002
01:19:42,108 --> 01:19:44,599
Separate everything but cars.

1003
01:19:44,677 --> 01:19:47,237
You said you like convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

1004
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:49,805
I'm sorry. The stiff"one eye"?

1005
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,909
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1006
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:54,477
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1007
01:19:54,555 --> 01:19:56,216
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1008
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:00,554
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1009
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:04,759
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1010
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,235
I need a hand,
and where did she go?

1011
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:10,170
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me?

1012
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:14,134
Is there any other way to see it?

1013
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:27,520
Here's a little suitcase...

1014
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:30,460
shocked that it's being used.

1015
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:42,171
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

1016
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:09,839
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- yes,

1017
01:21:11,077 --> 01:21:13,204
I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1018
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:19,585
just south of Baltimore, Maryland,
and I know what you're gonna say next.

1019
01:21:19,653 --> 01:21:22,918
I mean, I think I know,

1020
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:25,322
I'm not sure...

1021
01:21:25,392 --> 01:21:28,020
but I think so,

1022
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:30,394
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

1023
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,933
I didn't know...

1024
01:21:34,003 --> 01:21:36,527
if we were eating in any restaurants
that have dress codes.

1025
01:21:38,074 --> 01:21:41,531
Well, I don't...

1026
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,738
I mean, maybe,

1027
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:46,077
I mean, yes! Let's.

1028
01:21:47,919 --> 01:21:49,010
Gotcha.

1029
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:56,183
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1030
01:21:57,262 --> 01:22:00,356
Okay, then. Good night.

1031
01:22:05,138 --> 01:22:08,073
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1032
01:22:10,545 --> 01:22:12,843
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1033
01:22:12,914 --> 01:22:16,145
Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence.

1034
01:22:17,619 --> 01:22:19,052
Lip kiss.

1035
01:22:22,925 --> 01:22:25,416
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1036
01:22:25,494 --> 01:22:28,622
Hey! Real sensitive!

1037
01:22:29,433 --> 01:22:32,459
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1038
01:22:41,346 --> 01:22:43,371
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1039
01:22:43,448 --> 01:22:46,144
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1040
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:50,552
- Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1041
01:22:54,962 --> 01:22:58,419
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1042
01:22:58,499 --> 01:23:00,433
Give me a hug.

1043
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:05,133
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1044
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:06,799
Soak it up.

1045
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:11,034
It's your last chance for a hug
for a few days.

1046
01:23:26,397 --> 01:23:28,332
Thank you for being on time.

1047
01:23:33,506 --> 01:23:35,735
Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag.

1048
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:42,043
Hello.
Holy God! Who did that to you?

1049
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,647
Um, I was attacked.

1050
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:50,156
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1051
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:53,216
and I was hospitalized.

1052
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:58,529
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1053
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,535
Let's go.

1054
01:24:02,739 --> 01:24:04,899
How are you, sir?
Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1055
01:24:04,975 --> 01:24:07,102
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1056
01:24:07,178 --> 01:24:10,443
I, uh... Well, there's
no place cards or anything.

1057
01:24:10,514 --> 01:24:14,951
You look like you need more room,
so I'll sit in the back.

1058
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:33,235
Never a break. Never.

1059
01:24:33,307 --> 01:24:36,242
Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1060
01:24:37,178 --> 01:24:40,977
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1061
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:45,319
Thanks.

1062
01:24:54,398 --> 01:24:56,262
Thank you.

1063
01:24:57,835 --> 01:24:59,769
You're welcome.

1064
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:06,769
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1065
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:14,811
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1066
01:25:16,523 --> 01:25:18,684
Seriously.

1067
01:25:18,759 --> 01:25:21,421
We got good stuff here.

1068
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:36,974
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this

1069
01:25:37,047 --> 01:25:39,777
- When there's no complaining
- I like this music.

1070
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:42,010
There'll be days like this

1071
01:25:42,085 --> 01:25:44,645
I like this music.

1072
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:47,417
Like the flick of a switch

1073
01:25:47,492 --> 01:25:50,016
Well, my mama told me

1074
01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:53,393
There'll be days like this

1075
01:25:53,466 --> 01:25:59,064
Well, I'm looking for my girl
I wonder where can she be

1076
01:25:59,139 --> 01:26:03,303
Simon, I'm sure they did something
really off for you to feel this way...

1077
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:06,778
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid...

1078
01:26:06,847 --> 01:26:11,251
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1079
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:16,087
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1080
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:19,093
Nonsense.
And you want to know why?

1081
01:26:19,162 --> 01:26:22,097
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1082
01:26:31,776 --> 01:26:34,642
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

1083
01:26:34,713 --> 01:26:36,442
Yes.

1084
01:26:37,517 --> 01:26:39,280
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1085
01:26:39,352 --> 01:26:42,218
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1086
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:51,024
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1087
01:26:51,098 --> 01:26:55,228
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1088
01:26:55,303 --> 01:26:58,397
And she used to...

1089
01:26:58,473 --> 01:27:02,102
I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

1090
01:27:02,177 --> 01:27:07,410
She was very natural,
so she used to pose nude for me.

1091
01:27:08,885 --> 01:27:11,614
And I always thought,
or I guess I assumed...

1092
01:27:11,688 --> 01:27:13,747
that my father knew about it.

1093
01:27:13,824 --> 01:27:15,655
This stuff is pointless.

1094
01:27:15,726 --> 01:27:19,321
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1095
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:20,557
Stop.

1096
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:27,466
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

1097
01:27:29,408 --> 01:27:35,074
One day he walked in and found us,
and he started screaming.

1098
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:37,913
My father didn't come out of his room
for 1 1 years.

1099
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,010
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1100
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,953
playing the piano.

1101
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:48,528
Go ahead, Simon.

1102
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:52,125
So you said he came in your room
and he was yelling?

1103
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:54,828
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1104
01:27:56,973 --> 01:27:59,942
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1105
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:02,876
Yeah, I know. I was...

1106
01:28:02,947 --> 01:28:05,381
I remember I was defending
my mother...

1107
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:08,077
and I was trying to, you know...

1108
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:11,349
make peace in the lamest way.

1109
01:28:11,423 --> 01:28:13,948
I said...

1110
01:28:14,026 --> 01:28:16,517
"She's not naked. It's art."

1111
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:21,227
He started hitting me...

1112
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:26,602
and he beat me unconscious.

1113
01:28:26,674 --> 01:28:29,973
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1114
01:28:30,044 --> 01:28:33,206
I mean, he knew what I was
before I did.

1115
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,841
And the morning
that I left for college...

1116
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:38,853
he walked into my room...

1117
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,889
and he held out his hand...

1118
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:44,722
and it was filled with money.

1119
01:28:45,963 --> 01:28:50,332
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1120
01:28:52,337 --> 01:28:56,171
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1121
01:28:57,677 --> 01:29:01,772
And I just grabbed him
and I hugged him...

1122
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:04,441
and he turned and walked out.

1123
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:20,096
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1124
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:21,692
That's not true.

1125
01:29:21,769 --> 01:29:24,567
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories...

1126
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,767
that take place at lakes...

1127
01:29:26,842 --> 01:29:30,744
with boats and friends
and noodle salad.

1128
01:29:30,814 --> 01:29:32,748
just no one in this car.

1129
01:29:32,816 --> 01:29:34,443
But a lot of people...

1130
01:29:34,518 --> 01:29:38,386
that's their story:
good times, noodle salad.

1131
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:42,483
What makes it so hard
is not that you had it bad...

1132
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:46,259
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1133
01:29:46,332 --> 01:29:50,632
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1134
01:29:52,171 --> 01:29:53,603
Not it at all, huh?

1135
01:29:57,578 --> 01:30:01,378
Let's go to the hotel.

1136
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:04,111
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get
another big wad...

1137
01:30:04,185 --> 01:30:06,449
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1138
01:30:15,799 --> 01:30:18,323
Can I ask you a personal question?

1139
01:30:21,304 --> 01:30:22,862
Sure.

1140
01:30:24,275 --> 01:30:26,209
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1141
01:30:29,915 --> 01:30:33,372
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1142
01:30:33,452 --> 01:30:35,544
You consider your life easy?

1143
01:30:37,589 --> 01:30:40,524
All right.
I give you that one.

1144
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,663
Nice packin'.

1145
01:30:55,577 --> 01:30:57,737
- Hey, Spence.
- Hi, Mom,

1146
01:30:58,548 --> 01:31:01,312
- Wait till you hear,
- Why are you out of breath?

1147
01:31:01,384 --> 01:31:04,444
Mom, I ran over a guy
and scored a goal,

1148
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:08,513
- You did?
- yeah, He was big, Charlie, you know,

1149
01:31:08,592 --> 01:31:10,958
That's great!

1150
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:13,997
- yep, Amazing,
- Oh, my God, right?

1151
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:16,761
Mom, we're playing again,
Gotta go, Bye,

1152
01:31:16,836 --> 01:31:18,894
Wait.Just tell me...

1153
01:31:20,573 --> 01:31:24,942
- He scored a goal,
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1154
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:27,171
- Oh, you would've died.
- Oh, my God,!

1155
01:31:29,014 --> 01:31:33,952
My son was outside playing soccer.
Come on.

1156
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,183
Take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1157
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:38,384
Dancing?

1158
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,121
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1159
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,029
Oh, come on. Please, come on.

1160
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:49,026
All right.

1161
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:51,265
You're right.

1162
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:56,278
- Are you sad or something?
- No, I'm nervous.

1163
01:31:56,347 --> 01:32:00,215
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1164
01:32:00,284 --> 01:32:02,047
What a nice compliment.

1165
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:16,494
I'm happy.

1166
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:20,229
And you're my date.

1167
01:32:21,976 --> 01:32:23,499
Let's get dressed.

1168
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:35,221
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1169
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,782
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1170
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:18,502
- All set?
- Yeah.

1171
01:33:22,578 --> 01:33:25,138
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1172
01:33:25,214 --> 01:33:28,012
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1173
01:33:36,928 --> 01:33:39,623
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1174
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,990
Thank you.

1175
01:33:43,068 --> 01:33:44,729
Good evening.

1176
01:33:44,803 --> 01:33:47,966
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1177
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:51,373
just him. Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1178
01:33:51,444 --> 01:33:52,934
Yes, we do.

1179
01:33:52,979 --> 01:33:56,005
Oh, and I can give you
a tie and jacket.

1180
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:59,052
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1181
01:33:59,121 --> 01:34:00,553
We have some available.

1182
01:34:14,537 --> 01:34:16,471
No, I'm not putting that on.

1183
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:21,604
I'm also not going to let you inject me
with the plague, either.

1184
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,977
It's such a nice place.

1185
01:34:24,049 --> 01:34:26,540
You probably have these dry cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1186
01:34:26,618 --> 01:34:28,449
Actually, I don't think so.

1187
01:34:36,562 --> 01:34:40,555
Well, you just wait here.

1188
01:34:42,002 --> 01:34:43,435
Excuse me.

1189
01:34:55,418 --> 01:34:57,352
Good evening.

1190
01:34:59,289 --> 01:35:02,281
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1191
01:35:06,363 --> 01:35:09,526
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1192
01:35:09,601 --> 01:35:12,330
That one, yeah.
And this tie.

1193
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:23,343
Excuse me.

1194
01:35:27,287 --> 01:35:31,189
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1195
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:34,922
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1196
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:38,227
No, that's all right.
I'll just watch.

1197
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:47,841
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1198
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:33,292
Oh. Wait.

1199
01:37:04,232 --> 01:37:06,792
You look so se...

1200
01:37:08,803 --> 01:37:11,294
You look, uh, great.

1201
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:15,165
You look great.

1202
01:37:25,623 --> 01:37:27,113
You want to dance?

1203
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,059
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1204
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,188
- And?
- No.

1205
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:38,993
I don't get this place.

1206
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:43,971
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

1207
01:37:44,945 --> 01:37:46,606
I don't get it.

1208
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:50,205
What? No. Wait. Why?

1209
01:37:50,284 --> 01:37:53,345
Where are you goin'? Why?

1210
01:37:56,391 --> 01:38:00,089
I didn't mean it that way.
You ought to sit down.

1211
01:38:00,162 --> 01:38:03,359
You can still give me the dirty look.
just sit down and give it to me.

1212
01:38:03,432 --> 01:38:05,661
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1213
01:38:05,734 --> 01:38:08,828
I need one. Quick.

1214
01:38:08,905 --> 01:38:12,341
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1215
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:15,742
The mono-minute someone gets
that they need you...

1216
01:38:15,813 --> 01:38:17,973
they threaten to walk out.

1217
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:21,143
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1218
01:38:22,788 --> 01:38:26,518
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1219
01:38:35,736 --> 01:38:37,169
And mean it.

1220
01:38:49,018 --> 01:38:50,451
Can we order first?

1221
01:38:58,362 --> 01:39:00,886
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1222
01:39:00,964 --> 01:39:02,693
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1223
01:39:02,767 --> 01:39:04,598
Baked or fries?

1224
01:39:04,669 --> 01:39:06,102
Fries.

1225
01:39:10,476 --> 01:39:12,774
One baked, one fried.

1226
01:39:12,845 --> 01:39:15,540
I'll tell your waiter.

1227
01:39:15,614 --> 01:39:17,445
My waiter.

1228
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:23,080
Okay, now, I got a real great
compliment for you...

1229
01:39:23,156 --> 01:39:25,283
and it's true.

1230
01:39:25,358 --> 01:39:27,486
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1231
01:39:28,563 --> 01:39:31,123
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1232
01:39:32,367 --> 01:39:34,891
Okay, here I go.

1233
01:39:36,338 --> 01:39:38,499
Clearly a mistake.

1234
01:39:40,243 --> 01:39:44,612
I've got this, what, ailment?

1235
01:39:48,685 --> 01:39:52,212
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time...

1236
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:55,054
says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases...

1237
01:39:55,126 --> 01:39:57,526
a pill really helps.

1238
01:39:58,597 --> 01:40:00,030
I hate pills.

1239
01:40:00,098 --> 01:40:02,362
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1240
01:40:02,435 --> 01:40:07,237
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

1241
01:40:07,307 --> 01:40:10,275
My compliment is, that night...

1242
01:40:10,343 --> 01:40:13,801
when you came over and told me
that you would never...

1243
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:19,648
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1244
01:40:19,721 --> 01:40:22,281
Well, my compliment to you is...

1245
01:40:23,593 --> 01:40:28,155
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1246
01:40:31,835 --> 01:40:34,497
I don't quite get
how that's a compliment for me.

1247
01:40:40,178 --> 01:40:42,738
You make me want to be a better man.

1248
01:40:55,629 --> 01:40:58,689
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1249
01:41:03,905 --> 01:41:05,930
Well, maybe I overshot a little.

1250
01:41:06,007 --> 01:41:08,942
I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1251
01:41:21,425 --> 01:41:23,359
How's it goin' with those pills?

1252
01:41:24,896 --> 01:41:27,558
Good, I hope, I hope...

1253
01:41:33,205 --> 01:41:34,638
It's little by little.

1254
01:41:37,911 --> 01:41:40,846
It's exhausting talking like this.

1255
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:04,802
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1256
01:42:06,343 --> 01:42:07,435
Never.

1257
01:42:08,946 --> 01:42:11,574
Here's the trouble with "never."

1258
01:42:33,808 --> 01:42:37,073
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1259
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:42,449
When you first came in to breakfast,
when I first saw you...

1260
01:42:42,517 --> 01:42:44,007
I thought you were handsome.

1261
01:42:46,122 --> 01:42:48,056
Then, of course, you spoke.

1262
01:42:51,295 --> 01:42:54,627
So now that your...

1263
01:42:54,698 --> 01:42:56,962
soft little underbelly
is all exposed...

1264
01:42:57,035 --> 01:43:00,128
tell me, why did you
bring me here?

1265
01:43:06,612 --> 01:43:08,045
It's...

1266
01:43:11,984 --> 01:43:13,918
a personal question.

1267
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:17,388
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1268
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:19,755
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1269
01:43:21,729 --> 01:43:23,253
It's okay.

1270
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:26,266
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1271
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:30,059
Well, I...

1272
01:43:30,105 --> 01:43:33,872
I don't know.

1273
01:43:33,942 --> 01:43:36,638
There's a lot of reasons.

1274
01:43:36,713 --> 01:43:40,114
I thought... one thought...
maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1275
01:43:40,183 --> 01:43:41,844
What?

1276
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:46,683
Well, that's just one idea.

1277
01:43:46,757 --> 01:43:48,622
That's why you brought me?

1278
01:43:48,694 --> 01:43:51,491
Like I'm a what...

1279
01:43:51,563 --> 01:43:54,259
and I owe you what?

1280
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:56,766
I don't know why I brought you.

1281
01:43:56,836 --> 01:44:01,398
That was just one thought that I had.
It came out first. That's all it was.

1282
01:44:01,474 --> 01:44:03,806
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1283
01:44:03,877 --> 01:44:06,812
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1284
01:44:06,881 --> 01:44:09,076
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1285
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:11,413
Forget what I said about Simon.

1286
01:44:11,486 --> 01:44:14,422
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1287
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:17,784
It was a mistake.

1288
01:44:24,267 --> 01:44:26,598
- Hello, this is Fred Bishop,
-And Betty,

1289
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:28,934
We're sorry to be unable
to take your call right now,

1290
01:44:29,006 --> 01:44:31,372
Please leave a message
with all the pertinent information,

1291
01:44:31,442 --> 01:44:33,205
-Say good-bye,
- Good-bye,

1292
01:44:33,277 --> 01:44:35,006
Thank you,

1293
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,014
It's Simon.

1294
01:44:38,584 --> 01:44:40,518
I'm in town.

1295
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:48,786
Folks, you haven't been out later
that 1 0:00 in your entire lives.

1296
01:44:48,862 --> 01:44:51,263
Please pick up the phone.

1297
01:44:53,768 --> 01:44:55,201
Really.

1298
01:45:00,041 --> 01:45:02,066
I'll try you in the morning.

1299
01:45:02,144 --> 01:45:04,442
I need to see you...

1300
01:45:04,513 --> 01:45:07,778
or at least get you
to answer the phone.

1301
01:45:16,361 --> 01:45:19,227
How are you?

1302
01:45:19,297 --> 01:45:21,628
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1303
01:45:21,699 --> 01:45:24,793
I don't wanna see him,
and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1304
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:25,961
What happened?

1305
01:45:27,172 --> 01:45:29,107
Don't ask.

1306
01:45:31,677 --> 01:45:34,612
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1307
01:45:34,681 --> 01:45:36,979
- Do you need help...
- No!

1308
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:42,485
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1309
01:45:42,557 --> 01:45:43,750
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1310
01:45:46,128 --> 01:45:49,495
I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1311
01:45:49,565 --> 01:45:51,191
What are you thinking about?

1312
01:45:52,734 --> 01:45:54,099
How to die, mostly.

1313
01:45:56,172 --> 01:45:59,404
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1314
01:46:13,058 --> 01:46:15,549
- Good night.
- Good night.

1315
01:46:58,343 --> 01:47:00,277
Hold it.

1316
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:23,361
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1317
01:47:25,207 --> 01:47:27,004
I have to draw you.

1318
01:47:29,178 --> 01:47:31,772
Absolutely not. I'm a lot
more shy than people think.

1319
01:47:31,847 --> 01:47:33,872
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1320
01:47:33,951 --> 01:47:35,816
I haven't sketched anything
in weeks.

1321
01:47:35,887 --> 01:47:38,651
Stop staring.
Do a vase.

1322
01:47:39,957 --> 01:47:41,049
But you're beautiful.

1323
01:47:41,125 --> 01:47:43,958
Your skin, your long neck...

1324
01:47:45,396 --> 01:47:48,126
the back, the line of you.

1325
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:53,136
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1326
01:47:56,743 --> 01:47:58,233
All right. Cut me a break.

1327
01:48:21,804 --> 01:48:23,829
The next thing I know she's...

1328
01:48:23,907 --> 01:48:27,070
sitting right there next to me.

1329
01:48:27,144 --> 01:48:29,806
Well, it's not right
to go into details.

1330
01:48:29,881 --> 01:48:32,441
I got nervous.

1331
01:48:32,517 --> 01:48:35,179
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1332
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:40,816
Where if I hadn't...

1333
01:48:40,893 --> 01:48:44,329
I could be in bed right now
with a woman...

1334
01:48:44,398 --> 01:48:49,165
who if you make her laugh,
you got a life.

1335
01:48:51,706 --> 01:48:54,607
Instead, I'm here with you.

1336
01:48:54,676 --> 01:48:58,304
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1337
01:49:03,253 --> 01:49:05,187
jameson, soda back.

1338
01:49:07,724 --> 01:49:09,919
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1339
01:49:09,993 --> 01:49:14,054
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No.

1340
01:49:14,132 --> 01:49:17,329
This is great.
This is so great.

1341
01:49:17,402 --> 01:49:20,530
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up.

1342
01:49:20,605 --> 01:49:22,869
- Hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1343
01:49:22,941 --> 01:49:25,739
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1344
01:49:25,812 --> 01:49:29,578
It doesn't matter.
My hand's not even bothering me.

1345
01:49:29,649 --> 01:49:32,641
I can't... I just...

1346
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:35,745
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

1347
01:49:39,994 --> 01:49:41,928
Oh, careful.

1348
01:49:53,477 --> 01:49:56,105
Coming in. It's late.

1349
01:50:02,687 --> 01:50:04,349
Did you have sex with her?

1350
01:50:05,257 --> 01:50:07,224
You're sure you
don't want your shampoos?

1351
01:50:12,332 --> 01:50:14,823
Sorry.

1352
01:50:14,901 --> 01:50:18,029
I didn't know
she was still here.

1353
01:50:18,104 --> 01:50:21,130
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1354
01:50:21,208 --> 01:50:23,699
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1355
01:50:25,212 --> 01:50:28,670
What I need
he gave me great.

1356
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,742
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1357
01:50:36,659 --> 01:50:38,593
I just love her.

1358
01:50:44,735 --> 01:50:46,669
How are you doin'?

1359
01:51:02,556 --> 01:51:05,047
- Hello?
- Mom? Hi.

1360
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:08,651
Hello, Simon, you were right,
We were home last night,

1361
01:51:08,729 --> 01:51:10,753
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1362
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:13,526
- I'm not a screamer,
- No, no.

1363
01:51:13,601 --> 01:51:16,297
It was the luckiest thing
you didn't answer last night.

1364
01:51:16,371 --> 01:51:18,498
- your father hasn't been feeling well,
- I can't hear you.

1365
01:51:18,574 --> 01:51:21,475
- It's too late to start, Hold on,
- Hold for what?

1366
01:51:21,543 --> 01:51:23,909
What are you gonna do?
Where are you going?

1367
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:26,881
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no snap to...

1368
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:29,941
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1369
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:33,148
Truly no grudges, okay?
Truly.

1370
01:51:33,224 --> 01:51:37,490
It was odd that you didn't come see me
when you heard I was hurt, but...

1371
01:51:37,562 --> 01:51:40,997
- We almost did,
- I don't even want to talk about it.

1372
01:51:41,066 --> 01:51:44,126
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1373
01:51:44,203 --> 01:51:47,296
- you do sound different,
- Yes, I'm working again.

1374
01:51:47,373 --> 01:51:50,673
- Good, About money...
- I don't need anything.

1375
01:51:50,743 --> 01:51:53,234
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land.

1376
01:51:53,313 --> 01:51:56,339
Then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1377
01:51:56,417 --> 01:51:58,442
He's gonna want to stay.

1378
01:51:58,519 --> 01:52:02,148
They'll want to take a ride
to the lake or whatever.

1379
01:52:02,224 --> 01:52:05,250
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye, dear,

1380
01:52:05,327 --> 01:52:08,353
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1381
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:10,761
We'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1382
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:13,529
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1383
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:16,094
- and be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1384
01:52:17,007 --> 01:52:19,999
- What about your parents?
- No, I'll take care of myself.

1385
01:52:20,077 --> 01:52:23,843
What are you talking about?
You got real problems.

1386
01:52:24,783 --> 01:52:28,115
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1387
01:52:28,186 --> 01:52:32,020
Suddenly everything
seems so easy.

1388
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:35,218
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1389
01:52:37,897 --> 01:52:41,128
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1390
01:52:42,803 --> 01:52:47,035
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1391
01:52:47,107 --> 01:52:50,805
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1392
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,075
Let me see.

1393
01:52:53,149 --> 01:52:55,582
Ah. Gorgeous.

1394
01:52:55,651 --> 01:53:00,554
Do it then, and pick up the dog.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1395
01:53:00,624 --> 01:53:02,056
Good-bye.

1396
01:53:03,627 --> 01:53:05,890
Your luck's running.

1397
01:53:05,962 --> 01:53:09,558
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1398
01:53:11,569 --> 01:53:14,936
Frank's got a line on another place
you can use for now.

1399
01:53:15,007 --> 01:53:18,534
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1400
01:53:23,183 --> 01:53:25,343
It doesn't.

1401
01:53:26,253 --> 01:53:28,618
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1402
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:32,252
I'm sorry.

1403
01:53:55,754 --> 01:53:59,281
I love you

1404
01:54:02,027 --> 01:54:04,587
For sentimental reasons

1405
01:54:04,663 --> 01:54:07,223
I don't want to hear
that music right now.

1406
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:10,290
- You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1407
01:54:12,706 --> 01:54:16,108
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1408
01:54:16,176 --> 01:54:19,077
but I don't want to hear it,
if that means anything.

1409
01:54:38,836 --> 01:54:41,167
Yes, sir. All right.

1410
01:54:41,238 --> 01:54:45,504
Here's the keys
to my apartment.

1411
01:54:45,577 --> 01:54:49,946
You go up there and wait.
I'm gonna take Carol home.

1412
01:54:50,882 --> 01:54:53,373
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1413
01:54:59,993 --> 01:55:02,621
Can you come here?

1414
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:05,631
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1415
01:55:06,934 --> 01:55:09,425
I don't think
I want to know you anymore.

1416
01:55:09,504 --> 01:55:12,199
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1417
01:55:15,778 --> 01:55:17,712
You have my number.

1418
01:55:20,216 --> 01:55:22,309
Let him take you home.

1419
01:55:22,385 --> 01:55:24,320
I don't want to.

1420
01:55:25,423 --> 01:55:28,620
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1421
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,404
Don't say anything.

1422
01:55:43,376 --> 01:55:47,176
I gotta get ahold of Frank,
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1423
01:55:47,248 --> 01:55:49,579
Well...

1424
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,414
I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1425
01:55:52,486 --> 01:55:55,547
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1426
01:55:55,624 --> 01:55:56,954
Look at you!

1427
01:55:57,025 --> 01:55:59,083
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1428
01:56:05,134 --> 01:56:07,694
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1429
01:56:10,173 --> 01:56:13,199
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1430
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:20,810
They rented your place furnished.
jackie brought your personal things.

1431
01:56:20,885 --> 01:56:24,321
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room.

1432
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:26,324
I never use it.

1433
01:56:26,392 --> 01:56:29,418
It's got good light.
No other choice, really.

1434
01:56:29,495 --> 01:56:31,429
I'm coming.

1435
01:56:33,633 --> 01:56:38,127
It's nice.

1436
01:56:38,205 --> 01:56:40,298
It looks good.

1437
01:56:41,676 --> 01:56:44,611
They got your music...

1438
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:47,240
paintings, paints.

1439
01:56:47,316 --> 01:56:49,511
Have to say
they did a good job.

1440
01:56:52,822 --> 01:56:55,416
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1441
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:58,482
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1442
01:57:04,202 --> 01:57:05,293
Thank you.

1443
01:57:07,538 --> 01:57:09,028
You overwhelm me.

1444
01:57:16,115 --> 01:57:17,513
I love you.

1445
01:57:24,091 --> 01:57:26,525
I tell you, buddy.

1446
01:57:26,594 --> 01:57:30,030
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1447
01:57:42,912 --> 01:57:45,142
Make yourself at home.

1448
01:57:47,384 --> 01:57:50,751
Anything else in the bag?

1449
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:54,450
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1450
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:57,984
I love my cookbook.

1451
01:57:58,063 --> 01:58:01,430
It's great. It's got all
these wonderful recipes in here.

1452
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:05,028
It says something for shark.
I never fixed shark before.

1453
01:58:05,104 --> 01:58:08,562
"Shark With A Bite."
Would you like that, Spencer?

1454
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:11,667
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nest."

1455
01:58:14,983 --> 01:58:18,510
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1456
01:58:18,587 --> 01:58:21,078
Where is he?

1457
01:58:21,157 --> 01:58:24,558
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart.

1458
01:58:25,928 --> 01:58:28,192
Oh, you're in bed.

1459
01:58:28,264 --> 01:58:30,027
Oh, no.

1460
01:58:31,033 --> 01:58:32,694
Yeah.

1461
01:58:34,671 --> 01:58:38,971
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1462
01:58:39,043 --> 01:58:40,978
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1463
01:58:41,045 --> 01:58:43,605
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1464
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:48,883
Is this okay?

1465
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,490
It's me. Hi!

1466
01:58:55,562 --> 01:58:57,325
Yes.

1467
01:58:57,397 --> 01:59:01,128
He took me in. Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1468
01:59:01,202 --> 01:59:04,399
I practically fainted
when I walked in.

1469
01:59:04,473 --> 01:59:06,566
- Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1470
01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:10,737
-Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1471
01:59:12,414 --> 01:59:14,541
Come on. Move faster.

1472
01:59:14,618 --> 01:59:18,644
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1473
01:59:32,638 --> 01:59:35,731
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

1474
01:59:35,809 --> 01:59:40,370
- Not so hot.
- Why? What's wrong?

1475
01:59:40,447 --> 01:59:43,609
I don't know whether I'm
being sensible or hard on you.

1476
01:59:43,683 --> 01:59:45,776
Maybe both, Maybe,

1477
01:59:45,853 --> 01:59:49,983
See, right there, I don't know
whether you're being cute or crazy.

1478
01:59:50,057 --> 01:59:53,185
- Cute.
- Don't answer everything I say.

1479
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:56,719
just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1480
01:59:58,201 --> 02:00:02,466
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1481
02:00:02,538 --> 02:00:05,599
And what I said on the street...

1482
02:00:05,675 --> 02:00:08,075
that was a bad thing to say.

1483
02:00:08,145 --> 02:00:12,480
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1484
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:19,752
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1485
02:00:21,327 --> 02:00:24,558
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1486
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:27,225
And I know that it...

1487
02:00:27,301 --> 02:00:30,030
I think that it's better for me
to not have contact with you...

1488
02:00:30,102 --> 02:00:31,763
because you're not ready...

1489
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,069
and you're a pretty old guy
to not be ready...

1490
02:00:34,142 --> 02:00:36,769
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1491
02:00:36,845 --> 02:00:40,109
But there were
extraordinary kindnesses...

1492
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:42,115
that did take place.

1493
02:00:50,092 --> 02:00:51,719
Anyway, thanks for the trip.

1494
02:00:54,197 --> 02:00:56,722
Good night.

1495
02:00:56,801 --> 02:00:58,564
Okay if I say something now?

1496
02:01:03,709 --> 02:01:04,801
Go ahead.

1497
02:01:07,413 --> 02:01:09,540
I should have danced with you.

1498
02:01:14,554 --> 02:01:16,488
Good night.

1499
02:01:37,614 --> 02:01:41,482
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1500
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:56,098
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1501
02:01:56,168 --> 02:01:57,862
Extraordinary.

1502
02:01:57,937 --> 02:02:01,304
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1503
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,244
I'm dying here.

1504
02:02:07,481 --> 02:02:09,745
Because...

1505
02:02:09,817 --> 02:02:11,909
you love her.

1506
02:02:13,587 --> 02:02:16,954
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1507
02:02:17,025 --> 02:02:19,994
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1508
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:22,522
I don't know.

1509
02:02:22,598 --> 02:02:25,362
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1510
02:02:25,435 --> 02:02:28,802
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1511
02:02:30,975 --> 02:02:33,603
I'm stuck.

1512
02:02:33,677 --> 02:02:36,976
I can't get back
to my old life.

1513
02:02:39,217 --> 02:02:41,412
She's evicted me from my life.

1514
02:02:41,487 --> 02:02:43,421
Did you really like it that much?

1515
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:46,151
Well, it's better than this.

1516
02:02:46,225 --> 02:02:49,058
Look, you,
I'm very intelligent.

1517
02:02:49,129 --> 02:02:52,098
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1518
02:02:52,165 --> 02:02:56,192
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up.

1519
02:02:56,269 --> 02:03:00,400
I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1520
02:03:00,476 --> 02:03:01,999
Picking on me won't help.

1521
02:03:04,613 --> 02:03:06,911
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1522
02:03:10,286 --> 02:03:12,880
Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1523
02:03:17,428 --> 02:03:19,055
You know who you want.

1524
02:03:21,432 --> 02:03:24,458
I would take your seat
any day.

1525
02:03:24,536 --> 02:03:26,697
So do something about it.

1526
02:03:26,772 --> 02:03:29,434
Go over there now, tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1527
02:03:29,509 --> 02:03:33,001
It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1528
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:35,980
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1529
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:39,451
Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel.

1530
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,286
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1531
02:03:43,357 --> 02:03:46,724
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1532
02:03:46,795 --> 02:03:49,696
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1533
02:03:49,765 --> 02:03:51,823
I really think
you have a chance here.

1534
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:55,770
The best thing you have going for you
is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1535
02:03:55,838 --> 02:03:59,240
So go over there, do this.
Catch her off guard.

1536
02:04:04,848 --> 02:04:06,783
- Okay.
- Okay.

1537
02:04:09,287 --> 02:04:11,721
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1538
02:04:13,725 --> 02:04:15,659
Here I go.

1539
02:04:24,505 --> 02:04:26,268
What's wrong?

1540
02:04:29,844 --> 02:04:31,539
I forgot to lock the door.

1541
02:05:50,702 --> 02:05:52,636
What do you want, Melvin?

1542
02:05:53,773 --> 02:05:56,799
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1543
02:06:01,749 --> 02:06:03,545
What a break.

1544
02:06:05,753 --> 02:06:08,586
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1545
02:06:12,027 --> 02:06:13,459
I had to see you.

1546
02:06:17,701 --> 02:06:18,793
Because?

1547
02:06:22,405 --> 02:06:25,169
It relaxes me.

1548
02:06:26,911 --> 02:06:31,109
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1549
02:06:31,182 --> 02:06:32,444
than any other place...

1550
02:06:32,517 --> 02:06:35,849
I can think of or imagine.

1551
02:06:35,921 --> 02:06:38,651
No, wait.
That's overstating.

1552
02:06:38,724 --> 02:06:42,422
I'd rather be sitting inside
on the steps...

1553
02:06:42,495 --> 02:06:44,689
'cause I don't want to
get my feet in the gutter.

1554
02:06:44,765 --> 02:06:46,322
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1555
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:49,995
Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1556
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:53,733
just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1557
02:06:53,808 --> 02:06:57,869
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1558
02:07:01,083 --> 02:07:04,177
Oh, I'm sorry.

1559
02:07:04,253 --> 02:07:07,188
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1560
02:07:12,697 --> 02:07:14,220
Boyfriend.

1561
02:07:18,536 --> 02:07:22,870
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1562
02:07:24,209 --> 02:07:27,076
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1563
02:07:31,718 --> 02:07:33,652
Maybe we could.

1564
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:03,386
It feels a little confined in here.

1565
02:08:03,455 --> 02:08:05,547
Let's take a walk.

1566
02:08:08,361 --> 02:08:10,885
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1567
02:08:10,962 --> 02:08:14,523
A walk sounds
a little screwy to me...

1568
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,090
if you don't mind.

1569
02:08:16,168 --> 02:08:20,605
Well, if you need an excuse...

1570
02:08:20,674 --> 02:08:24,440
there's a bakery on the corner
that will be open soon.

1571
02:08:24,511 --> 02:08:27,002
That way we're not screwy.

1572
02:08:27,048 --> 02:08:31,041
just two people
that like warm rolls.

1573
02:08:35,324 --> 02:08:36,757
Okay.

1574
02:08:55,147 --> 02:08:57,479
What are you doing?

1575
02:08:57,549 --> 02:09:00,485
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1576
02:09:00,552 --> 02:09:02,487
You don't have to...

1577
02:09:09,096 --> 02:09:11,360
And darlin'

1578
02:09:11,432 --> 02:09:14,526
I'm never lonely

1579
02:09:14,602 --> 02:09:18,594
Whenever you're in sight

1580
02:09:18,674 --> 02:09:20,608
Thank you.

1581
02:09:22,044 --> 02:09:23,978
You know, I was hoping...

1582
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:43,231
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1583
02:09:52,579 --> 02:09:55,309
- I'm feel...
- What?

1584
02:09:57,384 --> 02:09:59,818
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1585
02:10:01,121 --> 02:10:04,649
Even though
it may seem that way now...

1586
02:10:04,726 --> 02:10:07,820
you don't know me all that well.

1587
02:10:07,897 --> 02:10:09,387
I'm not the answer for you.

1588
02:10:09,465 --> 02:10:13,196
Hey, I've got
a great compliment for you.

1589
02:10:14,737 --> 02:10:18,036
- You know what?
-Just let me...

1590
02:10:18,108 --> 02:10:20,042
Let me talk.

1591
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:29,781
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1592
02:10:29,854 --> 02:10:32,379
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1593
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:36,394
I might be the only one
who appreciates...

1594
02:10:36,463 --> 02:10:41,093
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do...

1595
02:10:41,168 --> 02:10:44,068
and how you are with Spencer.

1596
02:10:44,137 --> 02:10:45,399
Spence.

1597
02:10:46,574 --> 02:10:50,408
In every single thought you have
and how you say what you mean...

1598
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:53,039
and how you almost always
mean something...

1599
02:10:53,115 --> 02:10:57,711
that's all about
being straight and good.

1600
02:11:00,189 --> 02:11:02,713
I think most people
miss that about you.

1601
02:11:02,792 --> 02:11:04,920
I wonder how they
can watch you...

1602
02:11:04,995 --> 02:11:07,986
bring their food
and clear their tables...

1603
02:11:08,065 --> 02:11:11,728
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1604
02:11:12,904 --> 02:11:15,098
And the fact that I get it...

1605
02:11:15,174 --> 02:11:17,108
makes me feel good...

1606
02:11:18,977 --> 02:11:20,501
about me.

1607
02:11:29,523 --> 02:11:32,288
Is that something that's...

1608
02:11:32,359 --> 02:11:34,793
bad for you to be around
for you?

1609
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:51,442
I'm gonna grab ya.

1610
02:11:53,317 --> 02:11:56,150
I didn't mean for that
to be a question.

1611
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:58,154
I'm gonna grab ya.

1612
02:12:21,715 --> 02:12:23,683
I know I can do better than that.

1613
02:12:48,012 --> 02:12:50,344
Better.
Definitely better.

1614
02:12:56,089 --> 02:12:57,182
See?

1615
02:13:15,131 --> 02:13:17,008
Warm rolls.

1616
02:13:26,369 --> 02:13:28,246
- Excuse us.
