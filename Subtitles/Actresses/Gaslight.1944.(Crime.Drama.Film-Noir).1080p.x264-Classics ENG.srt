1
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,280
Stand back.

2
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,814
No, Paula. Don't look back.

3
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,655
You've got to forget everything
that's happened here.

4
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,993
That's why you're going to Italy,
to <i>Signor</i> Guardi.

5
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:45,531
He was the best friend your aunt ever had,
and he'll be yours, too.

6
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,706
Perhaps <i>Signor</i> Guardi will make you
into a great singer, as she was.

7
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,671
Wouldn't you like that?

8
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,175
<i>You must think of the future, dear,
not the past.</i>

9
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,370
No. Now, look. Wait a moment, <i>signorina.</i>

10
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:33,748
There's no use.
Paula, you are not concentrating.

11
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,964
Your mind's not on your singing.

12
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,263
<i>All these years you've worked so hard.
Now what's come over you?</i>

13
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:45,176
This opera is tragedy, <i>signorina.</i>
You seem incapable of understanding.

14
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,725
Did you never hear your aunt sing Lucia?

15
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,889
You look like her.

16
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,817
But I don't sing like her. I know.

17
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,069
<i>Signor</i> Guardi,
may I speak to you seriously?

18
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,403
- Very seriously.
- Maestro.

19
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,121
It is 10 minutes to the hour.

20
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,994
If you're not continuing the lesson,
I'd like to be excused.

21
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,165
- Very well, <i>Signor</i> Anton.
- Thank you. Good afternoon, <i>signorina.</i>

22
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,424
Now, what is it you wish
to say to me seriously?

23
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,760
"Very seriously."

24
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>Signor</i> Guardi, I've tried.
I've worked hard, but it's no use.

25
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:30,432
- I haven't the voice, have I?
- The trouble is not in your voice alone.

26
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,977
Your heart is not in your singing anymore.

27
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:38,066
Each time you come here now,
you look happier and you sing worse.

28
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:43,199
Tell me, Paula, you're in love?

29
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,993
Yes.

30
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,207
Yes. It's something
that has never happened to me before...

31
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:58,420
something I never expected
would happen...

32
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,586
but suddenly
it is as if nothing else existed...

33
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,763
even my music,
which used to mean so much to me.

34
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:12,056
Yes, you are right. My thoughts
were wandering while singing just now.

35
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,106
I'm too happy. That's why you said...

36
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,647
the tragedy was something
I could never understand.

37
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:20,187
I'm sorry.
It was cruel of me to say that...

38
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,192
cruel and untrue.

39
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,607
Real tragedy has touched your life...

40
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,739
and very deeply.

41
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,199
<i>But now there is a chance
to forget tragedy, my child.</i>

42
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,791
<i>Take it. Free yourself from the past...</i>

43
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:39,957
<i>and forget your singing, too, for a while.
Happiness is better than art.</i>

44
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,338
Dear Maestro, no one has ever been
as kind to me as you have since she died.

45
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,429
Will you let me meet the man
who is taking my pupil away from me?

46
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,469
Yes, of course.

47
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,729
You have a rendezvous with him.

48
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,813
The moment your lesson is over,
you fly to him.

49
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:04,281
Is he jealous of your music,
these hours you spend away from him?

50
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,570
Dear Maestro...

51
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,320
I don't know when we'll meet again.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,330
Thank you.

53
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,131
Paula.

54
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,651
- Did you tell him?
- He told me. He didn't know who.

55
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,694
- What did he say?
- He said I should take my happiness.

56
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:52,032
And will you? Now?
Why do you still hesitate, Paula?

57
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:55,745
But I don't know you.
I don't know anything about you.

58
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:58,207
Nor I about you, but I want to marry you.

59
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:01,546
- Are you afraid?
- I think I am, a little.

60
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,755
- Of me?
- No.

61
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,381
No, never, but of happiness.

62
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,677
I haven't had a lot,
and I feel I can't trust it.

63
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,006
You must give me time
to get used to the idea.

64
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,350
You shall have all the time you want.
I've waited for you so long.

65
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:17,141
Waited? We've only known
each other two weeks.

66
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,980
I've waited all my life till now.
I can wait a little longer.

67
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:25,196
But it will not be easy to wait,
to be patient, seeing you every day.

68
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,862
No, it won't be easy for me, either.

69
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,367
- I should go away.
- Go away?

70
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,702
By myself for a week, only a week...

71
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,709
just to know what I'm doing,
just to be sure.

72
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:44,124
- Where will you go?
- I thought perhaps to the Lakes.

73
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,755
- And when will you go?
- I thought tomorrow.

74
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,967
- Tomorrow?
- Is that too soon?

75
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:53,015
No, the sooner you go,
the sooner you will come back.

76
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,015
But while you're away, never forget
for one moment I'm here waiting...

77
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,561
and in love with you.

78
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,322
My dearest.

79
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:32,220
Oh, my goodness! Good gracious!

80
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,092
- So exciting.
- The book?

81
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:40,396
Yes. It's about a girl who marries a man,
and what do you think?

82
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,810
- He's got six wives buried in the cellar.
- That seems a lot.

83
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:49,149
Yes, and I'm only on Page 200,
so I'm sure there's still more to come.

84
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:52,526
- It's a wonderful book.
- It sounds a little gruesome.

85
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,868
Yes. I'm afraid I enjoy a good murder
now and then.

86
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:59,455
My brother always calls me
"Bloodthirsty Bessie."

87
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,618
- Have a biscuit, dear.
- Thanks.

88
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,665
Digestive biscuits.
Unpleasant name, isn't it?

89
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,294
I always call them "diggy biscuits."

90
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>I never travel without them.</i>

91
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,382
You're not English, are you?

92
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,503
No.

93
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,720
I was brought up there.
My aunt lived in London.

94
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:19,509
- Are you on your way there now?
- No. I'm going to Lake Como.

95
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,981
- All by yourself?
- Yes, all by myself.

96
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:27,350
- But is that wise?
- I don't think any harm will come to me.

97
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,405
I'm going to London.
I must be in London for the spring.

98
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,360
The crocuses, you know,
and the daffodils and the tulips.

99
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,443
The gardens are so beautiful in the spring.

100
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:39,747
I say "good morning" to my flowers
in Thornton Square every day.

101
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:43,208
- Thornton Square?
- Where I live, Number 16.

102
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:44,836
<i>Do you know it?</i>

103
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:50,123
- I know Thornton Square.
- Do you know anyone living there?

104
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,969
- I used to. Not anymore.
- I wonder who that could be.

105
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,461
I know almost everyone
who lives there now.

106
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,890
We're all so very friendly,
popping in and out of each other's houses.

107
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:03,353
- What number did your friends live at?
- I'm afraid I don't remember.

108
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:06,938
You know, we had a real,
live murder there.

109
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:09,943
Yes, I'd heard of it.

110
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:14,609
Unfortunately, it's before I went
to live there, just a year before.

111
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:19,611
Ten years ago, at Number 9,
a famous singer called Alice Alquist.

112
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,162
- Have another biscuit, dear.
- No, thank you.

113
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:26,164
It was a most mysterious case.
They never found out who killed her.

114
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,460
They never even found a motive.

115
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,623
I've tried to get in the house many a time.

116
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:34,631
I think it's so exciting. Don't you?
I mean, just to see.

117
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,179
It's just as it used to be.

118
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,674
Nothing's been changed...

119
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:41,976
- all the furniture and everything--
- I think we're getting into Como.

120
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,556
So we are.

121
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:46,264
- Is anyone meeting you?
- No.

122
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,526
- You will be careful, won't you?
- I will. Goodbye.

123
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,101
Goodbye. Come and see me
if you're ever in London.

124
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,070
My name's Miss Thwaites.

125
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:57,358
I'll point out the window
of the room where it happened.

126
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,942
You can see it
from my drawing room.

127
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,210
- You're not angry with me?
- Angry?

128
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:10,712
If you hadn't come,
I should have sent for you.

129
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,300
Well!

130
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,252
Come and look at the morning.

131
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:19,780
Aren't you cold like this?
What were you dreaming of?

132
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,286
- Our life together.
- And how do you see it?

133
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,247
I saw all the places
where we'll be together.

134
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,792
Lovely places like this.

135
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,494
I was thinking of our life together, too,
only I heard it in music.

136
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:35,459
- Something that I want to write.
- Yes, what?

137
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:40,425
The whole thing is alive with happiness.
I want a feeling of the early morning.

138
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:43,090
- This morning.
- Yes.

139
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:47,300
With the sun rising,
lighting your hair as it is now.

140
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:52,934
I don't know how it ends.
Perhaps it never ends until I do.

141
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,946
- When will you start on it?
- Some day...

142
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,660
after we've had our honeymoon...

143
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,404
and settled down
in a home of our own somewhere.

144
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,287
- Where?
- Where would you like us to settle?

145
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,120
- I haven't thought. Paris, perhaps.
- Paris?

146
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:21,631
Or Rome?
How would you feel about London?

147
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,004
London?

148
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:35,347
Paula, if you won't laugh at me,
I'd like to tell you something.

149
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,316
I won't laugh at you. What is it?

150
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,523
It's an idea, a silly idea
that's been with me for years.

151
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,817
I was in London once in the winter.

152
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,452
It seemed there was no city
in the world...

153
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,912
that was colder to the homeless...

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,251
or that could be warmer
to the ones who had a home.

155
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,709
How I used to long
for a home of my own...

156
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,673
in one of those quiet houses
in the little London squares...

157
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,679
with the woman
I should one day come to love.

158
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:10,470
Could we settle down in London?
Not in a house in a square, perhaps....

159
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,557
Paula, why do you look like that?

160
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:21,812
- Because there is a house in a square.
- What house?

161
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,525
9, Thornton Square.

162
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,236
- She left it to me.
- She?

163
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,367
You mean Alice Alquist?

164
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:38,295
She was my mother's sister.
My mother died when I was born.

165
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,044
I don't know anything about her
or my father.

166
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,551
I lived with my aunt always
as if I were her own.

167
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,715
After it happened I never went back.

168
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,938
That house
comes into my dreams sometimes...

169
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,651
a house of horror.

170
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,901
It's strange.

171
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,284
I haven't dreamed of it
since I've known you.

172
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:13,163
I haven't been afraid since I've known you.

173
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,871
- Afraid?
- Yes.

174
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,411
For years I've been afraid
of something nameless...

175
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,916
ever since she died.

176
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,584
You've cast out fear for me.

177
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,835
If it were true,
it would make me very happy.

178
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:30,678
It is true. I've found peace in loving you.

179
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:36,810
- I could even face that house with you.
- No, Paula, beloved.

180
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:40,266
- I would not ask that of you.
- Yes, you shall have your dream.

181
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,981
You shall have your house in a square.

182
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,736
Good morning, daffodils.
Good morning, tulips.

183
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,787
Percy! There it is, dear.

184
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,366
Good....

185
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,092
What are you doing, my good man?

186
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,003
Turning on the water
in Number 9, ma'am.

187
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:10,302
Nine? Why nine?

188
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,883
Orders, ma'am.

189
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:16,425
It must be going to be occupied at last,
after all these years.

190
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,226
Wouldn't care to live in there, myself.

191
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:23,609
I don't know about living there,
but I would like to get a peep inside.

192
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,827
- Good morning.
- Morning.

193
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,586
- Are we late?
- Not at all. I've only been here a moment.

194
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,339
- Good morning, Mr. Anton.
- Good morning.

195
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,801
It's you. Don't you remember me?

196
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,673
In the train in Italy last month.
Diggy biscuits.

197
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,507
Yes, of course, I do.

198
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:57,018
Don't tell me
you're coming to live in Number 9?

199
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,520
Yes.

200
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,807
We mustn't keep
Mr. Mufflin waiting.

201
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:05,648
- Sorry, I must go now. Perhaps we can--
- I'll call directly you're settled.

202
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,310
That's my house over there,
with the pink curtains.

203
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,363
Goodbye, for the present.

204
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:13,656
Goodbye. I'm so glad
we are to be neighbors.

205
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:14,942
So am I.

206
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,990
This lock needs oiling.

207
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,999
If there's anything further I can do,
let me hear from you. Good day.

208
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,330
- Good day.
- Good day, Mr. Anton.

209
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,504
Now, Paula....

210
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,740
- This is the dining room?
- Yes.

211
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,028
There's a little study beyond it.

212
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,371
- And the drawing room is upstairs?
- Yes.

213
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,682
Come, Paula.
Don't stand there in the doorway.

214
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,517
Will you light the gas, please?

215
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:51,706
- Gregory.
- It's a very handsome room.

216
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,718
Yes, but to see it like this....

217
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,513
I remember parties in this room
when it was full of flowers and light.

218
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,174
Those must have
been wonderful days.

219
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:05,180
It's all dead in here.

220
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:08,983
<i>The whole place seems to smell of death.</i>

221
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:12,486
There. It will all be fresh again
in a moment.

222
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,070
That's where she kept her treasures.

223
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,450
Things she collected
on her tours around the world.

224
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,623
- The glass is broken.
- It was broken that night.

225
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,748
All the things were disarranged,
but there was nothing missing.

226
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,628
I know all these by heart.

227
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,214
It was a great treat
when she'd unlock them...

228
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,543
and take them out
and tell me all their stories.

229
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:37,643
Careful, dearest.

230
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:40,279
She wore this glove
in <i>Romeo and Juliet...</i>

231
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,220
at the command performance
at Covent Garden.

232
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,643
<i>Gounod signed it for her afterwards.</i>

233
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,770
I never knew what happened
to the other glove.

234
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,056
I used to ask her sometimes...

235
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,606
but she'd only laugh
and say she'd given it away.

236
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:55,862
A very great admirer.
She would never tell me who.

237
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:58,024
I wish I could have seen her.

238
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,777
Let me show her to you.

239
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,458
That's as the Empress Theodora.

240
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,171
<i>That was her greatest role.</i>

241
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,431
When she sang it in St. Petersburg...

242
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,138
the Czar used to come
to every performance.

243
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:28,561
She was very beautiful,
very much like you.

244
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:34,977
It was there that I found her,
there in front of the fire...

245
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,981
under her own portrait.

246
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:42,900
I was in bed, and something woke me.
I've never known what.

247
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:45,570
I came running down the stairs...

248
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,286
frightened, as if I knew
what had happened.

249
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,001
<i>She had been strangled.</i>

250
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:01,626
She had been strangled.
Her lovely face was all....

251
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:06,597
No!

252
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:08,512
No, I can't stay here.

253
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,689
Then how would it be if we took away
all these things that remind you so of her?

254
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:25,327
The painting, all this furniture.
Shut it away so you can't even see it?

255
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:28,698
Suppose we make it a new house
with new things, beautiful things...

256
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,369
for a new, beautiful life for us.

257
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,243
Yes, and then later,
we'll have people here and parties again.

258
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:41,795
- Don't you want to?
- Later, yes, but not just at once.

259
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,715
Let us have our honeymoon here
by ourselves for a little longer.

260
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,682
- Yes. I only--
- I know.

261
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:50,516
Later.

262
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,060
Now, where should we put
all these things?

263
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,144
There is an attic under the roof.

264
00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:59,644
All her trunks are up there
and all her costumes.

265
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:03,024
Then we'll put all these there, too,
and then we'll board it up...

266
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:06,901
so you'll never have to see it again,
never even think of it.

267
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:10,697
That piano traveled with her everywhere
in the great days.

268
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:16,368
It will need tuning terribly.
Look, here's some of her music.

269
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:19,206
Her score of <i>Theodora</i>, just as she left it.

270
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,376
We'll send those upstairs
with all the rest.

271
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:24,470
No, not her music.
Perhaps later I might like to study again.

272
00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:27,390
I'd like to have her scores to study from.

273
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:32,385
- What makes you play that?
- Why not?

274
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:34,640
That was her great song.

275
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:37,934
She always used it in her concerts
for her last encore.

276
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:40,150
It was everybody's favorite.

277
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,870
Here's an old letter.

278
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:55,034
"Dear Miss Alquist,
I beg of you to see me just once more.

279
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,416
<i>"I have followed you to London."</i>

280
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,085
It was written two days
before she was murdered.

281
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:03,424
Where did you find that?

282
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,486
In this score.
She must have left it there.

283
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:08,591
It was written by somebody
called Sergis Bauer.

284
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,260
Give it to me!

285
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,599
- Gregory, what is it?
- I'm sorry....

286
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,854
I didn't mean to be so violent.

287
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,728
It's just that....

288
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:23,943
Why does this letter upset you so?

289
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,859
It's not the letter.
It's just that I am upset for you.

290
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:32,076
All these things are reminding you of her.

291
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:35,913
You said that you had lost your fears,
and now everything you touch here...

292
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,160
brings them back.

293
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:42,414
While you are afraid of anything,
there cannot be any happiness for us.

294
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:44,299
<i>You must forget her.</i>

295
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,261
No, not her.

296
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:50,011
Only what happened to her.

297
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:02,151
Elizabeth!
I say! Elizabeth!

298
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,229
- Good afternoon, Elizabeth.
- It's you, miss.

299
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:07,652
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

300
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,363
- The house is looking very nice now.
- What's that, miss?

301
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:13,121
I said, the house looks very nice now...

302
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,830
- from the outside.
- Yes, miss.

303
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:18,000
I expect you're glad
you got rid of the workmen at last.

304
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,034
Yes, miss.

305
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:23,173
Do you think that Mr. and Mrs. Anton
will be ready to receive callers soon?

306
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:26,708
I couldn't say, miss, I'm sure.
We haven't had no visitors yet.

307
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,720
Master says seeing people
isn't good for her.

308
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,677
She hasn't been feeling too well lately.

309
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,637
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- What's that, miss?

310
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:39,144
I said, this fine summer weather
we're having ought to do her good.

311
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,769
Yes, miss.
They're going out this afternoon.

312
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,768
First time for some while. Good day, miss.

313
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,566
Good day.
What lovely-looking strawberries.

314
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:50,404
I never get big ones like that.
I think I'll just taste one for luck.

315
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:51,987
Good afternoon.

316
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,153
If you have your bags,
you can start immediately.

317
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:59,617
- Thank you. They're downstairs, sir.
- Everything's arranged.

318
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,662
Your wages will be £16 a year.

319
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:04,313
Yes, sir.
I understand all right, sir.

320
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,662
Just one more thing...

321
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:09,590
I don't want you to bother your mistress
about anything, ever.

322
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,337
If you have any questions,
just come to me.

323
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,676
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,182
That'll suit me, sir.

325
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:19,680
Then you'll remember it.
Your predecessor did not.

326
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:22,516
That's why she left.

327
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:25,856
It may seem a little unusual...

328
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:30,690
but your mistress is inclined
to be rather highly strung.

329
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:33,652
Elizabeth, come in.

330
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:37,077
This is Elizabeth, the cook.

331
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,406
- Hello.
- She's a little deaf.

332
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,702
- Hello.
- Elizabeth, this is our new housemaid.

333
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:45,963
I was explaining her duties to her.
She'll be down in a moment.

334
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,716
Very good, sir. I'll see you downstairs.

335
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:55,136
- She's a tartar, ain't she?
- What do you mean by that?

336
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:57,181
You know, strict-like.

337
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:01,473
I'm not gonna sleep
in the same room with her.

338
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:03,521
You see the way she looked at me?

339
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:07,985
Don't you think perhaps your costume
might have something to do with it?

340
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:14,031
- What's the matter with it?
- It's a little, shall we say, loud?

341
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,736
- I hope you're not a flighty girl, Lucy.
- My name's Nancy, sir.

342
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,246
I'm sorry, Nancy. Are you?

343
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,753
- I don't think so, sir.
- I'm glad to hear that.

344
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:28,917
Your mistress is very particular
about everything being very correct.

345
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,632
- Is she, sir?
- Yes.

346
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,636
So am I.

347
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:35,670
Oh, Paula.

348
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,433
<i>This is our new housemaid.</i>

349
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:48,098
- How do you do?
- I'm all right, ma'am.

350
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:51,107
- You can go now, Nancy.
- Very good, sir.

351
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:55,820
She seems a nice girl.

352
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:57,867
I'm glad.
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

353
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:01,239
- I had to go back for the guidebook.
- You look like a summer's day.

354
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:04,617
Because I'm happy. We're going out,
and I'm going to show you London.

355
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,332
- Do you know what day today is?
- Yes.

356
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,915
Three months ago today...

357
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:12,707
we came out of that little church
by the lake, man and wife.

358
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,836
I have a present for you, Paula.

359
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:17,847
Oh, Gregory.

360
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:22,224
Where did you find anything so beautiful?

361
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,229
It belonged to my mother,
and before that to her mother...

362
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,939
and now it belongs to you.

363
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,933
I shall wear it always.

364
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:32,018
Always, my dear.

365
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:37,106
How sweet of you to give me this.

366
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:41,742
I'm afraid the pin is not very strong.

367
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,788
- No.
- I'll have it mended.

368
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:46,616
You better not wear it until I have.

369
00:27:47,377 --> 00:27:50,663
You might lose it.
You know, you are inclined to lose things.

370
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:54,457
- I am? I didn't realize that.
- Just little things.

371
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,632
I'll put it in your bag for safekeeping.

372
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:00,886
There.

373
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,218
<i>Now, you'll remember where it is.</i>

374
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,270
Don't be silly. Of course I'll remember.

375
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,645
I was teasing you, my dear.

376
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:13,851
Look.

377
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,993
- That's London.
- It's music.

378
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,366
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, ma'am.

379
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,618
<i>It's nice to see you getting out again.</i>

380
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,870
- Where to, ma'am?
- The Tower of London.

381
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:34,835
Very good, ma'am.
The Tower of London it is.

382
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:45,350
What's the matter with the mistress?
She don't look ill to me. Is she?

383
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,146
I don't know. Not as I can see.

384
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,894
But the master keeps telling her she is.

385
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:56,189
Here we have
the ax of the headsman...

386
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,237
<i>and the execution block.</i>

387
00:28:58,865 --> 00:29:03,160
These are the originals with which
such historic persons as Lady Jane Grey...

388
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:07,113
and Queen Catherine Howard
was beheaded within these precincts.

389
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,912
The victim, kneeling,
laid his head upon the block...

390
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,410
fitted his neck into the small,
hollowed-out space...

391
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:15,624
designed to receive it,
whereupon the ax descended...

392
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:18,801
severing the head
from the torso with one blow...

393
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:21,044
or in unlucky cases, two.

394
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:24,384
<i>Moving to our right,
we have a model of the famous rack...</i>

395
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:27,559
<i>the instrument of torture
upon which prisoners were stretched...</i>

396
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:30,266
<i>their limbs being frequently torn
from their sockets...</i>

397
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:34,188
<i>in an effort to extract
a confession from them, true or false.</i>

398
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:49,203
- Oh, Paula.
- Yes.

399
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:53,749
There you are.
I wondered what had become of you.

400
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:57,420
It was so close in there.
Let's go out into the sunshine.

401
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:13,138
- Are we going to see the torture chamber?
- Certainly. I think it's right over here.

402
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:28,660
Uncle Brian, what's the matter?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

403
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:33,291
- That's exactly what I thought I'd seen.
- There's no such thing as a ghost.

404
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:37,291
I know. I meant I just thought
I saw someone I know is dead.

405
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:40,753
I have no idea who he is.
He seemed to know me and--

406
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,919
Do you usually bow
to people you don't know?

407
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:44,839
No. I supposed I'd met him somewhere.

408
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,216
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Of course. Why should I lie?

409
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,642
- I don't know who he is.
- Yet you smiled at him. Why?

410
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:55,313
I tell you, I wasn't thinking.
I don't know why I did it.

411
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,273
Like the other things.

412
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,945
- What other things?
- Nothing.

413
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,782
Only I've been noticing, Paula, that...

414
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:08,451
- you've been forgetful lately.
- Forgetful?

415
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:11,580
Losing things and....

416
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,782
Don't look so worried, Paula.
It's nothing.

417
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,009
You get tired and--

418
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,401
Yes, that's probably what it is.
I get tired.

419
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:23,130
- I'm tired now. Can't we go home?
- No, we still have the crown jewels to see.

420
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:27,133
- They're in that building over there.
- How do you know?

421
00:31:27,472 --> 00:31:28,469
What did you say?

422
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:31,677
How do you know where they are?
You haven't been here before.

423
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:34,468
The guide told us inside.

424
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:39,980
Are you becoming suspicious
as well as absent-minded, Paula?

425
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:42,776
No, of course not, Gregory.

426
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:57,001
The Kohinoor
or "Mountain of Light."

427
00:31:57,544 --> 00:32:00,166
<i>It's the most famous diamond
in the world.</i>

428
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:02,420
"The imperial state crown...

429
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:04,465
- That's that one.
- Yes, I know.

430
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:07,469
<i>"... was made for the coronation
of Queen Victoria.</i>

431
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:12,347
"Among the jewels it contains
are the ruby of the Black Prince...

432
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,225
"the size of a hen's egg,
the Stuart sapphire...

433
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:18,059
"which was among the jewels...

434
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:21,150
"James Il took with him
when he fled to France...

435
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:26,486
"and the diamonds and pearls
from the earrings of Queen Elizabeth."

436
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:31,652
Jewels are wonderful things.

437
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:35,202
They have a life of their own.

438
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,242
Gregory, can't we go home now?

439
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,421
Of course, my dear. I'll take you home.

440
00:32:57,312 --> 00:33:00,314
That's the mistress's room.
That's the master's.

441
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,234
We've got all this to see to.
Have you got the sheets there?

442
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:05,774
<i>I could have sworn
that there were more than that, but--</i>

443
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:08,698
- What's up there?
- Never mind about up there.

444
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:11,570
- The whole floor's been boarded off.
- Why?

445
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,366
That's the way the master wanted it.

446
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,496
You were right.

447
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:22,253
<i>There is nothing more beautiful
than London in sunshine.</i>

448
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:25,873
I'm sorry I spoiled the day
by bringing you home so soon.

449
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:30,010
You should lie down
and rest for a little, Paula.

450
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,384
Should I stay with you
and not go out this evening?

451
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:34,631
No. You go and work as usual.

452
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,177
Can you really work
in that room you rented?

453
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:39,595
I wish you'd let me see it
and make it attractive.

454
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,773
I never notice my surroundings
when I'm working.

455
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:46,601
Oh, Paula.

456
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,904
You might give me your broach
so I can have it repaired.

457
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,442
What's the matter? Anything wrong?

458
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:56,360
No.

459
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,078
<i>I can't find it.</i>

460
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:03,958
What?

461
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:08,591
I missed it
when we were in the Tower.

462
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,593
I must turn everything out.

463
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:22,305
<i>I know it was here. I can't understand it.</i>

464
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:25,686
<i>I couldn't have lost it.
It must be here.</i>

465
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:27,609
I'm sure it's there.

466
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:30,227
It's not.

467
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:35,778
Paula, didn't I tell you?
How did you come to lose it?

468
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,829
I must have pulled it out
with something, I suppose.

469
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,002
- I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.
- Forgive, my dear?

470
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:48,503
It's not as serious as that.
It's not valuable.

471
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:54,382
Your present to me, your mother's broach.
I wanted to wear it always.

472
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:59,758
I don't remember opening my bag.
I suppose I must have.

473
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,845
You did put it in there?

474
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,519
Don't you even remember that?

475
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,519
Yes, of course I do.

476
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:13,819
But suddenly, I am beginning
not to trust my memory at all.

477
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:15,648
Paula.

478
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,995
I tell you, you're just tired, that's all.

479
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,072
It doesn't mean anything.
I'm sure it doesn't.

480
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:27,667
Don't worry so, Paula. Don't worry.

481
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:42,677
- Has the master left?
- Yes, ma'am. A little while ago.

482
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:45,771
Please see that he has plenty of coal
on the fire in his room.

483
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,979
You already told me that, ma'am.

484
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:03,498
Nancy, did you turn
the gas up in there?

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,081
Turn it up? No, why?

486
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:09,122
I thought it went down in here,
as if you had.

487
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:12,505
- I never touched it.
- But this went down.

488
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,845
Perhaps Elizabeth
lit another jet in the kitchen.

489
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:20,421
Couldn't have been her.
She's been in bed for an hour.

490
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,509
I could hear her snoring.

491
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:25,097
That's odd.

492
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:31,020
- Good night, Nancy.
- Good night, ma'am.

493
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:04,262
- Yes, that's it.
- I beg your pardon?

494
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,925
I said, "That's it.
" That's the Alquist house.

495
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,052
Oh, yes.

496
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:12,891
It happened in the drawing room, upstairs.
That window.

497
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:16,735
I live just across the square.
My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites.

498
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:18,614
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

499
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:21,534
Perhaps you could tell me,
has the house been occupied long?

500
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:24,406
About four or five months now.
Come along.

501
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:28,331
You don't happen to know
who's living in the house, do you?

502
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:32,581
Yes. A foreign couple. Anton's the name.
Something mysterious there.

503
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:36,043
- What do you mean, mysterious?
- Never have visitors...

504
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:39,087
never go out anywhere.
At least, she doesn't.

505
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,881
I think you're wrong.

506
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,257
There aren't as many as usual here today.
Come along, pigeons.

507
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,592
Come along, sparrows. What did you say?

508
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:50,019
You seem to be wrong
about her not going out.

509
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,615
How very surprising.

510
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:12,876
It's you, ma'am.
I never knew you'd gone out.

511
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:15,792
I went for a walk,
but it looks as if it might rain...

512
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,083
- so I thought I should have my umbrella.
- Of course, ma'am.

513
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:25,388
Suppose the master comes back
and asks where you've gone?

514
00:38:25,473 --> 00:38:28,890
- Tell him I just went for a walk.
- By yourself, ma'am?

515
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:33,095
- Of course. Why not?
- Suppose the master asks where?

516
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,643
Tell him I just....

517
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,244
Now do you see what I mean?
Goes out, goes back, goes in.

518
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:56,128
Odd. Definitely odd.

519
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:01,088
<i>It's an odd household, too.
That maidservant, most impertinent.</i>

520
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:04,220
I can't get a thing out of her.
She won't talk to me...

521
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:07,471
though she would quick enough
if I wore trousers.

522
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:11,471
The way she carries on
with that policeman on the beat.

523
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,140
It's scandalous!

524
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,554
There.

525
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:19,560
There, that's all there is.
Fly away, pigeons. More tomorrow.

526
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:22,568
Well!

527
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:27,282
Paper!
Thank you, sir. There you are.

528
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:31,118
<i>Extra. Special. Special edition.
Read all about it.</i>

529
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:33,871
<i>Extra! Paper!</i>

530
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,664
Here you are, governor. Paper?
Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.

531
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:44,880
Put that file back where
you got it. I tell you, the case is dead.

532
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:47,722
I'm not going to have it all dug up again
for nothing.

533
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:51,057
Do you understand?
You had no right to go through that file.

534
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:52,976
Budge had no right to let you get it.

535
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,093
Sorry, General.

536
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:57,557
- He is your assistant--
- It's his job to assist me...

537
00:39:57,649 --> 00:40:01,730
not go digging into 10-year-old cases
on wild suspicions of his own.

538
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,237
- Now then, Budge, you get along.
- Very good, General.

539
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,412
What's your interest in this case, anyway?

540
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,242
It was rather a famous case...

541
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,576
and it impressed me very much
at the time.

542
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:19,081
Besides....

543
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,882
I once met Alice Alquist.
I was taken to hear her...

544
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,921
at a command performance
when I was 12 years old...

545
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,178
and afterwards
to meet her in the artists' room.

546
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:33,932
It sounds silly, but I still think
she was the most beautiful woman...

547
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:36,807
I ever saw, and I've never forgotten her.

548
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:40,264
- And now--
- You've seen someone who looks like her.

549
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,482
- Living in the same house.
- Why shouldn't she?

550
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:44,977
If she's the niece,
the house probably belongs to her.

551
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,528
And if you're trying to meet
a pretty woman...

552
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:50,452
you've no right to use official business
as an excuse.

553
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,493
It's not that, sir.

554
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,999
But I tell you, sir, I have a feeling
there's something peculiar going on there.

555
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,204
Perhaps even more than peculiar.

556
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:02,960
Look here, Brian, once and for all,
the case was given up as hopeless.

557
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:07,093
As for the matter of the jewels,
that was dropped by order...

558
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,963
of a most important personage.

559
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,171
Jewels?

560
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:16,676
There's nothing here about jewels.

561
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:24,685
There were some jewels.
They were given to her...

562
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,943
by somebody very highly placed.

563
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:31,238
Some of the crown jewels of his....

564
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:35,571
- Of another country, as a matter of fact.
- What happened to them?

565
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:39,080
- They disappeared.
- That's why she was murdered.

566
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,708
That was the official theory.

567
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:45,414
Though what the murderer
wanted the jewels for I can't imagine.

568
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:47,963
They were too famous
for him to be able to sell them.

569
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,804
- Have they never shown up since?
- Not as far as I know.

570
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:53,177
Well then, where are they?

571
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:57,718
I don't know. The murder part of the case
was pursued to the utmost...

572
00:41:57,811 --> 00:42:02,141
as you can see for yourself from that file.
There was never any case against anyone.

573
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:04,314
There were the usual blind-alley suspects.

574
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,975
You've read all their names there
in that stuff.

575
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,273
And there was never anything
to prove against any of them.

576
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:13,283
Now run along, there's a good fellow.
I'm busy.

577
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:15,822
Very well, sir.

578
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:20,994
Good day, sir.

579
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:33,296
- Afternoon, sir.
- Williams.

580
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:36,964
Williams.

581
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:40,178
- Did you want me, sir?
- Yes.

582
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:45,018
Tell me, you're not a married man,
are you?

583
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,514
No, sir.

584
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:51,188
- Where are you on duty now?
- Down in the East End, sir.

585
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,358
How would you like
a more fashionable locality?

586
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,199
- I'd like it very much, sir.
- We'll see what can be done about it.

587
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:00,951
Don't say anything to anybody
for the moment.

588
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:54,834
If you want coal on the fire, Paula,
why don't you ring for the maid?

589
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:58,095
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Go back to sleep, dear.

590
00:43:58,181 --> 00:43:59,510
No, Paula.

591
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:03,184
Now that you have wakened me,
we might as well be comfortable.

592
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:05,975
- Ring for the maid.
- I can put it on myself.

593
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:08,894
We've had this subject out before.

594
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:14,733
Please, pull the bell cord.

595
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,860
It seems so unnecessary.

596
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:22,824
What do you suppose
the servants are for?

597
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:27,458
<i>Answer me.
What do you suppose the servants are for?</i>

598
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,841
To do things. To serve us, I suppose.

599
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:35,041
Exactly.

600
00:44:35,135 --> 00:44:38,302
It's only that I think
we should consider them a little.

601
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:40,421
Oh, Gregory.

602
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:43,635
Don't be cross with me.

603
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,851
I'm not cross with you.

604
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:51,351
There are a lot of things....

605
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,653
- Did you ring, sir?
- No. Your mistress rang.

606
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:06,031
Go on. Why don't you tell Nancy
what you rang for?

607
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,999
- A little coal on the fire, please, Nancy.
- Very good, madam.

608
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,962
You're looking very pretty this afternoon,
do you know that?

609
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:19,460
I don't know it at all, sir,
I'm sure.

610
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:22,176
- Is tonight your night out?
- That's right.

611
00:45:22,265 --> 00:45:26,311
Whom are you meeting tonight?
You might light the gas, too, Nancy.

612
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,892
I see they've changed
the policeman on the beat.

613
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,026
Is his heart going to be added
to the list of those you've broken?

614
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:36,354
- I didn't know I'd broken any, sir.
- I'm sure that's not true.

615
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:38,736
And that complexion of yours...

616
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:42,073
that's something
that's not quite true, either.

617
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,782
You do it very cleverly, I grant you.

618
00:45:46,414 --> 00:45:50,330
In fact, I was wondering
whether you might not care...

619
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:52,957
to pass some of your secrets
on to your mistress...

620
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:55,205
and help her get rid of her pallor.

621
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,549
Sure. I'd be very pleased
to do anything I can, sir.

622
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:03,508
- Will that be all you're wanting?
- Yes, except tea when it's ready.

623
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:05,141
Very good, sir.

624
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:15,057
How can you talk to Nancy like that?

625
00:46:16,778 --> 00:46:19,733
You seem so anxious
to regard the servants as your equals.

626
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:23,406
I thought I would treat her as one.
Besides, I was only trifling with her.

627
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:26,578
No wonder that girl despises me,
the way you encourage her.

628
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:29,790
Despises you?
Whatever makes you think that?

629
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,667
Her whole manner!

630
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:35,287
The way she talks to me,
the way she looks at me.

631
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,550
Looks at you?

632
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:41,459
Paula.

633
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:45,090
I hope you're not starting
to imagine things again.

634
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:48,308
- You're not, are you, Paula?
- Of course I'm not.

635
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:53,056
I hope you're not, but if you start talking
about the way Nancy looks at you....

636
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:56,482
Don't turn away, Paula.
We must have this out.

637
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:01,448
Do you really think Nancy despises you?

638
00:47:03,408 --> 00:47:05,781
<i>Answer me, Paula. Do you?</i>

639
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:09,320
No, Gregory.

640
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:14,413
I'm glad of that.
It hurts me when you're ill and fanciful.

641
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:16,201
Come in.

642
00:47:17,797 --> 00:47:19,257
What is it now?

643
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,177
If you please, sir,
Miss Thwaites is downstairs.

644
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,669
She wanted to know
if the mistress was at home.

645
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:27,131
You mean that old busybody
from across the square?

646
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:29,051
Yes, sir. She has her nephew with her.

647
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:31,515
I don't think
we need bore ourselves with them.

648
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:35,471
- Tell her your mistress isn't in.
- Gregory, really, she's been....

649
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:38,775
My dear, if you let her in once,
you'll always have her here.

650
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,815
But she's called so often,
and we've never been at home to her--

651
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:44,657
I do not want people all over this house!

652
00:47:51,998 --> 00:47:54,158
Bringing her family with her.

653
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,833
You tell Miss Thwaites...

654
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:00,129
that your mistress is sorry,
but she's not well enough to see her.

655
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:01,626
Very good, sir.

656
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:11,010
Gregory, why did you do that?
I would've liked to have seen her.

657
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:14,015
I thought you were only trying
to be polite.

658
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,940
Why didn't you tell me
you really wanted to see her?

659
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,688
I couldn't in front of that girl.

660
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:23,193
You must get over
this ridiculous fear of the servants.

661
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,030
If you really wanted to see her,
all you had to say was:

662
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:29,241
"Show her up, Nancy," wasn't it?

663
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:30,359
Wasn't it?

664
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:33,695
- Yes, but--
- I'm sorry, miss. That's all I know.

665
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,745
The mistress isn't well enough
to receive anyone.

666
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,119
Please tell her how sorry we are.

667
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:46,753
Come along, Auntie dear.

668
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:10,614
You wouldn't have had time
to see them anyway.

669
00:49:10,702 --> 00:49:13,110
You have to dress, do your hair.

670
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:16,328
Why?

671
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,827
We're going out tonight.

672
00:49:20,962 --> 00:49:23,750
We are? You didn't tell me.

673
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,669
Or have I forgotten?

674
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:43,812
Don't you think this is charming?
It's from the new operetta at the Gaiety.

675
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:47,280
I wish I could write tunes like Strauss.

676
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,739
Paula, you silly child,
don't look like that.

677
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:56,498
<i>Of course you haven't forgotten anything.</i>

678
00:49:56,664 --> 00:50:00,615
This is my surprise for you.
We're going to the theater tonight.

679
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:13,428
How wonderful!

680
00:50:16,017 --> 00:50:20,098
- And you thought I was being cruel to you.
- No, you're not cruel.

681
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:23,640
Keeping people away from you,
making you a prisoner.

682
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:26,225
You're the kindest man in the world.

683
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:29,191
I'm sorry.

684
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:43,201
Oh, Gregory.

685
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,130
I'm so happy.

686
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:23,866
What's the matter?

687
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:31,506
Paula, I don't want to upset you.
If you will put things right...

688
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:34,085
when I'm not looking,
we'll assume it did not happen.

689
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:36,256
But what? Gregory, what?

690
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:40,267
Please don't turn your back on me.
What has happened?

691
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:44,055
You mean you don't know?

692
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:45,929
No, I....

693
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:49,023
Look.

694
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:04,365
Yes.

695
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:09,584
The little picture has been taken down.

696
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,218
Who took it down?

697
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,556
- Why has it been taken down?
- Why indeed?

698
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,557
Why was it taken down before?

699
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:28,102
Get it from wherever you've hidden it
and put it back in its place.

700
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:32,066
But I haven't hidden it.
I swear I haven't. Why should I?

701
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:36,441
Don't look at me like that.

702
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:39,735
Someone else must have done it.

703
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:42,657
No, don't ring. Please don't ring.

704
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:46,912
- Don't shame me before the servants.
- Please stop being hysterical.

705
00:52:49,712 --> 00:52:53,462
Now sit down and calm yourself
before they come.

706
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:57,923
We must get to the bottom of this
once and for all.

707
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:02,764
Please come in, Elizabeth.

708
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:07,228
Do you notice anything missing
from this room?

709
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:08,773
Missing, sir?

710
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:11,605
No. I don't think so, sir.

711
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:13,936
Look carefully on the walls.

712
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:17,021
<i>Well?</i>

713
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:20,700
- There's a little picture missing.
- Exactly.

714
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:23,743
- Did you take it away?
- No, sir.

715
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,452
Have you ever taken it down
from where it belongs?

716
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:30,409
- No, sir. Why ever should I?
- Why indeed?

717
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,082
Elizabeth.

718
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,549
You go to church, don't you?

719
00:53:39,637 --> 00:53:41,512
- To what, sir?
- Church!

720
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:42,797
Yes, sir.

721
00:53:42,891 --> 00:53:47,020
Please kiss this Bible as a solemn oath
that you've told the truth.

722
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:56,148
Thank you, Elizabeth. You may go now.
And send Nancy in here at once.

723
00:53:56,488 --> 00:53:58,197
- Nancy.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,909
Gregory, no, not that girl.

725
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:05,030
I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it.
I'll not have that--

726
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:07,447
Please! Have the goodness
to control yourself.

727
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,827
This is painful enough
without your making it worse.

728
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:12,628
<i>Please come back.</i>

729
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:16,081
<i>Since you've thrown suspicion
on the servants...</i>

730
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:18,796
<i>they must be cleared of it. Now sit down.</i>

731
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:23,261
Did you hear what I said?

732
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,429
Sit down.

733
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:31,933
Come here, Nancy.

734
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:41,356
A picture has been taken down
from the wall there.

735
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:44,285
So it has. That's another rum go.

736
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:46,825
I did not ask
for any comments on your part.

737
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:49,701
I want to know whether it was you
who took the picture down.

738
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:53,659
Of course it wasn't, sir.
What would I want to take it down for?

739
00:54:53,753 --> 00:54:57,622
Shall I ask her to kiss the Bible, Paula,
or will you accept her word?

740
00:54:57,715 --> 00:55:01,928
- Of course I'll accept it. Let her go.
- Very well. You may go, Nancy.

741
00:55:10,478 --> 00:55:12,139
Give me that Bible!

742
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:18,771
There. Do you see? I swear on the Bible
I didn't take that picture down.

743
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,524
Go look for that picture.

744
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:09,287
So you knew where it was all the time.

745
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:18,167
No.

746
00:56:19,255 --> 00:56:20,751
I didn't know.

747
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:25,799
I only looked there because that's
where it was found twice before.

748
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:28,379
I didn't know, Gregory.

749
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:29,796
I didn't.

750
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,722
I think you better go to your room.

751
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:37,138
We're not going to the theater?

752
00:56:37,232 --> 00:56:40,269
I'm afraid you are far from well enough
for the theater.

753
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,641
<i>Now come.</i>

754
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:44,652
Gregory.

755
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,694
- If it was I who took that picture down....
- If?

756
00:56:48,451 --> 00:56:50,694
If it was I who took it down
the other times...

757
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:54,038
if I do all these senseless,
meaningless things....

758
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:57,668
It's so meaningless.
Why should I take a picture down?

759
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,039
- Then I don't know what I do anymore.
- I know, Paula.

760
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:06,758
- That's just the trouble.
- But then, if that's true...

761
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:09,171
then you must be gentle with me.

762
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:12,007
You must bear with me, please.

763
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:17,097
Please, Gregory, please.

764
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:21,395
Now come, Paula.

765
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:28,197
- You better go to your room.
- What are you going to do?

766
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:30,863
I'm going out to work and forget all this.

767
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:34,037
No. Please don't leave me here
all by myself now.

768
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:38,037
I get so frightened when I am here alone
and you go out night after night.

769
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:41,081
Frightened? You never
told me that before.

770
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:44,381
I'm telling you now!
I'm frightened of the house!

771
00:57:44,466 --> 00:57:46,625
I hear noises and footsteps.

772
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:51,046
I imagine things,
that there are people over the house.

773
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:56,350
I'm frightened of myself, too.
Gregory, please!

774
00:57:57,103 --> 00:58:01,731
<i>Please don't leave me. Stay with me.
Gregory, take me in your arms, please!</i>

775
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,685
<i>Please. Take me in your arms, Gregory.</i>

776
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,528
I hope to find you better in the morning.

777
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:37,591
She seems to be getting worse,
doesn't she, sir?

778
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:40,604
You will please not refer
to your mistress as "she."

779
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,102
<i>Thank you, Nancy.</i>

780
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:46,898
Gonna work on your tunes
again tonight, sir?

781
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:49,656
- You're always working, aren't you?
- Yes.

782
00:58:51,074 --> 00:58:53,067
What are you doing
with your evening out?

783
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,785
I'm going to a music hall.

784
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:02,369
- I've never been to an English music hall.
- You don't know what you've missed, sir.

785
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:10,792
- You'd like it a lot, sir.
- We must see about that.

786
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:14,802
And whom are you going
to the music hall with?

787
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,171
Gentleman friend, sir.

788
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,592
Now, you know, Nancy, don't you...

789
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:20,928
that gentleman friends
are sometimes inclined...

790
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,936
- to take liberties with young ladies?
- No, sir, not with me.

791
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:28,436
I can take care of myself when I want to.

792
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:32,736
It strikes me that you're not at all
the kind of girl that your mistress...

793
00:59:32,824 --> 00:59:35,530
- should have for a housemaid.
- No, sir?

794
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:38,620
She's not the only one
in the house, is she?

795
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,529
Let people find their own places
for the concert.

796
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:36,024
Just sit where they like.

797
01:01:36,114 --> 01:01:39,484
Those who don't care for music
can go into the smoking room.

798
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:42,780
- May I come in?
- Brian.

799
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:44,330
Good evening.

800
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,365
Good evening, Lady Dalroy.
How are you, sir?

801
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,580
- How are you, my boy? Nice to see you.
- Am I the first to arrive?

802
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:54,792
I have a favor to ask. Are you having
a sit-down supper afterwards?

803
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:57,920
Yes, and I've put you
next to Laura Pritchard.

804
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,968
I don't like Laura Pritchard.
She's got adenoids.

805
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:07,519
Nonsense. She's a most agreeable girl,
and I want you to be very nice to her.

806
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:10,974
Haven't you learned yet
that Mildred is an incurable matchmaker?

807
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:13,059
I'll be nice to Miss Pritchard
another time.

808
01:02:13,151 --> 01:02:17,232
Tonight I want you to be very kind
and put me next to Mrs. Anton. Will you?

809
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:21,700
- It's most tiresome of you. All right.
- Who's Mrs. Anton?

810
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,071
She's the niece of Alice Alquist.
She used to come here as a child.

811
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:27,702
Brian told me she was back in London
now and married...

812
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:31,741
so I invited them to come tonight.
Who's Mr. Anton, by the way?

813
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:33,831
What does he do?
Where does he come from?

814
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:37,339
Put me next to her tonight,
and I'll find out for you.

815
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:42,180
I'm sorry, Brian, but you'll have to
sit next to the Pritchard girl after all.

816
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:44,473
- The Antons can't come.
- No.

817
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:46,101
- Letter from her?
- No. From him.

818
01:02:46,184 --> 01:02:48,178
- Him?
- Yes. Apparently she's ill.

819
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,678
Very tiresome of her.
Read it if you want to.

820
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:54,189
I must go and order the tables.
Come on, Freddy. I want you.

821
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:24,721
Is that you, Paula?

822
01:03:31,146 --> 01:03:32,226
Yes.

823
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,599
Why are you dressed up like that?

824
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:39,726
Because tonight
is Lady Dalroy's reception.

825
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:41,530
But I sent a note.

826
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,528
I know.

827
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:45,859
I sent a note to say
you were not well enough.

828
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:48,705
I'm quite well enough, and I want to go.

829
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,957
Lady Dalroy was very kind to me
when I was small...

830
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:54,955
and I am going.

831
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:58,210
I must get out of this house,
meet people...

832
01:03:58,298 --> 01:04:00,872
and see a little
of what's going on in the world.

833
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:03,541
I am going to this reception, Gregory.

834
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:07,260
Then I'm afraid you'll have to go alone.

835
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,056
Then I must go alone.

836
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:23,521
Paula.

837
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:27,900
<i>Paula.</i>

838
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:31,330
I didn't realize this party
meant so much to you.

839
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:33,950
I'll go and change immediately.

840
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:38,497
You didn't really think
I would let you go alone, did you?

841
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:41,162
- I don't know.
- I shan't be a minute.

842
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:04,901
Come in.

843
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:11,367
Coo. Did you ring for something, ma'am?

844
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:14,665
- Yes. Please fetch a cab.
- But I thought you were....

845
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:17,287
Get a cab, Nancy.

846
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:24,876
- Is the master going out, too?
- Yes, he is.

847
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:30,973
- Please hurry.
- Very good, ma'am.

848
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,247
Cabby!

849
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:04,964
Beckoning a cab on your evening out?

850
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:07,886
Yes. I'm going out to dinner
at Buckingham Palace, I am.

851
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:11,505
- I'm gonna have a lovely evening out.
- What's the matter with you?

852
01:06:11,598 --> 01:06:15,134
First they're going out, then they're not.
Changing all my plans.

853
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:17,518
Never a word to me from him.

854
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:24,315
You better get along.
They'll be out in a minute.

855
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:26,147
- See you Sunday?
- Perhaps.

856
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:28,524
- Usual place?
- Usual place.

857
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:30,276
- Good night.
- Good night.

858
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:39,449
Draw your cloak around you. It's damp.
Dalroy House.

859
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:43,045
- Good night, Nancy.
- Have a nice evening, sir.

860
01:07:31,136 --> 01:07:33,841
You're Paula.
I'm sure you don't remember me.

861
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,556
I do indeed, Lady Dalroy.

862
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,559
It was at the children's party here,
and there was a magician.

863
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:41,396
- May I introduce my husband, Lady Dalroy.
- How do you do?

864
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:43,936
I hope you will forgive
all the confusion...

865
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:48,153
but my wife suddenly felt much better,
and we were so anxious to come.

866
01:07:48,236 --> 01:07:51,321
But of course.
You'll find some seats over there.

867
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:54,284
Seratsky hasn't played yet.
I'll see you later at supper.

868
01:09:00,475 --> 01:09:03,762
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

869
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,809
I thought I saw someone I knew, that's all.

870
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:01,359
Paula.

871
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,543
My watch is gone.

872
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:33,140
No!

873
01:11:18,196 --> 01:11:20,603
I didn't put it there.
I swear I didn't put--

874
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:22,301
Would you be quiet, please?

875
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:41,294
Paula, please control yourself.

876
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:51,062
- Being seen like this in public.
- No.

877
01:11:56,526 --> 01:11:57,523
Come.

878
01:12:06,703 --> 01:12:10,203
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
my wife's illness has returned.

879
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:13,411
- Can I send for a doctor?
- No. If I can just get her home.

880
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,337
We shouldn't have come tonight,
but she was so anxious.

881
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:18,165
I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy.

882
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,544
I think it's the most....

883
01:12:42,155 --> 01:12:45,739
I've tried so hard to keep it
within these walls, in my own house.

884
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:50,028
Now, because you would go out tonight,
the whole of London knows it.

885
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:52,910
If I could only get inside
that brain of yours...

886
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:57,212
and understand what makes you
do these crazy, twisted things.

887
01:12:58,129 --> 01:13:00,752
Are you trying to tell me I'm insane?

888
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:04,090
That's what
I'm trying not to tell myself.

889
01:13:04,177 --> 01:13:05,720
But that's what you think, isn't it?

890
01:13:05,804 --> 01:13:09,505
That's what you've been hinting
and suggesting for months, ever since....

891
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:13,218
- Since what?
- Since the day I lost your broach.

892
01:13:14,354 --> 01:13:16,264
Yes, that's when it all began.

893
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:20,315
No, it began before that.

894
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:23,274
The first day here,
when I found that letter.

895
01:13:26,908 --> 01:13:30,444
- What letter?
- The one I found among the music...

896
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:34,033
from that man called Bauer.

897
01:13:34,124 --> 01:13:37,576
Sergis Bauer. Yes, I remember.

898
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:40,416
Yes, you're right. That's when it began.

899
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:44,415
I can see you still,
standing there and saying:

900
01:13:44,509 --> 01:13:48,424
"Look at this letter,"
and staring at nothing.

901
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,507
- What?
- You had nothing in your hand.

902
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:53,264
What?

903
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,516
I was staggered, but I didn't know then...

904
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:58,265
how much reason I had to be.

905
01:13:58,356 --> 01:14:02,225
- I don't know. What reason?
- I didn't know then about your mother.

906
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:04,070
What about my mother?

907
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:08,323
Your mother was mad.

908
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:13,032
She died in an asylum
when you were a year old.

909
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:15,118
That's not true.

910
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:18,702
I've been making inquiries
about Alice Alquist's sister.

911
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:21,416
I've talked to the doctor who attended her.

912
01:14:21,504 --> 01:14:22,999
- Would you like to see him?
- No.

913
01:14:23,089 --> 01:14:26,292
He described her symptoms to me.
Would you like to hear them?

914
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:30,632
It began with her imagining things,
that she heard noises, footsteps, voices...

915
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:33,178
and then the voices began to speak to her.

916
01:14:33,808 --> 01:14:36,514
In the end, she died in an asylum
with no brain at all.

917
01:14:36,603 --> 01:14:38,312
No! Please stop.

918
01:14:42,317 --> 01:14:46,102
Now perhaps you will understand
a lot of things about yourself and me.

919
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:50,278
Now perhaps you will understand
why I cannot let you meet people.

920
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:56,323
He must have been rather disappointed
that you left before he could talk to you.

921
01:14:57,373 --> 01:14:58,370
Who?

922
01:14:58,917 --> 01:15:01,041
The man who was sitting behind us.

923
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:04,089
- Where?
- Tonight.

924
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:07,004
You only went because you knew
he would be there.

925
01:15:07,092 --> 01:15:08,551
What, Gregory? Who?

926
01:15:08,843 --> 01:15:11,549
The man who bowed to you that day
at the Tower.

927
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:15,679
Who is he, someone from the past?
Someone you refused, perhaps?

928
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:18,852
I never met him.
I have no idea who he is.

929
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,059
Who is he?
Why is he dogging my footsteps?

930
01:15:22,732 --> 01:15:24,441
I don't know that he is.

931
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:29,188
- You lie. Why do you lie to me?
- I never lie to you.

932
01:15:33,076 --> 01:15:36,244
I'm sorry. I should not have said that.

933
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:42,372
I know you never lie to me. I believe you.

934
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:49,086
You're not lying. It's worse than lying.

935
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:52,718
You've forgotten. You've forgotten him
as you forget everything.

936
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:56,256
But perhaps I'm wrong
to try to handle this myself.

937
01:15:57,809 --> 01:16:00,846
The case is one for people
who know about those things.

938
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:06,443
We shall have visitors, and shortly.

939
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,195
- A doctor?
- Two.

940
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:13,405
I believe two is the required number.

941
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:53,694
Yes?

942
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:23,602
It's you, Constable.

943
01:17:25,355 --> 01:17:26,767
Good evening, sir.

944
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:30,107
- Nasty night to be out, isn't it?
- Very nasty, indeed.

945
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:23,617
Where'd he go?

946
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:25,829
He didn't get past me as
I came through the alley.

947
01:18:25,915 --> 01:18:28,953
He certainly turned in here.
You must have missed him in the fog.

948
01:18:29,043 --> 01:18:32,081
I'd have heard his footsteps
as he passed, Mr. Cameron.

949
01:18:33,757 --> 01:18:35,999
He must've gone
into the rear of one of these houses.

950
01:18:36,092 --> 01:18:37,837
Yes, but which? And why?

951
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:41,467
Do you think he could have gone
into his own house?

952
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:45,851
- If he did, sir, that's not against the law.
- No, but it's against common sense.

953
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,680
Why should he walk out of his own house
and all the way around the corner...

954
01:18:49,773 --> 01:18:51,850
just to get back to where he started from?

955
01:18:51,941 --> 01:18:54,398
But the service entrance to Number 9
is out front.

956
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:57,025
There's no way into Number 9
from back here.

957
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:01,235
- Then where did he go?
- Number 5 is empty.

958
01:19:02,619 --> 01:19:05,574
But what would he want to go
into an empty house for?

959
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:07,748
I don't know, Williams.

960
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:11,868
I don't know.

961
01:19:58,466 --> 01:20:00,294
Elizabeth!

962
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:08,685
Just coming, ma'am.

963
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,522
What is it, ma'am?

964
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:25,448
- I want you to help me. I'm so tired.
- Yes, ma'am.

965
01:20:44,095 --> 01:20:46,255
Did you turn on the gas?

966
01:20:46,765 --> 01:20:49,720
Did you turn on the gas
anywhere downstairs just now?

967
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:53,594
Why, no, ma'am. I've had it on
in the kitchen all evening, that's all.

968
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,896
I thought it went down in there,
as if someone...

969
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:00,441
had turned it on
in some other part of the house.

970
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:04,064
There's no one in the house
but me, ma'am. Nancy's not back yet.

971
01:21:08,203 --> 01:21:10,327
But the gas comes in pipes, ma'am.

972
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:13,914
And I expect they get more gas
in the pipes at some times...

973
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,709
than they does at others.

974
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:17,743
Yes.

975
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,920
Yes, I suppose that could explain it.

976
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:36,852
- Do you hear anything?
- Hear anything, ma'am?

977
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,977
- Yes. Up there. Listen.
- Listen to what, ma'am?

978
01:21:40,485 --> 01:21:44,021
Those sounds. Those noises up there.

979
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:45,479
No, ma'am.

980
01:21:48,618 --> 01:21:51,287
But there are sounds.
Sounds like someone moving about.

981
01:21:52,163 --> 01:21:56,079
- Elizabeth, listen, please.
- There are no noises up there, ma'am.

982
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:59,917
How could there be?
The whole floor is boarded up.

983
01:22:00,046 --> 01:22:03,665
You know that as well as I do.
No one can't get in up there.

984
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:06,792
You know, ma'am,
you just imagine things.

985
01:22:24,988 --> 01:22:26,613
And into the mews.

986
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:37,955
Williams, come in. You're early.
Get another cup, will you?

987
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:41,789
- Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you, sir.

988
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,043
Well?

989
01:22:45,717 --> 01:22:47,960
- Well?
- Well, sir...

990
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:51,923
I don't know what it means,
but this morning around 3:00...

991
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:56,014
I was standing on the corner of
Thornton Square, looking both ways-like...

992
01:22:56,102 --> 01:22:59,768
and suddenly, who should I see turning up,
but our friend again.

993
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:02,430
- Coming out of the mews, it looked like.
- Yes?

994
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:04,934
I got a good look at him
under the lamppost.

995
01:23:05,028 --> 01:23:07,734
I tell you, that man
had been up to something.

996
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:08,772
What?

997
01:23:08,865 --> 01:23:11,737
I wouldn't undertake to say what exactly...

998
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:13,744
but he was kind of in a mess.

999
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:18,748
Clothes untidy, tie all on one side.
Dirt and dust all over, even on his face.

1000
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:22,079
- Had he been in a fight?
- He didn't look like it.

1001
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:25,748
More as though he'd been digging
in a cellar or something.

1002
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:28,207
Have some coffee.

1003
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:30,544
Thank you.
I've had breakfast already.

1004
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:33,592
Had it in the kitchen at Number 9,
as a matter of fact.

1005
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,260
Nancy tell you anything this morning?

1006
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,387
If you ask me,
Nancy's getting ideas above her station.

1007
01:23:38,603 --> 01:23:39,849
Seems the master told her...

1008
01:23:39,938 --> 01:23:43,308
that her mistress might be going away
for quite a long time...

1009
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:46,065
and that he wanted her to stay
and look after him.

1010
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:48,561
The master told her
her mistress might be going away?

1011
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:50,067
That's right, sir.

1012
01:23:54,035 --> 01:23:56,112
- A long time, you said?
- Yes, sir.

1013
01:23:56,913 --> 01:23:58,741
What do you think that means?

1014
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:02,581
From all you've told me these last weeks,
I should say it could mean...

1015
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:05,422
any one of a number
of quite unpleasant things.

1016
01:24:07,298 --> 01:24:10,585
- I've to get into that house tonight.
- Not while he's there.

1017
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:12,921
- He goes out every evening?
- Right, sir.

1018
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:14,093
Tonight after dinner.

1019
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,933
Nancy says he's told her
not to let her mistress see anyone.

1020
01:24:17,016 --> 01:24:19,971
Then you'll have to see to it
that Nancy isn't home tonight.

1021
01:24:20,061 --> 01:24:24,107
- Any little thing I can do for the Yard, sir.
- I thought you wouldn't mind.

1022
01:24:24,441 --> 01:24:26,066
There's just one thing more though.

1023
01:24:26,151 --> 01:24:28,773
How do you know the lady herself
will see you?

1024
01:24:29,571 --> 01:24:30,770
I don't know.

1025
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:33,481
Yes.

1026
01:24:35,118 --> 01:24:36,993
I think there's a way.

1027
01:24:48,006 --> 01:24:50,961
"People who go every night
to places of public amusement...

1028
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,297
"can hardly enter into--"

1029
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:54,877
<i>Your mother was mad.</i>

1030
01:24:55,638 --> 01:24:58,427
"People who go every night

1031
01:24:58,516 --> 01:25:00,676
"can hardly enter

1032

<i>She died in an asylum

1034
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:12,528
"The snug comfort of the close carriage....

"...the sight of the stars glinting fitfully
through the trees...."

1037
01:25:43,186 --> 01:25:45,678
I'm sorry,
but the mistress won't see anyone.

1038
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:49,058
Did she tell you to say that?
You're Elizabeth, aren't you?

1039
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:52,313
- How'd you know my name?
- I know many things about this house.

1040
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:55,738
You're fond of her, aren't you?
You'd like to help her, wouldn't you?

1041
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:59,822
This is your chance because I'm a friend,
and you're going to let me see her.

1042
01:25:59,911 --> 01:26:02,154
No. I don't dare, sir. I'd lose me place.

1043
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:04,039
Really, I don't dare....

1044
01:26:11,923 --> 01:26:15,210
- My husband isn't here.
- I know that, Mrs. Anton.

1045
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:18,470
It's you I want to see.

1046
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:22,681
Go away. I'm ill. I can't see anyone.

1047
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:25,224
Elizabeth, stop him.
I didn't ask him to come.

1048
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:28,064
Mrs. Anton, my name is Brian Cameron.

1049
01:26:28,398 --> 01:26:30,890
You mustn't come here. Go away.

1050
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:33,820
Not until I've given you this.
Look at it, please.

1051
01:26:33,903 --> 01:26:37,107
<i>Alice Alquist gave it to me
years ago at Covent Garden.</i>

1052
01:26:37,782 --> 01:26:40,321
I was a little boy
overcome with admiration.

1053
01:26:43,955 --> 01:26:45,949
Now you'll trust me, won't you?

1054
01:27:09,105 --> 01:27:10,304
You.

1055
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:13,275
She gave it to you.

1056
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:17,440
After all these years...

1057
01:27:17,572 --> 01:27:22,116
the great admirer she used to make
such a mystery of. A little boy.

1058
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,040
Tell me something, Mrs. Anton.

1059
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,709
Are you planning
on going away somewhere?

1060
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:37,416
Go away? Why, no. I have nowhere to go.

1061
01:27:40,762 --> 01:27:43,088
Unless my husband sends me away.

1062
01:27:46,643 --> 01:27:49,135
Is that why you came here?
To take me away?

1063
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:51,603
Are you as frightened as all that?

1064
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:57,945
I'm sorry. I haven't talked to anyone
for a long time.

1065
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:02,942
I can't talk to you, either. I'm not....

1066
01:28:04,077 --> 01:28:05,453
I'm afraid I....

1067
01:28:06,496 --> 01:28:09,035
You're afraid
you're going out of your mind.

1068
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:13,207
I'm here to prove to you that you're not.

1069
01:28:13,294 --> 01:28:16,629
To help me do that, you've got to answer
my questions. Tell me now...

1070
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:18,459
where is your husband now?

1071
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:24,305
Where has he gone?

1072
01:28:26,182 --> 01:28:29,184
He has taken a studio
where he can work on his composing.

1073
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:32,639
He can't work in this house.
He has to have it quiet.

1074
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:37,358
Tell me, is there anyone else
in the house now except us and Elizabeth?

1075
01:28:39,154 --> 01:28:42,773
- No. Why?
- The gas just went down.

1076
01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:46,985
- You saw that, too?
- Why, yes.

1077
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:51,332
Then it really happens.
I thought I imagined it.

1078
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:53,872
That only means
that someone else has turned it on.

1079
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,247
I thought that, too, but every night,
I've been all over the house...

1080
01:28:57,338 --> 01:29:00,008
and there's never been
another light turned on.

1081
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:04,631
At last I can tell this to someone.
Every night when my husband goes out....

1082
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:08,635
The light goes down?

1083
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:14,264
- Yes.
- And then what?

1084
01:29:16,566 --> 01:29:19,354
Then I think I hear things.

1085
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:23,105
I watch and wait.

1086
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,320
- Later on, the gas goes up again.
- And he comes back.

1087
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:32,452
Yes. Quite soon after.

1088
01:29:33,249 --> 01:29:34,709
Always quite soon after.

1089
01:29:34,793 --> 01:29:38,376
You say you think you hear things.
What things?

1090
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:44,709
Sounds. Noises over my room.

1091
01:29:57,524 --> 01:30:00,810
- What's up there?
- A floor of trunks and furniture.

1092
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:04,320
- Is that what you meant?
- Yes!

1093
01:30:05,323 --> 01:30:06,439
But who?

1094
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:10,235
Mrs. Anton, you know, don't you?

1095
01:30:11,162 --> 01:30:13,405
- You know who's up there.
- No.

1096
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:17,289
- Are you sure you don't?
- No.

1097
01:30:19,421 --> 01:30:22,921
- How could he be?
- There's an alley behind these houses.

1098
01:30:24,175 --> 01:30:27,296
He goes in the back of Number 5,
that's the empty one...

1099
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:30,423
and then across the roof.

1100
01:30:30,598 --> 01:30:31,880
Why?

1101
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:34,091
<i>Why?</i>

1102
01:30:35,145 --> 01:30:37,185
You said there's old furniture up there.

1103
01:30:37,272 --> 01:30:38,435
My aunt's.

1104
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:42,483
And her clothes, stage costumes, trunks,
all of her things.

1105
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:45,023
All of her things?

1106
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,492
And they said the case was dead.

1107
01:31:47,008 --> 01:31:49,465
Tell me, has he any weapons
in the house?

1108
01:31:49,803 --> 01:31:52,129
He has a revolver. Why shouldn't he?

1109
01:31:52,222 --> 01:31:53,551
Where does he keep it?

1110
01:31:56,059 --> 01:31:58,432
I think he has it in his desk in there.

1111
01:32:07,654 --> 01:32:09,482
You can't open his desk.

1112
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,574
No. You have no right to.
Whoever you are, you have no right to!

1113
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:17,611
He'll know. He'll think that I....
What should I say to him?

1114
01:32:17,872 --> 01:32:19,866
You won't have to say anything.

1115
01:32:30,927 --> 01:32:33,799
Perhaps it's a good thing
I came tonight.

1116
01:32:33,888 --> 01:32:35,432
I was right.

1117
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:39,518
There was a letter.

1118
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,347
- It was from Sergis Bauer.
- What?

1119
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:44,598
- What was that name?
- Sergis Bauer.

1120
01:32:44,691 --> 01:32:48,820
I found this, but my husband said
I dreamed, and now it's here.

1121
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:51,442
- Bauer.
- It's been here the whole time.

1122
01:32:51,573 --> 01:32:55,156
There was a Sergis Bauer
connected with Alice Alquist.

1123
01:32:57,203 --> 01:33:00,988
He was a young pianist who played
for her in Prague. Let me see that.

1124
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:03,580
"Dear Miss Alquist,
I beg of you to see me once more.

1125
01:33:03,668 --> 01:33:05,461
"I followed you to London."

1126
01:33:11,885 --> 01:33:12,881
Look.

1127
01:33:13,178 --> 01:33:17,639
"Dear Lady Dalroy...."
This is my husband's writing.

1128
01:33:17,932 --> 01:33:19,048
So is this.

1129
01:33:19,601 --> 01:33:22,852
Your husband and Sergis Bauer
are one and the same person.

1130
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:27,352
This letter from him to Alice Alquist
was written two days before her murder.

1131
01:33:30,236 --> 01:33:33,072
He said there was no letter,
that I was going out of my mind!

1132
01:33:33,156 --> 01:33:36,324
No. You're slowly and systematically
being driven out of your mind.

1133
01:33:36,409 --> 01:33:37,406
Why?

1134
01:33:37,494 --> 01:33:40,579
Perhaps because you found this letter
and know too much.

1135
01:33:40,914 --> 01:33:45,244
Or because then he would have control
of your property, of this house...

1136
01:33:45,835 --> 01:33:49,086
and could search in the open
instead of the dark like this.

1137
01:33:49,255 --> 01:33:51,130
Search? What is there to search for?

1138
01:33:51,216 --> 01:33:54,917
For the things for which
Alice Alquist was murdered: her jewels.

1139
01:33:56,805 --> 01:33:58,051
I have her jewels.

1140
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:01,307
They're the jewels
you didn't know she had. Famous jewels.

1141
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:03,849
Jewels for which
he was searching that night...

1142
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:07,104
when he was frightened away by hearing
someone come down the stairs.

1143
01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:08,733
<i>Someone he never saw.</i>

1144
01:34:09,734 --> 01:34:10,980
<i>A little girl.</i>

1145
01:34:12,445 --> 01:34:13,442
Me.

1146
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:25,457
So he was here that night,
but he never....

1147
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,334
He never knew her.

1148
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:31,370
You're wrong. You're making a mistake.

1149
01:34:32,006 --> 01:34:34,166
I know him. He's my husband.

1150
01:34:34,717 --> 01:34:36,758
I've lived in the same house with him.

1151
01:34:36,845 --> 01:34:38,969
You're talking about the man
I'm married to.

1152
01:34:39,055 --> 01:34:43,517
Mrs. Anton, there's not a detail
of the Alquist case that I don't know...

1153
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:46,603
and unless I'm more mistaken
than I've ever been in my life...

1154
01:34:46,688 --> 01:34:50,354
the man called Sergis Bauer
has a wife living in Prague now.

1155
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:55,317
<i>So you see, he must have planned
the whole thing...</i>

1156
01:34:55,405 --> 01:34:57,280
<i>step by step from that night.</i>

1157
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:03,533
If that were true, then from the beginning,
there would have been nothing.

1158
01:35:05,707 --> 01:35:08,080
Nothing real from the beginning.

1159
01:35:08,209 --> 01:35:10,997
I'm sorry to take everything away
from you like this.

1160
01:35:11,087 --> 01:35:12,796
- No.
- You must believe me.

1161
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,088
Your life depends
on what you're going to do now.

1162
01:35:15,175 --> 01:35:17,133
Nothing less than your whole life.

1163
01:35:17,218 --> 01:35:19,675
Don't you see the way everything fits in?

1164
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,387
The gas.

1165
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:26,310
How long has it been up?

1166
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:03,021
Elizabeth, whatever happens tonight,
have her welfare in mind.

1167
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:04,825
You can count on me, sir.

1168
01:37:04,993 --> 01:37:08,279
But what am I going to say to the master
when he comes back?

1169
01:37:08,413 --> 01:37:10,739
He won't come back anymore, Elizabeth.

1170
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:36,490
Paula?

1171
01:39:42,734 --> 01:39:45,819
- What are you doing?
- I was lying down.

1172
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,521
Fully dressed?

1173
01:39:50,992 --> 01:39:52,986
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.

1174
01:39:54,662 --> 01:39:56,371
Then why don't you answer?

1175
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:00,785
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1176
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,788
Do you know anything
about anything you do?

1177
01:40:04,881 --> 01:40:07,883
<i>I will be obliged if you will come with me
to my room.</i>

1178
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:27,563
Sit down in this chair.

1179
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:30,442
You know what you remind me of
as you walk across the room?

1180
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:33,320
Have you ever seen anyone
walking in their sleep?

1181
01:40:34,994 --> 01:40:38,198
But you're not asleep.
No, you can't deceive me.

1182
01:40:38,289 --> 01:40:41,991
You're fully awake, or you would not have
broken open my desk!

1183
01:40:44,295 --> 01:40:46,254
Now be careful how you answer.

1184
01:40:46,923 --> 01:40:48,667
Why did you open my desk?

1185
01:40:49,426 --> 01:40:51,087
I didn't open your desk.

1186
01:40:51,177 --> 01:40:52,922
- Nancy?
- Nancy's out.

1187
01:40:53,096 --> 01:40:55,765
- Who, then? Elizabeth?
- No, it wasn't Elizabeth.

1188
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:58,138
Please don't question me anymore.
Let me go back--

1189
01:40:58,226 --> 01:40:59,805
No. Stay there, Paula.

1190
01:41:01,438 --> 01:41:05,139
- Why did you open my desk?
- I didn't open your desk.

1191
01:41:06,776 --> 01:41:10,312
- Why did you open my desk?
- I didn't open your desk. It was he....

1192
01:41:18,413 --> 01:41:20,288
He opened it.

1193
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:23,617
What are you talking about?

1194
01:41:24,002 --> 01:41:25,378
Who is he?

1195
01:41:27,255 --> 01:41:28,454
A man.

1196
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:31,340
A man who came to see me.

1197
01:41:32,469 --> 01:41:34,213
- When?
- While you were out.

1198
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:35,711
Who let him in?

1199
01:41:35,847 --> 01:41:37,426
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth!

1200
01:41:41,102 --> 01:41:42,099
Yes, sir?

1201
01:41:42,854 --> 01:41:46,271
Who was the man who came to see
your mistress while I was out?

1202
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:49,355
What man, sir?

1203
01:41:51,321 --> 01:41:54,109
Come, Elizabeth.
You must have answered the bell.

1204
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:57,364
No one was here, sir, while you were out.

1205
01:42:02,123 --> 01:42:03,832
But, Elizabeth....

1206
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:06,376
But you saw him.

1207
01:42:08,213 --> 01:42:10,502
You opened the door for him yourself.

1208
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,636
Elizabeth, say it!

1209
01:42:16,638 --> 01:42:19,307
No, ma'am. I didn't see anyone at all.

1210
01:42:26,147 --> 01:42:29,233
But he was here. I know it.

1211
01:42:32,028 --> 01:42:33,144
I know it.

1212
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:37,321
But he was here. I know it!

1213
01:42:49,838 --> 01:42:50,918
I saw him.

1214
01:42:51,548 --> 01:42:52,580
I saw him.

1215
01:42:53,675 --> 01:42:55,585
You see how it is, Elizabeth?

1216
01:42:56,177 --> 01:42:59,298
Yes, sir. I see just how it is.

1217
01:43:02,225 --> 01:43:04,017
I couldn't have dreamed it.

1218
01:43:06,729 --> 01:43:08,770
No, I couldn't have dreamed it.

1219
01:43:13,945 --> 01:43:18,240
Did I dream? Did I really dream?

1220
01:43:23,413 --> 01:43:26,284
Yes, Paula, you dreamed it.
You dreamed all day long.

1221
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:28,872
- Are you telling me that I've dreamed--
- Everything.

1222
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,962
- All that happened?
- All that did not happen.

1223
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:33,870
Then it's true.

1224
01:43:35,049 --> 01:43:37,624
- My mind is going.
- Haven't I told you?

1225
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:39,712
- It was a dream.
- Like all the rest.

1226
01:43:39,804 --> 01:43:42,343
- Take me away. I can't fight it anymore.
- I will.

1227
01:43:42,432 --> 01:43:45,600
It was a dream. Take me away.

1228
01:43:46,811 --> 01:43:50,062
Was I any part of this curious dream
of yours, Mrs. Anton?

1229
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,932
You.

1230
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,238
Perhaps my presence here
might help you to recall it.

1231
01:43:58,323 --> 01:43:59,901
Who the devil are you?

1232
01:44:01,075 --> 01:44:03,745
Apparently a mere figment
of your wife's imagination.

1233
01:44:03,828 --> 01:44:07,613
- How did you get into this house?
- Through the skylight, like you...

1234
01:44:10,168 --> 01:44:13,004
and down these stairs.
You made it very easy.

1235
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:15,123
Will you tell me what you're doing here?

1236
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:18,335
Mrs. Anton, you'd better
go to bed. You must be tired.

1237
01:44:18,426 --> 01:44:20,467
You'd better explain your business, sir.

1238
01:44:20,553 --> 01:44:24,173
As a mere figment, as a mere ghost
existing in your wife's mind...

1239
01:44:24,265 --> 01:44:26,757
I could hardly be said
to have any business.

1240
01:44:27,852 --> 01:44:29,846
Paula, go to your room, please.

1241
01:44:43,368 --> 01:44:45,196
So you found them after all.

1242
01:44:47,372 --> 01:44:48,748
I was right about you.

1243
01:44:48,832 --> 01:44:51,917
I knew from the moment I saw you
that you were dangerous to me.

1244
01:44:52,001 --> 01:44:55,288
I knew from the first moment I saw you
that you were dangerous to her.

1245
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:59,295
I should have followed my instinct
about you, as you followed yours.

1246
01:44:59,384 --> 01:45:01,792
I thought she was Alice Alquist
come back to life.

1247
01:45:01,886 --> 01:45:05,506
I didn't know then that she was walking
with Sergis Bauer.

1248
01:45:06,391 --> 01:45:09,843
- I'm afraid I don't know your name.
- Cameron. Want my address, too?

1249
01:45:09,936 --> 01:45:13,851
- No. I think I can guess it.
- So we both ended our search tonight.

1250
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:16,977
This is where Alice Alquist hid them.

1251
01:45:17,068 --> 01:45:20,485
Where the world could see them,
yet no one would know where they were...

1252
01:45:20,572 --> 01:45:23,657
except the man who gave them to her,
watching from the royal box.

1253
01:45:23,741 --> 01:45:28,072
Pretty clever of her to put four priceless
jewels among a lot of paste and tape.

1254
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:31,825
- For the last time, what do you want?
- The jewels, and justice.

1255
01:45:31,916 --> 01:45:35,962
How does it feel, Bauer, to have planned
and killed and tortured for something...

1256
01:45:36,045 --> 01:45:39,297
- and then to know it's been for nothing?
- For nothing?

1257
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:55,555
Elizabeth!

1258
01:45:58,109 --> 01:46:00,732
What is it, ma'am?
I thought I heard a shot.

1259
01:46:04,407 --> 01:46:06,531
Help! Mr. Williams, come quick!

1260
01:46:08,328 --> 01:46:09,360
Up there!

1261
01:46:26,054 --> 01:46:27,430
Anybody at home?

1262
01:47:12,267 --> 01:47:14,474
Well, Mrs. Anton, you believe me now.

1263
01:47:15,478 --> 01:47:17,851
Perhaps you'd like to see these things.

1264
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:21,567
They cost a woman's life.
They cost you something, too.

1265
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:38,893
I want to speak to my husband.

1266
01:47:39,057 --> 01:47:41,147
Mrs. Anton,
I don't think that's advisable.

1267
01:47:41,212 --> 01:47:44,167
- I want to speak to him alone.
- That's impossible.

1268
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:48,007
- I assure you, I'm quite helpless.
- Please.

1269
01:47:49,971 --> 01:47:51,003
Well.

1270
01:47:52,015 --> 01:47:53,925
I'll be waiting on the stairs.

1271
01:48:02,317 --> 01:48:04,476
Go and see if he's listening.

1272
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:12,197
- He is not listening.
- You have got confidence in him.

1273
01:48:12,494 --> 01:48:14,119
Did he tell you many things about me?

1274
01:48:14,204 --> 01:48:15,699
- Yes.
- They were lies.

1275
01:48:15,789 --> 01:48:17,118
Why should he lie to me?

1276
01:48:17,207 --> 01:48:20,790
Because he's in love with you.
I can tell. I feel it.

1277
01:48:21,377 --> 01:48:24,961
Do you? Do you really, Gregory?
Or shall I call you Sergis?

1278
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:28,134
So he told you that, too. What of it?

1279
01:48:28,384 --> 01:48:32,134
Have you never heard of an artist
taking a stage name? Sergis Bauer's mine.

1280
01:48:32,222 --> 01:48:34,526
It was a part of my life
I didn't care to tell you about.

1281
01:48:34,555 --> 01:48:35,745
I was a failure then.

1282
01:48:36,059 --> 01:48:40,271
- They don't hang a man for that, do they?
- No, they don't hang a man for that.

1283
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:45,650
You remember our first days.
You remember Italy?

1284
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:49,319
There have been times
when I thought I only dreamed those days.

1285
01:48:49,906 --> 01:48:51,366
Come closer, Paula.

1286
01:48:55,453 --> 01:48:56,699
Closer.

1287
01:49:01,918 --> 01:49:03,330
Look into my eyes.

1288
01:49:04,045 --> 01:49:07,166
If I ever meant anything to you,
and I believe I did...

1289
01:49:08,925 --> 01:49:12,840
then help me, Paula.
Give me another chance.

1290
01:49:17,642 --> 01:49:21,427
Look, in the drawer of that cupboard
there is a knife.

1291
01:49:22,063 --> 01:49:23,689
Get it and cut me free.

1292
01:49:30,697 --> 01:49:33,533
Be quick, Paula.
Get me the knife. Cut me free.

1293
01:49:34,993 --> 01:49:37,781
Would you get it, Paula?
Would you get it for me?

1294
01:49:38,538 --> 01:49:42,122
Yes, I'll get it. I'll get it for you.

1295
01:49:42,959 --> 01:49:44,205
Hurry, Paula.

1296
01:49:47,464 --> 01:49:49,504
- There's no knife.
- I put it there.

1297
01:49:49,591 --> 01:49:52,297
- I don't see any knife.
- I put it there tonight.

1298
01:49:52,427 --> 01:49:55,678
No, it isn't here.
You must have dreamed you put it there.

1299
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:01,011
Are you suggesting that this is a knife
I hold in my hand?

1300
01:50:01,102 --> 01:50:03,060
<i>Have you gone mad, my husband?</i>

1301
01:50:04,147 --> 01:50:07,149
Or is it I who am mad?
Yes, of course. That's it.

1302
01:50:07,984 --> 01:50:09,266
I am mad.

1303
01:50:11,362 --> 01:50:13,522
<i>I'm always losing things and hiding things.</i>

1304
01:50:13,615 --> 01:50:16,107
I can never find them.
I don't know where I put them.

1305
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:18,609
That was a knife, wasn't it?
And I have lost it.

1306
01:50:18,703 --> 01:50:21,076
- Paula--
- I must look for it, mustn't I?

1307
01:50:21,164 --> 01:50:24,036
If I don't find it,
you will put me in the madhouse.

1308
01:50:24,209 --> 01:50:28,077
Where could it be, now?
Perhaps it's behind this picture.

1309
01:50:28,171 --> 01:50:32,300
Yes, it must be here.
No. Where shall I look now?

1310
01:50:32,383 --> 01:50:35,421
Perhaps I put it over here.
Yes, I must have done that.

1311
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:42,890
My broach. The broach I lost at the Tower.

1312
01:50:43,895 --> 01:50:46,897
I found it at last!
You see? But it doesn't help you, does it?

1313
01:50:46,981 --> 01:50:49,271
And I'm trying to help you to escape,
aren't I?

1314
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:51,898
- How can a madwoman help you?
- You're not mad.

1315
01:50:51,986 --> 01:50:53,731
Yes, I am mad, as my mother was!

1316
01:50:53,822 --> 01:50:57,108
No, Paula. That wasn't true! Help me.

1317
01:50:59,744 --> 01:51:01,987
If I were not mad, I could have helped you.

1318
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,414
Whatever you had done,
I could have pitied and protected you.

1319
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:08,164
But because I am mad, I hate you.

1320
01:51:08,336 --> 01:51:11,373
Because I am mad, I have betrayed you,
and because I am mad...

1321
01:51:11,464 --> 01:51:14,087
I am rejoicing in my heart
without a shred of pity...

1322
01:51:14,175 --> 01:51:17,960
without a shred of regret,
watching you go with glory in my heart!

1323
01:51:19,264 --> 01:51:23,345
Mr. Cameron, come.
Come, Mr. Cameron. Take this man away!

1324
01:51:23,435 --> 01:51:24,467
<i>Take this man away!</i>

1325
01:51:27,522 --> 01:51:29,646
- You ready?
- Quite ready.

1326
01:51:40,869 --> 01:51:42,946
I don't ask you to understand me.

1327
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:47,036
Between us all the time
were those jewels, like a fire.

1328
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:51,085
A fire in my brain that separated us....

1329
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:55,377
Those jewels which I wanted all my life.

1330
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:00,800
<i>I don't know why.</i>

1331
01:52:02,223 --> 01:52:04,217
The cab is coming, Mr. Cameron.

1332
01:52:06,519 --> 01:52:07,896
Goodbye, Paula.

1333
01:52:10,482 --> 01:52:11,893
Goodbye, Gregory.

1334
01:52:50,188 --> 01:52:51,932
This night will be a long night.

1335
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:55,144
But it will end. It's starting to clear.

1336
01:52:57,612 --> 01:52:59,238
In the morning, when the sun rises...

1337
01:52:59,322 --> 01:53:02,359
sometimes it's hard to believe
there ever was a night.

1338
01:53:02,617 --> 01:53:04,196
You'll find that, too.

1339
01:53:04,702 --> 01:53:08,701
<i>Let me come and see you and talk to you.
Perhaps I can help somehow.</i>

1340
01:53:08,957 --> 01:53:10,333
You're very kind.

1341
01:53:12,585 --> 01:53:13,749
Well!
