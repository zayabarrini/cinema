1
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,107
When shall I pick you up, sir?

2
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:13,062
Give me time for a couple of cocktails.

3
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,693
Half an hour.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,999
Mrs Farnsworth asked me to remind you
of your dinner engagement tonight.

5
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,737
A half-hour will just give me
time to change and make it.

6
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,159
By the way.

7
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:24,638
Did Mrs Farnsworth mention
with whom we dine?

8
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:26,744
With the Lindens, sir.
- Oh.

9
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:27,990
The Lindens.

10
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:31,406
You'd better make it an hour, Williams.

11
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:34,645
I find I'll need more
cocktails than I thought.

12
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:50,461
I beg your pardon .. but
aren't you Joyce Heath?

13
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:53,372
No.
- But I ..

14
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,024
You've made a mistake.

15
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:00,076
Perhaps I have .. pardon me.

16
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:11,855
Gentlemen.

17
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,517
How are you, Mr Farnsworth?
- Evening, Roger.

18
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:18,907
Anthony, a Sidecar with just a
splash more brandy than necessary.

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,690
I suppose you know what brandy
does to your liver, Roger.

20
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,348
Yes. That's why I stopped
port and turned to brandy.

21
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,044
Your liver is far less
conspicuous than your nose.

22
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,715
Do you chaps remember
an actress Joyce Heath?

23
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,216
I'll never forget her
as Camille .. Sappho.

24
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:37,678
I saw her only once,
but I'll never forget her.

25
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,872
What a vitally tempestuous
creature she was.

26
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,795
It's amazing how a powerful personality
can project itself over the footlights.

27
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,411
That night I was in
the rear of the theater.

28
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:49,724
Yet couldn't have been closer
if I held her in my arms.

29
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,705
Not closer perhaps,
but more interesting.

30
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:54,418
Quiet .. let the gentleman confess.

31
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:55,965
Joyce Heath never knew it.

32
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,442
But she prompted me to make a decision
that remade the course of my whole life.

33
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:04,385
The career my family planned for
me in Wall Street I discarded.

34
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,711
I suddenly got the urge to create.

35
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,216
I gave up writing as I couldn't write,
and music because I couldn't play.

36
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,498
But I could draw.

37
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,007
Three years in Paris taught me ..

38
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,606
Not defeat .. but compromise.

39
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,821
I still had enough of the
urge left to try architecture.

40
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:23,032
I saw her tonight, just as I came in.

41
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,888
Dowdy, down and out.

42
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:27,043
And ashamed of being Joyce Heath.

43
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,791
She was tops.

44
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:32,438
What's the matter, Mr Hanley?
Isn't the Highball right?

45
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,432
Oh .. the Highball. Yes, perfect.

46
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:36,580
Why?

47
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,262
You looked as if something
tasted or smelt bad.

48
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,797
I would rather you wouldn't mention
that. I was reading my own column.

49
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,101
Ted.
- Yeah?

50
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,149
We want to ask you something.

51
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,473
Yes, it's a toupee.

52
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,256
What about Joyce Heath? She was a star.

53
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,686
She was too brilliant.
Too startling for a star.

54
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,255
She was a comet.

55
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:02,002
Which appeared suddenly.
Fell spectacularly.

56
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,666
And disappeared completely.

57
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,883
That, gentlemen, is a metaphor.
One of the great actresses.

58
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,119
And Joyce Heath.

59
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,963
That's why I can't read his column.
He writes that way too.

60
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,438
Yes, but what happened to her, Ted?

61
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:16,959
Fantastic as it may sound .. a jinx.
One she put on other people.

62
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,175
A jinx?

63
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:21,530
It started when her leading man
was killed on an opening night.

64
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:27,107
From then on .. everyone associated with
her was haunted by failures, divorces ..

65
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:28,732
Suicides and scandals.

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,658
That's right. She practically
lived on the front page.

67
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,311
At first, she laughed
at the superstition.

68
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,771
Then she believed it.

69
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:39,274
Last time I saw her, she was
on a cheap Vaudeville tour.

70
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,685
Then she vanished.
Like the magician's lady.

71
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,169
Sounds almost unbelievable, doesn't it.

72
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:48,780
But it happened.

73
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:55,306
I have to break into a trot if I want
to change and pick up Gail in time.

74
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,398
We have a dinner date.
- The Lindens?

75
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:58,790
The Lindens.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,200
I think they get most of their guests
from the tomb of Ramses The Second.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,042
There's quite a few valuable
civil war relics among them too.

78
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,796
Goodnight.
- Night.

79
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,002
A clever boy.

80
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:09,934
One of the best architects
in the country.

81
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:13,641
With his reputation and Gail Armitage
connections he'll come out alright.

82
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,772
By the way, when will they be married?

83
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,199
It hasn't been arranged yet.
- How do you know?

84
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,601
Mrs Farnsworth hasn't heard.

85
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,111
Maybe they're keeping it a secret?

86
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,317
What, from my wife? Impossible.

87
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,428
Good evening, Cato.
- Good evening.

88
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:43,813
I'm late, Cato. You'd better draw me a
bath, lay out my dinner jacket and ..

89
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,439
Never mind the bath.

90
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:49,157
Did you ever try putting celluloid fish
in the tub to entice him into it, Cato?

91
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,138
Gail, what are you doing here?

92
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,424
I finished early, so I came over to save
you the bother of driving out to get me.

93
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:55,739
Good for you.

94
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,355
Cato .. stew up a cocktail.

95
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:01,549
I don't want a cocktail, thank you.

96
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,741
Some hors d'oeuvres, Cato.
- They always spoil my dinner.

97
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:08,930
Cato, you fix the young lady a ham
sandwich whether she wants it or not.

98
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:16,287
Gail, what do you think?
- That I love you.

99
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,310
I'm pretty fond of myself this evening.

100
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,388
The bank is going to
make the building loan.

101
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,215
Don, how marvelous.
- Miraculous is the word.

102
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,483
All I have to do is put a
hundred thousand in escrow.

103
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,773
But they could let you
have the land now.

104
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,353
Don't worry about the petty cash.
It will come out alright.

105
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,927
Think of really starting on the estates,
after dreaming about them for years.

106
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,850
I know exactly how
they're going to look.

107
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,064
Unless I fall down, they'll be the most
beautiful estates in the whole country.

108
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,246
And I can't fall down.

109
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,762
I've worked too hard,
I've waited too long to flop.

110
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,893
It seems as though it's all really
going to come through, doesn't it.

111
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:49,425
I guess we have everything, young lady.

112
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,305
And best of all, we have us.

113
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,148
Ham sandwich, please?

114
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,221
No mustard.
- No mustard?

115
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:01,944
No mustard.
- Cato, go look for some mustard.

116
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,590
If you find it and bring it here, you'll
go out of here looking like a hot-dog.

117
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,877
Happy?
- Ecstatically.

118
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,909
Why?

119
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,361
Because dear, I have a very good sense.

120
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,786
You ineffable cad, you.

121
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,911
You adorable darling, you.

122
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,878
Darling, hurry. Get dressed or
we'll be late for the Lindens.

123
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,740
Can't we get out of it somehow?
- No, we cannot.

124
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,515
You'll meet a lot of people there
who can afford to buy your houses.

125
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,657
People who go to the Lindens don't
need houses, they need tombs.

126
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,443
[ Meow ]

127
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,899
Woof, woof.
- Meow.

128
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,518
Gail and I couldn't stand it any longer.

129
00:07:56,747 --> 00:08:00,774
Being the extra man at a Linden party
is like being a spare corpse at a wake.

130
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,211
I could kiss you for
getting us out of there.

131
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:06,003
I could too, if you didn't look so much
like a horse that threw me once.

132
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,610
Be exact. There have been so many.

133
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,075
Delightful women you take up with.

134
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,283
Where to, shrew?

135
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:13,647
What can I do?

136
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,352
Steal watermelons?
- Get tattooed?

137
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,288
Paint mustaches on a library lion.

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,104
One of you are bound to say
something rude if this goes on.

139
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:22,983
I'd like to go to shooting galleries
and Honkytonks and things.

140
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,069
An idea.

141
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,494
I'll send my driver home, and
we'll all go with you in your car.

142
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,631
No you won't. I've a tough day tomorrow.
I want to get up early.

143
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:34,835
I don't want to spend tonight escorting
you in, and carrying you out of a club.

144
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,416
Say, listen. I've never been
carried to any place in my life.

145
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,880
Thrown, yes .. but carried, never.
Well, whisk away and I'll follow.

146
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,555
Come on. Let's not go home.

147
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,975
Let's go in here and splash
about in some birds nest soup.

148
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,451
How about a little high
class sharpshooting?

149
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,002
A harbor for flotsam and jetsam.
A bit of O'Henry's.

150
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,035
You win.

151
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,300
A smart looking place.

152
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:30,982
Whose idea was this?

153
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:33,528
We can sit here.

154
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,882
I guess we'd better stand at the bar.

155
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,653
You'd better sit where
he tells you to, dear.

156
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,997
Oh Don, this is such a depressing place.
- You don't want to stay?

157
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:05,965
No, let's get out of here. Come on.

158
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,399
Some other time.

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,693
You can chalk one up against me.
I certainly can pick them.

160
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:21,689
Now where?

161
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:25,461
It's after 12 o'clock.
Don has to get to bed.

162
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,597
He's been working like a Trojan lately.

163
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:31,126
Why don't you go on with Teddy.
Let him take you home.

164
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,676
It would save me an hour,
getting out and back.

165
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:36,062
Do you mind, Teddy?

166
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:39,486
No. Not if you don't talk about Don.
- Alright. Why don't you do it then?

167
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,370
I think I will. I've got an early
meeting in the morning.

168
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,873
I'll call you after that.

169
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,390
Don't forget.
- No.

170
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,442
Listen, you're coming out to the club to
see me play Polo next week aren't you?

171
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:52,235
You mean to see the horseplay
until you get tired? I might.

172
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:53,727
Goodnight.

173
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:55,427
Goodnight, darling.

174
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,242
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

175
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:36,116
Do you mind if I sit down?

176
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:40,326
Not if you buy a drink.
- Two of whatever the lady is drinking.

177
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,598
Straight gin.

178
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,639
I've seen you before.

179
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,877
Which doesn't make us old friends.

180
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,150
Well you see, one time, I ..

181
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,831
It really doesn't interest
me, if you don't mind.

182
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,042
Thanks.

183
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,555
Not at all.

184
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,289
Rather ironical, isn't it?

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,829
Are you going to drink that?

186
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,298
Haven't you had enough?

187
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:19,733
Quite enough.

188
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,917
Goodnight, Joyce Heath.

189
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,127
What did you say?

190
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:35,831
Joyce Heath.

191
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,881
I ..

192
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,400
Joyce Heath, the actress.

193
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,105
Sitting in a dive like this
swilling down cheap gin?

194
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:48,057
You must be drunk too.

195
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,109
No, there isn't much similarity
except in appearance.

196
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,850
Lots of people look alike.

197
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,079
Joyce Heath was full of life.

198
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,744
I'll never forget the time I saw her.
She was playing Juliet.

199
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:05,895
Do you remember the scene where you
were told you had to marry Count Paris?

200
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:09,905
And you took the sleeping draught to
pretend death until Romeo's return?

201
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,934
As your mother kissed you goodnight ..

202
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,037
And left you.

203
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:15,874
You began:

204
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:17,573
'Farewell'.

205
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,795
'God knows when we shall meet again'.

206
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:22,683
Farewell.

207
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,288
God knows when we shall meet again.

208
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:31,785
A faint, cold fear thrills my veins.

209
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,630
And almost freezes out the heat of life.

210
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:42,388
I shall call them back to comfort me.

211
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,478
Nurse.

212
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:48,940
What should she do here?

213
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:53,645
My needs must act my dismal scene alone.

214
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,443
Come, vial.

215
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,112
What if this mixture do not work?

216
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:06,699
Shall I, by force, be
married to the Count?

217
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,019
No.

218
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,969
No .. this shall ..

219
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,493
This shall ..

220
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:21,887
Passed out?

221
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:23,004
Seems so.

222
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,403
I'll call the wagon.

223
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,990
They'll throw her in the tank until
she comes to in the morning.

224
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:28,257
Waiter.

225
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:31,458
I'll take her home.

226
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:35,368
Okay buddy. Pay me twenty cents
for them two drinks and she's yours.

227
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,371
Keep the change, boss?
- Yes.

228
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:43,802
Okay.

229
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:35,974
[ Door knocks ]

230
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:38,948
Yes?

231
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:47,965
You look poorly.

232
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:51,792
Then it won't surprise you to be
told that I <i>feel</i> poorly.

233
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:52,877
No.

234
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:56,243
Figuring the moist condition
you arrived in last night.

235
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,299
And just where did I arrive? I'm not
asking you to betray a confidence.

236
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,949
This is Mr Bellows' place.

237
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,385
He's an architect.

238
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,704
One of them fellows who draws pictures.

239
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:07,970
Thank you.

240
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,327
I suppose you are Mrs Bellows?

241
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:12,526
Or are you just one of his sketches?

242
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,501
Nope.

243
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,063
I'm his housekeeper for when
he comes down here weekends.

244
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,829
How cozy. And Mr Bellows, where is he?

245
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,289
He's having breakfast.

246
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,454
And if you want to see him, you better
look perky. He's got to get to town.

247
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm looking forward
to seeing Mr Bellows.

248
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,756
Stop that.
- Leave me alone.

249
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,412
I wasn't going to push you ..
- Do you mind leaving me alone?

250
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,874
Nope .. in fact, I'd like it.

251
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:52,927
Well, she's up.

252
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,195
Oh.

253
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,124
I bet the Mahoney boys are having
a parade for her this morning.

254
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,231
There weren't no-one in her room.

255
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,257
I don't know the Mahoney boys anyhow.

256
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:05,322
You never heard of the Mahoney Boys?

257
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:06,775
You're very fortunate.

258
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,856
Tiny men with purple beards.

259
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,750
That play tunes with nail-files
on your teeth with one hand ..

260
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,199
And keep time with mallets
inside your head with the other.

261
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:17,304
At the same time they run around your
stomach planting jumping beans.

262
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,477
You wouldn't be pulling my
leg would you Mr Bellows?

263
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,839
Please .. Mrs Williams.

264
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,596
Feeling better?
- I'd like a drink.

265
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:45,132
Before breakfast?

266
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,195
Get me a drink.

267
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,941
Why don't you lay off that stuff?

268
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,946
Because I'd rather be drunk than sober.

269
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,632
I gathered that last night.

270
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,310
Last night?

271
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:09,217
Oh, you must be quite
proud of your conquest.

272
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,629
You're very wrong. You see, I ..

273
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,820
Don't bother with alibis.
It really doesn't matter.

274
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,425
You are a perfect alibi.

275
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,701
Take a look at yourself.
Take a good look.

276
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,203
Drunken. Ill-kept.

277
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,671
The only feeling you can
arouse in a man is pity.

278
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:24,571
Pity?

279
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,406
Pity? You dare to feel sorry for me.

280
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,258
You with your fat little
soul and your smug face.

281
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,172
Picking your way so cautiously
through a pastel existence.

282
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:37,050
Why, I've lived more in a day
than you'll ever dare live.

283
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,496
Pity for me?

284
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,504
That's very funny, when I've
never had any for men like you.

285
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,907
You know, just now you are
as I imagined you would be.

286
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,970
Playing a second act speech
in a third-act coat.

287
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,732
When you boast to your friends
about seeing me here ..

288
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:58,528
I shouldn't mention that
I've become a has-been.

289
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:02,388
It would detract frightfully from
the glamour of your adventure.

290
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:05,066
Look here, Miss Heath.
The reason I brought you here ..

291
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,134
I know. Because you were sorry for me.

292
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,881
You've already said that.

293
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,796
No.

294
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,790
Because I was grateful to you for
something very important in my life.

295
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,008
I suppose you always loved the theater.

296
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:18,864
It was more than that.

297
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:23,126
The beauty and fineness of one of your
performances moved me so strongly ..

298
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,347
That the whole pattern
of my life was altered.

299
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,886
I've had plenty to be grateful for.

300
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,544
But first of all I owe you
my deepest gratitude.

301
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:32,565
Well?

302
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,683
Then I'm humiliated to the
point where I must thank you.

303
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,333
Breakfast .. breakfast ..

304
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:51,884
Oh.

305
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:54,657
Smoking before breakfast.

306
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:57,045
You'll spoil your appetite.

307
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,071
Being here already has.

308
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:14,539
Restful here, isn't it.

309
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,528
The whole countryside
seems to have found peace.

310
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,908
A person could find peace too.
- No.

311
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,623
You only find that in yourself and
when you do you may as well be dead.

312
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,961
Dead?

313
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,953
'Rest In Peace' is for tombstones.

314
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,094
And for the living?

315
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,934
Desire .. to want something ..

316
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,064
You'll tame that desire and
live up to every moment of it.

317
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,192
And then go on leaving yesterday behind.

318
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,022
On and on .. higher and higher.

319
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,879
Frustrated actress reads
lines for small audience.

320
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:52,905
You could go on.

321
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,134
Talent like yours doesn't die.

322
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,390
You were a star once. You can be again.

323
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,012
Uhuh .. an evil star, a jinx.

324
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,675
You'd better run for your life.

325
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:08,466
You can't possibly believe that
silly theatrical superstition.

326
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,203
Well, two men who loved me are
dead and some financially ruined.

327
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,060
Shows have folded.

328
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,979
How can I possibly ignore it when
producers won't give me parts?

329
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,106
Your breakfast is getting cold.

330
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,774
And you'd better be getting back to
town if you want to change your duds.

331
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:24,994
You know, there is
something in what you say.

332
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:28,227
I don't want breakfast. I go with you.
- Why don't you stay out the week?

333
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:31,514
No-one will be using the house, so I can
come down Saturday, and take you in.

334
00:21:31,717 --> 00:21:33,317
The rest and quiet will do you good.

335
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:36,521
Helping me is like shaking hands with
the devil. The worst luck in the world.

336
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,331
That's ridiculous.

337
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:40,958
Do you really want to go back to town?

338
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,595
I don't care.

339
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,856
You wouldn't feel obligated
if you stayed, would you?

340
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,998
Why should I?
What difference does it make?

341
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,059
Of course. It doesn't make any
difference. Then you'll stay?

342
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,246
Yes, yes! But stop asking me questions.

343
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:56,911
Go on and boast to your friends about
fishing Joyce Heath out of the gutter.

344
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,934
I won't mention it, I can assure you.

345
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,912
Better watch her pretty closely. She's
on the verge of going off the deep end.

346
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,505
Come and have your
breakfast before it gets cold.

347
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:24,034
May I please have a drink?

348
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,969
Fresh milk? Country sausage?

349
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:29,469
Come and get it.
There's lots to tuck away.

350
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,773
I asked for a drink. Where's the bottle?

351
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,549
Yes dear .. after you've eaten.

352
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:36,739
I don't want your greasy food.
I want a drink.

353
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,029
Where is it?

354
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,828
Now, it will only make you
more sick and fidgety.

355
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,553
You're worn to a frazzle.

356
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,926
What you need is rest and food.

357
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:46,703
Where is it?
- Uh ..

358
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,025
I don't know.
- You're a liar.

359
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,298
Now, now, now, now.
- Give me the key.

360
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,457
I haven't got it.

361
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,929
My dear ..
- Leave me alone.

362
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:05,861
My dear.

363
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:09,734
You've cut yourself.

364
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:13,528
I reckon it isn't the first time you've
been hurt getting things you shouldn't.

365
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,648
Oh stop nagging me .. get out.

366
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,413
Get <i>out</i> will you.

367
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,406
Ah.

368
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,789
'Phantom of delight' as Wordsworth says.

369
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,833
That's a little thing
I thought up myself.

370
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:49,222
And not bad either.

371
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,522
And what's the little woman been doing?
- Shopping. You?

372
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,696
Getting a check for a theater job.

373
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,151
Next week I go in escrow.

374
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:01,592
Grand, isn't it?

375
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:04,120
And those estates will be your
masterpiece, Don. I know it.

376
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,474
I've talked to more people
that are interested.

377
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:07,915
They'd better be.

378
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,829
When my creditors get through
subdividing my shirt ..

379
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,440
There won't be enough of it left
to show on a blue serge suit.

380
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,432
Stop worrying.

381
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,360
By the way, I've come to take you to
the Polo matches. Teddy's playing.

382
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:19,678
Teddy?

383
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,716
You know, I often wonder why he
doesn't use a croquet mallet.

384
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,685
He's on the ground most of the game.

385
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,687
Will you hurry up?
We've missed the first chukka as it is.

386
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,596
I'll take 4-1 on Teddy's collarbone.

387
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,969
Nope. But I'll take 2-1 on a rib.

388
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,199
Oh, I can't go.

389
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,599
Why not?

390
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:39,805
I've just remembered I've promised to
go down to the country this afternoon.

391
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,007
Why?

392
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,677
It's rather an interesting .. case.

393
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:48,326
Remember the night you and I and
Teddy sneaked out of the Linden party?

394
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:49,406
Well.

395
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,086
Oh I forgot .. I promised not to tell.

396
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:54,136
It sounds intriguing.

397
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,369
Well it was a peculiar incident.

398
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,637
I don't see any reason
why I shouldn't tell you.

399
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,577
Nope, better not.
A promise is a promise.

400
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:04,664
Will you be home by Sunday?
- Tonight.

401
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,916
If you ask me to breakfast
Sunday morning ..

402
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,424
I take you on the golf course, give you
a stroke a hole, and beat the pants ..

403
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,091
We call them 'slacks'.

404
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:13,623
You may kiss me.

405
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,269
Goodbye. See you Sunday.

406
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,657
Good evening, widow Williams.

407
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,795
Staying to dinner Mister Don? Pot roast.

408
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:37,194
Pot roast? With all those potatoes
and carrots and onions around it?

409
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:40,568
It's a shame to disturb them.
They look so cozy.

410
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:42,673
And turnips.

411
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,259
Turnips?

412
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,191
And what's the matter with turnips?
Turnips are good for you.

413
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,064
They grow hair on your chest.

414
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,707
Do you eat them?

415
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:52,826
Sure.

416
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:55,340
Mr Don, don't be pesky.

417
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,270
How did you guess?

418
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,680
She isn't exactly chatty.

419
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:05,437
You'll get more folksy
conversation out of a snowman.

420
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,448
Where is she now?
- Gone up the hill towards the barn.

421
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,502
I'd better go and try and find her.
It looks like rain to me.

422
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:15,016
Now that corn of mine has been
prophesying rain for 30 years.

423
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:17,240
Excepting once.

424
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,896
That was my own fault for trimming him.

425
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:21,956
I'd better hurry then.

426
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,650
When are you going to fetch
her home, Mister Don?

427
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,608
Whenever she wants to go. Why?

428
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,923
Nothing. I was just .. talking.

429
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:31,891
I'll be glad when she's gone though.

430
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,518
Why?

431
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,814
You know, it's different
for a man like you.

432
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:40,057
But a woman knows an awful
lot about another woman.

433
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:41,633
And she's dangerous.

434
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,144
A bad woman's got something
a good woman ain't.

435
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:49,000
And a good woman is jealous of
that something, and afraid of it.

436
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:51,461
I don't know what it is, but ..

437
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,261
She's got it.

438
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:57,018
Sounds to me as if you've been reading
bad translations of French novels.

439
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,250
In the first place, I don't find Miss
Heath especially attractive off stage.

440
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:04,348
And in the second place,
it's no concern of yours.

441
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,990
I guess he's right. I'm an old fool
getting to be a regular busybody.

442
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:12,442
Miss Heath.

443
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,379
Miss Heath.

444
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,014
Miss Heath.

445
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:37,881
Hey .. wake up.

446
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:45,765
Oh, it's you.

447
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:47,948
On Saturday, I ..

448
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:51,116
I fell asleep in a bar.
It all comes back to me now.

449
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:54,857
Yes, it's also going to rain. It would
be good sense to come in out of it.

450
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:56,431
That's merely hearsay.

451
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,388
Would you hand me my
shoes and stockings please?

452
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:04,815
Thanks.

453
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:06,923
You know, you are looking much better.

454
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,634
I've enjoyed this afternoon.

455
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,356
Going barefoot and sleeping in the sun.

456
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:16,236
Playing a sort of a Naiad in the jungle.

457
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,046
What do you mean? What's a 'Naiad'?

458
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:19,699
It's some sort of a wood nymph.

459
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:22,823
I'm not .. I'm not very
much up on my sprites.

460
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:26,748
I must say a 'Naiad' becomes
you better than a 'Maenad'.

461
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,148
Fancy.

462
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:31,053
What's a 'Maenad'?

463
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:34,486
They were mythical women,
famous for their beauty and charm.

464
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:36,419
Who attended the Dionysian rebels.

465
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:39,560
They were always so carried
away by the wild madness that ..

466
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,887
They ended up by dancing hysterically
over the edge of a cliff to destruction.

467
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,478
Sorry, but I'm too tired
to be hysterical, and my ..

468
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,779
My feet are much too sore
from going barefoot ..

469
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:51,852
To stand the jar of
dancing over the cliff.

470
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,475
By the way, I ..

471
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,484
I got the sermon.

472
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,626
Ha.

473
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:02,515
There's one little piggy that's going to
market in a shocking state of nudity.

474
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,440
I hope you don't mind me
borrowing some of your clothes.

475
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:08,822
Not at all.

476
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:18,917
Sorry.

477
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:26,518
[ Thunderclap! ]

478
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,591
Looks as if we're going
to have a cloudburst.

479
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,221
What do you find so amusing?

480
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:40,016
What do you find so disturbing?

481
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:43,894
Come on, before we get drenched.

482
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,189
Naiad or Maenad, nothing. Mermaids ..

483
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:52,928
Ha .. come on.

484
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,099
Land's sake, you're soaking wet.

485
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,628
It's all your fault.

486
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:10,186
If you'd used a corn-plaster,
this wouldn't have happened.

487
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:14,075
You'd better be going back to town
Mr Don, before you have to go in an ark.

488
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,283
You can't drive back in this rain.

489
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,935
And why can't he, may I ask?

490
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,490
Driving on that road will be
like touring in a full bathtub.

491
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,316
I never thought of that.

492
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:26,569
You'd better turn down
my bed, Mrs Williams.

493
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:28,447
I'll get up early and drive in.

494
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:02,612
Listen to that rain.

495
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:06,373
You know, I saw you on the
opening night of your Juliet.

496
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:07,910
Did you?

497
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,098
I think it was one of
your best performances.

498
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,295
Yes.

499
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:14,492
Which play would you prefer
to do more than any other?

500
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,164
One I've never done.

501
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,824
A thing called 'But To Die'.

502
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:23,073
I'd give anything in
the world to play it.

503
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:25,543
I wouldn't have to
act it, I could live it.

504
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,563
Why hasn't somebody produced it for you?

505
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,452
With the 'Jinx woman' of the theater?
Don't be silly.

506
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,963
I noticed a very interesting
play on your bookshelves.

507
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,105
Which one?

508
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:40,142
It's called .. 'Forever Ends At Dawn'.

509
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:43,750
'Forever Ends At Dawn'?
I don't think I've ever read it.

510
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:46,293
It's a beautiful last act.

511
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,343
You wouldn't read it to me, would you?

512
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,872
Are you sure you would like to hear it?
- It would be a treat to listen to you.

513
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,435
Well, just the last act then.

514
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,616
The scene of the play
is the French Riviera.

515
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,799
The story is about a man and a woman.

516
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:05,408
She's not a very nice person.
But a fascinating one.

517
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:10,310
The man has a wife or a
fiancée, I've forgotten which.

518
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:12,286
With whom he's very much in love.

519
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,773
He's intrigued by this woman but
quite nobly resists her charms.

520
00:32:19,118 --> 00:32:22,159
Here it is .. 'Forever Ends At Dawn'.

521
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,764
You may find the dialog a bit
awkward in spots but I'll ..

522
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:29,182
I'll try and make it convincing.
- I've never heard you when you weren't.

523
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,608
Thank you.

524
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,553
This scene takes place in the
woman's room late at night.

525
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,821
The man has to go home
in the morning so he ..

526
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,607
Comes to say goodbye to her.

527
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,269
I'll read from here.

528
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:46,596
Richard:

529
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:48,996
'I had to come and say goodbye'.

530
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,299
'And tell you it's been
swell knowing you'.

531
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:53,220
Joan:

532
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,914
'Well I .. thought that our goodbye
would be different from this'.

533
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,545
Richard:

534
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:04,067
'Yes, but you see .. there's always ..'

535
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:06,978
Joan: 'I know'.

536
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,269
'That girl in the back of your heart'.

537
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:11,444
Joan:

538
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:14,467
'Her 'forever' lasts until
death do you part'.

539
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,757
'My 'forever' only until dawn'.

540
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,438
'Tomorrow is where
regrets lie, Richard'.

541
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,326
'But there will be no tomorrow for us'.

542
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,579
'Only tonight'.

543
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:29,992
'Which we steal from no-one'.

544
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,884
'And forget as a dream which
has no part of our normal lives'.

545
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:38,026
'Over which we had no control'.

546
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:41,500
'And for which we need
feel no obligation'.

547
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,243
Is that the end of the play?

548
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:47,279
Almost.

549
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:50,585
Let's have some music.

550
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,931
You know, you read that beautifully.

551
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,319
Now you know.

552
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:18,670
I know it won't do.

553
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,799
Where are you going?
- Out for a walk.

554
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,413
In this rain?
- I like walking in the rain.

555
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:31,623
So do I. I think I'll go too.
- There is only one slicker.

556
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:03,615
Why don't you go back?

557
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:50,768
Kidneys and bacon and cornbread
this morning, Mister Don.

558
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,773
That's fine.

559
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:58,532
Miss Heath not down yet?
- No. I called her 15 minutes ago.

560
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,516
Mrs Williams, would you mind ..?

561
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:07,922
Good morning.

562
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:11,439
Do you like the negligee I
borrowed from Mrs Williams?

563
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:15,082
It's fine.

564
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,164
Rather cruel, aren't you?

565
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:26,326
Why do you say that?

566
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:29,217
You might at least have smiled
at me as I came down the stairs.

567
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,404
Even if it were a lie.

568
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,977
I don't think this is any time to lie.

569
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,735
Or to speak the truth or
to say anything, in fact.

570
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:42,302
Could I pour you some coffee?

571
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:44,759
Joyce.

572
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:47,302
I hate loose ends.

573
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,267
They .. they tangle your
life, they trip you up.

574
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,221
Yes, Don.

575
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:56,622
Well, last night ..

576
00:36:57,552 --> 00:37:00,126
I'm sorry I kissed you
and said the things I did.

577
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,874
How very gallant of you to say so.

578
00:37:04,604 --> 00:37:05,895
No, you don't understand.

579
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:08,779
You see, I'm engaged to someone.

580
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,498
And you blame me?

581
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,953
No. It was unfair to you too.

582
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,274
You are so very ..

583
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:18,261
Fascinating. I think it was that ..

584
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,377
The storm and our nearness
that made me lose my senses.

585
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:25,632
I've got them back this morning
and I'm asking you to forgive me.

586
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:27,151
And.

587
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,647
For what I'm saying now if I hurt you.

588
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:30,905
Hurt me?

589
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:35,382
You delight me.

590
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:38,570
You have the most amazing lack
of humor of anyone I've ever known.

591
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,225
I shouldn't laugh at you, should I.
But I can't help it.

592
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:46,283
You were so awkward I almost
laughed in your face at first.

593
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,360
Then it made me sick
to think that anyone ..

594
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,167
Could be stupid enough to be
taken in by a lot of old tricks.

595
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,722
I thought you might at least be amusing.

596
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:56,499
But you turned out to be dull
and stupid and so afraid.

597
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,022
You needn't be.

598
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:01,895
I won't hurt your Sunday School
romance or your oh-so-nice career.

599
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:03,611
Hurt me? Ha.

600
00:38:03,897 --> 00:38:06,035
Get out of here before
you give me hysterics.

601
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,711
Sorry friend, but I think you stop here.

602
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:47,211
It does seem advisable, doesn't it.
How soon will you have it repaired?

603
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:49,089
Oh the lumber will be here about noon.

604
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:51,480
And I think you ought to get
across early this evening.

605
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,561
Too bad you didn't get off last night.

606
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:55,214
Yeah.

607
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:58,639
Can one of your men get across and
telephone for me from the other side?

608
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:01,364
Why, sure.
- Have him call 'Miss Armitage'.

609
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,731
At Austin 9532.

610
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,560
Say Mr Bellows has been delayed and
can't see her until this evening.

611
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:12,450
And I'd be much obliged if you let
me know the minute I can get across.

612
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:15,665
I'm up at the old Quinn Farm.
- Okay. The first thing.

613
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:44,232
[ Crying sounds ]

614

Joyce.

617
00:39:59,114 --> 00:39:59,862
Don.

618
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,704
You did come back.
I was praying you would.

619
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:06,103
I had to. You see ..

620
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:09,754
It doesn't matter why.
You did, you had to.

621
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,802
You didn't believe what I
said this morning, did you?

622
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:14,643
Did you?

623
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,797
I guess I had it coming to me.

624
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:19,027
Oh no, Don. It was a lie.

625
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,988
Let's forget about it.

626
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:23,313
You can forget that.
But I want you to remember this.

627
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:26,907
I know you belong to somebody else.
And I don't want you, really I don't.

628
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,361
But last night was mine and ..

629
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,756
And I made it ugly this morning.

630
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,003
I don't want you to
think of it that way.

631
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,048
I won't.

632
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:37,487
You will, unless I tell you the truth.

633
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:40,732
You've seen me drunk and disgusting.

634
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:44,170
You took me in out of pity.
Well, that hurt my pride.

635
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:48,248
And because I'm a good deal of
a shrew, I wanted to hurt yours.

636
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,524
I was going to tease you
with all the tricks I knew ..

637
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:53,222
Until you tried to kiss me, and ..

638
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,537
Then I was to laugh in your face.

639
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:57,891
I was an actress playing a part.

640
00:40:58,561 --> 00:40:59,758
I played it too well.

641
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:03,883
But when you took me in your
arms .. I didn't want to laugh.

642
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:06,249
I wanted to cry.

643
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,290
I'm sorry.
- I'm not. I'm glad.

644
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:11,657
Last night was beautiful.

645
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,181
It will always be beautiful.

646
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:16,783
And now that it's over.

647
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:21,808
It's not over, Joyce.

648
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:24,793
Oh yes, Don. It's got to be over.

649
00:41:26,726 --> 00:41:29,278
Your career is on the verge
of permanent success.

650
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,467
You'll have someone who
can help you. I can't.

651
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,713
I'm the kind of woman
who destroys, not builds.

652
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:37,366
I'm Joyce Heath, Don.

653
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:39,693
A Maenad who ..

654
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:43,433
Who doesn't want to dance over the
cliff with a man as fine as you.

655
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:48,223
Now come on, let's finish up
the rest of the day very fine.

656
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,505
I'll get dressed. You go down.

657
00:41:58,622 --> 00:41:59,535
I got it.

658
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,206
No, no, Don. That's not fair.

659
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,483
You must be playing by pinochle rules.
- It's just you're slow, that's all.

660
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:12,013
No wonder.

661
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:17,033
These cards are so thick and old I could
be playing with Encyclopedia Britannica.

662
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:20,803
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

663
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:23,318
The recipe said it was toffee.

664
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,174
But that's not what we've got.

665
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,833
I'll never get my jaws apart.

666
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,310
I'm going to bite the
person that said so.

667
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,911
Pardon me a minute, while
I get out a piece of toffee.

668
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,747
I've lost a couple of molars and
a bicuspid that are sticking to it.

669
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:39,521
Did you get it?
- Yes, but I think I lost a nail.

670
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,483
Perhaps we should put some sand in that
mess to give it something to hold on to.

671
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:47,791
I wonder if Mrs Williams
would like some.

00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:50,399
It would certainly take the rattle
out her uppers and lowers.

673

I wish I'd never seen you.

674
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:07,441
Never kissed you.
Never held you in my arms.

675
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,266
Because every time I do, I hate myself.

- Thank you.

- Yes.

I love you.

687

You may never love me but .. you'll
find you always come back to me.

688

And each time you return it will
cost you more and more until ..

I don't mean to be

So I'm being generous to you, Don.

Kind. Kinder than I've ever
been to anybody before.

Mr Bellows.
- Huh?

707

Miss Armitage is on the telephone.

00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:15,723
Put her on.

No.

Tell her I'm still out of town.
I'll call her when I get back.

Very well, sir.

712

Mr Haynes of United Quarries called many
times to ask if you have a decision.

Tell him I haven't been
able to make up my mind.

He said he'd have to have an answer
one way or the other. Yes or No.

He's right.

716

Well, hello Mr B.

00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:31,062
It's about time you were getting back.

Don .. something has happened?

728
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,183
Yes Gail .. something has happened.

729
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:46,615
Even if it's all for the
worst, it can't be so bad.

730
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:49,882
Because you've got the most
enthusiastic assistant in the world.

731
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,535
To help you laugh it off.

Whichever we're going to do.

734

Gail, it would make me prouder
to have you as my wife ..

735
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:00,729
Than to have any other
woman in the world.

736
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:06,256
If I could respect you a little less, it
would all be very simple, but I can't.

737
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,516
So I must ask you a question.

738
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:11,077
I'm afraid I know the answer already.

739
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,207
What is it, Don?

740
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:18,305
If we were married, there is one
humiliation you would never know.

741
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,498
That's having me deceive
you with someone else.

742
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,366
I know that.
- But if there were someone else?

743
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,346
Someone I didn't love, that I'll
never even see again, but who ..

744
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:32,436
But who had a strange,
exotic fascination for me.

745
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:34,216
An appeal I couldn't kill.

746
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,122
Would that make any difference to you?

747
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:40,177
Yes Don, it would.

748
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,928
Whether you ever went to
her or not, wouldn't matter.

749
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:45,186
But the fact that you'd want to would.

750
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,322
It mightn't make me love
any less .. perhaps more.

751
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:53,285
The agony of wondering every time you
kiss me whether you're thinking of her.

752
00:47:53,635 --> 00:47:55,621
The hate and dread I'd have
for that other woman.

753
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,222
And the terrific loneliness of that
little part of you which I wouldn't own.

754
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:01,144
It would be unendurable.

755

I can't tell you Don, how much I
admire you for .. for being so honest.

I've come to see you for some
advice on producing a play.

00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:55,160
That's something I know nothing about.

after death, Mr Bellows.

Thanks for the warning.
What I want is an opinion.

768
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,215
Have you ever heard of a
play called 'But To Die'?

769
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:08,984
A magnificent script.

770
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:11,576
Which with the proper lead
would make a great play.

771
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:13,605
However, miscast ..

772
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:17,395
It would close so fast the third act
curtain would snag in the stage door.

773
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:19,485
Who do you see in the lead?

774
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:22,056
Only two women could have played it:

775
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,285
Jean Eagles and .. Joyce Heath.

776
00:49:24,578 --> 00:49:26,575
Eagles is dead .. Heath has disappeared.

777
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:28,070
So, forget it.

778
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:31,348
If I made both the script and Miss Heath
available to you, would you produce it?

779
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:34,441
Mr Bellows, I have great
respect for the script.

780
00:49:34,945 --> 00:49:36,889
And almost a reverence
for Miss Heath's talent.

781
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:40,224
But I wouldn't hazard
$80,000 to defy a jinx.

782
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:44,187
Surely an intelligent man like you won't
take any stock in a legend like that?

783
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,723
When you ask $80,000 for
a share of it I do.

784
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,963
Suppose I pay the $80,000?

785
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:53,943
Then I would produce
and direct it myself.

draw up the contract?

787

that flame and burn and leave ashes.

803
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:44,568
So we're not the same. I know that.

804
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:48,004
But is there any consistency in
the way you feel towards me?

No .. I can't build without plans.

Answer me, Joyce. Is there consistency
in your feelings towards me?

Tonight I love you so much that nothing
else matters. A love you couldn't kill.

But that's tonight.

First of all, your career.

Why should you concern
yourself about that?

829
00:52:57,213 --> 00:52:59,594
Because you don't belong in
the audience, but on the stage.

830
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:03,030

have beauty and poetry there.

Off the stage they'd be brutal.
They would ruin us both.

enough release to be content with me.

00:54:23,021 --> 00:54:24,200
Nothing, only ..

858
00:54:25,987 --> 00:54:28,076
Well, it's all happened
so quickly you know.

859
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:31,617
Being told about doing the play.
And you wanting to marry me.

860
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:33,127
You see.

861
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,585
It would ruin your career, Don.

862
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:39,153
You are society. I am theater.
They just don't mix.

863
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,663
There is still marriage.

864
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,051
Yes, I know. But ..

865
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:45,456
Let's not talk about it just now.

866
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:47,376
Think, Don.

867
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:50,818
Going on the stage for the first
time in two years to play for you ..

868
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:52,418
Your career and mine.

869
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:55,718
Our lives, our success,
depending on one performance.

870
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:59,116
When the lights go out
and that curtain goes up ..

871
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,051
Don, that's being alive.

872
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:03,990
I love you. I love you for
bringing me back to life.

873
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,980
Are you going back to town tonight?
- Right away.

874
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:08,757
I'm going with you.
- Why?

875
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:10,624
To leave two years behind.

876
00:55:13,796 --> 00:55:14,682
Faster.

877
00:55:17,723 --> 00:55:18,452
Faster.

878
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:37,227
So that's all it's been to you, Charles.
Just a shipboard romance.

879
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:38,966
No it wasn't.
- Oh yes.

880
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:44,194
Just a man telling a woman that the moon
and ocean aren't half as lovely as she.

881
00:55:44,968 --> 00:55:47,116
Swearing devotion, eternal as the tides.

882
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,955
Sweeping the girl off her feet.

883
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,651
All to be forgotten.

884
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:53,992
That isn't what it's meant to me.

885
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:56,539
No Charles. It has meant far more.

886
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,652
Your every word, your every
kiss, your every caress.

887
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,563
I've treasured.

888
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:06,819
Because I've always pretended they
belong to the man I really love.

889
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,385
Now that's something for you to forget.

890
00:56:13,305 --> 00:56:14,207
If you can.

891
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:16,491
That's fine.

892
00:56:16,984 --> 00:56:18,201
How about it, Miss Heath?

893
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:20,116
Too tired to go through
that scene again?

894
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,333
No, I'd love to.

895
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:24,593
I'm sorry .. I've got to beg off.

896
00:56:25,321 --> 00:56:26,162
I'm all in.

897
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:28,573
You've got too much vitality for me.

898
00:56:29,008 --> 00:56:31,142
And for me too .. we'll call it off.

899
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:34,457
No rehearsal tomorrow. And we'll run
through it again at 10 o'clock Monday.

900
00:56:34,756 --> 00:56:36,801
I don't like to work on the
day of the night we open.

901
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:39,149
But there's some things I
must change .. that's all.

902
00:56:40,009 --> 00:56:41,025
Alright boys.

903
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:47,303
Give me a cigarette.
- Sure .. what do you think?

904
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,669
I've spent a fortune and
misspent a life in the theater.

905
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:52,292
But this is the only time on
the eve of a dress rehearsal ..

906
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:55,383
I have nerve enough to say I had a hit.
- You're pretty positive.

907
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:57,880
So positive that I'll buy your
piece of it for $100,000.

908
00:56:58,154 --> 00:57:02,570
Oh no. Here's one angel who isn't afraid
to tread. I'm as certain as you are.

909
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:04,955
Isn't she magnificent?

910
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,702
Even in rehearsal, it's the greatest
performance I've ever seen.

911
00:57:08,168 --> 00:57:09,612
With the stimulus of an audience.

912
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:12,065
Monday night ought to make
her immortal in the theater.

913
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:13,793
What about that jinx?

914
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,644
Jonah himself couldn't
jinx a talent like that.

915
00:57:16,915 --> 00:57:17,644
Like it?

916
00:57:18,064 --> 00:57:20,449
It's alright I guess.
Needs a lot of work though.

917
00:57:20,923 --> 00:57:24,172
You know darling, if I could get away to
the country and go over this on Sunday.

918
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,793
I think I'd get a better perspective.
Can you run me down tonight?

919
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,669
Certainly. Not a bad idea.
We'd better get under way.

920
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:31,900
I want to stop by my apartment
to get my clothes.

921
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:33,147
Alright. Goodnight.

922
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:36,111
Goodnight, and keep her out of
the poison ivy and the fresh air.

923
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,063
I don't want her to open in a whisper.

924
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:44,779
Darling.

925
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:49,906
We can't go on like this.

926
00:57:50,392 --> 00:57:52,409
I could .. forever.

927
00:57:52,612 --> 00:57:54,586
Don't be evasive, Joyce.
You know what I mean.

928
00:57:56,045 --> 00:57:57,007
Getting married?

929
00:57:58,247 --> 00:57:59,026
Well ..

930
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,503
Of course. Sometime, darling.

931
00:58:01,947 --> 00:58:03,284
But right now there is the ..

932
00:58:03,575 --> 00:58:05,277
The show to think of.
- Look here, Joyce.

933
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,520
You always find some reason
to change the subject.

934
00:58:08,058 --> 00:58:09,962
Tell me the truth.
Why are you putting me off?

935
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:11,936
Don't be so intense, Don.

936
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,815
You know I love you and
that there is no-one else.

937
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,240
Isn't that enough?

938
00:58:16,443 --> 00:58:18,988
No, it's not enough. What's the matter?
Are you afraid to marry me?

939
00:58:19,688 --> 00:58:22,072
Afraid? Why should I be?

940
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,263
I don't know, unless you think marriage
will make me a bit harder to get rid of.

941
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:26,883
Don't say that Don. Don't.

942
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,103
That night you asked me a month ago.
I said I couldn't promise you tomorrows.

943
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,568
I can now.

944
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:35,122
I love you enough to
give them all to you.

945
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:37,033
At least as many as you want.

946
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:39,569
Then we'll be married right after
the opening on Monday night.

947
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:42,138
So soon?

948
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:44,707
If you meant what you said just
now that wouldn't seem soon.

949
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:47,556
It's not that, Don. Only ..
- Only what?

950
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:48,526
Well.

951
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:51,152
Marriage seems to make such
an issue out of everything.

952
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,267
Why can't we wait a while?
- No.

953
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,008
I'm not going to trail around after
you like a stage-door Johnny.

954
00:58:56,211 --> 00:58:58,818
And make a sap out of myself
waiting for you to get out of a mood.

955
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,766
I want you .. but I'm through begging.

956
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,029
It's either Monday night or never.

957
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:08,314
Well of course, darling.

958
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:10,098
Alright.

959
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:12,708
I'll marry you Monday,
right after the show.

960
00:59:13,413 --> 00:59:15,370
We'll go down to the
park for one glorious day ..

961
00:59:15,573 --> 00:59:18,513
And I hope it rains and washes the
bridge and the road and everything away.

962
00:59:18,817 --> 00:59:20,216
So we'll be marooned forever.

963
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:22,667
Put your arms around me
and tell me you love me.

964
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:25,707
Look, Joyce. You're almost hysterical.
What's the matter?

965
00:59:26,071 --> 00:59:29,413
Oh nothing. Excitement, nerves.
Worrying about the show.

966
00:59:29,723 --> 00:59:33,066
Listen, I've changed my mind.
I'm very tired from rehearsing.

967
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:35,892
I'd rather go to the country alone.
Would you lend me your car?

968
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,342
Sure. If you want. But I'd hate to
have you driving alone at night.

969
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,642
Don't be silly.

970
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,822
Now be a good boy, and
go now or you'll see me cry.

971
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:49,042
Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing I tell you, but stage fright.

972
00:59:49,277 --> 00:59:51,080
Go on now, there is
always a taxi out front.

973
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:55,369
I can see the old southern hospitality
and the artistic temperament don't mix.

974
00:59:55,836 --> 00:59:59,366
Goodnight, drive carefully and
leave the jitters down there.

975
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,670
I got your bag packed for you, honey.
- Well, put it down and get out of here.

976
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:23,122
Yes, ma'am.

977
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,050
Joyce.

978
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:33,591
I hoped you'd come
like this so many times.

979
01:01:35,055 --> 01:01:36,961
And you have, haven't you?
- Yes.

980
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:38,461
On business.

981
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:40,033
Come in.

982
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,839
I rather hate to have
you see my quarters.

983
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,685
Spare yourself any embarrassment.
I didn't come here out of curiosity.

984
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:54,107
You'll find this one more comfortable.

985
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,614
I shan't be here long enough
to find this one uncomfortable.

986
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:00,488
Cigarette?

987
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,981
No thank you.

988
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:21,168
You still hate me, don't you?
- No, Gordon. I don't.

989
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:23,692
There is an element of respect in hate.

990
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:25,817
The only feeling I have
for you is contempt.

991
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,618
You are very fortunate.

992
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,594
Contempt is much easier to carry in your
heart than a love you can't destroy.

993
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,492
You do love me, don't you Gordon?

994
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:41,873
When a man ruins his life for something,
it's liable to be pretty real.

995
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,258
I'm a bookkeeper now, Joyce.
In a company I used to own.

996
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:50,886
The worst of it is, I can't hate you.

997
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,413
I don't suppose you can understand that.

998
01:02:53,984 --> 01:02:55,779
I never could before. I do now.

999
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:00,052
You see, I loved somebody
that way too, Gordon.

1000
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:02,219
Heaven help you.

1001
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:05,090
Heaven help me if .. if you won't.

1002
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,046
You want me to divorce you?

1003
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:10,403
Oh yes, Gordon.

1004
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:13,895
I've told you time and
time again that I won't.

1005
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,669
You are my wife.

1006
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,108
Something you will never
be to any other man.

1007
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:22,773
Being your husband is the only thing
I've got left and I <i>won't</i> lose it.

1008
01:03:25,074 --> 01:03:26,839
You'll be my wife until the day I die.

1009
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:29,122
Then <i>I'll</i> divorce <i>you</i>.

1010
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:31,277
You can't, Joyce.

1011
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:34,294
You haven't any grounds.
You never will have.

1012
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:43,880
Gordon.

1013
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:47,034
I know I've ruined your happiness,
but don't ruin mine.

1014
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,416
If it's revenge you want,
I'll give it to you.

1015
01:03:49,686 --> 01:03:52,405
I'll beg, I'll crawl. I'll do
anything. Anything.

1016
01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:53,648
Gordon.

1017
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:55,416
Gordon, look at me.

1018
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:57,679
If you want to humiliate me,
you know how.

1019
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:00,591
But set me free, give me my
one chance of happiness.

1020
01:04:01,282 --> 01:04:02,314
Please Gordon.

1021
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,372
Please, please!

1022
01:04:06,527 --> 01:04:09,117
Oh you cheap, petty bookkeeper, you.

1023
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:14,152
Every time I think of those sticky hands
of yours touching me it makes me sick.

1024
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:15,731
'Sick' do you hear?

1025
01:04:16,306 --> 01:04:18,794
You are everything that's
repulsive to me. Your wife.

1026
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:22,154
I've never been a wife to you,
you poor, simpering fool.

1027
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:25,755
If you had any pride, if you were a
man, instead of a drooling milksop.

1028
01:04:26,144 --> 01:04:28,818
You'd throw me out and be ashamed
to admit you ever married me.

1029
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:35,782
I guess I'm better protected
against you than I used to be.

1030
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,691
Neither that, nor what
you said, seemed to hurt.

1031

Gordon.

1032
01:04:46,243 --> 01:04:48,218
Gordon .. you <i>can't</i> still love me.

1033
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,436
When you know how I feel.

1034
01:04:51,743 --> 01:04:52,644
Yes, I do.

1035
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:54,574
And .. and you ..?

1036
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:57,470
And I won't divorce you .. no.

1037
01:05:15,936 --> 01:05:16,779
Gordon.

1038
01:05:18,404 --> 01:05:20,919
Gordon, I guess we are
ordained never to be happy.

1039
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,516
So perhaps it would be better to make
the best of what we have and ..

1040
01:05:25,305 --> 01:05:27,174
To try and find contentment together.

1041
01:05:28,441 --> 01:05:30,901
That's all I'd ask, Joyce .. ever.

1042
01:05:32,313 --> 01:05:34,304
I'm going down to the
country over the weekend.

1043
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:36,633
Come along if you like.

1044
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:39,356
May I, Joyce?

1045
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:41,112
May I?

1046
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:53,641
Gordon.

1047
01:05:54,271 --> 01:05:56,771
Would nothing in the world
induce you to divorce me?

1048
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:58,693
Nothing.

1049
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,360
Not even to save your life?
- No.

1050
01:06:02,346 --> 01:06:04,530
Then we're going to settle
this thing once and for all.

1051
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:06,686
If I can't have him, I'd rather be dead.

1052
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:09,972
It's going to be your life or mine.
- Good.

1053
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:13,956
We're coming to a tree in the
middle of the road. We're taking it.

1054
01:06:14,323 --> 01:06:15,900
If you're killed, I'll be free.

1055
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:17,980
If I'm killed, it really doesn't matter.

1056
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:20,093
If we both die .. good riddance.

1057
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:21,290
Good.

1058
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:24,174
You've taken everything but my life.
I don't want that without you.

1059
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,102
Go ahead .. crash it.

1060
01:06:37,712 --> 01:06:39,136
Well, I heard a crash.

1061
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,852
And I came a-running.

1062
01:06:41,389 --> 01:06:44,543
Then I saw Miss Heath with this fellow.
And that's all I know.

1063
01:06:45,122 --> 01:06:47,662
I wonder how badly
the little thing is hurt.

1064
01:06:47,982 --> 01:06:49,508
How do you know it was Joyce Heath?

1065
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:52,171
Well, she's been staying
at Mr Bellows' farm.

1066
01:06:52,656 --> 01:06:54,827
I ought to know. I'm his housekeeper.

1067
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:57,440
Mr Bellows? You mean
Donald Bellows the architect?

1068
01:06:57,645 --> 01:06:58,828
That's who I mean.

1069
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:01,580
And if you want to know more
you'd better ask him yourself.

1070
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:03,610
He should be here by now. I phoned.

1071
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,171
Yeah thanks.
It may be a good idea to ask.

1072
01:07:12,733 --> 01:07:15,588
Listen, I need First Aid.
I'm a reporter, I got a lead.

1073
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:19,071
I don't want to use the payphone
because of the other reporters, so ..

1074
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:21,875
Can I use yours?
- I suppose so.

Yeah, juicy.

1080
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:43,407
Joyce Heath who's opening a new show on
Monday was hurt in an auto accident.

1081
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:45,970
With her was an, as yet,
unidentified man.

1082

The housekeeper for Don Bellows,
socialite and architect.

1083

Just admitted Joyce had
been living at his farm.

1084
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:55,608
Bellows recently broke his engagement to
Gail Armitage of the 'Utter Armitages'.

1085
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:58,144
Yeah. Better check that
last and I'll call you back.

1086
01:07:58,347 --> 01:08:01,219
And get your bucket and spade ready,
as I think we'll dish up some dirt.

1087
01:08:01,765 --> 01:08:02,554
Okay.

1088
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:09,727
Well .. it's better than collecting
garbage. It's not so heavy.

1089
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:15,485
Pardon me.
- Yes?

It isn't serious, is it?

1092
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:20,156
Well.

1093
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:22,657
There's the Doctor now. Doctor.

1094
01:08:24,064 --> 01:08:25,850
Doctor, this is Mr Bellows
about Miss Heath.

1095
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:27,673
How is she?
- Badly shaken up.

1096
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:30,604
Suffering from shock and
a very slight concussion.

1097
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,981
She may be on her feet
in a couple of weeks.

The man however, is very seriously hurt.

1099
01:08:36,014 --> 01:08:38,192
It may be more than a year
before he'll be able to walk.

- Gordon Heath.

Yes. He's been identified
as her husband.

1103
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:47,719
Her husband?

1104
01:08:48,048 --> 01:08:50,700
Mrs Heath is conscious if you would
care to see her for a few minutes.

1105
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:52,546
No, I don't want to see her.

1106
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,746
Please see they both
get every possible care.

1107
01:08:57,706 --> 01:08:59,180
Anything. I'll be responsible.

1108
01:09:01,424 --> 01:09:03,261
I think you just handed him one, Doc.

Oh yes, Don.

We've got to open without her.

What else can I do?

1115
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,583
The understudy.

1116
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:37,437
And she'll put the show right back
on the truck for Keynes warehouse.

1117
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:41,785
Yes, she's jinxed you out of $80,000,
me out of the best show I ever had.

1118

would make her a great American actress.

You can't sell me out.
I'm ready to start.

1130
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:18,776
It's rumored that you put $80,000
in a show that's doomed to fail.

1131
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:21,396
Is that correct?
- Fail?

1132
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,772
Yes .. it will fail but ..

1133
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,337
I can borrow that someplace else.

That's only a technicality.

1135
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,526
We're forced to take advantage
of that technicality.

1136
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:35,790
The board of directors, most of whom
are socially prominent .. insist on it.

1137
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:39,888
Would you mind being
specific instead of subtle.

1138
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:44,678
They feel the people who would've bought
the estates are prejudiced against you.

1139
01:10:45,401 --> 01:10:47,463
In other words, they don't
think you can sell them.

1140

They won't. They or anybody else.

I ever earned into those estates.

You mean you can't help
being rotten and selfish.

1170
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:23,523

and go on, leaving someone else to pay.

Is that selfishness?

1174

Yes, as you were afraid to risk losing
me by telling me you had a husband.

1175
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,218
So, instead you lied and ruined me.

1191
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:02,349
Of course you know.

1192
01:14:02,762 --> 01:14:05,297
To reopen a play that's failed
and make a success of it.

1193
01:14:05,668 --> 01:14:08,124
Is next to impossible.
- The play wasn't a failure.

1194
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:10,313
The only failure was mine to appear.

1195
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:12,365
I can make that play a success.

1196
01:14:12,763 --> 01:14:14,181
You're quite confident?

1197
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:17,231
More than confident. I'm positive.

1198
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:19,032
Why?

1199
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:21,304
Four very distinct reasons.

1200
01:14:22,008 --> 01:14:24,865
Any one of them so important to
me that it makes failure impossible.

1201
01:14:26,074 --> 01:14:28,254
First, I'm the only actress
suited to that part.

1202
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,723
Second. Don must get his money back.

1203
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:36,112
Third, I have a husband who's
injured for life because of me.

1204
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,526
I must support him.

1205
01:14:39,538 --> 01:14:41,244
And last but most important.

1206
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:43,664
I found out how to break my jinx.

1207
01:14:44,669 --> 01:14:45,713
By paying my debts.

1208
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:50,529
Are you strong enough to
start rehearsing Monday?

1209
01:14:52,445 --> 01:14:53,093
Yes.

1210
01:14:55,853 --> 01:14:56,915
I've got to be.

1211
01:14:58,033 --> 01:14:59,535
Monday morning at ten, then.

1212
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:00,880
Monday morning at ten.

1213
01:15:01,685 --> 01:15:02,869
Thanks so much.

1214
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:26,834
Pardon the coincidence.

1215
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:28,547
It's no coincidence, Joyce.

1216
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,903
I've been looking for you.
They told me you'd come here.

1217
01:15:31,476 --> 01:15:32,823
I want to talk to you.

1218
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:35,172
You were very frank the
last time we talked together.

1219
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,604
Everything I said was the truth.

1220
01:15:42,824 --> 01:15:45,194
Let me be just as frank
and just as honest.

1221
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:48,687
You're no longer important to me.

1222
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,103
Your importance ended
when the show closed.

1223
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,802
You mean, I was just a means to an end?

1224
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:58,041
Why not call it that?

1225
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,970
How cheap.
- No, I ..

1226
01:16:04,717 --> 01:16:05,933
I'm rather expensive.

1227
01:16:06,816 --> 01:16:08,110
Remember what it cost you.

1228
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:28,751
Darling.

1229
01:16:31,484 --> 01:16:32,652
Oh, darling.

1230
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,223
Oh, darling.

1231
01:18:26,908 --> 01:18:27,736
..t-g..
