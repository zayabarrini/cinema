A perfectly normal thing to do.

and make your highness
feel a little happy.

You will. It may take
a little time to take hold.

Just lie back.

Of course.

340
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,035
worn a nightgown in years.

341
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,840
Will you help me get undressed...

342
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,708
please?

343
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,246
Uh...

344
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:22,048
Ok.

345
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:37,730
Uh... there you are.
You can handle the rest.

346
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,043
May I have some?

347
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,847
No.

348
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,716
Now, look...

349
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,685
This is very unusual.

350
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,188
I've never been alone with a man before...

351
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,657
even with my dress on.

352
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:08,695
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

353
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,864
Ha! I don't seem to mind.

354
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,066
Do you?

355
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,706
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

356
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,874
You'd better get to sleep.

357
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,209
Mmm...

358
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,211
Oh, no. On this one.

359
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,213
So terribly nice.

360
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,215
Hey. Hey.

361
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,184
These are pajamas. They're to sleep in.

362
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,220
You're to climb into them.

363
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,855
You understand?

364
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,189
Thank you.

365
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,726
And you're sleeping on the couch...

366
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,894
not on the bed.

367
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,195
Is that clear?

368
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,698
Do you know my favorite poem?

369
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,067
You already recited that for me.

370
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,203
"Arethusa rose from her couch of snows...

371
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,873
in the acroceraunian mountains."

372
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,241
Keats.

373
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,709
Shelley.

374
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,246
Keep your mind off
poetry and on the pajamas.

375
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,714
Keats.

376
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,984
Shelley. I'll be back in 1o minutes.

377
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,086
Keats.

378
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,730
You have my permission to withdraw.

379
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,100
Thank you very much.

380
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,209
Well, no trace, your excellency.

381
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,211
Have you searched the grounds?

382
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,747
From the attics to the cellar.

383
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,984
You must not speak of this to anyone.

384
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:41,754
The princess is the
direct heir to the throne.

385
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,756
This must be top crisis secret.

386
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:46,025
Have I your pledge?

387
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,226
Yes, sir.

388
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,728
Very well.

389
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:54,100
Now we must notify their majesties.

390
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,919
Uh...

391
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,787
Ohh...

392
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,798
(DOOR SLAMS)

393
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,910
(SCRAPES AGAINST FLOOR)

394
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,812
Umm.

395
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,548
So happy.

396
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,952
The pleasure's mine.

397
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,124
Ah, screwball.

398
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,845
(STRIKING THE HOUR)

399
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,972
Holy smoke. The princess interview.

400
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,273
Hmm?

401
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,275
11:45.

402
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,609
Ahh.

403
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,478
Ah, shh.

404
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,623
Hi, Joe.

405
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,292
Good morning, Joe.

406
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,194
Hello, honey.

407
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:14,200
Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you.

408
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,169
Uh-oh.

409
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,173
Thanks a lot, hon.

410
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,176
Come in!

411
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,284
You've been looking for me?

412
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,120
Just coming to work?

413
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,622
We start our days at 8:3o.

414
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,624
We pick up our assignments...

415
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,127
I picked mine up last night.

416
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,295
What assignment was that?

417
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,131
The princess. 11:45.

418
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,536
You've already been to the interview?

419
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,204
Sure. I just got back.

420
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:57,276
Well, well, well, all my apologies.

421
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,610
It's all right.

422
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,446
This is very interesting.

423
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:04,150
Did she answer all the
questions on the list?

424
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,652
Of course. I've got them somewhere.

425
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,455
Don't disturb yourself.
I have a copy here.

426
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:13,159
How did her highness react
to a european federation?

427
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,594
She thought it was just fine.

428
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,030
She did?

429
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,300
Well, she thought that there would be...

430
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,634
two effects...

431
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,670
The direct and the indirect.

432
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,172
Remarkable.

433
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,640
Naturally, she thought
that the indirect...

434
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,179
would not be as direct... as the direct.

435
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,314
That is, not right away.

436
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,183
No, no, no, no.

437
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,318
Later on, of course, well...

438
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,652
Nobody knows.

439
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,154
Well, well, well.

440
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,156
That was a shrewd observation.

441
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,325
They fool you, you know...

442
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,626
these royal kids.

443
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,628
They've got a lot more...

444
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,163
on the ball than we suspect.

445
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,165
How did she feel about...

446
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,435
the future friendship of nations?

447
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,637
Youth.

448
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:02,174
She felt that the youth of the world...

449
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:08,347
must lead the way to a better... world.

450
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,648
Original.

451
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:13,185
Uh, by the way, what was she wearing?

452
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,188
Oh, you mean, what did she have on?

453
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,490
Well, that's usually what it means.

454
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,161
What's wrong?
Is it a little warm in here?

455
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,496
No. I just hurried over here.

456
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:27,633
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

457
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,669
Did you say she was wearing gray?

458
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,638
She usually wears gray.

459
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,641
Well, it was a kind of a gray.

460
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,644
I think I know the dress you mean.

461
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,679
It has a gold collar.

462
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,248
That's the one.

463
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,184
I think you described it very well...

464
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,187
In view of the fact that her highness...

465
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,589
was taken violently ill at 3 A.M...

466
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,192
put to bed with a fever...

467
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,195
and has had all her
appointments for today...

468
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,663
canceled in Toto!

469
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,265
In... Toto?

470
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:03,402
Yes, Mr. Bradley, in Toto.

471
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,670
(GULP)

472
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,173
It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

473
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:11,177
In view of the fact
that you just left her.

474
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,679
It's all over the front page...

475
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,547
of every newspaper in Rome.

476
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,684
Ok, I overslept.
It can happen to anybody.

477
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,253
If you read a morning paper...

478
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,289
you might discover little items...

479
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:26,325
that might prevent you
from getting immersed...

480
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:29,695
in such a gold-plated,
star-spangled lie...

481
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,530
as you have just told.

482
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,201
If I were you, I'd try
some other business...

483
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,702
Like mattress testing.

484
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,570
Is this the princess?

485
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,107
Yes, that is the princess.

486
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,708
It isn't Annie Oakley...

487
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,710
or madame chiang kai-shek.

488
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,512
Take a good look.

489
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,715
You might be interviewing
her again someday.

490
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,183
Am I fired?

491
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,186
No. When I want to fire you...

492
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,323
you won't have to ask... you'll know!

493
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,561
The man's mad.

494
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,350
(RING)

495
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,617
Pronto.

496
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,719
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

497
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,223
I want you to hurry up to my place...

498
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:34,860
and see if there's somebody there asleep.

499
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,230
Aha. Sure, Mr. Joe.

500
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,232
I look subito.

501
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:43,269
You wait. Aspetta.

502
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:03,789
Mr. Joe?

503
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,225
Yeah! Tell me. Tell me.

504
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:08,427
Bellissima!

505
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:13,199
Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

506
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,267
Yes, Mr. Joe?

507
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,404
A gun?

508
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,538
No!

But nobody goes in, and nobody goes out.

511

Capito?

512
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,614
Ok.

513
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,262
You still here?

514
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,764
How much would a real interview...

515
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,566
with this dame be worth?

516
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,001
Are you referring to her highness?

517
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,239
I'm not referring to Annie Oakley.
How much?

518
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,275
What do you care? You got no chance.

519
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,876
But if I did?

520
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:02,013
A plain talk on world
conditions might be worth $25o.

521
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,500
Her views on clothes
would be worth more... 1,000.

522
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Dollars?

523
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,755
I'm talking about
her views on everything.

longings of a princess.

00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:18,264
as revealed to your Rome correspondent...

528
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:23,669
in a private... personal... exclusive...

529
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:26,304
Interview.

530
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,743
Can't use it, huh?

531
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,713
I didn't think you'd like it.

532

Come here.

533
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,755
Love angle, too, I suppose?

534
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,757
Practically all love angle.

535
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,293
With pictures.

536
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,060
Could be. How much?

will be worth five grand...

00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,771
just how you are going to obtain...

541
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,307
this fantastic interview.

I'll enter her sickroom
disguised as a thermometer.

543

I want you to shake on five grand.

544
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,751
And you realize her highness
leaves for athens tomorrow?

545
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,719
Yep.

546
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,589
I'd like to make a
little side bet with you.

547
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,627
5oo says you don't
come up with the story.

548
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:29,067
What are you looking at that for?

549
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,837
I'm seeing what day it is.

550
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,071
It's a deal!

551
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,974
Now I'd like you to shake.

552
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,080
You're into me for about 5oo now.

553
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,115
When you lose this bet...

554
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,084
you'll owe me a thousand.

555
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,087
Why, you poor sucker,
I'll practically own you.

556
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,089
You have practically owned me.

557
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,092
I'm going to win that money, though...

558
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:58,096
and buy a one-way ticket
back to New York.

I love to hear you whine.

When I'm back in a real news room...

561
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,603
I'll enjoy thinking about you...

562
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,005
with an empty leash in your hands...

563
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,775
and nobody to twitch for you.

01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:55,399
Mr. Bradley, I have a confession to make.

853
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:56,901
Confession?

854
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,403
Yes. I ran away last night...

855
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,905
From school.

856
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,973
Oh, what was the matter?

857
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,942
Trouble with the teacher?

858
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,476
Nothing like that.

859
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,479
You don't just run away for nothing.

860
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:13,017
I only meant it to be for an hour.

861
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:16,153
They gave me something to make me sleep.

862
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:17,521
Oh, I see.

863
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,023
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

864
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:22,526
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

865
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:23,994
Before you do...

866
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:28,065
why don't you take a
little time for yourself?

867
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,034
Maybe another hour.

868
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:32,903
Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

869
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:36,440
I could do some things
I've always wanted to.

870
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,942
Like what?

871
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:39,409
You can't imagine.

872
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,412
I'd like to do just whatever I like...

873
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,381
the whole day long.

874
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,283
Like having your hair cut?

875
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,954
Yes. I'd like to sit in a sidewalk cafe...

876
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:51,922
and look in shop windows...

877
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,924
walk in the rain...

878
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,426
have fun and maybe some excitement.

879
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,429
Doesn't seem much to you, does it?

880
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,931
It's great.

881
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:02,266
Tell you what.

882
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:05,435
Why don't we do all those things...

883
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,937
Together?

884
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:09,039
Don't you have to work?

885
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,041
Work? No. Today's a holiday.

886
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:14,044
You don't want to do those silly things.

887
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:16,046
Don't I? First wish...

888
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,482
One sidewalk cafe, coming right up.

889
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:21,418
I know just the place... Rocca's.

890
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:31,161
What will the people at school say...

891
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,630
when they see your new haircut?

892
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,232
They'll have a fit.

893
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,034
What would they say if they knew.

894
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,669
I'd spent the night in your room?

895
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,407
Don't tell your folks. I won't tell mine.

896
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:45,509
It's a pact.

897
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,244
What would you like to drink?

898
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:50,414
Champagne, please.

899
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,983
Um, cameriere.

900
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,451
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

901
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,953
Champagne?

902
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,254
Si, si.

903
01:05:57,354 --> 01:05:59,957
Well, champagne per la signorina...

904
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,993
and, uh, cold coffee for me.

905
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,664
Must be quite a life
you have in that school...

906
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:09,099
Champagne for lunch.

907
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,936
Only on special occasions.

908
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:15,139
The last time was my
father's anniversary.

909
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:16,440
Wedding?

910
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,943
No. It was the 40th anniversary.

911
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:21,946
Of the day he got his job.

912
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:25,449
4o years on the job. What do you know?

913
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:27,451
What does he do?

914
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,987
Well, mostly you might call it...

915
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,989
public relations.

916
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,958
Oh, that's hard work.

917
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:36,460
Yes. I wouldn't care for it.

918
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,962
Does he?

919
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:40,464
I've heard him complain about it.

920
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:42,432
Why doesn't he quit?

921
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,969
People in that line of work...

922
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:46,971
almost never do quit...

923
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:49,974
unless it's actually
unhealthy for them to continue.

924
01:06:50,074 --> 01:06:51,976
Here's to his health, then.

925
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:55,011
You know, that's what everybody says.

926
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:00,985
It's all right?

927
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,452
Yes, thank you.

928
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,321
What is your work?

929
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:07,757
Oh, I'm, uh... in the selling game.

930
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,459
Really? How interesting.

931
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,996
What do you sell?

932
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:13,998
(HORSE WHINNIES)

933
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:15,765
Uh, fertilizer.

934
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,468
Chemicals. You know, chemicals.

935
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:20,137
Stuff like that.

936
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:22,038
Huh.

937
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:30,147
Irving! Well, am I glad to see you!

938
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,582
Why? Did you forget your wallet?

939
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,419
Pull up a chair. Sit down with us.

940
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,024
This is a good friend, Irving Radovich.
Anya, Irving.

941
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:41,458
Anya...

942
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,759
Smith.

943
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,461
Oh. Hiya, Smitty.

944
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,330
Charmed.

945
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,034
Hey, anybody ever tell you...

946
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:53,503
you're a dead ringer for... ow!

947
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,143
Uh, well, uh...

948
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,111
I guess I'll be going.

949
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:04,248
Don't do that, Irving. Sit down. Join us.

950
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:06,150
Join us.

951
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,785
Well, uh...

952
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:10,820
just till Francesca gets here.

953
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,490
Tell me, Mr. Radovich...

954
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,492
what is a ringer?

955
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,194
Oh, waiter?

956
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:19,396
It's an american term...

957
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,198
and it means, uh...

958
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,401
anyone who has a great deal of charm.

959
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,802
Oh.

960
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,471
Thank you.

961
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:28,805
You're welcome.

962
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:30,440
Ciao, Irving.

963
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,775
Ciao.

964
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,310
Oh, ciao. Cousins.

965
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,812
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me...

966
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,814
all about his work.

967
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,450
I'd like to have heard that.

968
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,319
What do you do?

969
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:44,821
The same as Joe, only I'm...

970
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:46,323
Oh!

971
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,458
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

972
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:50,494
What... what are you...

973
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:51,828
I'm sorry.

974
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:55,832
I can take a hint. I'll see you around.

975
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,834
Your drink's just here.

976
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,503
Take it easy.

977
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:01,305
I'm sorry about that.

978
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,840
Sit down. That's a good fellow.

979
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,276
That's the boy.

980
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,312
You're tw...

981
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:10,814
You're twisting my arm, you know.

982
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:14,318
Just be a little
more careful not to spill.

983
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:16,486
Who's been doing the spilling?

984
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:17,587
You.

985
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:18,722
Me?

986
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,224
Yeah.

987
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:23,293
Where did you find this loony?

988
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,497
You're ok.

989
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,333
Here's to you, huh?

990
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:31,335
Here's hoping for the best.

991
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:33,870
If it wasn't for that hair...

992
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:36,340
I'd swear that...

993
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,641
Aah!

994
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:38,875
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

995
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:41,211
Thanks.

996
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:43,847
You slipped and almost hurt yourself.

997
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:45,515
I slipped?

998
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,851
I almost hurt myself?

999
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:49,819
Joe, I didn't slip!

1000
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,821
You've got a bad sprain.

1001
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,824
We'd better go and get it fixed up.

1002
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,860
Excuse us for a minute.

1003
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,362
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:09:58,462 --> 01:10:00,364
Joe, now wait a minute.

1005
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,832
What are you trying to do?

1006
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,834
Have you got your lighter?

1007
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,671
Yeah. What are you trying to do?

1008
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,874
Listen. What would you do for five grand?

1009
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,342
Five grand?

1010
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:16,380
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

1011
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,516
This is my story. I dug it up.

1012
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:20,850
She's really the...

1013
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,853
Shh. Your tin-types will make this epic...

1014
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,355
twice as valuable.

"The princess goes slumming."

1016
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:30,360
You're in for 25% of the take.

1017
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,862
The take's 5 grands. That's $1,500.

1018
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,531
It's 1,250.

1019
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,533
Ok. Now you shake.

1020
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:37,867

01:43:26,334 --> 01:43:29,737
Then comes the news of the
lady's miraculous recovery.

1356
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:31,573
It all adds up.

1357
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:35,243
Don't think you'll raise
the price of that story.

1358
01:43:35,343 --> 01:43:37,245
A deal's a deal.

1359
01:43:37,345 --> 01:43:39,914
Come on, come on, where is that story?

1360
01:43:40,014 --> 01:43:42,250
I have no story.

1361
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:44,719
Then what was the idea of...

1362
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:46,588
Joe!

1363
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:50,425
Man, wait till you see these.

1364
01:43:50,525 --> 01:43:53,395
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy. You got here on time.

1365
01:43:53,495 --> 01:43:55,730
Wait till you get a look...

1366
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:57,532
What's the idea?

1367
01:43:57,632 --> 01:44:01,569
What do you mean charging
in here and spilling things?

1368
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:05,240
I spoke to you about that
once before, remember?

1369
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,275
Joe, look at my pants.

1370
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:09,277
Come dry them off.

1371
01:44:09,377 --> 01:44:10,712
Nuts to that.

1372
01:44:10,812 --> 01:44:13,415
Did you tell him about Smitty?

1373
01:44:13,515 --> 01:44:14,416
Smitty?

1374
01:44:14,516 --> 01:44:15,517
Irving.

1375
01:44:15,617 --> 01:44:16,718
Wait till...

1376
01:44:16,818 --> 01:44:19,287
There you go again, Irving.

1377
01:44:20,855 --> 01:44:22,290
Joe.

1378
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:24,759
All right, save that till later.

1379
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:27,795
Why don't you go home and shave?

1380
01:44:27,895 --> 01:44:28,963
Shave?

1381
01:44:29,063 --> 01:44:30,398
Or keep quiet...

1382
01:44:30,498 --> 01:44:33,601
till Mr. Hennessy and I finish talking.

1383
01:44:33,701 --> 01:44:36,771
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1384
01:44:36,871 --> 01:44:38,273
Who's Smitty?

1385
01:44:38,373 --> 01:44:40,242
A guy that we met.

1386
01:44:40,342 --> 01:44:42,577
What am I supposed to see?

1387
01:44:42,677 --> 01:44:45,280
Irving's dames. You wouldn't like them.

1388
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,249
Uh, maybe you would.

1389
01:44:47,349 --> 01:44:49,584
When you came into my office...

1390
01:44:49,684 --> 01:44:53,255
I thought I had a lead. I was wrong.

1391
01:44:53,355 --> 01:44:57,559
That's all there is to it.
There is no story.

1392
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:01,863
She's holding the press interview today.

1393
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:03,831
Same time, same place.

1394
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:07,469
Maybe that's one story you can get.

1395
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:10,037
And you owe me 5oo bucks!

1396
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:14,276
Take it out of my salary...
5o bucks a week.

1397
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:16,311
Don't think I won't.

1398
01:45:16,411 --> 01:45:17,745
(DOOR CLOSES)

1399
01:45:17,845 --> 01:45:19,046
Hey, what gives?

1400
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:21,583
Have we had a better offer?

1401
01:45:21,683 --> 01:45:26,053
Irving, I don't know just
how to tell you this, but...

1402
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:29,323
Wait till I sit down.

1403
01:45:30,692 --> 01:45:37,299
Well, in regard to the
story that goes with these...

1404
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:39,867
There is no story.

1405
01:45:41,403 --> 01:45:42,904
Why not?

1406
01:45:43,004 --> 01:45:47,409
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1407
01:45:57,685 --> 01:46:00,588
Uh... hey, the pictures
came out pretty well.

1408
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:05,760
You... want to have a look at them?

1409
01:46:10,565 --> 01:46:11,966
Huh?

1410
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:16,538
How about a blowup...

1411
01:46:16,638 --> 01:46:19,040
from a negative that size, huh?

1412
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:22,109
Oh, that's her first cigarette, huh?

1413
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,778
Oh, yeah.

1414
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:26,013
Hey, the mouth of truth.

1415
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:27,582
Ha ha ha!

1416
01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:29,984
Here's the caption I thought of...

1417
01:46:30,084 --> 01:46:31,919
"Barber cuts in." Huh?

1418
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:36,691
I figured this would be the
key shot for the layout...

1419
01:46:36,791 --> 01:46:38,860
"The wall where wishes come true."

1420
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,362
Joe, that's good.

1421
01:46:40,462 --> 01:46:44,366
Lead off with that, then
follow up with the wishes.

1422
01:46:44,466 --> 01:46:47,369
I dug that up out of the file.

1423
01:46:47,469 --> 01:46:48,870
"Princess inspects police."

1424
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:51,105
Yeah.

1425
01:46:51,205 --> 01:46:52,774
"Police inspects princess."

1426
01:46:52,874 --> 01:46:54,709
Oh!

1427
01:46:54,809 --> 01:46:56,010
How about... oh!

1428
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:58,880
I got a topper for you.

1429
01:47:00,848 --> 01:47:01,783
Wow!

1430
01:47:01,883 --> 01:47:03,785
Is that a shot, Joe?

1431
01:47:03,885 --> 01:47:05,620
What a picture!

1432
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,789
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1433
01:47:07,889 --> 01:47:09,090
How about this...

1434
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:10,758
"Crowned head." Huh?

1435
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:12,594
Oh, I get it!

1436
01:47:12,694 --> 01:47:14,962
That's... Joe, you got...

1437
01:47:20,868 --> 01:47:22,604
She's fair game, Joe.

1438
01:47:22,704 --> 01:47:25,973
It's always open season on princesses.

1439
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:30,144
You must be out of your mind.

1440
01:47:30,244 --> 01:47:32,146
Yeah, I know, but...

1441
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:35,149
I can't prevent you
from selling the pictures...

1442

if you want to.

Yeah!

01:47:46,728 --> 01:47:48,930
You going to the interview?

1446
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,598
Are you going?

1447
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:53,768
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1448
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:56,003
Yeah.

1449
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:03,010
I'll see you.

1450
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:21,696
It ain't much, but it's home.

1451
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:34,709
Ladies and gentlemen, please approach.

Ladies and gentlemen...

1457
01:50:16,911 --> 01:50:19,914
her royal highness will now
answer your questions.

1458
01:50:20,014 --> 01:50:22,584
I believe at the outset, your highness...

1459
01:50:22,684 --> 01:50:26,588
that I should express
the pleasure of all of us...

1460
01:50:26,688 --> 01:50:29,957
at your recovery from the recent illness.

1461
01:50:31,192 --> 01:50:33,027
Thank you.

1462
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:37,064
Does your highness
believe that federation...

1463
01:50:37,164 --> 01:50:38,714
would be a possible solution...

1464
01:50:38,814 --> 01:50:41,235
to europe's economic problems?

1465
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:44,371
I am in favor of any measure...

1466
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:49,376
which would lead to closer
cooperation in europe.

1467
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:52,379
And what, in the opinion
of your highness...

1468
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:56,383
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

1469
01:50:56,483 --> 01:51:00,755
I have every faith in it...

1470
01:51:00,855 --> 01:51:06,761
as I have faith in
relations between people.

1471
01:51:10,264 --> 01:51:16,403
May I say, speaking
for my own press service...

1472
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:19,073
we believe that your highness' faith...

1473
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:23,010
will not be unjustified.

1474
01:51:25,479 --> 01:51:30,384
I am so glad to hear you say it.

1475
01:51:30,484 --> 01:51:32,386
Which of the cities visited...

1476
01:51:32,486 --> 01:51:35,289
did your highness enjoy the most?

1477
01:51:44,165 --> 01:51:46,968
Each in its own way...

1478
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:53,941
Each in its own way was... unforgettable.

1479
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:56,978
It would be difficult to...

1480
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,682

1481
01:52:00,782 --> 01:52:02,416

Despite that.

1487
