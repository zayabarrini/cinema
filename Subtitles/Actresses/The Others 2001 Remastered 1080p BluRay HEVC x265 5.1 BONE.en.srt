1
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably??</i>

2
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:08,985
<i>Then I'll begin.</i>

3
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>This story started
many thousands of years ago,</i>

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,617
<i>but it was all over in just seven days.</i>

5
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>All that long, long time ago,</i>

6
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>none of the things we can see now -</i>

7
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,584
<i>The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,</i>

8
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,377
<i>the animals and plants -</i>

9
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,462
<i>Not a single one existed.</i>

10
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:29,880
<i>Only God existed,</i>

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,633
<i>and so only he could have created them.</i>

12
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>And he did.</i>

13
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,476
Simpson. What a character he was.

14
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,770
Wonder whatever became of him.

15
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,106
Oh, I imagine
he's dead like all the rest.

16
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,608
Ah, those were the days.

17
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,245
<i>Mr. “fume, your hair.</i>

18
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,629
Yes?

19
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,632
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the <i>-.</i>

20
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,551
Oh, yes, of course.

21
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,637
Come in.

22
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,266
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

23
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,192
Hmm. You are?

24
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

25
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,780
<i>And MS is Edmund “Yuma.</i>

26
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,448
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

27
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,783
You must be the gardener.

28
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,410
Ah, that's right. The gardener.

29
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,914
And, uh, this young lady is called Lydia.

30
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,125
Have you had much experience in service?

31
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,086
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

32
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,339
She's older than she looks.

33
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,257
Can you iron?

34
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,678
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

35
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,224
Uh, she can't talk, ma'am.

36
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,684
The poor little mite's a mute.

37
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:12,269
Oh.

38
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:15,064
Oh, but she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.

39
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,191
All right.

40
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,569
All right. The other girl I had
spoke too much, anyway.

41
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,821
Follow me.

42
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,322
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl,

43
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,075
you will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

44
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,202
And, uh, you, Mr...

45
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,287
- Tuttle, ma'am.
- Ah, Tuttle.

46
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:33,791
Uh, you could sleep in the shed
around the back.

47
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,253
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected

48
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,713
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

49
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:42,174
You mean they just vanished?

50
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,467
Into thin air.

51
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:47,012
No notice, nothing.
They didn't even collect their wages.

52
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,974
They - They just left us.

53
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,809
What a strange thing to do.

54
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,436
You'll soon find out there are times

55
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:56,856
when this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

56
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:03,195
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper
requesting honest, hardworking people.

57
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,823
Well, there's nobody more honest
or hardworking than us.

58
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,449
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

59
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,451
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

60
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:12,621
And, urn, very hardworking.

61
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,001
The kitchen.

62
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,962
I have breakfast at 8:00,

63
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,797
the children at 9:00.

64
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:25,175
Lunch will be served at 1:00
and dinner at half past 7:00.

65
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,802
And the master, ma'am?

66
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,974
The master went off to war

67
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,518
a year and a half ago.

68
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,771
I've had no news since the war ended.

69
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,316
Which of you does the cooking?

70
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,817
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

71
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,570
Which of you does the cooking?

72
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,322
You'll notice what I'm doing.

73
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,200
In this house, no door must be opened

74
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,453
without the previous one
being closed first.

75
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,914
It is vital that you remember this.

76
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,082
It is not as easy as it may seem.

77
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,127
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors,

78
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,880
depending on which area of the house
you are in at the time.

79
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,300
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards,

80
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,636
I will be leaving a set of keys
in your charge.

81
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,346
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,389
The music room.

83
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:14,516
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

84
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,603
Please do not let the children
thump away on it.

85
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,648
It sets off my migraine.

86
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:24,401
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

87
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,905
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio,

88
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,282
or anything else that makes a racket.

89
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,534
Uh, we don't have electricity, either.

90
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,828
During the war,
the Germans kept cutting it off,

91
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,747
so we just learned to live without it.

92
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,123
Let's continue.

93
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,376
Ma'am, there's really no need
to show us around the whole house -

94
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,460
Yes!

95
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,504
Yes, there is.

96
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,257
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

97
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,467
It's often difficult to make out

98
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,720
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

99
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,433
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,310
Wh-What do you mean, ma'am?

101
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,731
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

102
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,157
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

103
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,325
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,953
You two could start closing the curtains.

105
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,038
All of them.

106
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,278
Come.

107
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,499
I'll wake them. You wait here.

108
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,253
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.

109
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,009
Wakey-wakey.

110
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,013
Now, come on.

111
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,849
Eyes closed, hands together.

112
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,478
Let it be, at light of day,

113
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,730
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

114
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,982
Blessed be the Virgin pure,

115
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,318
whom I greet with faith so sure.

116
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,612
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose,

117
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,114
keep us fill this day doth close.

118
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,914
They're still half asleep.

119
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,500
What sweet little children.

120
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,088
Well, what do you say?

121
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,131
How do you do?

122
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,133
How do you do?

123
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,969
How do you do, children?

124
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:01,350
My name is Mrs. Mills,
but you can call me Bertha if you like.

125
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,310
What are your names?

126
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,271
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

127
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,773
Anne and Nicholas.

128
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,818
What pretty names.

129
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,028
Are you going to be our new nanny?

130
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,614
Mm-hmm.

131
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,119
Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.

132
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,912
It's time for their breakfast.

133
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,540
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

134
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,007
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

135
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,300
For what?

136
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,636
Their condition.

137
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,974
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

138
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,017
They are photosensitive

139
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:47,104
and they must never be exposed
to any light much stronger than this.

140
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,276
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes,
they will break out in sores and blisters

141
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,945
and begin to suffocate.

142
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,697
It would eventually be fatal.

143
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,157
Good heavens.

144
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,785
I don't like this toast.

145
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,579
Oh? Why not?

146
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,080
It tastes funny.

147
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,624
I liked it better before.

148
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,545
Well, that's because before,
somebody else made it.

149
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,381
When are they coming back?

150
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,926
They're not coming back, child.

151
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,262
Just like Daddy.

152
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,473
Daddy is coming back, though.

153
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,853
Mrs. Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France, you know.

154
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,021
It's the World War.

155
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,064
I know, but he's in France.

156
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,401
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

157
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,571
Are you going to leave us too?

158
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,074
Of course not.

159
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,161
Why should I leave you?

160
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,414
The others said they wouldn't,
but they did.

161
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,957
And then it happened.

162
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,292
Be quiet.

163
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,547
What do you mean, Anne? What happened?

164
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,220
Mummy went... mad.

165
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,847
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

166
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,849
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

167
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,142
Be quiet.

168
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,230
What's going on?

169
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,025
I want to see those plates empty
in less than a minute. Is that clear?

170
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,864
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

171
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,616
I'd like a word with you.

172
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,203
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,751
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.

174
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,880
But I just checked the letter box,
and this week he hasn't.

175
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,467
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

176
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,094
This letter should have been collected

177
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,554
and delivered to the newspaper
five days ago.

178
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,474
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published,

179
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,102
would you mind explaining to me
what you're doing here?

180
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,687
Oh, I understand.

181
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,191
Well, ma'am, that's exactly
what I was going to say to you

182
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,859
when you opened the door to us.

183
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,947
The truth is that we just come by
on the off chance.

184
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,077
You know, a big house like this is always
in need of someone who knows the ropes.

185
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,621
You mean, you've served in a house
like this one before?

186
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,499
This may come
as a surprise to you, ma'am, but...

187
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,336
we, in fact, used to work here.

188
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
Here?

189
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,758
Oh, now, 'twas a few years ago.

190
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:28,765
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am,
they were the best years of my life.

191
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:35,439
That's why we come by,
because this house... means a lot to us.

192
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,608
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

193
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,153
No, no, no. Don't bother. There's no need.

194
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
Uh, so you say you know the house well?

195
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,991
Like the back of my hand.

196
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,119
Well, that is always assuming
that the walls haven't sprouted legs

197
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,330
and moved in the meantime.

198
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,749
The only thing
that moves here is the light.

199
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,046
But it changes everything.

200
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,345
It's rather difficult, to say the least.

201
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,350
One might almost say... unbearable.

202
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:17,564
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

203
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,941
Oh, yes, ma'am.

204
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,860
I don't like fantasies.

205
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,030
Strange ideas. Do you know what I mean?

206
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,158
I think so, ma'am.

207
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,869
My children sometimes have strange ideas.

208
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,998
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.

209
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,376
Children will be children.

210
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,420
Yes, of course, ma'am.

211
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,464
All right.

212
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,801
You can stay.

213
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,221
Thank you very much, ma'am.

214
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,609
It did happen.

215
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:16,998
"The Roman governor tried to make them
change their minds afterwards -."

216
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,918
Mmm. "To make them change
their minds." Full stop.

217
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,546
- "Afterwards..." Mm-hmm.
- "Afterwards,

218
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,172
he ordered them to be beaten.

219
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,260
But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid,

220
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,221
rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

221
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,182
When he saw this,
the Roman governor was filled with rage

222
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,184
"and ordered their heads to be cutoff."

223
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,483
What do you find so amusing?

224
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,736
Well...

225
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,738
Well, what?

226
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,283
Those children were really stupid.

227
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,368
Why?

228
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,454
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus

229
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,372
and then they got killed for it.

230
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,333
And what would you have done? Deny Christ?

231
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,710
Well, yes.

232
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:06,590
Inside, I would have believed in him,
but I wouldn't have told the Romans that.

233
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,428
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

234
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,433
I see.

235
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:21,146
So you both would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

236
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,564
Oh, you'd have saved your heads

237
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,900
being chopped off by the Romans,
that's true.

238
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,402
But what would have happened afterwards?

239
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,487
When?

240
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,614
In the next life.

241
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,033
The one that's waiting for us
after we die.

242
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,951
- Where would you have gone?
- Oh.

243
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,036
Ah.

244
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,829
Where, Nicholas?

245
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,789
To the children's limbo.

246
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,583
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

247
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,419
- One of the four hells.
- Which are?

248
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,217
Me, me, me, me! Me!

249
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,761
No, no, no. Let him answer. Which are?

250
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,472
There's the hell where the damned go.

251
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,558
- Then there's purgatory...
- Yes.

252
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,852
...and the bosom of Abraham
where the just go,

253
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,437
and limbo where children go.

254
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,064
At the center of the earth.

255
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,107
Where it's very, very hot.

256
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,693
That's where children go who tell lies.

257
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,738
But they don't just go there
for a few days. Oh, no.

258
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,867
No, they're damned. Forever.

259
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,869
Think about it.

260
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:23,625
Try to imagine the end of eternity.

261
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,460
Close your eyes.

262
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,797
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.

263
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,550
Forever.

264
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,846
Pain... forever.

265
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,891
I'm getting dizzy.

266
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,730
Now do you understand
why Justus and Pastor told the truth?

267
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,944
Right.

268
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:55,115
Uh, open your readers at lesson six.

269
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,826
- Can't we go and play?
- You most certainly cannot.

270
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,247
First, you're going to read the lesson.
Then you're going to learn it by heart.

271
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,374
- All of it?
- Anne, any more protests

272
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,918
and there'll be no playing
for you at all today, hmm?

273
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,672
In fact, I think you can study
in separate rooms.

274
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,341
- No, no, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

275
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,968
But we get scared if we're separated.

276
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,388
You get scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

277
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,181
What if we see a ghost?

278
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,351
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

279
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,103
I haven't told him anything!

280
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,023
If you see a ghost, you say, "Hello,"
and you continue on studying.

281
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,358
- Anne, come with me to the music room.
- Why me?

282
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,277
Because I say so! Now come on.

283
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,612
Take your book.

284
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:37,574
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned in less than an hour.

285
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,993
- Mummy?
- What?

286
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,287
Give me a kiss.

287
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,248
"Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss. Give me a ki -"

288
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,167
Anne, wait for me outside.

289
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,461
You know I can't.

290
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,672
Over there.

291
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,303
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

292
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,139
My daughter is going to
cross the living room.

293
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,016
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:11,900
All right, Anne.

295
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,279
Darling...

296
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,659
Mummy can't be with you all the time.

297
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:21,785
Mmm?

298
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,623
You must learn to be on your own.

299
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,250
Where's your rosary?

300
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,711
Ah!

301
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,507
Whenever you feel afraid...

302
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,260
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might

303
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:42,847
and say an Our Father,
and then your fear will go away.

304
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,934
- It won't.
- Yes. Yes, it will. Honestly.

305
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,522
Don't you see that when you do that,
the Lord is with you?

306
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,150
There's no reason to be afraid.

307
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,900
"The house and the family."

308
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,779
We all live in a house with our family.

309
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:43,867
The family is usually made up
of parents, children

310
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,535
and their grandparents.

311
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,829
"We must be obedient and kind..."

312
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,082
"...obedient and kind towards
other members of our family

313
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:55,170
and we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters."

314
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,090
- Do you have any children?
- No.

315
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,594
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got,

316
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,263
and, uh, I'm all they've got.

317
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,140
Was she born like that?

318
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,893
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

319
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,812
The girl. Was she born a mute?

320
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,981
No.

321
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,194
You know, I think I've finished here,
ma'am.

322
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,406
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go
and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

323
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,146
Nicholas!

324
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,070
Nicholas, I'm coming!

325
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,491
Oh!

326
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,371
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

327
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,624
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

328
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,918
But I just heard you...

329
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,546
Anne! Anne.

330
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:27,428
Anne!

331
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:30,723
Anne?

332
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,226
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

333
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,895
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

334
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,566
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

335
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,318
I just heard you a moment ago.

336
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,947
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.

337
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,407
I don't.

338
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,659
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

339
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,995
Oh, really? So I imagined it, did I?

340
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,705
No. It was that boy.

341
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,750
- What boy?
- Victor.

342
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,128
Who's Victor?

343
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,590
The boy that was here a moment ago.

344
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:07,552
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

345
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,637
I think he's a spoiled brat.

346
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,973
He said we'd have to leave the house.

347
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,558
Oh, did he, now?

348
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:15,894
And why was he crying?

349
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,314
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

350
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,565
His father's a pianist <i>-.</i>

351
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,067
- Oh! His father's a pianist, is he?
- Yes.

352
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,487
And I've already told him
he is not allowed to touch the piano.

353
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:28,072
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

354
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,784
So, you've spoken to his father as well?

355
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:35,204
No, only with Victor.
His father's with the others in the hall.

356
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,457
But I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

357
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,211
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

358
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,589
That'll do, Anne! That's enough!

359
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,635
- Now why were you crying?
- It was Victor!

360
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:51,346
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there!

361
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,139
Would you mind telling me how a boy

362
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,642
can get in and out of this room
if it's locked?

363
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,482
I thought I made myself quite clear.

364
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,859
No door is to be opened

365
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,778
without the previous one
being closed first.

366
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,863
Is that so hard to understand?

367
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,074
This house is like a ship.

368
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,159
The light must be contained
as if it were water

369
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,662
by opening and closing the doors.

370
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,290
- My children's lives are at stake.
- But, ma'am, I-.

371
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,376
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

372
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,587
Now, which was the last of you
to enter that room?

373
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:26,547
Lydia?

374
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,386
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

375
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,304
Oh, that leaves you, then.

376
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,431
But I was in the hall the whole time.

377
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,892
And then I went out into the garden.
You saw me with your own eyes.

378
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,395
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me.

379
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,023
Do you think that I would overlook
such a thing

380
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,484
and endanger the life of my own daughter?

381
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,618
You're not supposed to read at the table.

382
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,037
Oh, really?

383
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:00,540
Who's going to tell Mummy? You?

384
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,088
Or perhaps you?

385
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,344
Did you really see a boy?

386
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,222
Yes. He's called Victor.

387
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,435
Is he a ghost?

388
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,396
Don't be stupid. Ghosts aren't like that.

389
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,689
What are they like?

390
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,442
I've told you a thousand times.

391
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,486
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

392
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:33,239
- How do you know?
- Because I've seen them.

393
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,699
They come out at night.

394
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,702
Fibber. Where?

395
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,128
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

396
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,923
- Well, I don't believe you saw that boy.
- Believe what you like.

397
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,009
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

398
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:08,441
Nicholas. Nicholas.

399
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,235
Huh? What?

400
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:13,362
Look.

401
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,282
Why have you opened the curtains?

402
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,242
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

403
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:22,121
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

404
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,166
You're lying. Going to tell Mummy.

405
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,627
- So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

406
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:32,548
Victor, come out from behind that curtain
so my stupid brother can see you.

407
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,185
Leave me alone.

408
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,187
80 you don't want
to see him now, eh?

409
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,064
You're a cowardly custard.

410
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,607
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

411
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,859
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

412
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,947
I'll just have to do it myself, then.

413
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,174
That's enough, Victor.

414
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,179
Nicholas. Nicholas.

415
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,932
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.
He won't listen to me.

416
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,226
Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

417
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,103
This is our bed.

418
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,688
No, it's mine.

419
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,899
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.

420
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,152
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

421
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,989
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother

422
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,907
and she'll kick you out.

423
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:41,534
You don't know my mother.

424
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,536
And you don't know my parents.

425
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,414
Anne, I'm going to tell Mummy about you.

426
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,791
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?

427
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:52,420
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

428
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,559
Help, Mummy! Help!

429
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,561
Help! Help, Mummy!

430
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,355
- What is it? What is it?
- Help! Help!

431
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,150
What is it?

432
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,778
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

433
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:20,406
I'm fed up. Do you hear me?

434
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,908
I am fed up with you!

435
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:23,659
I didn't do anything!

436
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:32,210
"Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth
from the Garden of Eden

437
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,921
to fill the ground
from whence he was taken.

438
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:36,839
So he drove out the man

439
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,426
and placed to the east
of the Garden of Eden cherubims

440
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,931
"and a flaming sword which turned every
way to keep the way of the tree of life."

441
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,558
There. I finished.

442
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,311
Very good.

443
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,524
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

444
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:58,903
What? That's not what we agreed!

445
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,072
We didn't agree anything, young lady.

446
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,908
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

447
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,993
You can't make me
ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

448
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,453
How dare you.

449
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,706
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

450
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,875
You told your brother
there was someone else in the room.

451
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,335
- There was!
- You're lying!

452
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,545
I am not!

453
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,422
Anne...

454
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,635
Anne, do you remember the story
about Justus and Pastor?

455
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,930
Children who don't tell the truth
end up in limbo.

456
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,015
That's what you say.

457
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:32,144
But I read the other day that limbo's only
for children who haven't been baptized.

458
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,438
And I have!

459
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,777
"And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering"

460
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,655
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.

461
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,200
And he took the fire in his hand
and a knife,

462
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,536
and they went, both of them together.

463
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:53,582
And Isaac spake unto Abraham, his father,
and said, 'My father.'

464
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:56,794
And he said, 'Here I am, my son.'
And he -...

465
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,228
Did you look in on Nicholas?

466
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:18,107
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

467
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,194
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?

468
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,071
Oh, yes, ma'am.

469
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,785
I prefer to have her where I can see her,
but I can't embroider in such poor light.

470
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,833
How long is this punishment
going to go on?

471
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,585
It's been three days now.

472
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,878
It's up to her.

473
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:44,216
She's got to learn to swallow her pride
and ask for forgiveness.

474
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,970
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

475
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,516
Mmm. Well, the priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

476
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,518
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.

477
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,937
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

478
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:00,232
He told me yesterday
he'd be by as soon as possible.

479
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:04,111
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

480
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,823
This fog doesn't exactly help.

481
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,617
It's never lasted this long before.

482
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,744
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

483
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,829
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

484
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,042
Anne!

485
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:20,920
Anne, I can't hear you.

486
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,964
"And Isaac spake unto Abraham..."

487
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:25,549
Oh!

488
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,551
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,

489
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:30,679
I've had to put up with the noise of Lydia
running around above my head.

490
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:32,640
She - She's been hurtling
backwards and forwards

491
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,392
as if there were three of her.

492
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:36,352
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary

493
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,979
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

494
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,982
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

495
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,734
I'll tell her, ma'am.

496
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:45,903
Thank you.

497
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,290
"And Abraham stretched forth his hand

498
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,168
and took the knife to slay his son.

499
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,921
And the angel of the Lord called..."

500
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,743
Now she's really gone too far.

501
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,580
Lydia. Lydia!

502
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,895
"...in the mount of the Lord,
it shall be seen.

503
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:03,814
-And the angel of the Lord -"
-What's going on up there?

504
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,692
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading like you told me.

505
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,612
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

506
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,496
"And the angel of the Lord
called unto Abraham out of heaven

507
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,623
the second time and said,

508
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,833
'By myself, I have sworn, '
saith the Lord -...

509
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,126
Shh!

510
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,931
- What was that?
- I don't know.

511
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:40,559
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.

512
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,186
I can't tell you, Mummy.

513
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,480
You tell me.

514
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,317
I told you there was someone in the room
and you punished me.

515
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,237
- Now I don't know what to say.
- Anne, I want the truth.

516
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,407
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

517
00:33:58,118 --> 00:33:59,995
There. In that junk room.

518
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:51,714
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

519
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:51,982
Shh!

520
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,693
- She's watching us.
- She's watching us.

521
00:35:58,697 --> 00:35:59,823
Oh!

522
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,635
Where did they go?

523
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,845
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

524
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,681
Which way did they go?

525
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,600
Over there, over there -
Oh, and down there as well.

526
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:36,026
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

527
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,988
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

528
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,910
- Ma'am, stay calm, please.
- I will not stay calm!

529
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,787
For five whole years
during the occupation,

530
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,498
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
ever stepping foot in this house,

531
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,458
and now there is someone here,
under my nose,

532
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,127
opening and closing the doors.

533
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:55,754
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

534
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,298
Why, the floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks <i>-.</i>

535
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,509
- There were voices. I'm telling you.
- Mummy, look.

536
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,386
A boy and two women,
and they were talking together.

537
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,887
Mummy, look!

538
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,183
I did it yesterday.

539
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,561
This is the father, this is the mother,

540
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,897
this is Victor, and this is the old woman.

541
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,024
What do these numbers stand for?

542
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,152
That's the number of times
I've seen them.

543
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,654
I've seen the old woman the most.

544
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,869
Oh, God in heaven.

545
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:28,495
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle.

546
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,789
Tell him that we have to search
the whole house immediately.

547
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:33,333
- Before it gets dark.
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.

548
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,335
- Mummy!
- Yes, darling. It's all right.

549
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:38,714
Nothing's going to happen to you
while Mummy's here. Hmm?

550
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,925
Look, Mummy. She really scares me.

551
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,887
It's as if she's not looking at you,
but she can see you.

552
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:47,806
And she's always around saying,
"Come with me."

553
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:49,516
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

554
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:52,311
Honestly, Mummy. And she asks me things.

555
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,688
Victor told me she's a witch.

556
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,691
- What does she ask you?
- Things.

557
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,820
Her breath smells.

558
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,951
We have to open all the curtains.

559
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,287
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

560
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,371
Yes, ma'am.

561
00:38:11,538 --> 00:38:13,916
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

562
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:15,292
Then we'll search upstairs.

563
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>Perhaps they're ghosts
who lived in this house before.</i>

564
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,412
Don't be stupid. I've already told you.

565
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,957
Ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go, "Ooh."

566
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,959
Now, Anne.

567
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,670
Why do you make up such stories?

568
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,881
I don't. I read them in books.

569
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:46,884
Well, you shouldn't believe everything
that you read in books.

570
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,760
That's what our mother says.

571
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:52,055
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

572
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:56,268
And then, she expects us to believe
everything written in the Bible.

573
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,062
- And don't you believe it?
- I believe some things.

574
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:04,109
But, for example, I don't believe
that God made the world in seven days.

575
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:08,530
And I don't believe that Noah
got all those animals into one boat,

576
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,657
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

577
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:13,076
No, I don't believe that either.

578
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:16,455
- Doves are anything but holy.
- They poo on our windows.

579
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:25,881
Have you mentioned any of this
to your mother?

580
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,762
Oh.

581
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,156
Ma'am?

582
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:34,950
Yes?

583
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:39,121
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.

584
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,539
I see.

585
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,418
Mrs. Mills.

586
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,379
Yes, ma'am?

587
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,549
Do you have any idea what this might be?

588
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,136
It is a photograph album, ma'am.

589
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:56,304
No, but look. They're all asleep.

590
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:57,431
Look.

591
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:00,600
They're not asleep, ma'am. They're dead.

592
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,354
It is a book of the dead.

593
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:08,108
In the last century, I believe,
they used to take photographs of the dead

594
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:12,946
in the hopes that their souls
would go on living through the portraits.

595
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,617
There are even group portraits.

596
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,954
- And children.
- Ah.

597
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,331
Oh, it's macabre.

598
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,170
How could these people
be so superstitious?

599
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,797
Grief over the death of a loved one

600
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:34,760
can lead people
to do the strangest things.

601
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,099
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

602
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:42,392
Yes, ma'am.

603
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:57,991
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?

604
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:12,422
Thank you very much, ma'am.

605
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,802
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

606
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,930
Did you have to
look after children then as well?

607
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,934
No, I was in charge
of organizing the housework.

608
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,478
Mmm. Were there many servants?

609
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,564
Oh, about 15.

610
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:33,777
Though in the end,
there were just the three of us left.

611
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,861
Why?

612
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,656
My employers moved to London.

613
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:43,954
They came here less and less,
it being so out of the way like.

614
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,375
So gradually the house just became empty.

615
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:52,170
Everybody ends up
leaving this damned island.

616
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:58,385
My family left in the summer of 1940,
just before the invasion.

617
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:02,347
That was the last I've heard of them.

618
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:05,433
Oh.

619
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,311
I don't blame them.

620
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,315
Actually, we left too.

621
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,820
Although, you know,
sometimes when you leave a place,

622
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:21,783
it's like it's there with you
all the time.

623
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,412
I always felt
like I never left this house.

624
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,580
Why did you leave?

625
00:44:27,914 --> 00:44:30,167
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis.

626
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,169
The whole area was evacuated.

627
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:34,880
Oh.

628
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,216
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

629
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,760
Yes, I think so.

630
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:45,223
Though, you know, my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

631
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,808
What happened to her?

632
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,482
Well, suddenly one day,

633
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,196
she just... stopped talking.

634
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,531
But there must have been a reason.

635
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,743
People don't just stop talking.

636
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,622
These things are always the result
of some sort of trauma.

637
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,666
Something must have happened to her.

638
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,589
Did your employers treat you well?

639
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,300
Oh, they were always very kind to us.

640
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,677
They treated us just like family.

641
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:28,350
You know, ma'am, I think I will go to bed.

642
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:31,061
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

643
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,771
Off you go.

644
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,648
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

645
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,524
Yes, ma'am.

646
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,019
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

647
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,487
Can you forgive me?

648
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,703
Anne?

649
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,516
- Mummy.
- What?

650
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,977
When's Daddy coming home?

651
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,896
When the war's over.

652
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,649
Why did he go to war?

653
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,028
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.

654
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,947
Daddy went <i>-.</i>

655
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,578
Daddy went because he's very brave...

656
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,332
and because he wasn't prepared

657
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,876
to let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

658
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,378
Why?

659
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,763
Charles...

660
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,600
where are you?

661
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:23,144
Mrs. Mills!

662
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,314
Mrs. Mills!

663
00:50:27,815 --> 00:50:29,442
What's the matter, ma'am?

664
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,529
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

665
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,614
- What's happening, ma'am?
- Come on!

666
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,583
Oh, my God.

667
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:51,422
I checked that room myself.

668
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:55,260
It was empty.

669
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,804
Take these tablets, ma'am.

670
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,430
-And yet -
-They'll do you good.

671
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:02,141
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

672
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,271
And it wasn't human.

673
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,149
There is something in this house.

674
00:51:11,192 --> 00:51:12,944
Something diabolic.

675
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,072
- Ma'am...
- Something which is not...

676
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,743
not at rest.

677
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,791
I know you don't believe it.

678
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:29,502
You don't believe it, do you?

679
00:51:30,503 --> 00:51:31,713
I don't blame you.

680
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:35,341
<i>I -</i> I used to not believe these things.

681
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,095
I do believe it, ma'am.

682
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,851
I've always believed in those things.

683
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,814
Oh, they're not easy to explain,
but they do happen.

684
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:54,319
We've all heard stories of... the beyond,

685
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:56,237
now and then.

686
00:51:57,655 --> 00:52:01,618
And I think that sometimes, the world...

687
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,747
of the dead gets mixed up

688
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:08,666
with the world of the living.

689
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:11,628
But it's impossible.

690
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:13,963
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

691
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,342
The living and the dead, they will
only meet at the end of eternity.

692
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:22,055
It says so in the Bible.

693
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:23,348
Ma'am...

694
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:27,977
there isn't always an answer
for everything.

695
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:42,742
Where are you off to, ma'am?

696
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,328
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

697
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,413
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

698
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,665
I shall bring him back.

699
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:50,708
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

700
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,752
I've waited long enough.

701
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:55,380
Ma'am, the priest told me that -

702
00:52:55,546 --> 00:52:57,215
I don't care what he told you!

703
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,676
I want him to tell me personally.

704
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,135
He must come today.

705
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:02,887
But what are you going to tell him?

706
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,057
That we have searched
every room in there inch by inch,

707
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,975
and now I need them to be blessed.

708
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,147
Ma'am, please, wait.
Still, it's very early.

709
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,983
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

710
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,569
I need you to search
the whole garden for gravestones.

711
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:19,737
Gravestones?

712
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:23,116
Yes. When my husband bought this house,
we were told there was a little cemetery.

713
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:25,702
I think it was somewhere over there,
amongst the trees.

714
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:26,994
I've not seen anything.

715
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:28,496
Check carefully.

716
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,873
- It could be overgrown.
- Yes, ma'am.

717
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,710
I need to know
if there was a family buried here

718
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:35,878
and if they had a little boy, Victor.

719
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,147
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

720
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:58,109
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

721
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,945
Oh, don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

722
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,655
Oh, yes, the fog.

723
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,574
The fog, of course.

724
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,829
And when - when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

725
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,333
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.
All in good time.

726
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,669
Speaking of which...

727
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,713
Oh!

728
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,741
Wha -

729
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,410
Charles?

730
00:56:14,078 --> 00:56:15,079
Grace?

731
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,875
Oh.

732
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:21,335
Oh!

733
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,838
Oh!

734
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,679
You're here. You're here.

735
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,724
They - They said there was no hope.

736
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,977
They said I should give you up for dead.

737
00:56:38,644 --> 00:56:40,062
They say a lot of things.

738
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:42,315
Oh.

739
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,275
Oh!

740
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:46,903
Oh, thank you.

741
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,405
Thank you, God.

742
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,948
Thank you, God.

743
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,367
Every night I prayed for this,

744
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,287
begging God to bring you back.

745
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:01,959
Bring the children their father back.
Bring him...

746
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:07,298
But where have you been all this time?

747
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:11,928
Out there, looking for my home.

748
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,604
You're so different.

749
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,440
80 different.

750
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:26,984
Sometimes I bleed.

751
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,148
Ma'am...

752
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,944
Mrs. Mills...

753
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:14,240
this is my husband.

754
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,413
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

755
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:21,914
He's very weak.

756
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:23,624
Here.

757
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,046
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

758
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,800
- And something to eat.
- Right away, ma'am.

759
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,155
How are my little ones?

760
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,367
Daddy!

761
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,247
Why did you take so long?

762
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:11,922
Hello, Nicholas.

763
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:14,925
I told you. You see?
I told you he'd come back.

764
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,185
Have you both been well behaved?

765
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,478
We've been very good.

766
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:28,314
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

767
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,524
We study every day
for our first communion.

768
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:33,611
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

769
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,328
Oh! Here he comes!

770
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:49,251
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.

771
00:59:50,127 --> 00:59:52,546
Are you coming down or would you prefer -

772
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,185
<i>When is Daddy coming down?</i>

773
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:10,272
<i>Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.</i>

774
01:00:10,439 --> 01:00:12,650
He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.

775
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,734
Shh.

776
01:00:17,738 --> 01:00:21,158
Mummy, when people die in the war,
where do they go?

777
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,910
Oh, what a question. Mmm.

778
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,872
- It depends.
- On what?

779
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,127
Well, on whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

780
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:33,379
Your father, for example,
fought for England,

781
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,880
on the side of the goodies.

782
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,927
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are?

783
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,847
That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

784
01:00:43,013 --> 01:00:44,515
You'll never go to war.

785
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,517
We'll never go anywhere.

786
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,726
Oh.

787
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,313
Oh, you're not missing out on anything.

788
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:54,441
You're much better off at home
with your mummy and your daddy

789
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,402
who love you very, very much.

790
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,738
And the intruders.

791
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,284
There are no intruders here.

792
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,162
But you said that there were.

793
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:07,830
No, I said
that there are no intruders here.

794
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,748
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

795
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:12,251
-But you said -
-No, that is enough!

796
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:15,129
- Can I say something?
- No!

797
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,465
- Why not?
- Because - Because you can't!

798
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:26,807
Anne, stop breathing like that.

799
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:30,728
You heard me. Stop it.

800
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,108
Stop breathing.

801
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,196
Right, you go to your room.

802
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:42,573
Go to your room.
There's no dessert for you today.

803
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:52,208
Oh, no crying now, no crying.

804
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:54,627
Oh, stop that. Here.

805
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:57,630
Oh, look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

806
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:01,467
- I don't care!
- There, there.

807
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,093
You listen to me.

808
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,223
I've seen them too.

809
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,516
You have?

810
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:12,061
Yes.

811
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,105
Then why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

812
01:02:15,272 --> 01:02:17,858
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

813
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:21,070
She only believes in what she was taught.

814
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,363
But don't worry.

815
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:25,074
Sooner or later...

816
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,327
she'll see them.

817
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,746
Then everything will be different.

818
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,039
How?

819
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,125
Oh, you'll see.

820
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:38,796
There are going to be some big surprises.

821
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,467
There are going to be... changes.

822
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,719
Changes?

823
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:01,110
Now she's behaving
as if nothing had happened.

824
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,571
What about her daughter?

825
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:06,657
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

826
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,034
The children will be easier to convince.

827
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,205
No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

828
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,127
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

829
01:03:19,586 --> 01:03:21,255
No.

830
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,799
I don't think he even knows where he is.

831
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:42,026
Oh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.

832
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,489
Mummy made this veil especially for you.

833
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:50,993
- Hmm?
- I look like a bride.

834
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:55,456
Yes. You do.

835
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:02,504
I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

836
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:05,382
- You can take it off now.
- No.

837
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:07,384
This dress has to be spotless
for your first communion.

838
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:09,386
I promise I won't dirty it.

839
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:12,264
Just let me wear it for a little longer.
Just a little.

840
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,682
On, just a little?

841
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,685
All right.

842
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,646
I'll be back shortly.

843
01:04:19,813 --> 01:04:22,024
No sitting on the floor,
no leaning against the walls.

844
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,108
No.

845
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,252
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

846
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,840
I'd love to.

847
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,700
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.

848
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,291
Ooh...

849
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:37,307
<i>♪ In the sky</i> I

850
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,273
<i>♪ I don't know if it's cloudy or bright ♪</i>

851
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,403
<i>I But I only have eyes</i> I.

852
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,241
<i>♪ For you, dear</i> I

853
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,412
<i>♪ The moon may be high</i> I

854
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,655
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.

855
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,661
Anne, are you listening to me?

856
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,081
Anne?

857
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:50,589
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

858
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:51,715
But it's clean.

859
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,091
It makes no difference.

860
01:06:53,258 --> 01:06:55,177
Why can't you ever do as you're told?

861
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,869
What's the matter?

862
01:07:21,036 --> 01:07:23,080
Where is my daughter?

863
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,669
What have you done with my daughter?

864
01:07:28,835 --> 01:07:32,047
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

865
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:37,302
No! You're not my daughter! No!

866
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,892
You're not my daughter! No!

867
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,811
No! No!

868
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,408
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

869
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,742
She wants to kill me!

870
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:03,412
She won't stop until she kills us!

871
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,330
She won't stop!
She won't stop until she kills us!

872
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,165
Hush, child. Come with me.

873
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:09,501
You're wicked! You're wicked! Wicked!

874
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,420
Wicked!

875
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,057
How is she?

876
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:28,353
There's no calming her,
so I've left her with her father.

877
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,815
She insisted on speaking with him.

878
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,530
What happened? Why did you fight?

879
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,073
It wasn't her.

880
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,411
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

881
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,997
She was imitating my daughter's voice.

882
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:49,791
I'd swear to God
that it wasn't my daughter.

883
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:55,130
Oh, God. God help me.

884
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,884
God help me. What's the matter with me?

885
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,054
I don't know what's the matter with me.

886
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:04,931
You must get more rest.

887
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:11,438
You can't take on
the whole responsibility of this house.

888
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:15,776
Leave it to us.
We know what has to be done.

889
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,822
What do you mean by that?

890
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,701
What do you mean,
you know what has to be done?

891
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,495
Nothing, ma'am. I was just suggesting <i>-.</i>

892
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,330
There's nothing to suggest.

893
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,876
Who do you think you are?
You have no idea what has to be done.

894
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:39,174
Or do you?

895
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,012
What are these?

896
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,810
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.

897
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,854
The ones you always take.

898
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,483
Please, I need to be on my own.

899
01:09:57,984 --> 01:09:59,111
Yes, ma'am.

900
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:24,136
Come, child.

901
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,161
Anne told me everything.

902
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,503
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

903
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,465
At first, I thought
there was someone else in the house.

904
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,133
Even thought that there were ghosts.

905
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,093
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

906
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:09,014
I'm talking about what happened that day.

907
01:11:16,396 --> 01:11:19,524
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Tell me it's not true.

908
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,860
Tell me what happened.

909
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:24,529
Happened?

910
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:34,206
I don't know
what came over me that day. I <i>-.</i>

911
01:11:34,956 --> 01:11:37,459
The servants had left during the night.

912
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,378
They hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

913
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:48,053
And they knew
that I couldn't leave the house.

914
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,931
They knew.

915
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:55,310
Anne?

916
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,606
Anne, what happened?

917
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,193
She hit me.

918
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:07,280
She went mad like she did that day.

919
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:09,241
Do you remember?

920
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:12,452
No.

921
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,706
You must forgive me, Charles.

922
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,003
Not me. The children.

923
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:24,589
They know that I love them.

924
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:30,011
They know I'd never hurt them.
I - I'd die first.

925
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,559
What are you going to do?

926
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:38,770
Are you angry with me?

927
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,861
I just came back to say goodbye
to my wife and children.

928
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:48,446
Now I must go.

929
01:12:49,155 --> 01:12:50,490
Go where?

930
01:12:51,908 --> 01:12:53,326
To the front.

931
01:12:53,493 --> 01:12:54,828
No. The war's over.

932
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:57,706
The war is not over.

933
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,416
What are you talking about?

934
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,211
You're not going. Do you hear me?

935
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:05,589
You left us once already. You can't go!

936
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:08,633
Why?

937
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,346
Why did you have to go to that stupid war
that had nothing to do with us?

938
01:13:14,806 --> 01:13:17,309
Why couldn't you have stayed here
like the others did?

939
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:19,728
- The others surrendered.
- We all surrendered!

940
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:22,272
The whole island was occupied!

941
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:26,192
What - What did you expect?

942
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,075
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

943
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:36,369
Your place was here with us.

944
01:13:38,496 --> 01:13:39,915
With your family.

945
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,380
I loved you.

946
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,092
That was enough for me.

947
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:55,388
Living in this darkness...

948
01:13:57,098 --> 01:13:58,433
in this prison.

949
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,438
But not for you.

950
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,317
I wasn't enough for you.

951
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,195
That's why you left.

952
01:14:13,406 --> 01:14:15,033
It wasn't just the war.

953
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,622
You want to leave me, don't you?

954
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:13,466
Forgive me, Grace.

955
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:28,917
Anne!

956
01:16:30,543 --> 01:16:31,753
Nicholas!

957
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,473
What is it? What <i>-.</i>

958
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:45,433
Oh!

959
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:48,436
Oh!

960
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:50,980
Oh, my God!

961
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,441
Here! Oh, my God!

962
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:57,445
No!

963
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,201
Here!

964
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:07,872
Oh!

965
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,964
Where are the curtains?

966
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:22,762
Mrs. Mills!

967
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,780
Let me see. Let me see.

968
01:17:41,364 --> 01:17:44,075
Oh, you're all right. You're all right.

969
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,995
I want my daddy!

970
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,917
Daddy's gone.

971
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:54,752
It's not true!

972
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,130
Yes, it is.

973
01:17:58,506 --> 01:17:59,716
It is true.

974
01:18:02,468 --> 01:18:03,887
I love you, Mummy.

975
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:14,522
Find the curtains.

976
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:18,568
Who was it?

977
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,778
Who did this?

978
01:18:20,945 --> 01:18:22,071
Tell me!

979
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:24,115
Tell me!

980
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,452
You know what's happening here!

981
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,829
You know because it happened to you too!

982
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,122
You tell me.

983
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:33,082
You write it down.

984
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,294
Write it down! Please!

985
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:39,047
That attitude
won't solve anything, ma'am.

986
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,383
Anyway, she can't write.

987
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,135
- Where are they?
- What?

988
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,595
The curtains!

989
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,556
The curtains
my children's lives depend on!

990
01:18:48,723 --> 01:18:50,016
Someone has taken the curtains!

991
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,559
I have noticed, ma'am.

992
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,853
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

993
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:58,775
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just
on the point of calling you.

994
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,903
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains?

995
01:19:03,404 --> 01:19:04,614
The curtains?

996
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,158
Oh, dear.

997
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:11,371
Why should anyone
want to take all the curtains?

998
01:19:12,705 --> 01:19:16,167
Oh, to let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

999
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,586
Daylight. Of course.

1000
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,464
Someone wants to kill my children.

1001
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,883
Why do you think
that the daylight would kill them?

1002
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,761
Are you mad?

1003
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,389
I told you.

1004
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:31,849
I already told you!

1005
01:19:32,016 --> 01:19:35,144
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1006
01:19:35,311 --> 01:19:37,563
Yes, but that was before.

1007
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:40,566
The condition could have cleared up
by itself.

1008
01:19:40,733 --> 01:19:43,278
I mean, if you never
expose them to daylight,

1009
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,029
how do you know they're not cured?

1010
01:19:45,863 --> 01:19:49,993
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism

1011
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,661
in her legs and back.

1012
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,497
Then one fine day...

1013
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:58,293
they disappeared.

1014
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,796
I am going to find those curtains,

1015
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,756
and when you have finished
helping me hang them,

1016
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:05,925
you will leave this house!

1017
01:20:19,355 --> 01:20:21,524
And what about the master, ma'am?

1018
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,943
What has he got to say about all of this?

1019
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:26,279
Give me your keys.

1020
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,448
I want your keys now!

1021
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:34,495
I know what you want.

1022
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,123
You want to frighten us.

1023
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,541
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1024
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:42,003
You've wanted to take over this house
ever since the first day you arrived.

1025
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:46,257
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

1026
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,009
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

1027
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,137
Give me the keys!

1028
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:53,890
Give them to me.

1029
01:21:00,646 --> 01:21:02,065
And now get out of here.

1030
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,085
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1031
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,047
I think I've reached the end of my tether.

1032
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,423
What about you?

1033
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,636
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1034
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:36,265
We'd better go and uncover
the gravestones.

1035
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,348
What's Mummy doing?

1036
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,851
I've already told you. She's gone mad.

1037
01:22:20,017 --> 01:22:21,477
- Liar.
- She's gone mad!

1038
01:22:21,644 --> 01:22:22,728
Liar, liar!

1039
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:24,605
- She's gone mad! She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1040
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:25,898
Liar!

1041
01:22:31,487 --> 01:22:32,738
Nighttime.

1042
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:35,783
Where are you going?

1043
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,285
I've had enough.

1044
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,164
I'm going to the woods to look for Daddy.

1045
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,458
Are you going to run away?

1046
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,671
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1047
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,631
It's very easy.

1048
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:07,273
If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.

1049
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,859
Yes, yes, yes.

1050
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,578
Anne, wait!

1051
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,539
I want to come and look for Daddy too.

1052
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:27,084
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1053
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:28,503
Scaredy pants, scaredy pants!

1054
01:23:28,669 --> 01:23:29,795
Be quiet!

1055
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,018
Anne, I think we've gotten lost.

1056
01:24:26,185 --> 01:24:28,104
We still haven't
left the garden yet, silly.

1057
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,358
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come, then.

1058
01:24:36,487 --> 01:24:39,657
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1059
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,076
I don't know. Anything.

1060
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,787
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1061
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:47,123
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1062
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:15,735
What's that over there?

1063
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,905
I think they're graves.

1064
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,075
Don't go near!

1065
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:24,368
Why not?

1066
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:26,787
What if a ghost jumps out?

1067
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:29,582
Graves don't have ghosts. Only skeletons.

1068
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:49,977
- There's something written here.
- Let's go!

1069
01:25:50,144 --> 01:25:51,395
Wait!

1070
01:26:14,877 --> 01:26:17,505
Anne! What does it say?

1071
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,473
You must be strong now, children.

1072
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,974
Nicholas, come here!

1073
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,479
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy
we've run away.

1074
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:34,772
Don't speak to them!

1075
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,942
- Why?
- They're dead!

1076
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:41,237
- What?
- They're ghosts! Please come here!

1077
01:26:42,029 --> 01:26:43,030
Children!

1078
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:44,824
Nicholas!

1079
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,995
They're ghosts? Why aren't they
wearing sheets and clanking chains?

1080
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:51,163
You said that -

1081
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,999
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1082
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:58,087
You're always teasing me
and telling lies, and I'm sick of it!

1083
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:00,881
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!

1084
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:02,174
Come here!

1085
01:27:04,593 --> 01:27:05,678
Quick!

1086
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:11,934
Children!

1087
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,650
Run!

1088
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:21,068
Run!

1089
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:23,571
Go! Run! Into the house!

1090
01:27:26,615 --> 01:27:28,033
Don't come any closer!

1091
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:31,746
Don't move!

1092
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,877
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1093
01:27:38,043 --> 01:27:42,923
Tuberculosis finished us off
more than half a century ago.

1094
01:28:03,402 --> 01:28:04,612
Go away!

1095
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,453
Open the door, ma'am. Please.

1096
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,788
What do you want?

1097
01:28:13,954 --> 01:28:16,832
Mummy, don't open the door. Don't.

1098
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:18,709
We've seen their graves.

1099
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,211
Go upstairs and hide.

1100
01:28:21,128 --> 01:28:22,755
- Go on. Go.
- I'm scared.

1101
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:23,964
Oh!

1102
01:28:29,386 --> 01:28:30,679
Don't separate.

1103
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:34,642
Oh!

1104
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,981
Whatever you do, don't separate. Hmm?

1105
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:45,069
Go hide. Go. Go.

1106
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:48,364
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1107
01:28:51,575 --> 01:28:52,910
Understand what?

1108
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,203
About the house.

1109
01:28:55,037 --> 01:28:56,956
About the new situation.

1110
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,416
What situation?

1111
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:04,964
We must all learn to live together,
the living and the dead.

1112
01:29:07,049 --> 01:29:10,052
If you're dead, leave us in peace.

1113
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,222
Leave us in peace!

1114
01:29:14,139 --> 01:29:16,350
Leave us in peace!

1115
01:29:21,772 --> 01:29:23,607
In here. Get inside.

1116
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:31,991
And suppose we do leave you.

1117
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:35,286
- Do you think they will?
- Who?

1118
01:29:35,452 --> 01:29:36,954
The intruders.

1119
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:39,290
There are no intruders.

1120
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:41,458
- They took the curtains down.
- There are no intruders.

1121
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:44,128
Oh, yes.
I assure you it was them.

1122
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:49,425
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

1123
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:50,634
Waiting for you.

1124
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:52,344
- No!
- Yes.

1125
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:57,975
And believe me, sooner or later,
they'll find you.

1126
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,352
Listen, wait here,
and I'll be back in a minute.

1127
01:30:00,519 --> 01:30:03,606
No, no, no.
Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

1128
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:05,608
I can't leave her on her own.

1129
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:12,031
Stop breathing like that.

1130
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:22,625
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

1131
01:30:25,544 --> 01:30:26,754
Stop breathing!

1132
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:32,551
Can't you hear it? There's someone there.

1133
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,974
Come with us, children.

1134
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,560
Come with us.

1135
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,152
Nicholas?

1136
01:30:52,821 --> 01:30:53,948
Anne?

1137
01:30:56,825 --> 01:30:58,035
Where are you?

1138
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:03,165
Answer me!

1139
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:04,833
The intruders have found them.

1140
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,919
There's nothing we can do now.

1141
01:31:07,836 --> 01:31:11,632
You'll have to go upstairs
and talk to them.

1142
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,277
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1143
01:31:33,278 --> 01:31:34,697
hallowed be thy name.

1144
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:37,074
Thy kingdom come,

1145
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:40,577
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.

1146
01:31:42,287 --> 01:31:44,456
Give us this day our daily bread,

1147
01:31:44,623 --> 01:31:46,250
and forgive us our trespasses...

1148
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:51,505
Why are you afraid, children?

1149
01:31:52,464 --> 01:31:55,634
Why don't you want us to be your friends?

1150
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,761
Come, come.

1151
01:31:57,928 --> 01:32:00,305
Come on. Speak to us.

1152
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:02,641
Speak.

1153
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:10,983
Tell me what happened.

1154
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,404
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

1155
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:18,490
"Don't tell her."

1156
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:22,494
If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.

1157
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:26,498
Mummy!

1158
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,334
"Mummy."

1159
01:32:30,002 --> 01:32:32,212
Why are you crying, children?

1160
01:32:33,797 --> 01:32:35,799
What happened in this room?

1161
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:39,887
What did your mother do to you?

1162
01:32:52,566 --> 01:32:54,276
Something about a pillow.

1163
01:32:54,985 --> 01:32:57,279
Is that how she killed you?

1164
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:00,783
With a pillow?

1165
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:02,159
She didn't kill us!

1166
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:03,744
Children, if you're dead,

1167
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,663
why do you remain in this house?

1168
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,415
We're not dead!

1169
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:11,585
Why do you remain in this house?

1170
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,170
We're not dead!

1171
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:15,714
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1172
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:17,091
We're not dead!

1173
01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:20,219
Why do you remain in this house?

1174
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:23,013
- We're not dead!
- "We are not dead. We are not dead."

1175
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:25,140
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1176
01:33:25,307 --> 01:33:28,560
We're not dead! We're not dead!

1177
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:31,480
We're not dead! We're not...

1178
01:33:32,648 --> 01:33:33,732
dead!

1179
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:35,609
Oh!

1180
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,665
Are you all right?

1181
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,377
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1182
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:56,588
What happened?

1183
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:00,092
They made contact.

1184
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:04,221
- All three?
- Apparently, yes.

1185
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:07,015
The mother and the two children.

1186
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:10,978
Quite interesting, don't you think?

1187
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:14,481
Interesting? I was scared out of my wits!

1188
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:16,525
- Darling, calm down.
- No.

1189
01:34:16,692 --> 01:34:19,027
So far, we have handled
this matter your way.

1190
01:34:19,194 --> 01:34:20,863
But now you listen to me.

1191
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:23,407
We can't possibly
stay in this house any longer.

1192
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:26,493
It is quite clear that these beings
do not want us to live here.

1193
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:29,037
- We don't know anything about them yet.
- Yes, we do!

1194
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,915
We know the woman went mad,

1195
01:34:32,082 --> 01:34:34,501
smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1196
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,587
That's quite enough.

1197
01:34:36,753 --> 01:34:38,088
Think of our son.

1198
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,673
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1199
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,425
Yes, there is.

1200
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:44,469
He has nightmares.
He says he has seen that girl.

1201
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:47,514
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1202
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:49,892
Please, let us leave this house.

1203
01:34:50,058 --> 01:34:50,976
All right.

1204
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:54,563
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1205
01:34:55,147 --> 01:34:56,732
Oh, thank God for that.

1206
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,819
I'll just go and check on Victor.

1207
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,325
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

1208
01:35:06,491 --> 01:35:09,161
Pleasure. I hope we've been of some help.

1209
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:12,956
Oh, yes, of course. Though I must admit,
that was not the most pleasant...

1210
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:18,128
At first, I couldn't understand...

1211
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:22,883
what the pillow was doing in my hands...

1212
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:27,888
and why you didn't move.

1213
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:34,102
But then I knew.

1214
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,107
It had happened.

1215
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:45,614
I had killed my children.

1216
01:35:52,454 --> 01:35:54,206
I got the rifle.

1217
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,418
I put it to my forehead...

1218
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:04,800
and I pulled the trigger.

1219
01:36:09,554 --> 01:36:10,639
Nothing.

1220
01:36:18,313 --> 01:36:21,149
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.

1221
01:36:25,862 --> 01:36:29,408
You were playing with the pillows
as if nothing had happened.

1222
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,663
And I thought...

1223
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:38,709
...the Lord, in his great mercy,

1224
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:43,005
was giving me another chance,

1225
01:36:44,589 --> 01:36:48,719
telling me, "Don't give up."

1226
01:36:52,222 --> 01:36:53,432
Be strong.

1227
01:36:55,892 --> 01:36:57,311
Be a good mother...

1228
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:01,064
"for them."

1229
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:06,528
But now...

1230
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:11,491
Now...

1231
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,289
What does all this mean?

1232
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:23,211
Where are we?

1233
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:27,466
Young Lydia
said the very same thing

1234
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,386
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1235
01:37:32,637 --> 01:37:35,766
And that was the last time she ever spoke.

1236
01:37:38,268 --> 01:37:40,812
But I couldn't tell you that before now.

1237
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:48,445
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1238
01:37:52,699 --> 01:37:56,703
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

1239
01:37:57,329 --> 01:37:59,539
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1240
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:01,833
Other times, we won't.

1241
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:05,712
But that's the way it's always been.

1242
01:38:08,548 --> 01:38:09,549
Ma'am.

1243
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,180
Mummy.

1244
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:18,558
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

1245
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,435
Yes.

1246
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:22,521
Will we ever see him again?

1247
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:24,564
I don't know.

1248
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:29,694
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1249
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:36,701
I don't know if there even is a limbo.

1250
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:41,581
I'm no wiser than you are.

1251
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:47,045
But I do know that I love you.

1252
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:50,966
I've always loved you.

1253
01:38:54,886 --> 01:38:57,013
And this house is ours.

1254
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:00,434
You say it with me.

1255
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:04,521
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1256
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:07,190
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1257
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:10,152
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1258
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,823
<i>This house</i> is <i>ours.</i>

1259
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:18,618
<i>The house is ours.
The house is ours.</i>

1260
01:39:18,785 --> 01:39:20,454
<i>The house is ours...</i>

1261
01:39:27,627 --> 01:39:31,131
Mummy, look. It doesn't hurt anymore.

1262
01:39:42,267 --> 01:39:44,644
No one can make us leave this house.

1263
01:40:11,546 --> 01:40:12,839
Come along, Victor.
