00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,765
<i>What do you see
beyond this wall?</i>

3
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,433
<i>Picture it.</i>

4
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:18,603
<i>You've got an imagination.
Go ahead.</i>

5
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,375
What I see is a small town
in the Midwest.

6
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,578
Handful of churches.

7
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:30,314
Some places for the farmers
to get drunk together.

8
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,481
Maybe a salon

9
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:35,320
for their wives to do their hair
on the holidays.

10
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,224
I visit these places.

11
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,859
These are the people
who send us our profits,

12
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,897
who send us your wages.

13
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,698
I make movies, Judy,
but it's your job

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,002
to give those people dreams.

15
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,606
The economy's in the gutter,
and they pay for you.

16
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,275
And I'll tell you
something else.

17
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,944
In every one of those towns,
believe me,

18
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:04,414
there's a girl
who's prettier than you.

19
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,385
Maybe their nose is a little
thinner at the bridge.

20
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,988
They have better teeth than you.

21
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,625
Or they're taller
or they're slimmer.

22
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:17,059
Only, you have something

23
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,463
none of those pretty girls
can ever have.

24
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,698
You know what that is?

25
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:24,936
No, sir.

26
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,272
You have that voice.

27
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:31,342
It'll maybe take you to Oz,

28
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,879
someplace none of those pretty
girls can ever go.

29
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,383
Still, I'm told you're unhappy.

30
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,453
Well, no, sir, not unhappy.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,823
I'd just maybe like a little
more time.

32
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,960
Time? For what?

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,062
I don't know.

34
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,565
Maybe to go to the pictures
like those other girls do.

35
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,704
The thing is, those other girls
will grow up to be cashiers

36
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:03,573
and farmers' wives
and elementary school teachers.

37
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:07,078
And they'll see their skins
roughed up through housework.

38
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:09,846
Is that what you want, Judy?

39
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:11,983
To be just a housewife?

40
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:14,651
To be just a mother?

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,786
Out there,

42
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:20,121
you'd have to put away
that voice of yours.

43
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,725
Forget it exists.

44
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:25,463
But here, with us,
with your family,

45
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,429
that voice will make you
a million dollars

46
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:29,667
before you're 20.

47
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:39,476
Those average kids,
they're all loved, in their way.

48
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,744
I can see how you
may be drawn to it,

49
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,782
from time to time.
Their small lives.

50
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,652
Not too dangerous.
Not too exciting.

51
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,688
They're where they belong.

52
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:55,126
And maybe you feel like
you're like them.

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,762
But really, you're not.

54
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:01,032
You live in another world
entirely.

55
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,935
They just look like you.

56
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,906
But if you truly wanna
go join them,

57
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:10,875
it's your decision.

58
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,545
We'll shake hands and you
can walk through our gates.

59
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,783
I guarantee it's all there,

60
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,082
the rest of America,

61
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:25,923
just waiting to swallow you up
and forget all about you.

62
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,661
Like a raindrop
falling into the Pacific.

63
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,431
Who cares? Who even notices?

64
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,099
Of course I wanna stay
with the studio, LB.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,669
Any girl would kill
to be Dorothy.

66
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,038
I'm just terribly sorry if...

67
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,042
I didn't even say anything
to anyone.

68
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,613
You're my favorite, Judy.

69
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,118
- Who else have we had in?
- Shirley Temple this morning.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,524
Everybody loves Shirley.

71
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,793
Let's see how Judy measures up.

72
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,995
Joey, did you grow again?

73
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:41,998
I guess.

74
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,033
Oh! Well, could you at least
do it all at once?

75
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:47,805
Just get it over with
one weekend?

76
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:51,209
'Cause it's a new pair of pants
every time you add an inch.

77
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,811
Dad says vitamins
make me grow.

78
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,712
So, we'll cut those out.

79
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,182
Oh, I'm kidding, darling.

80
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:01,149
It's a wonderful thing
to have a son big enough

81
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,153
he can carry his mother
to the car.

82
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,557
Lorna, sweetheart,
let me see you.

83
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,156
What are we doing first?

84
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:10,194
Oh, the usual. Is that okay?

85
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,627
- Yeah.
- You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

86
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,665
- So, I have your money.
- Oh.

87
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,998
Crowd's gonna go crazy

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,199
- out there.
- Aw.

89
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,071
So, it's $150.

90
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,404
Uh, I know it's not maybe

91
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,873
- what you're used to, but...
- No, no, I appreciate it.

92
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,110
- All right.
- I do.

93
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,978
- Okay, you ready?
- Sure.

94
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:30,113
- Follow me.
- Go on.

95
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,014
<i>All right, folks...</i>

96
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,784
We'll just do what we did
in New York, yeah?

97
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,019
<i>Hope you're ready.
Put your hands together.</i>

98
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,687
Okay, let's go, let's go.

99
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,089
How are you tonight, Altadena?

100
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,723
<i>One of Hollywood's
true legends,</i>

101
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,858
<i>Miss Judy Garland.</i>

102
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,728
<i>Well, I've got something
very special</i>

103
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,066
<i>planned for you this evening.
I've brought my children along.</i>

104
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,258
What a journey.

105
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,562
I'm sorry it's so late.

106
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,831
How you doing, Georgie?

107
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,865
I'm okay, thank you,
Miss Garland. And you?

108
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,101
Oh, stumbling along.

109
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,139
Any messages
while we were out of town?

110
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,139
Uh, I don't think so.

111
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,945
Okay. Well, could I just
have my key, please?

112
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,949
Let me check something
with Mr. Horowitz. One moment.

113
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,686
Can we get room service, Mama?
I missed dinner.

114
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,288
Sure, sweetheart.
Anything you want.

115
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,726
- Miss Garland.
- Oh, please. I'm Judy.

116
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,096
- Could I have a word?
- Can it wait?

117
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,230
We're just desperate
to get to bed.

118
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,132
Lorna, darling,
tell Peter what you want

119
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,636
and he'll take care of it.

120
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,303
A hamburger and fries, please.

121
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,741
Oh, and, you know,
I'd love a bowl of soup.

122
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,709
And a drink.
Vodka rocks.

123
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,308
You know what, forget the soup.

124
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,848
I'm too tired to even
wield a spoon.

125
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,985
I'm very sorry, but your suite
has been released.

126
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,622
What do you mean, "released"?

127
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,990
It's not still attached
to the building?

128
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,959
Where exactly has it gone?

129
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,795
I believe your account
was in arrears.

130
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,366
Oh. No. No, I don't...
I don't think that's the case.

131
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,901
- The room got released.
- So un-release it.

132
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,069
Hand it back.
We need to sleep in it.

133
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,969
- Is everything okay?
- No. No, darling.

134
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,274
These people have let us
down very badly

135
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,910
leaving us stranded without so
much as a change of socks.

136
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,280
Everything is in storage.

137
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,980
I could have rooms
anywhere in this city,

138
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,217
but I chose this hotel.

139
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,085
Well, not anymore.

140
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,390
I wouldn't let my worst enemy
stay here.

141
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,292
Let's just go.

142
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,995
Outraged.

143
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,067
Come on, sweetheart.

144
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,512
- Please don't go to sleep now.
- No, no, no.

145
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,049
These are the other ones.

146
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,990
- Where are we going?
- The Roosevelt.

147
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,192
Didn't we stay there last year?

148
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,462
Sure.
But they like us.

149
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:36,966
Mama.

150
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,873
Could we head toward Brentwood,
please?

151
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,314
Joe, get the bell,
would you, darling?

152
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,094
So, you wanna stay?

153
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:04,828
No.

154
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,163
And they're only
staying tonight.

155
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,930
- So, they have school tomorrow.
- I know that.

156
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,035
They slept in the cab.
They'll be fine.

157
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,938
I probably paid more
on cab fare tonight

158
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,507
than I would've on a hotel.

159
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,307
- What about tomorrow night?
- What about it?

160
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,877
- Come on. Don't play that game.
- Well, you're needling me, Sid.

161
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,879
- Just ask me a straight question
- All right,

162
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:28,049
where are my children
gonna sleep tomorrow night?

163
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,220
Wherever I tell them.

164
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,521
Hi, sweetheart.

165
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,024
- Something wrong?
- Hey.

166
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:38,328
- I... I can't sleep.
- You want some milk?

167
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,528
- Come here.
- No, you go to bed.

168
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,234
We'll bring it to you, okay?
Don't worry.

169
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,773
Where are the mugs?

170
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,307
I moved them.

171
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,076
They're where the glasses were.

172
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,780
Ridiculous.

173
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,020
Couldn't you just take a role
in something?

174
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,556
I'm "unreliable."

175
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,958
And "uninsurable."

176
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:14,030
That's what the ones who like me
say to my face.

177
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,567
So, thank you for that.

178
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,035
Leave me out of it.

179
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,339
"Judy, leave it to me
and you'll be back on top."

180
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,608
- Look how that turned out.
- "Where is she, Sid?

181
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,042
Is she sick?

182
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,344
- Is she coming in today?"
- Don't.

183
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:31,912
- "Where's your star?"
- Don't.

184
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:33,915
"You realize we're gonna have
to sue you both, Sid."

185
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,049
- Don't start.
- "Why are you

186
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,420
even protecting her, Sid?

187
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,353
- What's going on?"
- Oh, shut up, Sid!

188
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,488
You can't turn up here
at one o'clock in the morning

189
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,557
- and expect...
- I know they should be in bed!

190
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,158
It just doesn't always
work that way.

191
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,496
And it gets late because nobody
wants to pay to see me

192
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,031
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

193
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,532
And I have to work,
because they need things.

194
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:55,270
They need an education, Judy.
They need ten hours of sleep.

195
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,405
Oh, just to hell with this.
Just call me a cab.

196
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,243
I want custody
during the school year.

197
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,179
Over my dead body.

198
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,151
Well, no one would be surprised,
believe me.

199
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,625
Give me the milk.

200
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:17,927
Give me the milk!

201
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,570
It's a little late for all that,
don't you think?

202
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,011
Why don't you see yourself out?

203
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,901
Can we go here, please?

204
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,267
<i>♪ Got to tell you true ♪</i>

205
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,334

This house is fabulous.

212
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,319
Look at that. She shows.

213
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,088
What, am I early?

214
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,323
- You look fabulous.
- Liza, darling,

215
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,259
you look beautiful.

216
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,594
I can't believe you came.
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:28,298
Well, I wanted to see you,
darling.

218
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,233
Are you in L.A. for a while?

219
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:33,734
Well, I never know, you know,
these days.

220
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,570
I have a show
opening in two days.

221
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,142
- You do? Really?
- Mm. Yeah.

222
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:42,209
- And how do you feel about it?
- I don't know.

223
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,545
I know my lines
and it's all in my range.

224
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,716
I guess I haven't really
thought about it that much.

225
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:50,218
You're not even
a little anxious about it?

226
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,523
- Well, should I be anxious?
- Well...

227
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,693
I mean, no.

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,729
No.

229
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,498
Um, we were off to go dance.

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,134
Will you come with us?

231
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,733
No, no.

232
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,472
No, you go.
I'll catch up to you.

233
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,193
Excuse me. This is for you.

234
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,694
We can't have the world's
greatest entertainer

235
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,231
out here without a drink.

236
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,235
Frank Sinatra's here?

237
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,673
Frank is great,
but he is no Judy Garland.

238
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,475
I bet it kills him.

239
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,182
- I'm Mickey, by the way.
- Judy.

240
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,322
So, you live in Los Angeles,
Mickey?

241
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,357
Mm. No, I manage a bar
back in New York.

242
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,694
I'm out here looking
at a business opportunity.

243
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,194
Hmm.

244
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,264
You ever make your own
cocktails?

245
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,330
- Hmm.
- This place, we sell the booze,

246
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,767
and all the mixings and stuff
is on the tables,

247
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,835
so you get to invent
something of your own.

248
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,403
You know, it's fun.

249
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:18,238
People drink more
'cause they wanna be part

250
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,739
of the next new thing,
you know.

251
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,144
- Oh?
- I don't know.

252
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,480
You have to have ambitions,
right?

253
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,715
Well, I used to have them.

254
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,815
I found they gave me
the most terrible headache.

255
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:29,752
Well...

256
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,456
if you wanna create
the Judy Garland martini,

257
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:33,790
that's me.

258
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,692
- Mr. Mickey Deans.
- Yep.

259
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,327
Hmm.

260
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,596
You have kids, Mickey?

261
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,797
Uh, no. No, I don't.

262
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,435
Hmm. Well, you shouldn't.

263
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,639
It's like living with your heart
on the outside of your body.

264
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:54,778
Find a hobby or something,
like canasta or birdwatching.

265
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,911
Well, I play piano, actually.

266
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:58,414
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,151
You play anything
or you just sing?

268
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,519
Just sing?

269
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:05,855
Sorry.
That's not what I...

270
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:08,623
- Did that come out wrong?
- My entire childhood

271
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,527
I must've slept five
hours total.

272
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,393
It's a wonder
I learned to use cutlery,

273
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,365
let alone play the violin.

274
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,337
We've changed our minds. We're
gonna head to Andy's place.

275
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,441
Will you come?

276
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,378
I don't know.
I think I might stay.

277
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,447
Well, you don't know
anyone here.

278
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,946
Well, everybody
seems to know me.

279
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,584
Besides, I wanna stay somewhere
for longer than five minutes.

280
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,188
You go. Have fun.

281
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,357
- Mom?
- I'm fine.

282
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:42,859
Go.

283
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,794
I love you.

284
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,200
- I love you.
- I love you.

285
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,788
- <i>Voilà.</i>
- The masterpiece.

286
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,562
Well, what now?

287
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:33,176
You can't!

288
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:56,500
Wanna hear something?

289
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:57,800
Yeah, sure.

290
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,637
I've nowhere else to be.

291
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:05,672
All right. If you don't like it,

292
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,741
just toss a drink at me
or something, okay?

293
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,279
- I'll get the message.
- I will, don't worry.

294
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,982
Do you wanna join me?

295
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,818
Hell, no.

296
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,387
I'm the audience.

297
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,903
It's very good.

298
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:43,512
This has been
a good time, huh?

299
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,451
Well, we're not done yet,
are we?

300
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,756
I hope not.

301
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,694
If you ever wanna get together,
just... click your heels.

302
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,796
That's how it works, right?

303
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,671
You gotta at least
eat some.

304
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,408
I don't know.

305
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,694
Oh!

306
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,665
Those are too good.

307
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,969
You're gonna have to,
I don't know,

308
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:42,635
tie my hands to the chair legs.
Only then

309
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,740
I'd probably lean forward
and grab 'em with my mouth.

310
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,778
Hey, I'm eating those.

311
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,980
You wanna see if I can manage
a whole hamburger?

312
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:55,551
Mickey?

313
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,388
Are we dating?

314
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,361
I just wanna know
so as I know how to look at you.

315
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,098
So...

316
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,931
I think we're just pals
who might be something more

317
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,502
sometime in the future.

318
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,772
You gotta ask Mr. Mayer.
I think it's just pals.

319
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,609
I'm not kissing you
if that's what you're after.

320
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,414
Your loss.

321
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,583
- Don't I know it.
- And anyways,

322
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,685
after a mouthful
of onion rings?

323
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:31,688
No, thanks!

324
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,156
No hamburger.

325
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:39,562
Mr. Mayer said very specifically
you were not to eat the food.

326
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:42,598
I'm honestly very hungry.

327
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,103
Those'll take the edge off.

328
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,472
No, I gotta sleep tonight.

329
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,476
Halpert will give you something
for that later. Down the hatch.

330
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,080
Okay, boys, here we go.

331
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:02,882
- ...get set up.
- Let her at least take a bite.

332
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:04,218
We can't have a Dorothy

333
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,085
who puts on weight
halfway through the picture.

334
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,154
- His words, not mine.
- Can you take another bite

335
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,826
with your head to the side,
Mr. Rooney?

336
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,228
- Yeah. That's our shot!
- That's great stuff.

337
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,567
That's great, Judy!

338
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,043
Okay. Right.

339
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

340
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,980
So, that was Sid's lawyers
on the phone.

341
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:35,719
- Why?
- He wants them

342
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:39,186
Sunday through Friday
during school time.

343
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,892
- No.
- He claims you're homeless.

344
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,159
How's he even
paying for a lawyer?

345
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,497
He's not making money
off me anymore.

346
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,566
So, where are you staying?

347
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,568
I love my children.
I take care of them.

348
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,634
Where'd you stay last night?

349
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:55,871
With a friend.

350
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,038
And is that somewhere maybe
you could take the kids to stay?

351
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,676
I don't have a home.

352
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:04,146
I can't even get a manager.

353
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:07,750
Step right up
and take 10% of my debts.

354
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,052
You know what I'm gonna say.

355
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:13,554
London would offer you

356
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:14,958
- a lot of money
- No.

357
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:16,957
See, they're crazy for you.

358
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,125
It's because the English
are insane.

359
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,894
Look, start earning again.

360
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:23,098
Then Sid's people
will have nothing on you.

361
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,634
Lorna does adore London.

362
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:27,971
Honey...

363
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:31,238
the courts won't let you
take them out of the country.

364
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,842
So, you're saying
I have to leave my children

365
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,878
if I wanna make enough money
to be with my children?

366
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,015
I know it's hard.

367
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,719
But I think you have
to take this seriously.

368
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:46,823
I can't.

369
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,135
Thank you.

370
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:11,515
Oh, God.

371
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,954
You'll miss Christmas.

372
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,924
Well, you see, darling,
the problem is that...

373
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,528
I don't currently own a chimney

374
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:28,197
for Santa to climb down,
so I'm no good to you kids.

375
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,768
But I'll be back
for New Year's, okay?

376
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,306
Joey.

377
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:37,973
Joe.

378
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:42,176
Darling, I have to fix things,
okay,

379
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:44,981
so I can see you every day,
the whole of every day.

380
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:49,149
I just need a little money
to make that happen.

381
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:50,820
Where would we live then?

382
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm going to find us a new home
for the three of us,

383
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,756
so don't you get
too comfortable here.

384
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,861
I'm coming straight back
for you.

385
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
I am.

386
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:05,068
Or maybe...

387
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,971
I could...

388
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:13,643
just hide out in here...

389
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,814
with Nibbles instead.

390
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,220
Okay.

391
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,929
Shh.

392
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:46,175
Ooh, it's very spacious in here.

393
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,312
I might just have a bathroom
plumbed in.

394
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:53,349
You wouldn't mind,
would you, Joe?

395
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:54,918
<i>I'd love it.</i>

396
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,689
Well, maybe I'll stay put, hmm?

397
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,058
Would you visit me
once in a while?

398
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:04,927
In Joey's wardrobe?

399
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,163
Oh, sure.

400
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,166
There's room for three.

401
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,641
Well, come on in.

402
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:22,709
Do you wanna... Do you guys
wanna play tennis or something?

403
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:23,879
There's a court over there.

404
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:26,416
Aw.

405
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:30,019
I do like it here.

406
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:37,394
I would very much like to stay.

407
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:44,067
Judy!

408
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:52,206
Hello, darling. Hello.
Hello, darling. Hello.

409
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,411
- I love you.
- I love you too, darling.

410
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,847
- Welcome to the Picador.
- Thank you very much.

411
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:01,050
Thank you.

412
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:04,250
- Hello.
- Welcome, Miss Garland.

413
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:05,454
Oh, thank you.

414
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:09,058
Ah, there she is.

415
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:12,258
- The fabulous Miss Judy Garland.
- Oh.

416
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,963
- Bernard Delfont. How are you?
- How wonderful. I'm good.

417
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:17,029
I just adore London,

418
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:19,533
- my home away from home.
- Marvelous.

419
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,000
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

420
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:22,004
- Hello.
- Hello.

421
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:23,871
I'm Rosalyn Wilder.
I'll be looking after you

422
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,109
- while you're in London.
- Wonderful.

423
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,111
Oh, lovely.

424
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,480
We have a schedule
printed for you.

425
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,883
How old are you?

426
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:36,953
I'm... I'm 28.

427
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:41,458
Oh, it is a little cold in here.

428
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,761
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

429
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,497
I'll have somebody
look into that right away.

430
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:49,399
Thank you.

431
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,900
Everywhere else I go,

432
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,001
it seems they just
knock the place down

433
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,139
and start over as soon
as I leave.

434
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,443
I come back the next year
and I have no idea where I am.

435
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:06,215
London just sort of slaps on
another coat of paint.

436
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,915
I suppose we're rather
old-fashioned.

437
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,753
Oh, no, I like it.

438
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,788
I like it.

439
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:14,988
It's comforting.

440
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,289
Call me if you need anything.

441
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,357
I'll leave my card
for you on the table here.

442
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,962
It's beside the schedule.

443
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:23,532
- Hadn't forgotten the...
- schedule.

444
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,302
I... I really do appreciate it.

445
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,038
- We'll see you tomorrow morning.
- See you tomorrow.

446
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,945
Thank you.
Right, here we are.

447
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:12,048
Here?

448
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,113
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

449
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:17,086
We do all our rehearsals here.
The acoustic is wonderful.

450
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:18,387
This way.

451
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:22,325
<i>♪ So... So... Somewhere ♪</i>

452
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,226
<i>♪ Over the rainbow ♪</i>

453
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,061
Well, that sounds familiar.

454
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,096
Judy,
this is our band leader,

455
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:31,931
Burt Rhodes. Burt, Judy.

456
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:32,999
- It's...
- Hello, Burt.

457
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,102
...an honor to be working
with you, Ms. Garland.

458
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,405
I've been an admirer
for a long time.

459
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,173
Well, I like this one.

460
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,976
He can stay.

461
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,611
The whole town
is talking about you.

462
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,278
Oh, well,
let's not dwell on that.

463
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,250
Oh, no.
It's completely sold out.

464
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,518
Hmm!

465
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,332
Miss Garland?

466
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:05,601
Do you need anything
or should we dive in?

467
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,403
You know,
it's really damp in here.

468
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,974
I don't think rehearsing
is a good idea.

469
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,979
Right.

470
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,248
- Uh...
- You understand, darling?

471
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:22,085
Okay, well, how about we talk
about the band positions?

472
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:24,988
Okay.

473
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,624
Well, I'm going to be here.

474
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:31,627
And this, this is the mark-up
for the stage.

475
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:34,898
Hmm.

476
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,303
Right.
And where's the audience?

477
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:43,038
Wrapped around you,
all three sides.

478
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,139
Mm-hmm.

479
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:47,543
- And they're on one level?
- Four.

480
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,620
How many tiers
was Carnegie Hall?

481
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:00,455
Five.

482
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:11,601
We can discuss the songs
if you really want to.

483
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:14,200
I have all your charts.

484
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:15,602
Any changes
you might like to make?

485
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,170
No, everything the same.

486
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:19,139
Is there anything
to discuss, then?

487
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,977
Sweetheart, that's up to you.

488
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:24,280
I don't particularly need
to discuss anything.

489
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:27,213
Judy, I'm afraid the critics

490
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:29,985
- will review opening night.
- Sure.

491
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,322
Of course.

492
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,558
- It's tomorrow.
- I'd like to rest.

493
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,966
<i>Hi. It's Judy.</i>

494
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:44,599
Are the kids there?

495
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,334
Will you tell them
that I called?

496
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:51,606
And that I'll try them again
at this time tomorrow?

497
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,708
<i>And I'd like them
to be on the line</i>

498
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,679
<i>next time I call, okay?</i>

499
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:41,790
- Good evening, Miss Garland.
- And to you.

500
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,260
Oh, do... Do you have the time?

501
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,626
It's 3:00 in the morning, ma'am.

502
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,598
- Oh.
- Can I get you anything?

503
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,636
I am having a little trouble
sleeping.

504
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:57,339
Some warm milk, perhaps?

505
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:00,476
Sure.

506
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,478
Thank you.
I'll try anything once.

507
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,449
I'll have them bring it
up to you straightaway.

508
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,317
Thank you.

509
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,526
- Has the stage door called yet?
- Not yet.

510
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:28,663
She's late.

511
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,470
Hello. Can we
go to the Picador, please?

512
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:55,657
Judy?

513
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,861
<i>Judy, it's Rosalyn.</i>

514
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,297
<i>How are you?</i>

515
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:03,798
I don't feel too good.

516
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:05,867
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

517
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:09,371
I said I don't feel good.

518
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:13,775
What kind of goddamn
lock is that?

519
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:17,911
If I lock a door,
I like it to stay that way.

520
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:20,182
That's completely
understandable.

521
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:23,451
Now, this is Vivian. She's going
to take your temperature.

522
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,589
Take a sip of this.

523
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:30,326
Tongue out for me.

524
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,396
Lips together for me, darling.

525
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:36,929
What's the prognosis?

526
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,201
No spots, no fever,
throat's fine.

527
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:40,903
Go for a nice red lippy.

528
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:45,505
What do you
think of this, Judy?

529
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:46,840
Oh, it's very pretty.

530
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,541
Put some silver dust
on your cheekbones.

531
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,845
You'll look incredible.

532
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,716
Are you a nurse or what?

533
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,284
Yeah, if you like.

534
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:57,617
Take an arm of this,
Vivian. You can finish that

535
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,721
- on the way.
- Yeah.

536
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,054
Now, oopsy-daisy.

537
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,923
- There we go. One leg in.
- Oh, God.

538
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:04,990
That's it.

539
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:05,994
Shoes.

540
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,862
- There we go.
- Hey!

541
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:13,568
You look
absolutely incredible.

542
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,438
All right!
All right, all right

543
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,842
We can't wait
to show you off.

544
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:22,909
I felt so terrible earlier.

545
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,543
Well,
you do work very hard.

546
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:26,014
You're under a lot of pressure.

547
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,949
Since I was two.

548
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,450
Judy Garland,
born in a trunk.

549
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:33,489
That's what I say.

550
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:35,891
Right.

551
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:38,460
Now...

552
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,601
Wait, wait. What are we...

553
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,803
It's opening night, Judy.

554
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:51,474
Oh, yes, of course.

555
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,514
Well, here we are.

556
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,043
Judy!

557
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,057
Hello. Hello, darling.

558
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:43,822
- Hello. Hello, darling.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

559
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:46,428
- I love you too, darling.
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

560
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:47,929
Let... Let us through, please.

561
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,436
- Hello, Judy.
- Are those for me?

562
00:36:57,438 --> 00:36:59,773
- These are for you.
- Oh, they're beautiful.

563
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:02,441
- You mean so much to us.
- We wanted you to know.

564
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,646
Gentlemen, sorry, but Judy
is running extremely late now.

565
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:06,679
Thank you, ladies.
Clear the way.

566
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:08,684
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

567
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,621
It's right up here, Judy.

568
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,028
Okay, here we go, boys.

569
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:25,965
What's the matter?

570
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,034
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- I can't.

571
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,570
What? No, no, no.
What do you mean, you can't?

572
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:33,606
There's an audience out there
waiting to hear you sing.

573
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,775
My mouth's dry
and it could fall apart.

574
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:37,844
- No. Listen to me.
- I can't.

575
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:40,548
You'll be fine.
Now, on you go.

576
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,571
- We love you, Judy!
- Oh, say!

577
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:06,441
And I love you, too.

578
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,844
In fact, I love this whole town.

579
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,047
Though you will always be
special.

580
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:21,123
You know, the first time...

581
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:22,891
I sang...

582
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,127
on a stage,
I was all of two years old.

583
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,699
They say my papa
had to come and drag me off

584
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:35,503
after I started singing the same
song for the fifth time.

585
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,916
Oh.
It seems we have a band here.

586
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:52,621

put them to use.

Yeah.

639
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,126
Judy, we're locking up.

640
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:28,497
Hmm. Okay.

641
00:43:32,032 --> 00:43:34,469
There's absolutely no rush.
Take your time.

642
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:40,943
Can I, uh, get you anything?

643
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:42,978
No. No, no.

644
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:53,521
I thought you were very good.

645
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:01,829
What if I can't do it again?

646
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:10,739
Oh.

647
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:17,146
- A mess.
- Here. Let me have a go at it.

648
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:22,083
There.

649
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:31,559
- Perfect.
- Brand new.

650
00:44:33,894 --> 00:44:36,331
Right. Well,
can I get you anything?

651
00:44:36,563 --> 00:44:37,965
No. No, thanks.

652
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,103
A glass of water or...

653
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:46,340
No, no. I'll get my bag
and I'll meet you outside.

654
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:48,343
Of course.

655
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:53,375
Get up.

656
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:00,982
I can't sleep at all anymore.

657
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:04,485
Please, I can't sleep.
Please. Please.

658
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:06,654
That's not my department.

659
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:09,891
But I can't remember the steps,

660
00:46:10,324 --> 00:46:12,624
and the others
keep pushing me to the back,

661
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:15,264
and everyone shouts at me
when I have a hard time with it.

662
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:17,365
Get up.

663
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,205
- What's this?
- Judy Garland turns 16.

664
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:27,910
- But that's not for two months.
- Gotta be today.

665
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:30,211
Scheduling issues.

666
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,214
Nobody splash her hair.

667
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:38,052
So this is really...
I mean, it's not really a party?

668
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,956
In the middle of a shoot?
You would have to be kidding.

669
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:43,057
There is a cake. Don't eat it.

670
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:45,291
Is it fake?

671
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,662
Pretend to eat it.

672
00:46:47,661 --> 00:46:49,330
You know I get an hour
for lunch?

673
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,267
- It's in my contract.
- What are you talking about?

674
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:57,068
I get an hour. I wanna have it.
I don't see why I shouldn't.

675
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,706
Nobody takes it. Come on.

676
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:03,110
Judy.

677
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,050
Don't you dare.

678
00:47:30,438 --> 00:47:32,304
Who wants to have some real fun?

679
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:33,405
Yeah!

680
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:34,976
What do you have in mind?

681
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,213
Is he propositioning me?

682
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,351
Who wants to hear
"The Trolley Song"?

683
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:47,318

Yeah?

706
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:32,661
Fan mail.

707
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:36,664
Is there anyone
at the stage door?

708
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:38,432
I'll go and check.

709
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:43,305
That's okay. I'll just go.

710
00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:57,318
We could have a drink
if you like.

711
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,255
I'll see you tomorrow.

712
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:06,894
Well, your television
interview's all confirmed.

713
00:50:07,427 --> 00:50:08,829
It's a prime slot, so...

714
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:11,867
Oh, marvelous. Thank you.

715
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:16,637
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

716
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,309
Good night, Norman.

717
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:25,744
Good night, Miss Garland.

718
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:29,518
- Aw! Evening, fellas.
- Bravo.

719
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:33,155
- You were wonderful again.
- Thank you, darling.

720
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:36,358
- Would you mind?
- Oh, of course.

721
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:42,764
Coming to see you every night
next week. You're just...

722
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,432
I, um... What was it
that I said earlier?

723
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,633
- About Judy?
- Yes, about Judy.

724
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:50,401
- Of course about Judy.
- Uh, it was about

725
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:53,805
how you seem to bypass the ears
and land here.

726
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:56,478
- That was the gist of it.
- Thank you.

727
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,448
Um...

728
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,920
Uh, do you...

729
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:07,955
Do you wanna, um...

730
00:51:10,324 --> 00:51:13,961
get some dinner or... I mean,
if you're not doing anything.

731
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:20,901
- You mean with us?
- I don't wanna impose.

732
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:25,606
- No. Yes. I mean...
- I mean, that would be beyond...

733
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,844
- Where's gonna be open?
- On a Tuesday after midnight...

734
00:51:31,378 --> 00:51:33,681
- If it's trouble, I don't...
- No, no, no. No.

735
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:36,648
- We'll find somewhere, won't we?
- Of course.

736
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,485
Great, okay, well...

737
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,655
Lead on, my good gentlemen.

738
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:45,526
- Your bag.
- Thank you, dear.

739
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,827
Oh!

740
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,530
I thought they'd be open.

741
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:51,729
Perhaps it was terrible
dragging you

742
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:54,369
- through the streets like this.
- Oh, no, don't.

743
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:56,937
I haven't had a chance
to see any of the city.

744
00:51:57,371 --> 00:52:00,307
And, well,
now I've seen all of it, so...

745
00:52:00,974 --> 00:52:01,976
Sweet.

746
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,380
Would you like me
to make you an omelet?

747
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:09,682
Obviously, we'll try
for something a little better

748
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:10,719
than an omelet.

749
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:12,921
We're just round the corner.

750
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:15,624
You won't believe it,

751
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:17,692
but it was twice
with Mickey Rooney.

752
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:21,860
You are outrageous.
You all right

753
00:52:21,862 --> 00:52:23,494
- with the green plates?
- Yes, please.

754
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:24,829
- Great.
- I like those.

755
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,498
- Me too.
- Mm.

756
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,335
I think I messed this up.

757
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:32,373
You can't really mess up
an omelet.

758
00:52:32,706 --> 00:52:34,572
I put cream in it.

759
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,974
- Why would you put cream in?
- To make it more special.

760
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:39,445
And instead you've simply
made it not work.

761
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,746
Yes, I'm aware of that.

762
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:42,780
If it won't settle
for being an omelet,

763
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:45,751
just give it a shove,
and we'll have scrambled eggs.

764
00:52:45,753 --> 00:52:47,853
- Would you mind?
- For goodness' sake,

765
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:50,425
has there ever been so much
drama over half a dozen eggs?

766
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,693
I mean, we invite you
over for dinner,

767
00:52:55,695 --> 00:52:56,994
all we offer you are eggs,

768
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:58,666
and now you're doing
the cooking.

769
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:00,434
I always do the cooking.

770
00:53:02,135 --> 00:53:04,103
No, I can't. I can't bear it.
Come on.

771
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:06,771
- I'm a very good cook.
- I'm sure. Put that spoon down.

772
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:08,375
- You don't trust me.
- I do.

773
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,976
Put that spoon down,
would you?

774
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:14,380
Please, for me. Put the spoon...
Let's give you a drink. Come on.

775
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:16,048
I'm always going to use cream
from now on.

776
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,617
It'll be fine.
Let's get you a drink. Come on.

777
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:20,021
You sit yourself down.

778
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:24,058
Are you gonna come through
or hide in there all night?

779
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:27,829
I'm not sure
that was even scrambled eggs.

780
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:31,662
Well, we know some eggs
went into the pan.

781
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:33,701
- We witnessed that.
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:53:41,842 --> 00:53:43,411
It was delicious.

783
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:47,682
Whatever it was.

784
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,485
Shh.

785
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:06,033
It's sweet
that you come to see me.

786
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:11,740
Sometimes I spy the two
of you out there.

787
00:54:13,907 --> 00:54:16,009
I feel like I have allies.

788
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:23,684
Well, we missed you
in '64, so...

789
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,088
- You couldn't get tickets?
- Not together, no.

790
00:54:31,492 --> 00:54:35,430
Stan was otherwise engaged.

791
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,635
Six months for obscenity.

792
00:54:42,735 --> 00:54:43,737
In jail?

793
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:48,843
They've changed the law
since then.

794
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:51,679
Turns out we didn't do
anything wrong after all.

795
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,950
They hound people in this world.

796
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,552
Anybody who's different.

797
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:01,021
They can't stand it.

798
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:04,525
Well, to hell with them.

799
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:13,001
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

800
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:16,934
We decided to make up for it
in style this time,

801
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:19,473
and it is money well spent.

No, thank you.

816
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,686
What?

817
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:49,287
- Room service.
- I didn't order anything.

818
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,822
It's the first sleep
I've gotten in weeks!

819
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:53,260
And you woke me up.

820
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,597
There's a man under the trolley.

821
00:57:57,164 --> 00:57:58,262
What?

822
00:57:58,264 --> 00:57:59,766
Hey, baby.

823
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:02,903
Surprise.

824
00:58:04,038 --> 00:58:05,173
Mickey?

825
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:12,679
What are you doing here?
I can't believe it.

826
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:20,786
What a wonderful surprise.

827
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,056
Oh!

828
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:26,259
Oh. Well...

829
00:58:27,728 --> 00:58:30,932
- this is me.
- Yeah, it's nice, it's nice.

830
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:33,835
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

831
00:58:34,134 --> 00:58:35,400
- Yeah?
- Literally.

832
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,001
I just walked off the plane.

833
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,007
- I'm just passing through.
- Where are you staying?

834
00:58:40,373 --> 00:58:42,807
I don't know. I don't know.
I literally just showed up.

835
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,144
I haven't thought
about anything.

836
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,247
Well, stay here.

837
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:48,248
Yeah?

838
00:58:49,717 --> 00:58:51,885
I'm drowning in space.

839
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,989
Yeah, no, I mean, that...
That sounds great.

840
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:00,961
Okay. I'll stay here, then.

841
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,266
It's so good to see you again.

842
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:11,105
You ever tried a crumpet?

843
00:59:11,905 --> 00:59:14,005
- Mm.
- It's like a pancake

844
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:15,842
that's had the living shit
kicked out of it.

845
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:18,045
You gonna eat something?

846
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:22,380
No, no. No, I'm fine.

847
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:24,916
Well, have some eggs.
The tomatoes are pretty good.

848
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:25,920
I'm fine.

849
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,387
Come on, have a bite.

850
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:29,887
What do you wanna do?

851
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:30,891
I'm easy.

852
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,092
Maybe, uh... get a drink

853
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,396
- with your friends.
- Sure.

854
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:37,699
We could get the gang together.

855
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,802
I'll make some calls.

856
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,175
Yeah, it's okay.

857
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:50,010
It's just okay?

858
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:52,346
It's a little old-ladyish.

859
01:00:00,186 --> 01:00:01,822
I'm just saying.

860
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:04,325
You got great legs.

861
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,291
Show them off.

862
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:07,327
Yeah?

863
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:09,029
Yeah.

864
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:12,099
Wow.

865
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,737
Wish there was a little more
of them.

866
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,805
So, let's go shopping, baby.

867
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,041
Hmm?

868
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:22,943
- Get you dolled up.
- I don't know.

869
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:26,980
Oh, come on.
A woman's gotta wear something.

870
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:30,184
Or not, right?

871
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:31,184
Look out.

872
01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:33,955
Don't kill America's sweetheart
here.

873
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:37,354
All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

874
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:39,858
Oh, yeah, I have a great idea
for a new shop.

875
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,062
Oh? What's that?

876
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:50,267
It's great to meet you guys.
I've heard so much about you.

877
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:51,536
How are you enjoying London,
Mickey?

878
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:54,775
It's one of the world's great
cities, you know, it really is.

879
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,344
And there's a lot of
opportunities here, too.

880
01:00:57,844 --> 01:01:00,981
Like with The Beatles
new record. You've heard it?

881
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:04,152
It's good.
It's very, very experimental.

882
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:06,988
And it's still number one
on the charts, you know?

883
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,490
That tells me that
there is an appetite out there.

884
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:12,793
For The Beatles?

885
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:16,264
Well, for great artists
trying new things.

886
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:18,630
Like, I don't know you, Burt.
Judy says you're great.

887
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:20,432
These are just new ideas,
you know.

888
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:22,566
But what if it's not
Judy and Burt?

889
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:26,137
What if it's... What if it's Judy
and The Rolling Stones?

890
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:28,206
What is that?

891
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,374
I don't know.
Maybe it's something, right?

892
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,313
Are you going to ask them
or should I?

893
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:37,315
Maybe somebody should.
That's all I'm saying for now.

894
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:40,619
That's the most
fascinating conjecture.

895
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:42,119
- Thank you.
- Don't you think?

896
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:43,190
Oh, absolutely.

897
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:45,893
Ha!

898
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,129
All right, yeah, cool.
Another round?

899
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:49,963
- Yeah, great.
- Great.

900
01:01:58,972 --> 01:02:00,608
You don't think I could do it.

901
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,110
Well, I just...

902
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:06,112
Well, I'm trying
to take the idea in.

903
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:08,882
Well, he thinks I could do it.

904
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:12,854
Isn't that sweet?

905
01:02:15,322 --> 01:02:16,688
Judy, what you having?

906
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,027
- Gin and tonic?
- Yes.

907
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:23,228
The studio portrayed you

908
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:27,365
as the sort of typical
American teenage girl next door.

909
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:29,070
Is that how you remember things?

910
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:31,471
Louis B. Mayer.

911
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:36,106
Oh, MGM put out all these
stories about how I ate pizza

912
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:37,577
like any other girl.

913
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,612
They didn't let me have
any pizza at all.

914
01:02:40,614 --> 01:02:42,680
Every lunchtime for a year,

915
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:46,217
they had me eating
Louis B. Mayer's chicken soup

916
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:48,556
till I was thin enough
to play Dorothy.

917
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:56,130
The truth is,
those years left their mark,

918
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,132
- though, isn't it?
- Oh, sure.

919
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:02,467
Hollywood's chicken population
never recovered.

920
01:03:03,704 --> 01:03:05,072
Very good.

921
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:08,576
But your childhood
at the studio,

922
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,079
it did lead to problems,
didn't it?

923
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:17,050
Well, what matters to me now
is my children's happiness,

924
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,349
that's all.

925
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:19,552
Are they here with you
in London?

926
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:21,722
They have school.

927
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,925
Well,
they must miss their mother.

928
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:28,329
Hopefully they're having an
easier time of it than you had.

929
01:03:28,695 --> 01:03:29,931
Well, we all...

930
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:34,034
Everybody has their troubles,
and I've had mine.

931
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:37,571
I've probably had everybody
else's too.

932
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:41,675
Has it affected
your children, do you think?

933
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:44,175
What?

934
01:03:44,177 --> 01:03:45,479
The fights over custody.

935
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:47,480
Your children
living away from you.

936
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:51,182
I mean, if I'm this terrible
mother they like to write about,

937
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:54,753
well, you tell me how I end up
with such incredible kids.

938
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:57,088
But I wasn't suggesting...

939
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,425
Well, no,
everybody suggests things,

940
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:05,195
like I'm not a real person,
but I am, you understand?

941
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,734
I'm only Judy Garland
for an hour a night.

942
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:11,105
The rest of the time,
I'm part of a family.

943
01:04:11,505 --> 01:04:13,541
I just want
what everybody wants.

944
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:16,610
I seem to have a harder time
getting it.

945
01:04:18,344 --> 01:04:19,980
I didn't mean to upset you.

946
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:21,615
Thank you.

947
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:24,684
Have you seen Judy?

948
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:31,822
Gill, you haven't seen Judy,

949
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,059
- have you?
- No, I'm sorry.

950
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:34,992
- Judy?
- <i>Miss Garland</i>

951
01:04:34,994 --> 01:04:37,561
<i>to the stage, please.
Miss Garland.</i>

952
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:47,608
Judy, it's twelve o'clock.

953
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:49,242
And?

954
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:51,578
And there's a thousand
people upstairs

955
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:54,681
- waiting to hear you sing.
- So bring 'em another drink.

956
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:56,684
And have 'em bring me one, too.

957
01:04:57,818 --> 01:04:59,020
I know...

958
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:03,656
- I know it's not easy.
- Oh, you do, do you?

959
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:05,523
I mean, the shows

960
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,528
- have been a huge success.
- So what?

961
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:12,729
It doesn't change anything.
What difference does it make?

962
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:13,733
Look.

963
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:16,803
I'll do all I can to help you
resolve whatever's going on.

964
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:22,742
But, please... for my sake,
just... Just... Just do the show.

965
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,780
You're a classy little number,
aren't you?

966
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:28,748
Just get up and sing!

967
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:32,550
You wanna serve me up to them
like I'm their goddamn dinner.

968
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:34,619
Judy, I'm sorry, but that is not
what I'm trying to do.

969
01:05:34,621 --> 01:05:36,456
- I'm trying to help you.
- Don't Judy me.

970
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:38,491
You're not my friend.

971
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:43,329
You don't care about me.

972
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:48,432
Listen, it's fine.

973
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,568
It's fine. We'll just
have Lonnie Donegan perform.

974
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,202
Over my dead body!

975
01:05:52,204 --> 01:05:54,741
- If you don't want to do it...
- It's my show.

976
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:56,807
It's my name up there.

977
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:00,346
No, Lonnie Donegan
is a peach of a man,

978
01:06:01,148 --> 01:06:05,086
but he can go fuck himself if he
thinks he's having my billing.

979
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:08,856
- She's upset.
- Yes, I gathered that.

980
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,359
Evening, Lonnie.

981
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,300
No! No time for that, Burt.

982
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,137
We've got a show to,
you know, put on.

983
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:25,639
- You're late.
- So what?

984
01:06:25,871 --> 01:06:28,475
It's a party.
Where are you?

985
01:06:29,476 --> 01:06:31,445
Oh! What, do you have to be home

986
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,313
for your mommy
to put you to bed?

987
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:34,848
Be a man,
have another drink.

988
01:06:35,248 --> 01:06:36,813
Have one on me.

989
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,650
He's gonna have one on me.

990
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:42,556
- What you let her on stage for?
- Wonderful to be here.

991
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:43,757
There you go.

992
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:45,492
Yeah.

993
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:50,795
Is this... Is this Chicago?
What is it?

994
01:06:50,797 --> 01:06:52,599
The set list says San Francisco.

995
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:56,370
Chicago, San Francisco...

996
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,771
What the hell town
are we in anyway?

997
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:01,808
Sing us a song.

998
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,309
Is that you again? I thought you
were gonna have a drink.

999
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:06,945
You drank the bar dry.

1000
01:07:06,947 --> 01:07:08,548
Oh!

1001
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:15,588
Why did you just
spoil it for everyone?

1002
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:20,224
How am I supposed to do this
up here with you harassing me

1003
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,726
like that down there?
Why don't you

1004
01:07:21,728 --> 01:07:23,595
come up here
and you do the show?

1005
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:26,563
And I'll take the chair
and do the fatuous backtalk,

1006
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:28,999
you goddamn fucking baboon!

1007
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:44,251
I want her changed
and ready in five minutes.

1008
01:07:46,385 --> 01:07:48,255
I'd like a moment with Judy.

1009
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,248
I had a swim.

1010
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:16,382
How was the water?

1011
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:19,687
Cold.

1012
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,922
That's because it's a prop.

1013
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:24,225
It's not meant to be enjoyed.

1014
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:27,961
I did 18 hours yesterday.

1015
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,365
I mean, I couldn't hardly
remember my own name.

1016
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:35,235
Your name is Frances Gumm.

1017
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:38,503
You're a fat-ankled,
snag-toothed rube

1018
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:40,304
from Grand Rapids.
Your father was a faggot,

1019
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,542
and your mother only cares
about what I think of you.

1020
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:46,713
Now, do you remember
who you are, Judy?

1021
01:08:49,548 --> 01:08:51,482
I'm sorry if I slowed things
down a little.

1022
01:08:51,484 --> 01:08:52,853
We like you loyal.

1023
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:56,824
You're the best friend.
The girl next door.

1024
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,927
- You're faithful.
- I'm sorry.

1025
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:02,462
You sing from the heart, Judy.

1026
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:05,865
You know where the heart is?

1027
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,338
It's there.

1028
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:16,741
Now, I want you
to look me in the eye

1029
01:09:16,743 --> 01:09:19,913
and tell me you remember
we made a deal.

1030
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,416
I know I did.

1031
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:25,586
You made that choice.

1032
01:09:26,586 --> 01:09:28,622
I was there.
I heard you make it.

1033
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:33,994
I'm sorry.

1034
01:09:35,595 --> 01:09:37,829
You wanna go swimming,
you come over to my beach house.

1035
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:39,432
You can swim there all night.

1036
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:46,974
Now, say thank you.

1037
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:50,443
Thank you.

1038
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:55,449
Don't ever hold up
a movie of mine.

1039
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,328
You know what?

1040
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:10,997
You need your own place.

1041
01:10:12,097 --> 01:10:14,368
A club or something.
Someplace...

1042
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:17,837
people are gonna come to anyway
because it's a cool place.

1043
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:22,440
And if you sing, it's a goddamn
perfect miracle of a night.

1044
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:25,645
And if you don't, it's no foul,
it was a good time.

1045
01:10:26,845 --> 01:10:28,881
People just wanna be around you.

1046
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:30,984
You have that.

1047
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:37,457
You know, I talk to people.
You don't hear it.

1048
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:39,393
They all love you.

1049
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,096
I'm serious.
You don't see it.

1050
01:10:42,929 --> 01:10:44,728
People talk about
what's next for you

1051
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,532
because maybe they
could get in on it.

1052
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:48,668
Because you're a big deal.

1053
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,170
I... I have a perspective on this
that I think you don't.

1054
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:56,476
I see how great you are.
I don't see the problems.

1055
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:01,382
You'll get it perfect next time,
all right?

1056
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:05,452
Sweetheart?

1057
01:11:08,621 --> 01:11:09,890
You can't stay there forever.

1058
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:13,493
Sweetheart.

1059
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:17,663
I really feel just terrible

1060
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,964
about last night.

1061
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:23,768
I sincerely believed that I was
coming down with something.

1062
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,706
And I took a syrup for the flu.

1063
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:28,741
And I was off with the fairies.

1064
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:31,512
And I just... I got so upset.

1065
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:37,884
And, Rosalyn, I wanna thank you
for... For looking after me.

1066
01:11:39,018 --> 01:11:40,020
Oh...

1067
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:45,125
If I'd have known
you were unwell,

1068
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:47,528
I wouldn't have asked you
to sing.

1069
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:51,465
And the press
might've been more forgiving.

1070
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,501
But can you forgive me?

1071
01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,806
It's forgotten.

1072
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:02,576
The question is...

1073
01:12:04,077 --> 01:12:06,012
how are you feeling today?

1074
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,817
Well, as it happens,
I feel terrific.

1075
01:12:10,516 --> 01:12:13,519
We have a man
I'd encourage you to see.

1076
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:16,590
He does vitamin injections.

1077
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,694
Whatever you'd like me to do.

1078
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:26,696
Right.
Would you sing for me,

1079
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:27,900
- please?
- Sing?

1080
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:30,237
Any scale will do.

1081
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,480
Good, and up.

1082
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:57,664
Right, well...

1083
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:00,701
it's not in a good way, is it?

1084
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:05,538
Have there been any surgeries?

1085
01:13:06,605 --> 01:13:09,076
Tracheotomy.
Two years ago.

1086
01:13:11,144 --> 01:13:12,613
Tried to kill myself.

1087
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:14,948
That won't have
helped your voice.

1088
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,182
Hmm.

1089
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:20,287
Hepatitis as well.

1090
01:13:20,886 --> 01:13:23,023
Look, do you take anything
for depression?

1091
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:25,057
Four husbands.

1092
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:29,029
Didn't work.

1093
01:13:30,128 --> 01:13:31,631
I'd say you're underweight.

1094
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:34,134
Well, you're flirting
with me now.

1095
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:38,302
Mr. Delfont asked me
to give you something,

1096
01:13:38,304 --> 01:13:39,907
so I'm going to give you

1097
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,940
a vitamin injection
and some anti-inflammatories

1098
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:46,643
for your vocal cords.
What you really need is rest.

1099
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:47,648
Mm!

1100
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:49,950
At home, with my children.

1101
01:13:50,882 --> 01:13:53,686
- Precisely. With your feet up.
- Mm-hmm.

1102
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:04,730
Good.

1103
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,234
Ooh!

1104
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:11,939
Do you know, I, uh...

1105
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:17,610
I had an absolute thing
for Dorothy Gale.

1106
01:14:18,243 --> 01:14:19,313
My goodness.

1107
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:23,149
A lot of boys
liked her pigtails.

1108
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,417
Yeah. For me, it was...

1109
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:28,789
It was more about
how she took care of her dog.

1110
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:34,694
You might be the most English
man I've ever met.

1111
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:38,064
Judy...

1112
01:14:39,765 --> 01:14:41,934
you need to take better care
of yourself.

1113
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,770
You understand?

1114
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,309
- Do you understand?
- Mm.

1115
01:15:04,756 --> 01:15:06,456
<i>So there's a guy
I mentioned.</i>

1116
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:07,693
Mm-hmm.

1117
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:09,427
Desperate to do a deal with you.

1118
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:10,831
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1119
01:15:12,032 --> 01:15:15,402
His thing is a chain of maybe
500 movie theaters, okay?

1120
01:15:16,135 --> 01:15:19,070
Each one is called
a Judy Garland Picture House.

1121
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:20,073
Every one?

1122
01:15:21,073 --> 01:15:23,175
All you gotta do for each one
is you open it,

1123
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:26,179
and you get 10% of sales.

1124
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:28,079
- Ten percent?
- Ten percent.

1125
01:15:28,081 --> 01:15:30,281
He tried to make it seven,
but I pushed him up.

1126
01:15:30,283 --> 01:15:32,083
And I don't have to
do anything else?

1127
01:15:32,085 --> 01:15:33,753
No touring, nothing.

1128
01:15:34,087 --> 01:15:37,891
You get to pay off your debts,
you buy that house,

1129
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:41,328
and you see your kids
every single day.

1130
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,163
- Mickey.
- You're free.

1131
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,263
Isn't that the greatest thing
you ever heard?

1132
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,201
Yes, it's the greatest thing.

1133
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:50,671
Oh, darling.

1134
01:15:51,136 --> 01:15:53,139
- Good news, right?
- Yes.

1135
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,377
Yeah, just had to tell you that.

1136
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:01,881
This isn't so bad, is it?

1137
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:05,152
I mean, I know it's not family,
but...

1138
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:07,153
You're family.

1139
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,789
That's how I feel.

1140
01:16:11,356 --> 01:16:12,391
Yeah?

1141
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:16,129
I have an incredible feeling
about you, Mickey.

1142
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:18,398
Look what you're doing.

1143
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:20,834
Look how you take care of me.

1144
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,235
I mean, it's completely crazy,

1145
01:16:24,237 --> 01:16:26,038
- but...
- But it's very real.

1146
01:16:26,972 --> 01:16:28,240
Yeah, I know.

1147
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:29,775
I know.

1148
01:16:33,246 --> 01:16:34,780
Are you happy?

1149
01:16:36,114 --> 01:16:38,851
Yeah... I am.

1150
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:42,285
You and me.

1151
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:43,422
You and me.

1152
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,059
I want us to get married.

1153
01:16:48,493 --> 01:16:51,964
I feel like any moment
we're not married is wasted.

1154
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:55,868
I mean, do you
remember Scotty Beckett?

1155
01:16:56,101 --> 01:16:59,436
He played my kid brother in
<i>Listen, Darling</i> in '37 or '38.

1156
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:02,473
He was the sweetest kid.
And last year, just like that,

1157
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:04,044
he's dead from something
or other.

1158
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:07,279
That and...
I'm happy with you.

1159
01:17:08,113 --> 01:17:10,216
And shouldn't we
grab hold of that?

1160
01:17:13,286 --> 01:17:15,221
I... I'm here, aren't I?

1161
01:17:15,854 --> 01:17:17,321
That's a hell of an answer.

1162
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:20,357
Sweetheart, I already said
I love you nine times today.

1163
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:22,262
Well, maybe I need ten,

1164
01:17:22,962 --> 01:17:26,099
or 12, once an hour,
like a cuckoo clock.

1165
01:17:26,431 --> 01:17:28,033
Cuckoo!
I love you!

1166
01:17:30,136 --> 01:17:31,235
Well?

1167
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:40,277
Mm.

1168
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:41,879
To the happy couple.

1169
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:43,450
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1170
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:48,355
It's our present to you,

1171
01:17:48,554 --> 01:17:50,356
so you just trust me, okay?

1172
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:53,891
Judy, Judy, you go to the front.

1173
01:17:53,893 --> 01:17:55,860
It's a surprise.
It's a surprise.

1174
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:57,797
Burt, are you ready?

1175
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:00,063
I think the bloody
matches are damp.

1176
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:02,967
Matches?
I'm a little terrified.

1177
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,438
This way you can say you've had
an English church wedding.

1178
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:08,205

Sid?

1217

So I hear you got married again.

1219
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,402
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1220
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,173
How have the shows been?

1221
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,042
They've been wonderful.
I'm a hit.

1222
01:20:57,743 --> 01:21:01,247
Well, maybe you'll make it
as a singer after all.

1223
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:04,317
- I think I at least have a shot.
- Hmm.

1224
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:14,290
Who's looking after the kids?

1225
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,694
They're being looked after.

1226
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:18,097
By whom?

1227
01:21:18,564 --> 01:21:19,733
A maid?

1228
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:25,704
Maybe we, uh...

1229
01:21:27,706 --> 01:21:29,175
Maybe it's time we...

1230
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:32,012
put all the lawyers aside.

1231
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:34,378
Can't afford them either, huh?

1232
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,050
You and I need to work out
what's best for the kids.

1233
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:38,518
They need to know...

1234
01:21:39,318 --> 01:21:42,322
how their general
situation's gonna be.

1235
01:21:42,555 --> 01:21:44,758
- I'm coming back for them.
- The kids need a home.

1236
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,258
- I can give them that.
- I know what kids need.

1237
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,329
- They need their mother.
- They also need school,

1238
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:53,533
and friends
they can rely on seeing.

1239
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,301
No.

1240
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:56,767
- Come on.
- No, Sid.

1241
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:58,738
- Judy.
- No. No!

1242
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:02,339
I'm working harder
than you would ever believe.

1243
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:03,840
- Are you?
- And right now,

1244
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:06,110
my husband is making
a deal for me

1245
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:08,312
- that means I can start over.
- You're not listening.

1246
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:09,749
I have someone
I can rely on now.

1247
01:22:10,349 --> 01:22:11,748
Someone who's helping me
make money

1248
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,483
instead of losing it
at the track.

1249
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:15,755
- Can we not...
- I'm going to get a place.

1250
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:18,391
And they're going
to live with me.

1251
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:29,101
I don't want them
on stage with me,

1252
01:22:30,202 --> 01:22:33,236
I don't want them
in this phony business,

1253
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,176
and I don't want them anywhere
near the bastards who run it.

1254
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,250
But you have to let me be with
them, Sid.

1255
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:47,420
I'm a good mother.

1256
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:56,429
I know you try.

1257
01:22:58,396 --> 01:23:01,501
That's a sneaky little jab
in the guts.

1258
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:06,202
I know what a bad mother is.
I lived with one.

1259
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:08,507
They love you.
They do.

1260
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:11,511
They miss you,
and they wanna see you.

1261
01:23:12,578 --> 01:23:14,114
And they also wanna stay put.

1262
01:23:17,515 --> 01:23:18,650
That's what they want.

1263
01:23:19,251 --> 01:23:20,520
- That's the truth.
- Stay put?

1264
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:22,789
- That's what they told me.
- Stay put with you.

1265
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:25,325
- That's what they told me.
- I see.

1266
01:23:26,524 --> 01:23:28,560
And I'm just supposed
to take your word for it.

1267
01:23:30,261 --> 01:23:32,262
- What, you think I'm an idiot?
- Judy.

1268
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:33,533
You think I'm an idiot?

1269
01:23:33,832 --> 01:23:35,799
Do you think I'd take your word
for anything,

1270
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:37,433
you lousy son of a bitch?

1271
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:40,370
That my children would wanna
live anywhere that I'm not?

1272
01:23:40,372 --> 01:23:42,705
- Keep it down.
- It's not true!

1273
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:45,244
- Keep your voice down.
- It's not true!

1274
01:23:46,311 --> 01:23:48,814
I knew you were low,
but, Jesus, Sid.

1275
01:23:49,981 --> 01:23:51,184
No.

1276
01:23:51,716 --> 01:23:53,318
- Sit down.
- No.

1277
01:24:15,306 --> 01:24:16,309
Mickey?

1278
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:19,279
Hey.

1279
01:24:20,945 --> 01:24:23,914
Thank God you're back.

1280
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,353
Never again. Do you hear me?
You can't leave me like that.

1281
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:30,289
- All right
- Did you miss me?

1282
01:24:30,555 --> 01:24:31,857
- Of course.
- Yeah?

1283
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:33,926
- I got you something.
- You did?

1284
01:24:34,592 --> 01:24:37,497
- No.
- The shop didn't carry wrapping.

1285
01:24:38,296 --> 01:24:42,668
I love it. I love it.
Oh, darling, thank you.

1286
01:24:43,368 --> 01:24:44,503
Thank you.

1287
01:24:45,637 --> 01:24:46,902
What time is it?

1288
01:24:46,904 --> 01:24:48,774
- Uh...
- They'll be waiting for me.

1289
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:51,611
Oh, the day I've had.

1290
01:24:51,844 --> 01:24:54,346
- What happened?
- I just...

1291
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:56,412
I need a drink.

1292
01:24:56,414 --> 01:24:58,217
- Would you mind?
- Of course.

1293
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:01,821
How was New York?
How'd it go?

1294
01:25:03,354 --> 01:25:05,755
You know, we need to send some
of the advance money

1295
01:25:05,757 --> 01:25:08,825
to my lawyer straight away.
I wanna reopen custody.

1296
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:10,697
And I feel like, you know,
I should...

1297
01:25:10,895 --> 01:25:12,731
at least pay him something,
you know?

1298
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:15,635
Um... sweetheart?

1299
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:16,868
<i>Yeah?</i>

1300
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,443
Yeah?

1301
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:26,812
What's wrong?

1302
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:30,649
It didn't, uh...
turn out like I wanted.

1303
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:32,719
What do you mean?

1304
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,421
The deal.

1305
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:38,524
It... It didn't work out.

1306
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:41,361
- I don't understand.
- Yeah.

1307
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:43,826
You have to keep singing
for a while, I think.

1308
01:25:43,828 --> 01:25:45,728
You have more dates
at Talk of The Town.

1309
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:49,031
No, I can't keep touring.
I have to go home to my kids.

1310
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,470
I have to go home.
You promised.

1311
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:55,539
- I tried my best, Judy, okay?
- No, you promised.

1312
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,540
Look, I tried to make
something happen,

1313
01:25:57,542 --> 01:25:59,545
but they had other ideas,
all right?

1314
01:25:59,811 --> 01:26:01,814
- Why?
- Why?

1315
01:26:02,613 --> 01:26:05,350
- I don't know.
- Yeah, why? Why, Mickey?

1316
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:07,918
Showing up late,
cursing at the audience.

1317
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,719
Their wives read about that
in the papers.

1318
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:10,756
They got cold feet.

1319
01:26:12,725 --> 01:26:14,727
So I messed it up?

1320
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,563
That's their opinion about it.
If you wanna know, yeah.

1321
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:21,430
And what's your opinion,
Mickey?

1322
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:23,366
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

1323
01:26:23,368 --> 01:26:26,436
I don't think
it's anybody's fault.

1324
01:26:26,438 --> 01:26:29,473
I think maybe I could've asked
more questions upfront.

1325
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:30,543
Oh, my God.

1326
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:32,944
Maybe you could have laid off
the stuff a little bit.

1327
01:26:33,412 --> 01:26:35,081
Oh, so you do think
it's my fault?

1328
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:37,813
- I didn't say that.
- You do.

1329
01:26:37,815 --> 01:26:39,918
- You think it's my fault.
- Of course it's your fault!

1330
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:51,730
So, uh...

1331
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:54,733
what is it...

1332
01:26:55,466 --> 01:26:58,937
What is that you do,
anyway, Mickey?

1333
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:01,708
What does that mean?

1334
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:06,446
You're just like
all the other ones.

1335
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:10,580
You sit on the sidelines

1336
01:27:10,582 --> 01:27:12,648
and you watch the show,

1337
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,818
and you think that's making
things happen.

1338
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,658
You think that's working.

1339
01:27:19,591 --> 01:27:21,728
What have you ever done

1340
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:25,562
that would make anybody
wanna listen to you?

1341
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,137
I shouldn't have come back here.

1342
01:27:32,604 --> 01:27:34,673
You shouldn't have come
in the first place.

1343
01:27:35,106 --> 01:27:35,938
I'm not gonna be here

1344
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,809
- when you get back.
- I don't care!

1345
01:27:38,743 --> 01:27:39,746
Judy!

1346
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,508

to the stage, please.</i>

1350
01:28:28,126 --> 01:28:29,829
<i>You're late, Miss Garland.</i>

1351
01:28:30,796 --> 01:28:34,129
<i>Miss Garland,
you should be on stage, please.</i>

1352
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:54,586
I'm here.

1353
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,222
I'm here.

1354
01:28:58,923 --> 01:29:00,091
I'm here.

1355
01:29:13,305 --> 01:29:15,975
Hey, there's a lady up here.

1356
01:29:18,109 --> 01:29:19,811
London, I love you.

1357
01:29:21,212 --> 01:29:23,248
It's true, it's true.

1358
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:25,848
- Of all the towns I've loved...
- Get off the...

1359
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:27,519
...I love London best.

I have a beautiful show

I have a beautiful show

I always have a beautiful show

Hey!

It's Mama. Hang... Hang on.

1374
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:42,688
<i>Mama?</i>

1375
01:31:45,457 --> 01:31:46,926
<i>Mama, are you there?</i>

1376
01:31:51,328 --> 01:31:52,331
<i>Mama?</i>

1377
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,237
Hello, sweetheart.

1378
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:00,639
How are you?

1379
01:32:01,405 --> 01:32:03,341
- <i>I'm okay.</i>
- Yeah?

1380
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,911
And... And... And how's school?

1381
01:32:06,444 --> 01:32:09,414
<i>I drew a really amazing
picture today, actually.</i>

1382
01:32:11,015 --> 01:32:12,150
You did?

1383
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:14,219
Oh, it's just...

1384
01:32:14,985 --> 01:32:18,189
There's a tree, and me and you
are at the bottom.

1385
01:32:18,457 --> 01:32:21,193
That's wonderful, darling.
I'm... I'm...

1386
01:32:21,893 --> 01:32:23,460
I'm proud of you.

1387
01:32:23,462 --> 01:32:24,997
<i>Yeah, it was cool.</i>

1388
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:26,399
Um...

1389
01:32:28,432 --> 01:32:29,835
Listen, um...

1390
01:32:32,203 --> 01:32:33,838
I spoke with your papa.

1391
01:32:35,006 --> 01:32:36,008
<i>And...</i>

1392
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:37,842
<i>And he...</i>

1393
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:42,347
He feels that you and Joey

1394
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,750
have a right to know

1395
01:32:45,283 --> 01:32:47,319
where you're going to be living

1396
01:32:48,086 --> 01:32:49,989
for the next few years.

1397
01:32:50,421 --> 01:32:51,690
And...

1398
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:57,028
I agree. And...

1399
01:33:00,765 --> 01:33:01,900
I think...

1400
01:33:03,368 --> 01:33:06,872
I think that if...

1401
01:33:08,774 --> 01:33:11,777
If you're happy where you are,

1402
01:33:12,778 --> 01:33:16,248
if that's working out,

1403
01:33:17,849 --> 01:33:22,421
that maybe you'd like to know
that it's okay to say that.

1404
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:26,391
How does that sound?

1405
01:33:31,563 --> 01:33:33,833
<i>That sounds good, Mama.</i>

1406
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:41,407
Is that what you and Joe want?

1407
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:43,074
Yeah.

1408
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:47,880
I guess it's nice
not to move so much.

1409
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:55,386
<i>Would you be okay?</i>

1410
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:00,291
Oh, sure.

1411
01:34:01,827 --> 01:34:03,162
I'll be great.

1412
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:07,466
I love you, okay?

1413
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:10,502
I hope you know that.

1414
01:34:13,438 --> 01:34:14,440
Yeah.

1415
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:20,145
Okay, okay.

1416
01:34:22,581 --> 01:34:24,048
Bye, darling.

1417
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:26,886
<i>Bye, Mama.</i>

1418
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:12,094
Well, that's all I could find
in your dressing room.

1419
01:35:12,096 --> 01:35:13,097
Thank you.

1420
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,135
Well, if Delfont's going to
sue me for everything I own,

1421
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:22,207
you might wanna
hold onto those...

1422
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,109
'cause that's it.

1423
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:29,114
Are you angry with me?

1424
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:33,018
Not really. Just...

1425
01:35:34,185 --> 01:35:36,188
- You are.
- No, I just...

1426
01:35:37,421 --> 01:35:40,259
I wish... I wish things
had been different.

1427
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:44,162
You did a very good job
trying to...

1428
01:35:44,695 --> 01:35:46,231
Nobody's blaming you?

1429
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:48,932
No.

1430
01:35:48,934 --> 01:35:50,603
Everyone knows you're
impossible.

1431
01:35:51,168 --> 01:35:52,570
Oh, good.

1432
01:35:55,573 --> 01:35:57,343
So I've a little surprise
for you,

1433
01:35:58,109 --> 01:35:59,378
if you can bear it.

1434
01:35:59,677 --> 01:36:01,913
Oh, no kidding.

1435
01:36:02,546 --> 01:36:04,280
- It's the least we could do.
- Aw!

1436
01:36:04,282 --> 01:36:06,049
We can't send you off
without a cake.

1437
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,387
Oh, it's so pretty.

1438
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,687
No, no.
Maybe one of you should do it.

1439
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:15,360
Every time I cut a cake,
I find I've married some jerk.

1440
01:36:17,162 --> 01:36:19,097
I'll do it.
Thank you.

1441
01:36:25,337 --> 01:36:26,338
Thank you.

1442
01:36:31,242 --> 01:36:32,511
It looks delicious.

1443
01:36:44,088 --> 01:36:45,256
- Mm.
- Mm.

1444
01:37:02,707 --> 01:37:04,443
That's good.

1445
01:37:11,082 --> 01:37:12,451
That's really good.

1446
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:18,456
I think maybe I was just hungry.

1447
01:37:22,359 --> 01:37:23,328
Here's to you.

1448
01:37:30,034 --> 01:37:31,569
So, what's next?

1449
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:35,407
Well, there'll be something.

1450
01:37:37,207 --> 01:37:39,208
Or maybe I'll just wait tables.

1451
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:41,076
I might come with you.

1452
01:37:41,078 --> 01:37:44,483
Maybe we'd meet some nice
fellows who tip heavily.

1453
01:37:44,681 --> 01:37:46,549
Half the world
wanna take you out.

1454
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:48,554
Oh, no.

1455
01:37:50,688 --> 01:37:53,692
The first man I ever asked out

1456
01:37:54,391 --> 01:37:56,259
was Mickey Rooney.

1457
01:37:56,261 --> 01:37:57,463
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1458
01:37:58,529 --> 01:38:00,095
I mean, you look at him now

1459
01:38:00,097 --> 01:38:03,132
and he's this little
bowling ball

1460
01:38:03,134 --> 01:38:04,536
kind of guy.

1461
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:06,568
But, uh...

1462
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:09,173
Oh, I was mad about him.

1463
01:38:10,774 --> 01:38:12,610
And he turned me down flat.

1464
01:38:13,177 --> 01:38:13,945
Hmm.

1465
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:17,315
At least, that's how
I remember it.

1466
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,686
Are you going to be all right?

1467
01:38:24,456 --> 01:38:25,556
Sure.

1468
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:35,033
It's snowing outside,
which I like.

1469
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,101
I have three beautiful children.

1470
01:38:38,103 --> 01:38:41,140
I have a lot to be grateful for.

1471
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:49,681
Could I come back with you?

1472
01:38:51,815 --> 01:38:53,519
You want to see the show?

1473
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:57,088
I still believe in it, you know?

1474
01:38:58,122 --> 01:39:00,291
The love you find
with an audience.

1475
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:03,594
On a good night.

1476
01:39:06,597 --> 01:39:09,501
And I hear Lonnie's one hell
of a performer.

1477
01:39:13,404 --> 01:39:14,506
Are you sure?

1478
01:39:16,507 --> 01:39:18,540
Sorry, what do you mean,
Lonnie Donegan?

1479
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:20,809
We bought tickets
to see Judy Garland.

1480
01:39:20,811 --> 01:39:22,445
- Yes.
- There's nothing I can do.

1481
01:39:22,447 --> 01:39:24,513
These cost an arm and a leg.
You call the manager now!

1482
01:39:24,515 --> 01:39:27,219
- A refund. Just get us a refund.
- Call him now!

1483
01:39:28,252 --> 01:39:30,688
Well, I'll be out front
if you need me.

1484
01:39:31,523 --> 01:39:32,690
Enjoy it.

1485
01:39:33,925 --> 01:39:35,327
- Thank you.
- No.

1486
01:39:49,173 --> 01:39:50,641
Come on, come on.

1487
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:54,146
Let's get out of here.

1488
01:39:56,413 --> 01:39:57,782
We're done.
You wanna get some dinner?

1489
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:00,652
You know, uh...

1490
01:40:01,685 --> 01:40:02,887
maybe we could...

1491
01:40:05,256 --> 01:40:07,223
I mean, listen to that.

1492
01:40:07,225 --> 01:40:08,627
Come on, Judes.

1493
01:40:09,394 --> 01:40:10,596
Really, we're done.

1494
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,643
Maybe some other time.

1495
01:40:34,252 --> 01:40:36,588
- Hello.
- Hi, Lonnie.

1496
01:40:37,689 --> 01:40:39,591
I didn't think I'd see you here.

1497
01:40:40,425 --> 01:40:43,695
Oh, well, I'm just here
to watch the show.

1498
01:40:43,994 --> 01:40:45,796
Go, go and be wonderful.

1499
01:40:46,296 --> 01:40:48,799
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

1500
01:41:11,322 --> 01:41:12,324
Lonnie.

1501
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:13,892
Yeah?

1502
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:16,228
Do you think...

1503
01:41:17,628 --> 01:41:20,731
Could I give them just one song?

1504
01:41:25,936 --> 01:41:29,571
I... I don't think
that I'll be here again,

1505
01:41:29,573 --> 01:41:32,911
and I didn't do so well
at my last show.

1506
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:35,713
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1507

Oh, boy!

1557
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:43,061
Oh! I don't know...

1558
01:45:43,728 --> 01:45:46,163
I don't know
what's left in there...

1559
01:45:46,898 --> 01:45:48,531
after that one.

1560
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:50,802

Let's find out, shall we?

1562
01:45:56,774 --> 01:45:58,043
Yes!

1563
01:46:07,652 --> 01:46:08,953
This next one,

1564
01:46:09,819 --> 01:46:13,692
it isn't a song about getting
anywhere.

1565
01:46:15,225 --> 01:46:16,594
It's about...

1566
01:46:18,762 --> 01:46:22,132
walking toward somewhere

1567
01:46:23,234 --> 01:46:24,936
that you've dreamed of.

1568
01:46:28,072 --> 01:46:29,140
And maybe,

1569
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,010
maybe the walk...

1570
01:46:34,345 --> 01:46:38,115
is every day of your life.

1571
01:46:42,086 --> 01:46:44,556
And the walking has to be
enough.

1572
01:46:49,025 --> 01:46:50,362
It's about hope.

1573
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:56,001
And we all need that.
