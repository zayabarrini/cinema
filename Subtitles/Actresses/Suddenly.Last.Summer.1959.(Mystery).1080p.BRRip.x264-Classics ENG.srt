1
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,863
Gentlemen, I wanna welcome
you medical schoolmen...

2
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,029
...to our new operating theatre.

3
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,153
As you can see,
it isn't exactly what you'd call new.

4
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,818
Used to be a library
when this was a school...

5
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,200
...and maybe before that
some kind of a sugar warehouse.

6
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,459
Makeshift or not, the important
thing is that we got it.

7
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,671
The first to be devoted
to psychosurgery in this state.

8
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,998
And that is a great step forward.

9
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,542
Now you're going
to witness an operation...

10
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:59,762
...never performed before
in this state.

11
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,722
A lobotomy on a woman's brain...

12
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,892
...suffering from acute
schizophrenic withdrawal.

13
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:08,223
Our new staff member,
Dr. John Cukrowicz from Chicago...

14
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,640
...will perform this operation.

15
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:52,513
Swab.

16
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:57,922
Sew up, will you?

17
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:05,502
You have just witnessed a delicate
operation on the human brain...

18
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,215
...performed under the most
primitive surgical conditions...

19
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,637
...that I hope any of you
will ever encounter.

20
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:23,022
Excuse us, please.

21
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,362
- Son, I know how you feel.
- For six months...

22
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,327
...I have listened to you
promise me this and that.

23
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,826
- But I am not...
- I know, I know, I know.

24
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:41,419
You are not the state board of health.
I am not a witch doctor.

25
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,046
I need properly trained assistants.

26
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:47,219
I need an operating room
that doesn't fall apart.

27
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,173
At least lights that stay lit.

28
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,928
I know, but this is a state hospital.

29
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,093
There just isn't
enough money for us.

30
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,808
I can't promise
that there ever will be enough.

31
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:01,401
I'll go back to Chicago
or someplace where there is.

32
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,600
John.

33
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,822
Before you do that,
read this.

34
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,909
Who is Violet Venable?

35
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,491
You reveal your ignorance
of our fair city...

36
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,208
...of which Mrs. Venable
is the richest lady.

37
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,758
At one time, her husband owned most of
it. Now she's a widow and she owns it.

38
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,634
"...and was very interested
in the work of your Dr. Cukrowicz."

39
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:33,723
<i>She must have read your
write-up in the Herald.</i>

40
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:37,718
"And I wonder if the foundation
I am establishing...

41
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:40,263
...might be of some assistance."

42
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,439
Son, with one signature
on one check...

43
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,279
...she can solve
all the problems we got.

44
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,531
"Also there is a matter
of some urgency...

45
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:52,149
...I should like to discuss with him.

46
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:55,661
Would 4:30 on Tuesday be convenient?"

47
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,373
That's today.

48
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,784
What is her urgency, do you know?

49
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,293
No, but I know what ours is.
Lack of money. Her money.

50
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:04,963
She is serious?

51
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:07,130
4:30 this afternoon, you'll know.

52
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:08,836
I can tell you this much.

53
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,468
I've been trying for years
just to see the Venable lawyers.

54
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,014
You've been invited by her.
That's a command performance.

55
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,467
That's how serious I think it is.

56
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,727
And this is serious too.

57
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:25,647
More than 1200 mental cases
Lions View can't afford to handle.

58
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,821
Good afternoon.

59
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,371
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:48,166
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

61
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:03,969
Mrs. Venable?

62
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,190
I am Miss Foxhill,
Mrs. Venable's secretary.

63
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,435
And you are Dr. Cukrowicz?

64
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:12,571
- Your appointment was for...?
- 4:30.

65
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:16,446
You are 23 seconds early.
Sit down, please.

66
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,280
Thank you.

67
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,625
Sebastian always said,
"Mother, when you descend...

68
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:27,077
...it's like the goddess
from the machine."

69
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,917
- Mrs. Venable's on her way down.
- I feel just like an angel...

70
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:35,004
...coming to earth
as I float, float into view.

71
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:36,668
Sebastian...

72
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:40,633
...my son, Sebastian, was
very interested in the Byzantine.

73
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,181
Are you interested
in the Byzantine, Dr...?

74
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,641
Cukrowicz.

75
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,138
I don't know very much
about the Byzantine.

76
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,266
The emperor of Byzantium,
when he received people in audience...

77
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,114
...had a throne which,
during the conversation...

78
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:58,777
...would rise mysteriously in the air
to the consternation of the visitors.

79
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:02,072
As we are living in a democracy,
I reverse the procedure.

80
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,955
I don't rise. I come down.

81
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,917
How do you do, Dr...?
Oh, I'm sorry, your name?

82
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,199
Cukrowicz.

83
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:11,248
It's a Polish word meaning "sugar."

84
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,172
Am I only wearing one earring?
Have I forgotten my lip rouge?

85
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,212
Excuse me, I...

86
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:21,549
I guess I had been told
you were a widow.

87
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,008
I am. I'm in mourning.

88
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,682
White was my son's favorite color.

89
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,352
Perhaps, Dr. Sugar...

90
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,807
...you expected an old widow.

91
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:34,606
With a garnet brooch, a cane
and an ear trumpet.

92
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,771
I have all that
to look forward to.

93
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:41,485
Life is a thief. Sebastian always
said, "Life steals everything."

94
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,695
I want to show you his garden.

95
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:46,279
Are you sure you should go out,
Mrs. Venable?

96
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,699
Quite sure.
They treat me like an invalid.

97
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:54,215
You see, last spring I had a tiny
convulsion of a tiny blood vessel.

98
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:55,959
What did your doctor call it?

99
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,462
A malady of living.

100
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:02,047
After all, I've buried a husband
and a son. I'm a widow and a...

101
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,430
Funny, there's no word.

102
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,848
Lose your parents, you're an orphan.

103
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:10,311
Lose your only son and you are...

104
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:12,972
...nothing.

105
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:15,731
Foxhill.

106
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,778
Where are they?

107
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,281
I put them in the patio.

108
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:25,489
They sent them parcel post from
Pensacola. That's why they were late.

109
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:29,327
Another day and we'd have starved
to death. Come on, doctor.

110
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:33,418
In your letter,
you said an urgent matter.

111
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:37,122
I must say, you're handsomer
than your photograph in the paper...

112
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,335
...without that awful paraphernalia
you doctors wear.

113
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:43,257
Your son's favorite color, white.

114
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,844
Such extraordinary eyes.

115
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:48,892
So like his. You must...

116
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:53,764
I almost said, "You must meet
my son Sebastian." Force of habit.

117
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,393
Is he the son who died?

118
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,186
Yes, last July, in Europe.

119
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:59,062
He must have been young to die.

120
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:00,400
All poets...

121
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:04,232
...whatever age they may seem
to others, die young.

122
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,232
- It's unexpected.
- Like the dawn of creation.

123
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,318
It was Sebastian's idea.

124
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,148
Part of his lifelong war
against the herbaceous border.

125
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:50,234
Not unlike a well-groomed jungle
and, frankly, a little terrifying.

126
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,246
So was creation.

127
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,748
So is creation.
Listen to them buzz, buzz.

128
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,412
What's in there?

129
00:12:57,586 --> 00:13:00,291
This way, before our poor lady
dies of hunger.

130
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,423
The Latin names to the plants
are printed on tags...

131
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,751
...attached to them,
but the print's fading.

132
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:08,845
Those ones there
are the oldest plants on earth.

133
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,591
Survivors from the age
of the giant fern forest.

134
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,553
And here's my poor lady.

135
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,063
They never get away.

136
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:22,267
The lady exudes this marvelous
perfume which attracts them.

137
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:26,270
They plunge into her chalice.
And they never come out.

138
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,237
This operation
you perform is called...?

139
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,573
Lobotomy.

140
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,868
- That's an unusual...
- I hate these flies.

141
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,284
Foxhill!

142
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,661
Foxhill!

143
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,743
She loves feeding our wicked lady.
Foxhill's rather a brute.

144
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,171
Such an extravagance, really,
from early fall to late spring...

145
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,214
...lady must be kept under glass...

146
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,961
...and we have to provide her
with flies flown in at great expense.

147
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:52,296
Foxhill, you do the honors.

148
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:56,134
- Lady's very hungry today.
- Of course, Mrs. Venable.

149
00:13:56,311 --> 00:14:00,225
I've never seen an insectivorous
plant before. What is it called?

150
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,563
The Venus flytrap.

151
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,852
A devouring organism...

152
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:08,320
...aptly named
for the goddess of love.

153
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,817
What was your son's work?
I mean, aside from this garden.

154
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,161
As many times as I've had
to answer that question...

155
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:18,407
...it still shocks me
a little to realize...

156
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,584
...that Sebastian Venable the poet
was quite unknown...

157
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:25,003
...outside of a small coterie
of friends, including his mother.

158
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:28,506
- Your son was a poet?
- His life was his occupation.

159
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:31,339
Yes. Yes, Sebastian was a poet.

160
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:34,549
That's what I meant
when I said his life was his work.

161
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:39,470
Because the work of a poet
is the life of a poet. And vice versa.

162
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,976
I mean, you can't separate them.
I mean...

163
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:45,226
...a poet's life is his work.

164
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:49,772
And his work is his life,
in a special sense.

165
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,446
- Are you all right?
- Right as rain, however right that is.

166
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,832
This operation of yours,
does it really work?

167
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,083
Yes, yes, it does.

168
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,333
However, it is very experimental.

169
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,626
I was struck by something
you said in the paper.

170
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,629
About the sharp knife in the mind.

171
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:14,630
That kills the devil in the soul?

172
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,804
I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.

173
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:23,055
No, what you said
was almost poetic itself.

174
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:28,609
Mrs. Venable, the work
of a doctor is his life too.

175
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,445
But we need help, particularly
in a field as experimental as mine.

176
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:37,322
Particularly at a state hospital
like Lions View.

177
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,485
We have very little money,
practically none.

178
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:42,241
Yes, I know.

179
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:43,738
Doctor...

180
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,036
...I have a niece by marriage...

181
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:48,210
...at a place called St. Mary's.

182
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:49,750
I've heard of it.

183
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,213
It's a custodial home for the insane.

184
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:56,008
She suffers from something
called dementia praecox.

185
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,383
From dementia praecox?

186
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:00,515
Which is to say, she's mad
as a hatter, poor child.

187
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:02,842
Would you like to
see Sebastian's studio?

188
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,602
<i>It's at the end of the jungle
in what used to be the garçonnière.</i>

189
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,433
An old New Orleans convenience.

190
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,734
A place where the young men
could go to be private.

191
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,688
You're not from New Orleans?

192
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:18,318
No, Chicago. Actually, dementia
praecox is a meaningless phrase...

193
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:22,449
Chicago. I've always wanted
to see two places before I die.

194
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:23,867
Hong Kong...

195
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,789
...and Chicago.

196
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,368
Now I shall never see either.

197
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:32,625
Because I must use every inch and
ounce of what little strength I have...

198
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,289
...in doing just what I'm doing.

199
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,169
The foundation you referred to?

200
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:40,091
Building a memorial to my son.

201
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:44,719
You see, Sebastian had
no public name as a poet.

202
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,928
He didn't want one.

203
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:49,269
He refused to have one.

204
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:53,527
He abhorred the false values
that come from being publicly known...

205
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:57,484
...from fame,
from personal exploitation.

206
00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:01,440
He'd say to me, "Violet, Mother,
you're going to live longer than me.

207
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,160
When I'm gone, it will be yours
to do whatever you please with."

208
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,451
Meaning, of course,
his future recognition.

209
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,829
- You're very like him, doctor.
- In what way?

210
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,917
Because you, a doctor, a surgeon...

211
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,003
...are dedicated to your art.

212
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:22,511
Yes, to your art.
It is an art, what you do.

213
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,846
Using people the way he did.

214
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,265
Grandly, creatively.

215
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,135
Almost like God.

216
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,846
I'm afraid my art is to help.

217
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,557
Not to use, but to be used.

218
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:40,441
Well, it comes to the same,
doesn't it?

219
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,899
I mean, in the end.

220
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,861
Oh, I don't know what I mean.

221
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:50,287
There is the atelier,
Sebastian's studio.

222
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,833
Most people's lives...

223
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,921
...what are they
but trails of debris?

224
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:58,419
Each day more debris, more debris.

225
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:02,084
Long, long trails of debris...

226
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,970
...with nothing to clean it all up
but, finally, death.

227
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
I guess...

228
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:12,682
...quiet desperation
is the word for most lives.

229
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,974
But ours were different.

230
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,398
Sebastian's and mine.

231
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:22,480
I know it sounds
hopelessly vain to say...

232
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,940
...but we were a famous couple.

233
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,113
People didn't speak of Sebastian
and his mother...

234
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,902
...or Mrs. Venable and her son.

235
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,039
They said, "Sebastian and Violet.

236
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:36,750
Violet and Sebastian are at the Lido.
They're at the Ritz."

237
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,754
And every appearance,
every time we appeared...

238
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,422
...attention was centered on us.

239
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,718
Everyone else eclipsed.

240
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,181
My son, Sebastian...

241
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,260
...and I...

242
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,470
...constructed our days.

243
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,934
Each day, we would carve each day
like a piece of sculpture.

244
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,857
We left behind us a trail of days...

245
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,396
...like a gallery of sculpture...

246
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:09,275
...until suddenly, last summer...

247
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,537
Your son died?

248
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:23,419
You say that your niece suffers
from dementia praecox.

249
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,006
There must have been
a more exact diagnosis.

250
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:29,425
Such a pretty name for a disease.

251
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,095
Sounds like a rare flower,
doesn't it?

252
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,882
Night-blooming dementia praecox.

253
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:39,388
What form does her disturbance take?

254
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:40,770
Madness.

255
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:43,150
Obsession, memory.

256
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,989
She lacerates herself with memory.

257
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:47,650
Memory of what?

258
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:50,238
Visions, hallucinations.

259
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,868
It all started last summer.

260
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,955
The first I knew, there was a cable
from this clinic in Paris...

261
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:01,287
...saying, "Your niece is out
of her mind. What shall we do?"

262
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:03,621
I was almost out of my mind
last summer.

263
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,416
Sebastian had just died, I was ill,
but I did everything I could.

264
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:10,470
I said, "Send her straight home
with a nurse."

265
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,349
<i>So they put her on the Berengaria...</i>

266
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,513
...locked in her stateroom
like a wild animal.

267
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:18,975
She was taken straight to St. Mary's.

268
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:23,186
And now they can't keep her there,
they can't help her...

269
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,435
...or cope with her fits of violence.

270
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:29,236
Her babbling.
Her dreadful, obscene babbling.

271
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:33,446
- What kind of babbling?
- Fantastic delusions and babblings...

272
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,155
...of an unspeakable nature.

273
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,696
Mostly taking the form
of hideous attacks...

274
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:41,201
...on the moral character
of my son, Sebastian.

275
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,829
And now they tell me at St. Mary's...

276
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:46,956
...the Mother Superior tells me...

277
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,879
...that we must find
another place for her.

278
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,046
And then I read about you...

279
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,676
...about your operation,
and I thought:

280
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:01,266
"This may be the answer
to all our prayers."

281
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,895
You must realize
the operation I do...

282
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,853
...is only for the unapproachable,
for the hopeless.

283
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:10,361
If she isn't unapproachable
and hopeless, I don't know who is.

284
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:12,073
- The things she says.
- What?

285
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,399
- Terrible, obscene things.
- Such as?

286
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,403
Oh, anything.

287
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,859
Such as?

288
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,330
All right, you asked.

289
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,032
This happened recently at St. Mary's.

290
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:26,703
Catherine accused an elderly gardener
of making love to her.

291
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,247
They questioned the gardener,
an old man.

292
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:30,919
It was the other way around.

293
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:34,758
Catherine had made advances to him,
spoken obscenely to him.

294
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,931
When confronted with her lies,
she fought and screamed.

295
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,009
It took four nuns to control her.

296
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:44,052
Now I'm put on notice that they
won't keep her there after this week.

297
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:45,855
You see why I said urgent.

298
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,726
Yes, I do. I certainly do.

299
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:50,392
It's important I see her
as soon as possible.

300
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,322
And help her. If you can't,
I'm at my wits' end.

301
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,906
I can transfer her to Lions View.
She won't be as comfortable...

302
00:21:57,077 --> 00:21:58,275
I understand.

303
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,653
But the important thing
is you, doctor.

304
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,452
You'll be happy to know
that at this very minute...

305
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,539
...my lawyers are working on the
Sebastian Venable Memorial Foundation...

306
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:11,372
...to subsidize the work
of young people like yourself...

307
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,627
...who are pushing out
the frontiers of art and science...

308
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,546
...but have a financial problem.

309
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:21,052
Mrs. Venable, loving your niece
as you do, you must know...

310
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,138
...there's great risk
in this operation.

311
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:28,808
When you enter the brain with a foreign
object, even a needle-thin knife...

312
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:31,350
...in the hands
of the most skilled surgeon...

313
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,149
...there still is
a great deal of risk.

314
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,939
But it does pacify them,
I've read that.

315
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,444
It quiets them down.
It makes them peaceful.

316
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:45,494
- Yes, that it does do, but...
- But what?

317
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,326
Well, it will be years before we know
if the benefits...

318
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:52,118
...of the operation are lasting...

319
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,878
...or maybe just passing
or perhaps...

320
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:59,382
There's a strong possibility that
the patient will always be limited.

321
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,012
Relieved of acute anxiety,
yes, but limited.

322
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:07,437
But what a blessing to them, doctor,
to be just peaceful.

323
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:12,022
To be just suddenly peaceful.

324
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:14,811
After all that horror...

325
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:17,277
...after those nightmares...

326
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:21,316
...just to be able to lift up
their eyes to a sky...

327
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,860
...not black with savage,
devouring birds.

328
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,329
You said a sky filled
with savage, devouring birds?

329
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,572
Did I?

330
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:32,457
How odd. I hadn't thought
about all that in years.

331
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,580
Now, why should I suddenly...?

332
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,045
Yes, we saw those birds
one summer in the Pacific.

333
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:43,210
You see, my son
Sebastian was looking for...

334
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:47,346
- Looking for what?
- Rare, hungry birds.

335
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:51,511
- That's not what you started to say.
- You're too quick for me.

336
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:56,061
I was going to say my son
Sebastian was looking for God.

337
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:59,278
I stopped myself.
I thought you'd think:

338
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:03,902
"What a pretentious young crackpot."
Which Sebastian was not.

339
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:07,619
This is something
I've never told anyone before.

340
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,538
Something so terrible.

341
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:14,078
Forgive me if I sound quite mad,
but it's true all the same.

342
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:17,380
Sebastian saw the face of God.

343
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:19,755
I'd like to hear about that.

344
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,708
Yes, yes.

345
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:28,259
One long ago summer,
sitting right here in this garden...

346
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:31,263
...Sebastian said,
"Mother, listen to this."

347
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:34,854
And he read me
Herman Melville's description...

348
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:38,808
...of the Encantadas,
the Galapagos Islands.

349
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:42,978
He read me that description
and said we had to go there.

350
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,357
So we did go there that summer...

351
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,032
...on a boat,
a four-masted schooner...

352
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:51,946
...the sort of boat that Melville
would have sailed on.

353
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,372
We saw the Encantadas.

354
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:57,206
But on the Encantadas
we saw something...

355
00:24:57,421 --> 00:24:59,579
...that he hadn't written about.

356
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,966
We saw the sea turtles
crawl out of the sea...

357
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:05,216
...for their annual egg-laying.

358
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,549
Once a year, the female
of the sea turtles...

359
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:12,348
...crawls out of the sea
onto the blazing sand beach...

360
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:16,606
...of a volcanic island
to dig a pit in the sand...

361
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,353
...and deposit her eggs there.

362
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:23,731
It's a long and dreadful thing,
the depositing of the eggs in the sand.

363
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,613
And when it's finished...

364
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:31,578
...the exhausted female turtle
crawls back to the sea half-dead.

365
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:33,947
She never sees her offspring.

366
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,989
But we did.

367
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:40,871
Sebastian knew exactly when
the sea turtle eggs would be hatched.

368
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:44,209
- We returned in time for it.
- You went back?

369
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:49,586
In time to witness the hatching
and their desperate flight to the sea.

370
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:54,468
The narrow beach, the color
of caviar, was all in motion.

371
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,221
The sky was in motion,
full of flesh-eating birds.

372
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,313
And the noise of the birds...

373
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,933
...their savage cries
as they circled...

374
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:05,276
...over the beach
of the Encantadas...

375
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:08,608
...while the new sea turtles
scrambled out...

376
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:11,316
...and started their race to the sea.

377
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,987
- Race to the sea?
- To escape the flesh-eating birds...

378
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,958
...that made the sky almost black.

379
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:23,328
And I said, "Sebastian, no.
No, it's not like that."

380
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:27,717
But he made me look.
He made me see that terrible sight.

381
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,383
- What was not like that?
- Life.

382
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,299
I said, "No.

383
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:36,014
No! That's not true!"

384
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,805
But he said it is.

385
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,887
He said, "Look, Violet.
Look, there on the shore."

386
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:46,604
And I looked and saw the sand
all alive, all alive...

387
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:50,071
...as the new-hatched sea turtles
dashed to the sea...

388
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:53,698
...while the birds hovered
and swooped to attack...

389
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:56,995
...and hovered and swooped to attack.

390
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:00,993
They were diving down
on the sea turtles...

391
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,500
...turning them over
to expose their soft undersides...

392
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:09,752
...tearing their undersides open...

393
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:14,086
...and rending and eating their flesh.

394
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,767
Sebastian guessed that possibly...

395
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:23,182
...only a hundredth
of one percent of their number...

396
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,225
...would escape to the sea.

397
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:31,110
Nature isn't created
in the image of man's compassion.

398
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:32,983
Nature is cruel!

399
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:37,068
Sebastian knew it all along,
was born knowing it, but not I.

400
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:41,949
I said, "No, no, those are
only birds, turtles, not us."

401
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,325
I didn't know then it was us.

402
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:49,420
That we are all of us trapped
by this devouring creation.

403
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:53,417
I couldn't, wouldn't face
the horror of the truth...

404
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:56,210
...even that last day
in the Encantadas...

405
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,305
...when Sebastian left me...

406
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:01,601
...and spent the whole
blazing, equatorial day...

407
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:05,476
...in the crow's-nest,
watching that thing on the beach...

408
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:07,890
...until it was too dark to see.

409
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:12,438
When he came down the rigging,
he said, "Now I've seen him."

410
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:16,190
- And he meant God.
- Do you believe he saw God?

411
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:20,027
He saw the whole thing there
that day on the beach.

412
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:23,033
But I was like you. I said no.

413
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,325
I refused to believe...

414
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:30,004
...until suddenly, last summer,
I learned my son was right.

415
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,539
What he had shown me
in the Encantadas was the horrible...

416
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,251
...the inescapable truth.

417
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:53,017
Violet, honey.

418
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:56,365
- You gave me a turn.
- Hi, Aunt Vi.

419
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:58,277
Why are you two here?

420
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:01,943
We came for Sebastian's
clothes, like you said.

421
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:06,030
- Remember? Like you said.
- So we just kind of let ourselves in.

422
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,790
- I must have got hold of this letter.
- Caught on your sleeve probably.

423
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:17,130
That's Mrs. Holly, mother of the
St. Mary's girl, and that's her son.

424
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:21,128
Apparently, I said
he could have Sebastian's clothes.

425
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:25,809
You haven't forgotten what you said
at Elaine Tutweiler's?

426
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,763
Since I was going to college...

427
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,105
...I could have Cousin
Sebastian's clothes.

428
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:32,645
You did say that.

429
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:35,185
You said
that Son here could have...

430
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:39,147
I'm accused of generosity.
Now will you please...?

431
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:43,275
Aunt Violet is generous,
so generous to her family, Mr...

432
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,775
What's your name?

433
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,914
- Dr. Cukrowicz.
- Are you a doctor?

434
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:50,497
- Violet, you're not ill again?
- No, Grace!

435
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,169
I'm so relieved.

436
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:57,005
I was afraid you had another of those
strokes of yours. Those seizures.

437
00:29:57,217 --> 00:30:02,673
I've never had a seizure nor a stroke.
We were discussing your daughter.

438
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,724
My poor lamb, my poor little girl.

439
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:09,053
- Can you help her?
- I'm gonna try to, if I can.

440
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,390
Mama, look here! White silk.

441
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:14,768
"Made in Rome."

442
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:18,069
Oh, boy, is this one gonna
pick up lipstick!

443
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,648
Take the clothes.
Don't flaunt them in my face.

444
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:24,867
Why don't you both let yourselves out?

445
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:29,823
- Get the rest another time.
- It won't take two seconds to finish.

446
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:34,703
It's impossible that Sebastian
won't walk through that door again...

447
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:38,124
...with all those bright people
he used to know.

448
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,167
All laughing, carrying on...

449
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,548
...saying those witty things
that were way over my poor head.

450
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:47,219
He was such a tease too.
You know...

451
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,968
...he told me that the piece of lace
on this table...

452
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:55,932
...was made by these blind nuns
in Belgium. Imagine!

453
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,601
- I thought I'd gone through everything.
- Who is that?

454
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,900
- It's the girl.
- Why, that's my poor angel, Catherine.

455
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:07,776
- I wonder why he put it there.
- Maybe he liked her.

456
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:12,244
George, take your plunder
and get out of here.

457
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:15,702
- Okay.
- This must've been taken last spring.

458
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,493
She's wearing her Mardi Gras gown.

459
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:22,794
Remember how lovely she was?
You loaned her your fur coat.

460
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,216
I remember everything.

461
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,216
I guess it was not exactly
a happy evening.

462
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,143
- What did happen?
- She was, she is a lovely girl.

463
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:37,141
And I must say, of all my relations...

464
00:31:37,357 --> 00:31:42,019
...my delightful relations,
she was the one most like me.

465
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,438
That's why you've got to save her.

466
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:47,948
Because madness is the most horrible
doom on this earth.

467
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,109
Every item here has been inventoried
by the insurance people.

468
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,497
They'd be upset
if anything were missing.

469
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,459
- What do you think I am?
- On that subject, my lips are sealed.

470
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,997
Now, both of you, please go.

471
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:05,588
- It's almost 5:00.
- That's right.

472
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:08,554
Violet always has,
I mean, used to have...

473
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:11,681
...her 5:00 daiquiri
here with Sebastian.

474
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,683
Now I have it here alone.

475
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:16,640
Well, we must fly now.

476
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:20,555
I do pray you can help my poor Cathy.
Goodbye.

477
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:25,271
Violet, bye now.
Say thank you, George.

478
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:28,442
Bye, Aunt Violet.
Thanks for everything.

479
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:33,070
Aren't they awful?
Sebastian and I used to speculate...

480
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,410
...on how those Neanderthals...

481
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:38,908
...could've produced a girl
as rare as Catherine.

482
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:44,211
You would have liked Sebastian
and he would have been charmed by you.

483
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:48,291
He wasn't a family or a money snob,
but he was a snob.

484
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:51,927
He was a snob about loveliness
in things...

485
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,386
...about personal charm
and physical grace in people.

486
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,429
We always had a perfect troupe...

487
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:03,354
...of beautiful people around us
always, whenever we traveled.

488
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,277
- May I sit here?
- Sebastian's seat.

489
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,943
- Oh, well...
- No, no, please.

490
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:14,783
It's a court jester's chair.
A rare one, 500 years old.

491
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,487
Please, sit on it.

492
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:21,829
Say something funny.
Make me stop wanting to cry.

493
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,164
I'm afraid I'd make
a miserable jester.

494
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,125
I get concerned when
people stop wanting to cry.

495
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,917
Time for your medicine and daiquiri.

496
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,095
In that order.

497
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:39,267
Isn't it nice of the drugstore
to keep me alive?

498
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,853
- Thank you.
- Foxhill...

499
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:45,771
See the Hollys off the premises.
They're apt to remove the silver.

500
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,484
Yes, Mrs. Venable.

501
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:51,608
He would sit in his chair,
I in mine, at 5:00 every day...

502
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:55,607
...and we'd have daiquiris
with St. Sebastian brooding above us.

503
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,692
But you stayed here last summer.

504
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:02,454
I did. I wasn't well.
He took Catherine with him.

505
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,743
- And he died.
- Of a heart attack.

506
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,336
Was she with him?

507
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:11,291
She was there with him when he died,
and that day she lost her mind.

508
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,965
When will you see her, doctor?

509
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,510
As soon as I can.

510
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:21,802
What can I tell Dr. Hockstader
about your interest in helping us?

511
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,427
Can't that wait until
you've met my niece...

512
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,265
...and decided if you think
your operation could help her?

513
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,524
Yes, of course it can wait.

514
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,310
Surely there's no connection between...

515
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:38,157
Aren't we more interested in something
that concerns us personally?

516
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,410
Aren't we, doctor?

517
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,865
I understand.

518
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,619
I can find my way out.

519
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:52,376
Millions of years ago, dinosaurs fed
on leaves of those trees.

520
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,545
They were vegetarians.
That's why they became extinct.

521
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,210
They were just too gentle
for their size.

522
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,847
Then the carnivores,
the ones that eat flesh...

523
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,680
...the killers inherited the earth.

524
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,311
But then they always do, don't they?

525
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,872
Catherine.

526
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,834
It's Sister Felicity, Catherine.

527
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,166
Please get up. You're to come with me.

528
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,309
Catherine.

529
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,025
I'm not being violent, Sister.

530
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,711
What are you doing, Catherine?

531
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,339
Just smoking a cigarette.

532
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:11,138
Now, you know we're not allowed
to smoke at St. Mary's.

533
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:14,389
- Please let me smoke. Please.
- Give it here.

534
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:18,355
- Don't be such a bully!
- Disobedience has to be paid for.

535
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,902
- I'll pay for it later.
- Now, Catherine.

536
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,652
I'm putting out my hand for it.

537
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,364
- All right, take it!
- You burned me!

538
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,199
- I'm sorry...
- You deliberately burned me.

539
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,996
- You said to...
- You stuck the lit end into my hand.

540
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:37,874
I'm so sick of being
bossed and bullied.

541
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,712
I'm sick of being...

542
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:43,876
You saw that.
Saw her deliberately burn me.

543
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:47,629
- You better put something on that.
- I can't leave.

544
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:51,342
- Patients classified as violent...
- Sister.

545
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,557
Very well, doctor. I'll wait outside.

546
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:00,771
Just outside the door.

547
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:06,278
You're very brave
being in the room alone with me.

548
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:09,527
- Do you plan to burn me too?
- Oh, much worse.

549
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,694
I'm classified as violent.

550
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:16,413
I'm apt to attack you
and then accuse you of rape.

551
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:21,254
- Do you do that sort of thing?
- That's why I'm in isolation.

552
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:25,755
I molested an elderly gardener
of great virtue.

553
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:29,836
When he refused my advances,
I denounced him as a lecher.

554
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,921
After that, I was punished.

555
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:34,595
Was it true?

556
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,142
That I was punished? Yes.

557
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:41,933
- That you accused him unjustly.
- Of course I accused him unjustly.

558
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:43,776
After all, I'm insane.

559
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:47,485
It's the sort of thing
an insane woman would do.

560
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,577
Besides, haven't you noticed
how oddly I've been looking at you?

561
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:54,944
Have you?

562
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:58,372
How I've been staring at your eyes.

563
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:02,541
Your beautiful, blue, frightened eyes.

564
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:05,958
Why are they so frightened?
Do you need help?

565
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:08,299
Do you want help from me?

566
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,259
I'm making you nervous.

567
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:14,679
You have every reason to be.

568
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,054
Because now I'm going
to attack you. Yes, attack.

569
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,311
It won't be for your beauty.

570
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:25,893
No, it's for these cigarettes.
Let me have one.

571
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,567
Of course. Help yourself.

572
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,108
You are good.

573
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:36,909
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

574
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,619
- Sent by my aunt?
- Yes.

575
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:43,451
- As I haven't responded to treatment.
- So they say.

576
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,296
You've been invited to try
your hand at what is a hopeless case.

577
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:52,672
Is it hopeless? What do you think?

578
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:58,094
- Where are you from?
- Lions View.

579
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,313
The state asylum.

580
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:09,311
Where they have the Drum.

581
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:13,112
What you call the Drum
is not a torture chamber.

582
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:16,325
It's really a recreation hall.

583
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,663
They'll keep me there forever.

584
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:22,790
Like an animal in a cage.

585
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:27,043
- She is merciless, isn't she?
- Who?

586
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,167
Aunt Violet. Why else
do you think I'm here?

587
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,713
Where no one can see me, hear me?

588
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:35,762
You sound as if you think
she hates you.

589
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:37,086
Doesn't she?

590
00:40:37,306 --> 00:40:39,465
Do you hate her?

591
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,848
What, hate?

592
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:45,726
No. I don't understand what hate is...

593
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,976
...or how anyone could hate
and still be sane.

594
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:51,814
I really do think I am sane...

595
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:55,363
...despite considerable evidence
to the contrary.

596
00:40:55,574 --> 00:41:01,659
- Your aunt, Mrs. Venable...
- Can no more help herself than I could.

597
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,363
Help herself? How do you mean?

598
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,706
You see, we all loved Sebastian.

599
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,380
Women, men, children, animal,
mineral, vegetable...

600
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:16,174
Sebastian was a vocation, not a man.

601
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:20,472
Poor Aunt Vi was hooked
from the beginning.

602
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:23,802
Loved Sebastian and nobody else.

603
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:27,186
She gave up everything for Sebastian.

604
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,271
Even her husband.

605
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:32,400
What was Mr. Venable like?

606
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:35,102
Mr. Venable was a good man...

607
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:38,691
...but dull to the point of genius.

608
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,199
That was Sebastian talking.

609
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:45,413
From him,
it wouldn't have sounded cruel.

610
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:50,493
When I talk like him or when Aunt Vi
talks like him, we sound heartless.

611
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:54,792
And we're not really.
Though we do terrible things.

612
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:58,092
What do you consider terrible?

613
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:02,219
Aunt Vi let her husband die
because of Sebastian.

614
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:05,386
Killed him, some people thought.

615
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,932
How, killed him?

616
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:12,475
Once, Sebastian decided to give up
the torments of this world...

617
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,019
...and become a Buddhist monk.
That was in Tibet.

618
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:20,531
He shaved his head, was given
a wooden bowl and was happy.

619
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,533
Till Aunt Vi came.

620
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,736
Why? What did she do?

621
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:29,248
Lived in a hut, even took vows,
or whatever women do.

622
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:33,955
Anything to be near him,
to get to him, to make him come home.

623
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:36,372
While there, word came.

624
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,924
Mr. Venable was dying.
He had to see her.

625
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:42,004
And she chose to stay?

626
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:46,886
She chose to let her husband
die alone.

627
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:51,478
If you'd known Sebastian, you'd
understand she had no choice...

628
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:56,979
...how none of us ever had a choice,
once Sebastian had decided we were...

629
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:58,986
...to be used.

630
00:42:59,196 --> 00:43:00,607
Used?

631
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,658
You mean he used people?

632
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:05,445
Yes.

633
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:09,910
Isn't that what love is?
Using people?

634
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:14,999
And maybe that's what hate is.
Not being able to use people.

635
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:17,330
- Go on.
- Go on where?

636
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:19,339
Anywhere.

637
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,594
To the first memory you come to.

638
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,720
My first memory?

639
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:29,220
It was once at a Mardi Gras ball.

640
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:32,093
The Mardi Gras ball? Yes?

641
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:36,310
My very first memory.

642
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,808
It was last spring.

643
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:44,234
Before last spring,
I remember nothing. Nothing at all.

644
00:43:44,574 --> 00:43:49,450
It's as if my life began
and ended that night.

645
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:54,533
Tell me about it.

646
00:43:55,085 --> 00:43:57,576
At the ball...

647
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:03,337
I was taken there by some boy
who got too drunk to stand.

648
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:06,837
I wanted to leave.
My coat was in the cloakroom.

649
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:11,099
They couldn't find the check for it,
so I said, "Let it go"...

650
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:14,096
...and started out for a taxi.

651
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:17,308
Then somebody took my arm and said:

652
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:20,228
"I'll drive you home."

653
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:24,981
As we left, he took off his coat
and put it around my shoulders...

654
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,902
...and then I looked at him.

655
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:31,985
I don't think I've ever seen him
before then, really.

656
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:36,578
He took me home.
But he took me another place first.

657
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,993
Near the Dueling Oaks at the end
of Esplanade Street.

658
00:44:41,213 --> 00:44:46,171
We stopped. I asked what for.

659
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:48,508
He didn't answer.

660
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:51,556
Just struck a match
to light a cigarette...

661
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:56,178
...and I looked at him,
and I knew what for.

662
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:03,770
I think I got out of the car before
he got out of the car, and we...

663
00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:09,277
...walked through the wet grass
toward the great misty oaks as if...

664
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,817
...as if somebody were...

665
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:15,369
...calling for help there.

666
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:21,332
And after that?

667
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:27,834
I lost him.

668
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:32,463
He took me home.

669
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:36,429
Then he said an awful
thing to me. He said:

670
00:45:36,977 --> 00:45:39,183
"We'd better forget it.

671
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:44,141
My wife's expecting a child, and..."

672
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:50,811
I just entered the house
and sat there thinking a while.

673
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:55,910
I called a taxi and rushed
to the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom.

674
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,160
The ball was still going on.

675
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:02,786
I thought I'd gone back
to pick up my coat. But I hadn't.

676
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:08,547
I hadn't gone back for that at all.
I'd gone back to make a scene.

677
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:13,005
I didn't pick up Aunt Violet's
silver fox in the coatroom.

678
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:17,883
I rushed right into the ballroom,
spotted him on the floor...

679
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:20,805
...ran up to him and started...

680
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,848
...to beat him in the face
and the chest with my fists till...

681
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,274
...Cousin Sebastian took me away.

682
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,650
Miss Catherine?

683
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:43,790
Miss Catherine?

684
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:49,208
She's here. Miss Catherine's here.

685
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:52,668
In spirit as well as flesh.

686
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:56,218
And now you want to play a game.
Look at pictures?

687
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,009
Tell you the first thing that comes
into my mind, my poor deranged mind.

688
00:47:01,227 --> 00:47:02,886
All right.

689
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:08,638
That shadow on the wall.
What does it look like to you?

690
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,018
Like a shadow on a wall.

691
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:14,313
I thought we were gonna play a game.

692
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,063
All right.

693
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:19,863
I see forests.

694
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:22,451
Trees, a girl.

695
00:47:22,998 --> 00:47:26,165
And those trees
are the Dueling Oaks...

696
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:31,378
...and that tormented figure
is the girl, Catherine, losing her...

697
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,835
...honor.

698
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,333
I'm trying to make you
feel sorry for her.

699
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:40,131
- I hope I am.
- I am sorry.

700
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:44,350
I believe you really are.

701
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:49,690
Tell me about your cousin, Sebastian.

702
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:54,562
He liked me, so I loved him.

703
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:57,982
How? I mean, in what way
did you love him?

704
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:00,859
The only way he'd accept.

705
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,907
- I tried to save him, doctor.
- Save him from what?

706
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:15,336
Completing a sort of image
he had of himself...

707
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:20,630
...as a sort of a sacrifice
to a terrible sort of a...

708
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:22,845
- God?
- Yes.

709
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:27,266
Sebastian, who was gentle, kind...

710
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:31,013
...saw something not gentle,
not kind, in the universe.

711
00:48:31,232 --> 00:48:33,023
Something...

712
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:37,439
- Something terrible in himself.
- What was it? Can you tell me?

713
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:42,484
- One day at Cabeza de Lobo...
- Where?

714
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:49,195
That's where we were last summer.
That's where...

715
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,909
That's where Sebastian died?

716
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:54,041
Yes.

717
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:55,745
How did he die?

718
00:48:57,716 --> 00:49:02,129
They say a heart attack,
but I don't remember. I really don't.

719
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:06,344
You see, afterwards,
I was hysterical, taut.

720
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:09,178
Said things I don't remember.

721
00:49:09,728 --> 00:49:11,353
That's why I'm here.

722
00:49:11,605 --> 00:49:15,056
Because I say things people don't...

723
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:18,193
...and then I don't even remember.

724
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:20,111
Try to remember.

725
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:28,031
You and Sebastian, last summer...

726
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:30,580
Try to remember.

727
00:49:38,965 --> 00:49:42,381
The beach was very white.

728
00:49:43,762 --> 00:49:46,004
Oh, how the sun burned.

729
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:51,969
It was like the eye of God
watching us.

730
00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:54,685
Burning, burning.

731
00:49:55,774 --> 00:49:58,062
There was no air that day.

732
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:01,147
The sun had burned up all the air.

733
00:50:02,155 --> 00:50:06,318
Outside it was like inside a furnace.

734
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:13,079
- Then they came.
- Who came?

735
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,497
From all parts of the beach.

736
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:20,413
And that awful noise they made.

737
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:26,295
The noise of musical instruments
all made of tin.

738
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,258
Who is "they"?

739
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:33,518
And that, that music.

740
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,603
That awful music.

741
00:50:38,357 --> 00:50:40,350
I hear that music!

742
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:43,269
I still hear it!

743
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:47,191
It's getting closer and closer!

744
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,738
Sebastian! Help!

745
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:59,034
- What happened? What happened then?
- I don't remember after that!

746
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:02,203
Stop that this minute.
Stop that noise.

747
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:05,050
- Doctor, I must see you at once.
- Get out of here.

748
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:08,883
Sister, get out and don't
come back until I call you.

749
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:19,312
I can't remember.

750
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:23,686
- I can't remember!
- It's all right.

751
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:28,446
- Don't worry, it's all right.
- But I have to, I want to!

752
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:30,109
Then you will.

753
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,909
Will you help me?

754
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,203
- If you let me.
- Yes.

755
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:41,334
I shouldn't have done that.

756
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:44,380
Why not?
It was a friendly kiss, wasn't it?

757
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:46,960
Maybe it wasn't.

758
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:50,293
Maybe now you'll think
that all those...

759
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,424
...stories about the gardener
are true.

760
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,929
Whatever's true, we'll find.

761
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:14,402
I want you to know that
I can look attractive...

762
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:17,029
...if I had my hair done and if...

763
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,459
When I'm at Lions View,
may I wear a pretty dress?

764
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:23,085
If you like.

765
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,210
Just imagine, once again
to be able to do...

766
00:52:30,426 --> 00:52:33,131
...one thing I'd like.

767
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:57,659
Come out here, son.
I want you to see something.

768
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:10,002
Take a good long look.
Tell me, what do you see?

769
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:14,540
Old tires, tin cans,
and a "Drink Nehi" sign.

770
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:16,635
That's the past you're looking at.

771
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:19,420
Thanks to a certain young man
from Chicago...

772
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:22,013
...there'll be a new building
on that lot...

773
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:27,138
...devoted to psychosurgery, dedicated
to the memory of Sebastian Venable.

774
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,226
I wish I were that optimistic.

775
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,864
I've been working with
the lawyers and accountants.

776
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:37,024
And we're getting, listen to this...

777
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:41,536
...in big, round, beautiful figures,
$1 million.

778
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:45,530
- Just like that, no strings attached?
- No strings attached.

779
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,250
She wants you, and nobody else,
to do the operation on her niece.

780
00:53:49,462 --> 00:53:52,629
You can't blame her for that.
There isn't anybody better.

781
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:58,211
Something horrible happened
to that girl last summer.

782
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,639
Some dreadful, traumatic experience
of some kind.

783
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:05,050
What?

784
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:07,803
I don't know.
I haven't found out yet.

785
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:11,731
And she refuses to allow herself
to remember.

786
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,065
She's gonna have to be made
to remember.

787
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:17,812
Come in.

788
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:19,735
Excuse me, Dr. Hockstader.

789
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:23,071
Mrs. Holly and her son are here
to see the new patient.

790
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:25,743
Have them wait in my office, will you?

791
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:28,157
- How's Miss Catherine?
- She looks lovely.

792
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:32,373
She had her hair done this morning.
She's wearing her own clothes.

793
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:36,752
I've never seen clothes like
that girl's got. From Paris! And...

794
00:54:37,468 --> 00:54:40,588
Thank you, Miss Benson.
I'll be along.

795
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,965
But she's a patient. You can't
let her wear her own clothes.

796
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:48,476
I put her in the nurses' wing.
I don't want her in the ward.

797
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:50,431
The nurses' wing?

798
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:53,062
I know I'm taking a risk...

799
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:56,561
...but for a while I don't want her
to feel she's a patient.

800
00:54:56,779 --> 00:55:00,907
I want her to feel she's free of
restrictions, free of being watched.

801
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:02,445
This is very unorthodox.

802
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:04,824
So is insanity.
That's why we're here.

803
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:08,488
Seems your whole approach
has little to do with neurosurgery.

804
00:55:09,124 --> 00:55:12,624
- For the time being.
- That's what this new building is for.

805
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:16,959
- Dedicated to neurosurgery.
- Yes, I know.

806
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:21,587
Mrs. Venable thinks you're prepared
to go ahead with the operation.

807
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:24,096
Yes, I know.

808
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:41,647
Cathy's in there?
George, hold me now.

809
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,026
I'm so nervous, I could jump
clear out of my skin.

810
00:55:45,243 --> 00:55:47,402
Well, don't, Mama.

811
00:55:54,336 --> 00:55:58,250
- Kitten!
- Miss Benson, you can go to lunch now.

812
00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:03,091
- Thank you, doctor.
- My poor baby. My angel.

813
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:06,921
- In this place.
- It's all right, Mama. I'm just fine.

814
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,094
You look pretty good,
Cathy, considering.

815
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,513
- So do you, George, considering.
- We wanted to see you.

816
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,647
But Violet said no,
not while you were at St. Mary's.

817
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:21,354
The doctors there didn't want
anybody to see you, so we didn't.

818
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:23,444
My, that's a pretty dress.

819
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:27,440
- When did you get that?
- In Paris. Sebastian bought it.

820
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,994
Yeah? I'm wearing one of his suits.

821
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:33,245
Yes, I recognize it.

822
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:36,661
Wasn't it sweet of Vi to give George
his wardrobe?

823
00:56:36,836 --> 00:56:39,161
Not that she could've done
anything with it.

824
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,164
It's the thought behind the deed
that matters.

825
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,709
Have you seen Aunt Vi recently?

826
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:48,846
Yes, we saw her last night.
At her house.

827
00:56:49,056 --> 00:56:51,808
She invited us to a private supper.

828
00:56:52,017 --> 00:56:55,636
She's had this elevator installed.
Cutest thing you ever saw...

829
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,723
We've got business to talk about.

830
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,190
I know, son. You know
how children are. They're critical.

831
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:03,810
What did Aunt Vi say last night?

832
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:07,529
That you were
in extremely capable hands.

833
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:10,742
And I can tell they are capable too.

834
00:57:10,953 --> 00:57:13,704
Mr. Brossard, the new lawyer we got...

835
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:16,749
Such a nice man too,
a tower of strength...

836
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:20,043
...in all these months
since Sebastian's been gone.

837
00:57:20,254 --> 00:57:23,669
It nearly killed Violet.
I know, I was there.

838
00:57:23,882 --> 00:57:29,303
You didn't see her the way I did,
grieving like a madwoman.

839
00:57:30,597 --> 00:57:33,349
I mean, like her heart would break.

840
00:57:35,227 --> 00:57:39,307
He was her whole life. She worshipped
the ground beneath his feet.

841
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:43,390
When she got this letter
from that place with the funny name...

842
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:44,641
What letter?

843
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:49,238
From the authorities, telling about
what happened to him at...

844
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:52,616
What was the name of that place,
honey, where he passed on?

845
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:54,577
- Cabeza de Lobo.
- That's it!

846
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:56,412
- Did you see the letter?
- No.

847
00:57:56,665 --> 00:58:00,247
But I guess it told about
how he had this heart attack...

848
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,208
...and how Catherine was
not quite herself, poor baby.

849
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:07,458
I'm myself now, Mama.
Aren't I, doctor?

850
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:09,509
Of course you are.

851
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:12,175
Don't worry a thing about
what people say.

852
00:58:12,347 --> 00:58:15,348
Nobody in the city knows about
what you've been through.

853
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,266
Do they, George? Not a thing.

854
00:58:17,477 --> 00:58:20,050
Nobody even knows you've come back
from Europe.

855
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:22,180
When they question us
or inquire...

856
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,645
...we just say that you stayed abroad
to study something or other.

857
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:31,774
- Can we talk to Catherine alone?
- Yes, on a private family matter.

858
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:36,867
Just some papers gotta be signed.
Some business.

859
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:40,040
Is that all right?

860
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:44,585
Don't worry. Since I've been allowed
to smoke, I've become a perfect lamb.

861
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:48,751
My little girl was
always a perfect lamb.

862
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:52,086
Thank you.

863
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:04,314
- Cathy, Sebastian left a will.
- A generous, thoughtful will.

864
00:59:04,523 --> 00:59:08,022
He bequeathed to us,
to you and to me, $50,000 each...

865
00:59:08,193 --> 00:59:10,067
...after taxes are paid.

866
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:13,399
- Sebastian always was very kind.
- Isn't that the truth?

867
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:14,991
But there is a problem.

868
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,530
It's very complicated, but
Mr. Brossard, this new lawyer, is...

869
00:59:19,746 --> 00:59:23,993
...trying to get it through probate.
- Only it won't go through probate.

870
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:25,917
- Why not?
- Aunt Vi won't let it.

871
00:59:26,086 --> 00:59:30,214
Well, you see, it has to do with you.
With your being ill.

872
00:59:31,049 --> 00:59:35,711
- She doesn't trust me with the money?
- 50 grand is chickenfeed to Aunt Vi.

873
00:59:35,929 --> 00:59:39,428
- Then what is it?
- When you went off your rocker...

874
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:43,686
Shut up, Mama. Cathy's not
that far gone. Are you, Cathy?

875
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:47,347
- When I went off my rocker...?
- Yeah. You said something.

876
00:59:47,566 --> 00:59:50,139
You made up some crazy story
about Sebastian.

877
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,816
- When she heard whatever it was...
- Last night...

878
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:56,647
...not a word would she say,
except that you babbled.

879
00:59:56,866 --> 01:00:00,946
That's her word for it. You babbled
some story about Sebastian...

880
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:04,329
...and how he lived and...
- Died...

881
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,781
...in a place called Cabeza de Lobo.

882
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:11,040
What you said gave her a real turn.

883
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:16,083
When doctors decided you were crazy,
she wanted you to stay at St. Mary's.

884
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:20,134
Or even right here.
This seems such a nice place too.

885
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:23,468
- With that nice, capable doctor.
- Go on.

886
01:00:23,684 --> 01:00:26,258
Written permission was needed
to keep you here.

887
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:30,763
So that was the point
of the private supper.

888
01:00:30,942 --> 01:00:32,650
You've gotta understand...

889
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:35,570
This 100 grand is important to us.

890
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,781
It means George will have all sorts
of advantages now.

891
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:43,155
Things we couldn't give him, since 1929
killed your father and our nest egg.

892
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:46,288
Mother, you didn't sign those papers?

893
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:49,832
- You didn't commit me to Lions View?
- Not yet.

894
01:00:50,044 --> 01:00:53,792
But, Cathy, the way Aunt Vi put it,
there was no choice at all.

895
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:55,334
Mama's gotta sign.

896
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:59,464
Besides, honey, it's not like
it was for always.

897
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,596
In no time,
after the little operation...

898
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:06,010
...you'll be able to...

899
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,514
What little operation?

900
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,390
Oh, Cathy!

901
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,019
There's only one little operation
they perform here.

902
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:21,405
It's on the brain.
It's called a lobotomy.

903
01:01:21,617 --> 01:01:24,736
You may have heard of it
or read about it. I have.

904
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:28,038
It's that nice young doctor's
specialty.

905
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:31,541
In cases of hopeless lunacy...

906
01:01:31,752 --> 01:01:35,701
...he bores holes into the skull
and operates on the brain!

907
01:01:35,964 --> 01:01:39,962
Oh, honey, please don't
talk about it. Please!

908
01:01:40,177 --> 01:01:44,305
- You can't let them!
- Stop. It's not the end of the world!

909
01:01:44,514 --> 01:01:47,301
- Don't sign that paper!
- They say it don't hurt.

910
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:50,222
- Don't let them!
- No worse than tonsils.

911
01:01:50,437 --> 01:01:54,137
And then, afterwards,
you're all right again.

912
01:03:57,645 --> 01:04:00,516
Miss Catherine.

913
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:03,682
- Those faces!
- Look, for the love of...

914
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:07,816
- You get her back to her room.
- What are you doing here?

915
01:04:11,993 --> 01:04:14,032
We've just come from your office.

916
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:17,780
- What is all that noise? Is it fire?
- What happened?

917
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:22,293
I don't know. We were having this chat
about your treatment.

918
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:26,168
All of a sudden my poor baby flew
out of the room and down the hall.

919
01:04:26,382 --> 01:04:30,711
I'm sure it's the right thing,
what you and Violet are doing.

920
01:04:30,928 --> 01:04:33,135
- It is the right thing.
- Come on, Mama.

921
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:35,755
- We're so grateful to you.
- Come on.

922
01:04:35,975 --> 01:04:37,635
Having you look after her and...

923
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:40,224
Will you get me Dr. Van Vitch?

924
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:41,600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

925
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:49,405
I'm sorry they upset you.

926
01:04:49,613 --> 01:04:52,817
Miss Catherine, don't ever run away.

927
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:55,904
Where will you cut, doctor?

928
01:04:56,203 --> 01:05:00,995
- I'm not at all sure that I will.
- Where will you cut my brain, doctor?

929
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,702
In front?

930
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,456
Or further back?
I suppose I'm to have my head shaved.

931
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:12,343
It seems such a waste, seeing as how
I had my hair fixed this morning...

932
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:15,719
...then to have it all cut off
right after it.

933
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:18,303
I tell you, it's funny.

934
01:05:19,893 --> 01:05:24,105
And you were the one who was
going to help me. Help me.

935
01:05:24,523 --> 01:05:25,554
Help me!

936
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:27,316
Don't talk like that.

937
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:30,396
Why not?
Now I sound insane, don't I?

938
01:05:30,612 --> 01:05:33,103
- Are you trying to?
- No, and I'm not.

939
01:05:33,323 --> 01:05:36,657
You've got to believe me, doctor.
I am not.

940
01:05:36,868 --> 01:05:40,486
Insane is such a meaningless word.

941
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:43,541
But lobotomy has a precise meaning,
hasn't it?

942
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:48,745
Are you going to operate? Tell me,
doctor, please, are you going to?

943
01:05:48,964 --> 01:05:51,537
I don't know yet.

944
01:05:54,427 --> 01:05:56,254
Poor doctor.

945
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,796
I bother you, don't I?

946
01:06:00,016 --> 01:06:01,890
Yes, you do.

947
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:05,019
Well, I'll try not to anymore.

948
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:11,442
- Three cc, please.
- Yes, doctor.

949
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:13,978
Must I take off my pretty dress?

950
01:06:14,197 --> 01:06:15,857
Of course not.

951
01:06:20,203 --> 01:06:22,361
I want to help you.

952
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:23,902
Trust me.

953
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:27,751
I want to trust you.

954
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:32,498
It seems to me that
I need help very much.

955
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,890
- His eyes are so blue.
- Who?

956
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,893
The doctor.

957
01:06:46,562 --> 01:06:48,851
Wonder why he isn't blond.

958
01:06:49,023 --> 01:06:51,692
They usually are blond,
with eyes that blue.

959
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:53,940
- I'm blond.
- Are you?

960
01:06:54,153 --> 01:06:58,103
Funny. We were going to blonds next.

961
01:06:58,324 --> 01:07:00,779
Blonds were next on the menu.

962
01:07:00,993 --> 01:07:05,489
You just relax now.
Let yourself go.

963
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:11,167
All last summer,
Sebastian was famished for blonds.

964
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:13,538
Fed up with the dark ones.

965
01:07:13,881 --> 01:07:18,626
Famished for blonds.
The travel brochures he picked up...

966
01:07:18,844 --> 01:07:23,055
...were advertisements of blond
northern countries.

967
01:07:23,265 --> 01:07:27,594
Think he'd already booked us
to Stockholm and Copenhagen.

968
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:32,812
Fed up with the dark ones,
famished for the light ones.

969
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,397
That's the way he talked about people,
as if they were...

970
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:40,186
...items on a menu.

971
01:07:40,407 --> 01:07:43,443
That one's delicious-looking.

972
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,281
That one's appetizing.

973
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:50,328
Or that one is not appetizing.

974
01:07:51,543 --> 01:07:55,042
I think really he was half-starved...

975
01:07:55,255 --> 01:07:58,540
...from living on pills and salads.

976
01:08:00,051 --> 01:08:02,625
You just relax, now.

977
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:09,718
We'll fly north, little bird.

978
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,854
It's what he called me sometimes.

979
01:08:13,106 --> 01:08:15,145
Little bird.

980
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:22,028
We'll walk under those radiant,
cold northern lights.

981
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:27,029
I've never seen the aurora borealis.

982
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:30,574
Well...

983
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:35,576
He never saw those northern lights.

984
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:41,798
Who said, "We're all of us children...

985
01:08:42,009 --> 01:08:44,963
...in a vast kindergarten...

986
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:51,639
...trying to spell God's name
with the wrong alphabet blocks"?

987
01:09:13,707 --> 01:09:14,988
Thank you.

988
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:20,083
Mrs. Venable, I do
want to speak with you...

989
01:09:20,297 --> 01:09:23,998
Oh, this forgetfulness,
my greatest failing, doctor.

990
01:09:24,218 --> 01:09:27,005
I have a little gift for you,
this book.

991
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:28,756
Thank you.

992
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:32,266
<i>- Poem of Summer.
- By my son, Sebastian Venable.</i>

993
01:09:32,476 --> 01:09:35,927
That volume contains only one poem,
as do the others I have.

994
01:09:36,146 --> 01:09:39,597
<i>Each with the title Poem of Summer
and the date of the summer.</i>

995
01:09:39,816 --> 01:09:42,486
If you like that one,
I'll bring the others.

996
01:09:42,694 --> 01:09:44,402
He wrote one poem a year?

997
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,112
One for each summer
that we traveled together.

998
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:52,192
The other nine months of the year
were really only a preparation.

999
01:09:52,412 --> 01:09:53,906
Nine months?

1000
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,031
The length of a pregnancy, yes.

1001
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:59,668
I gather the poem was hard to deliver.

1002
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:03,044
Even with me. Without me, impossible.

1003
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:08,132
- Doctor, he wrote no poem last summer.
- But he died last summer.

1004
01:10:08,344 --> 01:10:10,052
Without me, he died.

1005
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:12,131
That was his last summer's poem.

1006
01:10:13,433 --> 01:10:17,929
Mrs. Venable, how exactly
did your son die?

1007
01:10:18,813 --> 01:10:21,849
I told you, a heart attack.

1008
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:24,604
Is that what the letter said?

1009
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:27,939
How did Catherine know
I received a letter?

1010
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:31,449
Catherine? She knows very little.

1011
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:33,319
She can't remember.

1012
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:37,830
That's her illness. She was there,
but she can't remember.

1013
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,374
- Mrs. Holly told me about it.
- So you've seen her too, have you?

1014
01:10:41,544 --> 01:10:43,916
I must say, you have been observing.

1015
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,703
There was no letter,
only a death certificate.

1016
01:10:46,924 --> 01:10:48,715
- I'd like to see that if...
- Why?

1017
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:53,679
I think it's important. I want to know
what happened the day your son died.

1018
01:10:54,223 --> 01:10:57,010
You shall have it tomorrow.

1019
01:10:57,226 --> 01:11:00,891
And tomorrow you shall also have
the permission to operate.

1020
01:11:01,105 --> 01:11:02,765
And now I'd better go.

1021
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:05,437
I've got lawyers waiting for me.

1022
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:10,527
You'd think giving you a building was
simple. Apparently, I must sign papers.

1023
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:13,906
But I'm used to it.
Sebastian never signed anything.

1024
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:16,953
- He must have suspected...
- Mrs. Venable.

1025
01:11:17,663 --> 01:11:18,825
Your son...

1026
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:21,035
What about my son?

1027
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,120
What sort of personal life
did he have?

1028
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:27,749
He was chaste.

1029
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:32,629
- You mean he was celibate?
- Yes.

1030
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,885
You don't believe me, do you?

1031
01:11:36,098 --> 01:11:38,671
- Do you believe that he never...?
- Yes, never.

1032
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:44,681
As strictly as if he'd taken a vow.
This sounds like vanity, doctor...

1033
01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:47,899
...but I was actually
the only one in his life...

1034
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:51,313
...that satisfied the demands
he made of people.

1035
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:54,365
Time after time, he'd let people go,
dismiss them...

1036
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:57,486
...because their attitude
toward him was not as...

1037
01:11:57,702 --> 01:12:01,285
- As pure?
- As pure as my son demanded.

1038
01:12:01,623 --> 01:12:04,540
Would you want to see Catherine?

1039
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,622
Is that wise?

1040
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,378
It might help me.

1041
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:10,955
But the lawyer.

1042
01:12:11,174 --> 01:12:14,459
Surely you've kept the lawyer
waiting before.

1043
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:16,836
Yes, I have.

1044
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:18,763
Such a strong...

1045
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:22,431
...such a persuasive doctor.

1046
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:42,401
She's been under sedation.
She's just coming out of it.

1047
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:46,118
She looks lovely, doesn't she?

1048
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:47,911
Doesn't she?

1049
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:58,671
- Miss Catherine?
- Where are we going?

1050
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:00,761
His eyes...

1051
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:03,974
This one's eyes are so blue...

1052
01:13:04,184 --> 01:13:06,854
...such strange, frightened...

1053
01:13:11,942 --> 01:13:16,154
I'm sorry. I must have been dreaming.

1054
01:13:16,613 --> 01:13:18,570
Hello, Catherine.

1055
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:26,407
I thought... we would have
seen each other before this.

1056
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:29,661
At St. Mary's, they wouldn't
let any of us see you.

1057
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:32,916
Mama was here today.

1058
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,377
That was today, wasn't it? I lose
track of time with all these shots.

1059
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,300
You look very well, Catherine.

1060
01:13:39,886 --> 01:13:45,307
Mama told me how you got her
to agree to commit me here...

1061
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:48,511
...and then let them...
- She seems disturbed, doctor.

1062
01:13:48,853 --> 01:13:53,100
Aunt Violet! I am disturbed.

1063
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:57,233
Don't you think I have
every reason to be?

1064
01:13:57,445 --> 01:14:00,197
Forcing my mother
into signing a paper...

1065
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:03,324
I've never forced anybody
to do anything.

1066
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:04,945
Oh, yes, you have.

1067
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:06,953
Always.

1068
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:09,827
And now you're holding $100,000...

1069
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:13,534
...under Mother and George's
poor greedy noses...

1070
01:14:13,753 --> 01:14:17,585
...to force her to sign a paper
authorizing this doctor to...

1071
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,541
Doctor. I see no purpose in my
remaining here listening to this.

1072
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:24,466
I'll wait for you in that sun room.

1073
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,881
Doctor, I wanted to speak
to you alone.

1074
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:03,294
Miss Catherine wanted to see you again
before you left.

1075
01:15:03,969 --> 01:15:07,255
I didn't want to take your place
last summer.

1076
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:09,880
Please believe that, Aunt Vi.

1077
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,389
But Sebastian insisted. He said...

1078
01:15:12,603 --> 01:15:16,766
...you weren't well enough to travel
with him, and he couldn't travel alone.

1079
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:21,152
So he insisted that I go along
with him in your place last summer.

1080
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:23,735
And he died last summer.

1081
01:15:25,824 --> 01:15:30,652
Aunt Violet, would you like me
to tell you...?

1082
01:15:50,348 --> 01:15:53,219
You fell in love with Sebastian,
didn't you?

1083
01:15:53,435 --> 01:15:56,768
I tried to give him
what you had always given him:

1084
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,685
The tender understanding
and the love you gave...

1085
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:04,810
My son and I had a rare and wonderful
love and trust between us.

1086
01:16:05,029 --> 01:16:06,821
A covenant between us...

1087
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:10,032
- I know about the covenant.
- He broke that covenant...

1088
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:13,861
...when he took her, not me,
to travel while he created his poem.

1089
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,615
Even when I was with him,
he'd sometimes be frightened.

1090
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,411
But I'd know what of.

1091
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:23,162
I'd reach across a table
and touch his hands.

1092
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:27,628
Say not a word, just look,
and touch his hands with mine.

1093
01:16:29,011 --> 01:16:32,630
Then, in the morning, the summer poem
would be continued...

1094
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:34,343
...until it was finished.

1095
01:16:34,559 --> 01:16:37,346
- I couldn't help him.
- Naturally not, he was mine.

1096
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,512
I knew how to help him.
You couldn't.

1097
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,011
- I tried.
- I'd force him.

1098
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:42,856
All right, I failed him.

1099
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:46,934
I knew that the day we flew down
to Cabeza de Lobo from...

1100
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:49,313
...where he'd given off
writing his poem.

1101
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:52,983
- Because he had broken...
- Yes, something had broken.

1102
01:16:53,202 --> 01:16:56,535
- That string of pearls old mothers...
- Old?

1103
01:16:56,747 --> 01:16:58,787
- Hold their sons by!
- Yes, from death.

1104
01:16:58,999 --> 01:17:00,826
No! Hold them from life!

1105
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:03,616
You were the stranger, the destroyer.

1106
01:17:03,837 --> 01:17:06,375
- We were life.
- You fed on life.

1107
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,381
Both of you. Taking!

1108
01:17:08,592 --> 01:17:14,215
People were objects for your pleasure.
That's what you taught each other.

1109
01:17:14,431 --> 01:17:18,892
- You were superior to mere mortals.
- We needed no one but one another.

1110
01:17:19,603 --> 01:17:24,265
Sebastian only needed you
while you were still useful.

1111
01:17:24,483 --> 01:17:28,397
- Useful?
- I mean young, able to attract.

1112
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:30,403
She's babbling and lying.

1113
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:33,365
- He left her home because she...
- You stole him!

1114
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:35,484
Lost her attraction!

1115
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:38,738
What would attraction have to do
with a son and mother?

1116
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:43,618
- Is there no way to stop these lies?
- Yes! Have my brain cut.

1117
01:17:43,835 --> 01:17:45,211
This was a mistake.

1118
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:48,540
The mistake was my going
with Sebastian.

1119
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:52,208
- When he left her, she had a stroke.
- Not a stroke!

1120
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:54,170
A hysterical stroke.

1121
01:17:54,512 --> 01:17:57,513
Sebastian left her home
like a toy he tired of.

1122
01:17:57,724 --> 01:18:02,267
And he took me with him
like a new toy. On his last voyage.

1123
01:18:02,437 --> 01:18:05,521
- Lies. All lies.
- You see, doctor, we both...

1124
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:08,976
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?

1125
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:12,313
For Sebastian. He used us as bait!

1126
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:17,567
When she was no longer able to lure
the better fish in, he let her go.

1127
01:18:17,785 --> 01:18:20,407
Bait? For what?
What were the better fish?

1128
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:22,448
We procured for him.

1129
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:27,536
She'd do it in the smart, fashionable
places they went before last summer.

1130
01:18:27,753 --> 01:18:32,131
Sebastian was shy with people.
She wasn't. Neither was I.

1131
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,426
But we both did
the same thing for him.

1132
01:18:35,636 --> 01:18:37,795
We both made contacts for him.

1133
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:42,676
I can't listen to this obscenity.
Stop her, doctor.

1134
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:46,552
Cut the truth out of my brain,
is that what you want?

1135
01:18:46,772 --> 01:18:49,975
You can't. Not even God
can change the truth.

1136
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,518
- That we were nothing but a...
- Doctor!

1137
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:55,482
- It's the truth!
- See how she destroys us?

1138
01:18:56,073 --> 01:18:58,564
Cut this hideous story
out of her brain!

1139
01:18:58,784 --> 01:19:02,782
How much are you willing
to pay for that, Aunt Vi?

1140
01:19:02,997 --> 01:19:05,748
Get me away from her. Out of here.

1141
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,749
Out of this...

1142
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,748
- Nurse, some spirits of ammonia.
- Yes, doctor.

1143
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,006
- What happened?
- She fainted.

1144
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,924
No. No, she didn't.

1145
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:22,471
Just a little...

1146
01:19:22,683 --> 01:19:25,008
...dizziness, that's all.

1147
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:29,011
Dr. Hockstader, will you
help me to my car?

1148
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:34,652
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Whether it is or not, I'm going home.

1149
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:56,417
Tomorrow, I want that girl
operated on.

1150
01:19:56,633 --> 01:20:01,793
That decision belongs to the doctor
in charge, who is also the surgeon.

1151
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:06,177
I don't want to hear from you again
until the operation has been performed.

1152
01:22:24,028 --> 01:22:26,187
No! No!

1153
01:22:29,033 --> 01:22:30,196
Please, no!

1154
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,200
- You trying to ruin this hospital?
- You know better than that.

1155
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:42,585
Can you imagine what would happen
to us if she'd jumped?

1156
01:22:42,797 --> 01:22:44,125
She was frightened. She...

1157
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,045
Patients are here
because they can't think.

1158
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,926
After 24 hours observation...

1159
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:54,598
During which she tried to kill herself,
incited the men's day room to a riot...

1160
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:57,602
- She opened that door by mistake.
- Trying to get away.

1161
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:02,348
There was a riot, and she caused it.
Don't invent excuses for her.

1162
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:04,725
And from that Paris clinic:

1163
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:07,561
Delusions the world
was devouring her...

1164
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:11,107
...that she was being raped by a man
with dueling pistols.

1165
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:13,952
- The Dueling Oaks.
- Here's more of her erotomania.

1166
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,533
At St. Mary's, they couldn't
keep her. Why?

1167
01:23:16,747 --> 01:23:19,072
Because of her obscenity and violence.

1168
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,782
She sexually attacked
a 60-year-old gardener.

1169
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:23,959
It was the other way around.

1170
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:27,463
She tried to burn one of the Sisters
with a cigarette.

1171
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:30,344
She was provoked.
I was there, I saw it.

1172
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:33,672
Provoked? Who would provoke
a disturbed patient?

1173
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:35,299
You'd be surprised.

1174
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:38,137
And to top it, she attempts suicide.

1175
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,643
Cogent proof of sanity,
wouldn't you say?

1176
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,896
I need time.

1177
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:47,852
When will you want
the operating room tomorrow?

1178
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:51,029
I said I need more time.

1179
01:23:51,531 --> 01:23:53,191
I heard you.

1180
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:01,447
Get me Dr. Glen Kilmer
at the Seattle Clinic.

1181
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:05,742
You know I want that building
as much as you do.

1182
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:07,670
I'll hold on.

1183
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:13,465
Give me one more day to see if I can
break through that block to the truth.

1184
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:15,505
This is a medical emergency.

1185
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,008
I want to try something.

1186
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:20,343
I want to try something tomorrow,
at Mrs. Venable's.

1187
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,933
- Why Mrs. Venable's?
- I don't know.

1188
01:24:23,104 --> 01:24:26,555
I feel somehow that in that garden...

1189
01:24:26,774 --> 01:24:30,854
...maybe in that jungle,
we might find...

1190
01:24:31,028 --> 01:24:34,195
Look, you don't want Mrs. Venable
giving her money...

1191
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:36,695
...to the Seattle Clinic, do you?

1192
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:41,197
And you don't want anybody to be able
to say that we acted hastily...

1193
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:43,702
...or unethically, do you?

1194
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:47,200
Cancel the call.

1195
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:51,711
But be sure you know where
I can find Dr. Kilmer.

1196
01:25:25,123 --> 01:25:27,246
Mrs. Venable will be right down.

1197
01:25:27,584 --> 01:25:31,582
- The others are here, as you asked.
- Show them into the sun room, please.

1198
01:25:32,005 --> 01:25:33,630
Of course, doctor.

1199
01:25:35,425 --> 01:25:36,588
Cathy, honey...

1200
01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:38,379
Later, Mrs. Holly.

1201
01:25:38,595 --> 01:25:41,003
Doctor, I have the things you wanted.

1202
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,796
- In the dining room.
- Oh, thank you.

1203
01:25:50,523 --> 01:25:52,267
What's going on here?

1204
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:55,107
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Dr. Cukrowicz.

1205
01:25:55,278 --> 01:25:58,481
I had to get those papers you wanted.
I mislay everything.

1206
01:25:58,948 --> 01:26:01,618
My son always said,
"Mother, if you..."

1207
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:06,280
What are you two doing here?
And where is Dr. Cukrowicz?

1208
01:26:06,498 --> 01:26:08,455
Why, I thought you invited us.

1209
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:11,336
Dr. Cukrowicz asked me
to ask them to come.

1210
01:26:12,253 --> 01:26:13,582
Of course.

1211
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:15,339
Dr. Hockstader...

1212
01:26:15,882 --> 01:26:18,503
...I want you to meet
my sister-in-law, Mrs. Ho...

1213
01:26:18,718 --> 01:26:21,505
- Where is Catherine?
- In the sun room.

1214
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:25,133
Could Mrs. Holly and her son
wait for us in the garden?

1215
01:26:25,349 --> 01:26:27,223
Of course. Foxhill?

1216
01:26:27,643 --> 01:26:30,597
I don't know why everybody
is being so mysterious.

1217
01:26:30,813 --> 01:26:33,897
I brought you some of Sebastian's
papers. Odds and ends.

1218
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:37,482
- And this, the thing you wanted.
- Your son's death certificate?

1219
01:26:37,653 --> 01:26:41,318
- This must be painful for you.
- If you don't read Spanish, I have...

1220
01:26:41,532 --> 01:26:43,110
I read Spanish.

1221
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:45,986
Well, I have a translation.

1222
01:26:46,162 --> 01:26:47,988
As you see,
there was no mystery...

1223
01:26:48,164 --> 01:26:51,497
...no matter what the girl said
at the time or any other time.

1224
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:53,992
It says the body was somewhat...

1225
01:26:54,253 --> 01:26:56,495
...damaged in falling.
Where did he fall?

1226
01:26:56,714 --> 01:27:00,379
On the ground. Where else do you fall
when you die in the hot sun...

1227
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:02,627
...in the street
of a godforsaken village?

1228
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:04,258
Did you see his body...?

1229
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:07,347
It was a primitive country.
The coffin came sealed.

1230
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:08,547
Sealed?

1231
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:10,173
Were there any rumors?

1232
01:27:10,352 --> 01:27:13,555
There were no rumors.
His heart stopped and he fell.

1233
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,934
I'll wait in the garden now.
That is where you want me?

1234
01:27:17,109 --> 01:27:18,733
Yes, if you will.

1235
01:27:19,862 --> 01:27:21,190
Dr. Hockstader...

1236
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:24,400
...let me show you my son's garden.

1237
01:27:24,616 --> 01:27:28,946
It's very unusual.
Like the dawn of creation.

1238
01:27:31,707 --> 01:27:33,699
Sebastian's garden.

1239
01:27:35,794 --> 01:27:37,952
I can still cry.

1240
01:27:39,256 --> 01:27:41,165
Am I dreaming this?

1241
01:27:41,383 --> 01:27:43,506
It doesn't seem real.

1242
01:27:45,929 --> 01:27:50,342
Would you take off your jacket?
It's time for another injection.

1243
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,434
What is it this time?

1244
01:27:54,229 --> 01:27:57,099
- Something different.
- The truth serum?

1245
01:27:57,315 --> 01:28:00,351
Yes, except there is no such thing.

1246
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:01,932
As truth?

1247
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:03,398
Or the truth serum?

1248
01:28:03,738 --> 01:28:06,988
There is truth, all right. Somewhere.

1249
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:08,737
Sit down.

1250
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:13,914
Now you want me to start
counting backwards from 100?

1251
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:20,830
- Do you enjoy counting backwards?
- Oh, I love it. Just love it.

1252
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:25,335
100...

1253
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:29,051
...99, 98, 97...

1254
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:32,176
...96, 95...

1255
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:37,309
I feel it already.

1256
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,599
- How funny.
- Close your eyes for a minute.

1257
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,909
I want you to give me something.

1258
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,246
Name it, it's yours.

1259
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,076
I want you to give me
all your resistance.

1260
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,502
Resistance? To what?

1261
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:04,787
To the truth.

1262
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:09,300
Truth is the one thing
I have never resisted.

1263
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:12,512
People think they don't resist it,
but they still do.

1264
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,763
Sebastian said:

1265
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:19,266
"Truth is at the bottom
of a bottomless well."

1266
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,059
Why did...?

1267
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,728
Open your eyes.

1268
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,856
Why did you try to kill yourself?

1269
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:35,151
Isn't that what everybody wants?

1270
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,120
Me out of the way?

1271
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,198
Mother and George
would get their money.

1272
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,456
You'd get your building.

1273
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,949
Aunt Vi...

1274
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:45,869
Go on.

1275
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,838
You know what I think
you're trying to do?

1276
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:53,550
I think you're trying
to hypnotize me.

1277
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,050
You're looking at me so...

1278
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,594
...straight.

1279
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:03,684
You're doing something strange
to me with your eyes. Your eyes...

1280
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:07,392
- Is that what you're doing?
- Is that what you feel I'm doing?

1281
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,690
I feel... peculiar.

1282
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,158
It doesn't just have to do
with what you gave me.

1283
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,871
I'm putting out my hands.

1284
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:26,584
I want you to put your hands into mine
and give me all your resistance.

1285
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:30,538
Pass all the resistance
from your hands into mine.

1286
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,960
Here are my hands...

1287
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:36,551
...but there's no resistance in them.

1288
01:30:36,722 --> 01:30:38,264
You'll tell the true story?

1289
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,932
Yes, I'll try.

1290
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:44,229
Nothing not spoken.
Everything told exactly?

1291
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:46,723
Everything exactly.

1292
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:50,225
Because I have to.

1293
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:56,856
Can I...?

1294
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:58,404
Can I get up?

1295
01:30:58,577 --> 01:31:02,195
Yes, of course, but be careful.
You'll feel a little dizzy.

1296
01:31:03,832 --> 01:31:05,208
I can't.

1297
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:09,914
Tell me to.

1298
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:12,130
Then I think I could.

1299
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:14,001
Stand up.

1300
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,844
Now I can.

1301
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,973
- Oh, I'm dizzy. Help me.
- It's all right. You're all right.

1302
01:31:31,151 --> 01:31:32,811
Hold me.

1303
01:31:32,986 --> 01:31:35,145
I've been so lonely.

1304
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:40,946
Let me.

1305
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:42,323
Let me.

1306
01:31:50,462 --> 01:31:53,795
I suggest you bring her outside,
if you don't mind, doctor.

1307
01:31:53,965 --> 01:31:55,709
We'll be right out.

1308
01:32:02,974 --> 01:32:04,599
Are you ready?

1309
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:21,449
Hello, Catherine.

1310
01:32:22,452 --> 01:32:23,946
Now, Catherine...

1311
01:32:24,162 --> 01:32:26,735
...you're going to tell
the true story.

1312
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:30,740
- Where do I start?
- Wherever you think it started.

1313
01:32:31,335 --> 01:32:33,127
I think it started...

1314
01:32:33,296 --> 01:32:35,584
...the day Sebastian was born
in this house.

1315
01:32:35,756 --> 01:32:37,037
- Cathy.
- I don't mind.

1316
01:32:37,258 --> 01:32:41,920
Let's start later than that.
Why don't we begin with last summer?

1317
01:32:42,138 --> 01:32:43,300
Last summer?

1318
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:45,720
Last summer. How did it begin?

1319
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,594
It began...

1320
01:32:48,102 --> 01:32:49,513
...after the Dueling Oaks.

1321
01:32:49,728 --> 01:32:53,940
- Don't tell about that, Cathy...
- Mrs. Holly, don't interrupt.

1322
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:56,851
After that happened...

1323
01:32:57,152 --> 01:33:00,356
...the next morning,
I started writing my diary...

1324
01:33:00,531 --> 01:33:02,737
...in the third person singular,
such as:

1325
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:06,200
"She is still living this morning."

1326
01:33:06,662 --> 01:33:08,820
Meaning that I was.

1327
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,455
"What's next for her? God knows."

1328
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,877
I couldn't go out anywhere.

1329
01:33:16,088 --> 01:33:18,377
That's true.
She wouldn't leave her room.

1330
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,001
Shut up, Mama.

1331
01:33:20,217 --> 01:33:23,882
I would write,
"She woke up early this morning.

1332
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:27,383
She had her coffee, dressed...

1333
01:33:27,557 --> 01:33:29,052
...went for a brief walk."

1334
01:33:29,434 --> 01:33:31,593
- Who did?
- She did.

1335
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:34,558
I did.

1336
01:33:35,774 --> 01:33:38,265
From Esplanade
to Canal Street...

1337
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:41,770
...as though being pursued
by a pack of Siberian wolves.

1338
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:46,652
Went through all the stop signs.
Couldn't wait for the green signals.

1339
01:33:47,244 --> 01:33:51,822
"Where did she think she was going,
back to the Dueling Oaks?"

1340
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:55,918
Everything...

1341
01:33:56,336 --> 01:33:58,375
...chilly and dim.

1342
01:33:59,589 --> 01:34:01,083
But that hot...

1343
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:02,586
...ravenous mouth.

1344
01:34:03,259 --> 01:34:05,418
He was a very ordinary married man.

1345
01:34:05,845 --> 01:34:06,876
And then?

1346
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:12,382
One morning, Cousin Sebastian
came in and said, "Get up."

1347
01:34:12,602 --> 01:34:17,560
Well, if you're still alive after
dying, then you're obedient. I got up.

1348
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:21,102
He took me down to a place
where they take passport photos.

1349
01:34:21,986 --> 01:34:24,607
He said, "Mother can't go
with me this summer.

1350
01:34:24,906 --> 01:34:27,823
You're going with me this summer,
instead of Mother."

1351
01:34:28,034 --> 01:34:31,983
- Except that it was her idea, not his.
- Mrs. Venable.

1352
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,075
And your cousin?

1353
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,281
He helped bring me back to life...

1354
01:34:37,501 --> 01:34:40,289
...in Paris, Barcelona, Rome.

1355
01:34:40,463 --> 01:34:44,330
All those lovely foreign cities
I'd never seen, we saw together.

1356
01:34:44,508 --> 01:34:47,426
And those...
What did he call them?

1357
01:34:47,636 --> 01:34:49,629
Those sunshine days...

1358
01:34:49,805 --> 01:34:53,470
...where it's always noon,
and we cast no shadows.

1359
01:34:53,684 --> 01:34:56,009
- But then...
- But then what?

1360
01:34:56,604 --> 01:34:58,264
At Amalfi...

1361
01:34:59,106 --> 01:35:03,186
...high above the Mediterranean,
in a garden, I took his arm.

1362
01:35:03,986 --> 01:35:05,694
You took his arm. Yes...?

1363
01:35:05,863 --> 01:35:09,279
It seemed like such a natural thing
to do, but he pulled away.

1364
01:35:09,491 --> 01:35:12,860
How he must have loathed
being touched by her.

1365
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:17,534
I only did it to try and show
my appreciation for his kindness.

1366
01:35:17,749 --> 01:35:19,327
I didn't want to...

1367
01:35:20,002 --> 01:35:22,041
There was nothing else.

1368
01:35:23,839 --> 01:35:25,250
Anyway...

1369
01:35:25,757 --> 01:35:28,213
...it was there in Amalfi...

1370
01:35:28,427 --> 01:35:32,424
...suddenly, last summer,
that he began to be restless and...

1371
01:35:33,348 --> 01:35:35,008
Go on.

1372
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:38,518
He couldn't go on.

1373
01:35:38,728 --> 01:35:41,101
He couldn't write his summer poem.

1374
01:35:41,398 --> 01:35:44,434
I have his notebook here. See?

1375
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:48,731
<i>Title, Poem of Summer.
And the date of the summer: 1937.</i>

1376
01:35:48,947 --> 01:35:53,027
And after that, blank pages,
blank pages. Nothing but nothing.

1377
01:35:53,201 --> 01:35:55,443
A poet's vocation rests
on something...

1378
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,779
...as fine and thin as a spider's web.

1379
01:35:58,123 --> 01:36:00,495
It's all that holds him
out of destruction.

1380
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,701
Very few are able to do it alone.

1381
01:36:02,877 --> 01:36:05,451
Great help is needed.
I did give it. She didn't.

1382
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:07,919
She's right about that.
I failed him.

1383
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:10,416
I wasn't able to keep
the web from breaking.

1384
01:36:10,593 --> 01:36:12,716
I saw it breaking,
I couldn't save it.

1385
01:36:12,929 --> 01:36:16,879
Now the truth's coming out. Maybe
she'll admit what really happened.

1386
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,391
- What did happen?
- How she killed him.

1387
01:36:20,561 --> 01:36:23,349
How she murdered him
at Cabeza de Lobo. Ask her.

1388
01:36:28,778 --> 01:36:30,687
What did really happen?

1389
01:36:31,197 --> 01:36:33,569
Suddenly, last summer...

1390
01:36:33,783 --> 01:36:35,822
...he wasn't young anymore.

1391
01:36:36,035 --> 01:36:37,826
We went to Cabeza de Lobo...

1392
01:36:38,162 --> 01:36:41,163
...suddenly, he switched
from the evenings to the beach.

1393
01:36:41,457 --> 01:36:42,832
Evenings to the beach?

1394
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:47,628
I mean, from the evenings
to the afternoons.

1395
01:36:47,838 --> 01:36:52,002
Suddenly, Cousin Sebastian changed
to the afternoons in the beach.

1396
01:36:52,384 --> 01:36:55,220
What kind of a beach was it?
Was it a public beach?

1397
01:36:55,429 --> 01:36:57,007
Yes, public.

1398
01:36:57,223 --> 01:36:59,844
Little statements like that
give her away.

1399
01:37:00,684 --> 01:37:04,599
After all I've told you about his
fastidiousness, can you accept...

1400
01:37:04,772 --> 01:37:08,556
...that Sebastian would go to some
dirty public beach near a harbor?

1401
01:37:08,776 --> 01:37:11,942
Whatever she wants to say,
I want her to say it.

1402
01:37:12,571 --> 01:37:13,686
Go on.

1403
01:37:14,281 --> 01:37:16,819
I don't want to go on.

1404
01:37:17,034 --> 01:37:21,696
Every afternoon, you and your cousin
would go to this free public beach?

1405
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:26,578
It wasn't the free one.
The free one was right next to it.

1406
01:37:26,793 --> 01:37:29,166
There was a fence
between the free beach...

1407
01:37:29,379 --> 01:37:32,464
...and the beach that we went to
that charged admission.

1408
01:37:32,632 --> 01:37:35,088
Did anything happen there
that disturbed you?

1409
01:37:36,386 --> 01:37:38,260
- Yes.
- What?

1410
01:37:38,472 --> 01:37:41,887
He bought me a bathing suit
I didn't want to wear.

1411
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,093
I laughed.
I said, "I can't wear that.

1412
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:47,514
Why, it's a scandal
to the jaybirds."

1413
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:50,019
What do you mean?
Was this suit immodest?

1414
01:37:50,233 --> 01:37:54,480
It was a one-piece bathing suit.
Made of white something.

1415
01:37:54,696 --> 01:37:56,902
But the water made it transparent.

1416
01:37:57,115 --> 01:37:59,902
I told him I didn't want
to swim in it...

1417
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:03,653
...but he just grabbed my hand
and dragged me into the water...

1418
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:05,621
...all the way in...

1419
01:38:05,832 --> 01:38:08,749
...and I came out looking naked.

1420
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,543
Why did he do that?
Do you know why he did that?

1421
01:38:12,755 --> 01:38:14,298
Yes.

1422
01:38:14,507 --> 01:38:18,552
- To attract attention.
- Because he thought you were lonely?

1423
01:38:19,095 --> 01:38:22,262
Did he think he could shock you
out of your depression?

1424
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:26,681
You know why I was doing it.
I told you.

1425
01:38:26,853 --> 01:38:29,426
I was procuring for him.

1426
01:38:30,815 --> 01:38:33,982
Sebastian was lonely, doctor.

1427
01:38:34,193 --> 01:38:38,606
That empty blue jay notebook
got bigger and bigger.

1428
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:41,230
So big, it was big and empty...

1429
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:45,358
...like that big, empty,
blue sea and sky.

1430
01:38:47,707 --> 01:38:52,084
And before long, when the weather
was warmer and the beach so crowded...

1431
01:38:52,294 --> 01:38:54,999
...he didn't need me anymore
for that purpose.

1432
01:38:55,756 --> 01:39:00,383
The ones from the free beach climbed
over the fence or swam around it.

1433
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:05,383
So now he let me wear
a decent dark suit.

1434
01:39:05,557 --> 01:39:08,808
I'd go to a faraway end
of the beach and write post cards...

1435
01:39:08,977 --> 01:39:12,512
...and letters and keep up
my third person journal...

1436
01:39:12,731 --> 01:39:16,859
...until it was time to meet him
outside the bathhouses on the street.

1437
01:39:17,569 --> 01:39:20,689
He would come out... followed.

1438
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:22,948
Who'd follow him?

1439
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:27,950
The hungry young people that climbed
over the fence from the free beach.

1440
01:39:29,122 --> 01:39:31,874
He'd pass out tips among them,
as if they'd all...

1441
01:39:32,084 --> 01:39:35,951
...shined his shoes
or called taxis for him.

1442
01:39:36,171 --> 01:39:38,792
Each day the crowd got bigger...

1443
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:42,043
...noisier, greedier.

1444
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,427
At last, we stopped going out there.

1445
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:49,471
And after that? After you stopped
going to the public beach?

1446
01:39:49,684 --> 01:39:50,929
Then one day...

1447
01:39:51,144 --> 01:39:55,723
...a few days after we'd stopped
going out to the beach...

1448
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,941
...it was a blazing white day.

1449
01:39:59,152 --> 01:40:03,695
Not a blazing hot blue day,
but a blazing hot white one.

1450
01:40:04,324 --> 01:40:08,618
We had a late lunch at a shabby,
lonely restaurant by the sea there.

1451
01:40:08,828 --> 01:40:11,236
Sebastian was white as the weather.

1452
01:40:11,456 --> 01:40:16,367
He had on a white silk suit,
a white tie, a white Panama.

1453
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:20,756
And he kept touching his face
and his throat here and there...

1454
01:40:20,965 --> 01:40:22,958
...with a white silk handkerchief...

1455
01:40:23,134 --> 01:40:26,254
...popping little white pills
into his mouth all the time.

1456
01:40:26,429 --> 01:40:30,473
I knew he was having a bad time with
his heart and that it frightened him.

1457
01:40:30,683 --> 01:40:32,640
"Let's go north," he kept saying.

1458
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:36,974
"I think we've done Cabeza de Lobo.
I think we've done it, don't you?"

1459
01:40:37,189 --> 01:40:38,648
I thought we'd done it.

1460
01:40:38,816 --> 01:40:42,019
Then there were those children
along the beach...

1461
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:45,985
...which was fenced off with wire
from the restaurant.

1462
01:40:46,157 --> 01:40:50,368
Our table was less than a yard away
from the wire fence.

1463
01:40:50,578 --> 01:40:52,736
And those children...

1464
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:55,239
There was a band of them.

1465
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,741
They looked like a flock
of plucked birds...

1466
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,451
...and they came darting up
to the wire fence...

1467
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:03,120
...as if they'd been blown
there by the wind...

1468
01:41:03,299 --> 01:41:05,920
...by the hot, white wind
from the sea.

1469
01:41:06,135 --> 01:41:09,669
<i>They were all calling out,
"Pan! Pan! Pan!"</i>

1470
01:41:09,888 --> 01:41:11,513
They were calling for bread?

1471
01:41:11,724 --> 01:41:14,345
They made gobbling noises
with their mouths...

1472
01:41:14,518 --> 01:41:17,519
...stuffing their fists
into their mouths and making...

1473
01:41:17,688 --> 01:41:21,104
...gobbling noises
with frightful grins.

1474
01:41:22,192 --> 01:41:26,486
We were sorry we'd come to the place,
but it was too late to go.

1475
01:41:26,697 --> 01:41:28,405
Why was it too late to go?

1476
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:33,858
I told you. Cousin Sebastian
wasn't well. His eyes looked dazed.

1477
01:41:34,037 --> 01:41:37,074
But he said, "Don't look
at those little monsters.

1478
01:41:37,249 --> 01:41:39,704
Beggars are a social disease
in this country.

1479
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:42,546
If you look at them,
you get sick of the country.

1480
01:41:42,712 --> 01:41:45,286
It spoils the whole country for you."

1481
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,293
Go on.

1482
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,096
Go on.

1483
01:41:56,267 --> 01:41:57,927
Go on.

1484
01:41:58,478 --> 01:42:00,886
I am going on.

1485
01:42:01,106 --> 01:42:04,640
The band of children began
to serenade us.

1486
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:07,350
- Began to what?
- Play for us on instruments...

1487
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:11,271
...make music, if you
could call it music.

1488
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:15,868
Their instruments were the instruments
of percussion, know what I mean?

1489
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:18,914
Yes, instruments of percussion,
like drums.

1490
01:42:19,123 --> 01:42:23,951
As far as I could make out in
the white blaze of the sand beach...

1491
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:28,002
...the instruments were tin cans
strung together...

1492
01:42:28,216 --> 01:42:30,754
...and bits of metal,
other bits of metal...

1493
01:42:30,968 --> 01:42:34,135
...that had been flattened out
and made into...

1494
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,678
- Into what?
- Cymbals, you know?

1495
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:39,840
- Brass plates hit together.
- That's right.

1496
01:42:40,061 --> 01:42:44,272
Tin cans flattened out
and clashed together. Cymbals.

1497
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:48,938
The others had other things.
All sorts of things.

1498
01:42:49,153 --> 01:42:54,111
Things that they'd made or picked up
on the beach to make a sort of noise.

1499
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:57,780
A music made out of noise.

1500
01:42:57,953 --> 01:42:59,068
Go on.

1501
01:42:59,246 --> 01:43:01,618
I am going on.
Nothing could stop me now.

1502
01:43:01,832 --> 01:43:05,782
Your Cousin Sebastian, was he
entertained by this concert?

1503
01:43:06,003 --> 01:43:08,161
- Terrified of it.
- Terrified, why?

1504
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:12,081
I think he recognized some
of the musicians.

1505
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:13,629
Some of the boys.

1506
01:43:14,428 --> 01:43:16,717
Between childhood and older.

1507
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:19,338
Did he complain to the manager
about it?

1508
01:43:19,892 --> 01:43:23,557
What manager? God?
You don't understand my cousin.

1509
01:43:23,979 --> 01:43:25,010
How do you mean?

1510
01:43:26,481 --> 01:43:30,609
He accepted all as how things are...

1511
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:35,730
...and thought nobody had any right
to complain or interfere whatsoever.

1512
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:39,614
Even though he knew what
was awful was awful...

1513
01:43:39,828 --> 01:43:41,867
...that what was wrong was wrong.

1514
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,789
He thought it unfitting to ever take
any action about anything whatsoever...

1515
01:43:47,002 --> 01:43:50,620
...except to go on doing
as something in him directed.

1516
01:43:50,839 --> 01:43:53,840
What did this something in him
direct him to do?

1517
01:43:54,009 --> 01:43:58,255
He suddenly pushed himself
away from the table and said:

1518
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:01,514
"They've got to stop.
Make them stop. I'm not a well man.

1519
01:44:01,683 --> 01:44:04,849
I have a heart condition.
It's making me sick."

1520
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:08,512
That was the first time that
Cousin Sebastian ever attempted...

1521
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:11,359
...to correct a human situation.

1522
01:44:11,568 --> 01:44:16,360
I think that
that was his fatal error.

1523
01:44:16,531 --> 01:44:21,074
He stalked out of the restaurant after
throwing paper money on the table.

1524
01:44:21,285 --> 01:44:23,492
He fled from the place.

1525
01:44:23,663 --> 01:44:24,694
I followed.

1526
01:44:24,872 --> 01:44:29,368
It was all white outside.

1527
01:44:29,544 --> 01:44:31,916
White hot. A blazing white hot, it...

1528
01:44:32,129 --> 01:44:36,210
You followed Sebastian out of the
restaurant onto that hot, white street?

1529
01:44:36,425 --> 01:44:37,754
Running along the beach...

1530
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:40,923
- You ran along the beach?
- No, no. We didn't.

1531
01:44:41,138 --> 01:44:42,716
We didn't move either way.

1532
01:44:45,142 --> 01:44:49,603
I rarely made any suggestion,
but this time I did.

1533
01:44:49,814 --> 01:44:51,438
What did you suggest?

1534
01:44:51,649 --> 01:44:55,777
Sebastian seemed to be paralyzed
near the entrance at the café.

1535
01:44:56,028 --> 01:44:59,112
So I said, "Let's go."
I remember I said:

1536
01:44:59,365 --> 01:45:02,781
"Down that way is the harbor,
we're likely to find a taxi there.

1537
01:45:03,035 --> 01:45:06,404
Or why don't we go back in
and have them call us a taxi?

1538
01:45:06,622 --> 01:45:09,195
Oh, let's do! Let's do that.
That's better."

1539
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:13,628
And he said, "Are you mad?
Go back in that filthy place? Never!

1540
01:45:13,837 --> 01:45:17,621
That gang of kids shouted vile
things about me to the waiters."

1541
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:20,628
I said, "Well, let's go down
towards the harbor.

1542
01:45:20,844 --> 01:45:25,589
Let's not try to climb that hill
in this dreadful heat."

1543
01:45:25,766 --> 01:45:28,517
And Cousin Sebastian shouted,
"Please shut up!

1544
01:45:28,727 --> 01:45:32,807
Let me handle this situation, will
you? I want to handle this thing."

1545
01:45:34,191 --> 01:45:38,651
And he started up the steep street
with a hand stuck in his jacket...

1546
01:45:38,862 --> 01:45:42,942
...where I knew he was having
a pain from his palpitations.

1547
01:45:43,158 --> 01:45:47,950
But he walked faster
and faster in panic.

1548
01:45:48,163 --> 01:45:49,787
The faster he walked...

1549
01:45:49,998 --> 01:45:53,082
...the louder and the closer it got.

1550
01:45:53,293 --> 01:45:56,128
- Closer what got?
- The music!

1551
01:45:56,296 --> 01:45:58,869
- The music again?
- The music!

1552
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:01,546
The noise of the following band.

1553
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,093
They were following.
They were following...

1554
01:46:05,305 --> 01:46:07,974
...up the blazing white street.

1555
01:46:08,183 --> 01:46:12,643
Up. Straight up. That was the only
way open, so he went that way.

1556
01:46:12,937 --> 01:46:15,724
He tried to escape from those streets?

1557
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:20,187
He tried to escape
from those streets...

1558
01:46:20,361 --> 01:46:25,356
- He couldn't find a way out?
- He couldn't find a way out.

1559
01:46:25,575 --> 01:46:27,651
Did the band of children...?

1560
01:46:27,827 --> 01:46:30,911
When he tried to escape...

1561
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:33,032
...from those streets...

1562
01:46:33,749 --> 01:46:38,162
...down those little side streets,
between the buildings...

1563
01:46:38,337 --> 01:46:40,875
...they came from everywhere.

1564
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:43,498
So the only way was up.

1565
01:46:43,718 --> 01:46:45,757
The only way was straight up...

1566
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:47,927
...up those steep, white streets...

1567
01:46:48,139 --> 01:46:52,551
...in the sun, that was like a great
white bone of a giant beast...

1568
01:46:52,726 --> 01:46:54,802
...that had caught on fire in the sky.

1569
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:57,393
And Sebastian kept
running straight up.

1570
01:46:57,565 --> 01:47:00,056
I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran...

1571
01:47:00,234 --> 01:47:02,725
...but he ran and he ran and he ran...

1572
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:05,436
...where it was whiter and emptier.

1573
01:47:05,656 --> 01:47:07,031
What was emptier?

1574
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:10,692
The light. The sky and the light.

1575
01:47:10,869 --> 01:47:15,911
Those steep, white streets and the sun,
and everything blazed white and empty.

1576
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:18,870
Where did those streets lead to?

1577
01:47:19,044 --> 01:47:20,075
Nowhere!

1578
01:47:20,254 --> 01:47:21,285
He never reached...?

1579
01:47:21,505 --> 01:47:26,167
He never reached the end.
They stopped nowhere! Never!

1580
01:47:26,385 --> 01:47:28,876
Except, except...

1581
01:47:29,054 --> 01:47:30,881
- Except?
- At the...

1582
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:33,720
At the very top of the hill.

1583
01:47:33,892 --> 01:47:38,435
Something. A place, a ruin.

1584
01:47:38,647 --> 01:47:40,604
Broken stones. Like...

1585
01:47:40,816 --> 01:47:41,930
Like what?

1586
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:45,733
Like the entrance...

1587
01:47:45,904 --> 01:47:49,736
...to a ruined temple...

1588
01:47:49,908 --> 01:47:53,608
...some ancient ruined temple...

1589
01:47:53,828 --> 01:47:56,615
...which he entered.

1590
01:47:58,416 --> 01:48:00,907
And they...

1591
01:48:01,211 --> 01:48:03,120
...overtook him.

1592
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,629
There, in that...

1593
01:48:08,259 --> 01:48:11,213
And you, Catherine,
what did you do then?

1594
01:48:12,472 --> 01:48:14,797
I heard Sebastian scream.

1595
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:21,142
He screamed just once.

1596
01:48:22,607 --> 01:48:23,805
Then I...

1597
01:48:27,069 --> 01:48:28,861
Then I...

1598
01:48:29,822 --> 01:48:31,945
Help!

1599
01:48:33,034 --> 01:48:35,441
Help!

1600
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,530
Help!

1601
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:39,789
And then? Then?

1602
01:48:39,957 --> 01:48:42,282
I ran. They let me run.

1603
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:44,832
- They didn't even see me.
- Run where?

1604
01:48:45,004 --> 01:48:46,035
Down.

1605
01:48:46,255 --> 01:48:49,256
The waiters, police, people...

1606
01:48:49,467 --> 01:48:52,586
...ran out of buildings,
back up to where...

1607
01:48:52,803 --> 01:48:56,587
...to where Cousin Sebastian...

1608
01:48:58,642 --> 01:49:02,972
He was lying naked...

1609
01:49:03,188 --> 01:49:05,940
...on the broken stones.

1610
01:49:07,568 --> 01:49:10,818
And this you won't believe.

1611
01:49:10,988 --> 01:49:15,899
Nobody, nobody could believe it.

1612
01:49:19,204 --> 01:49:21,874
It looked as if...

1613
01:49:22,082 --> 01:49:25,451
...as if they had devoured him!

1614
01:49:26,587 --> 01:49:29,338
As if they had torn or cut...

1615
01:49:29,548 --> 01:49:33,047
...parts of him away
with their hands...

1616
01:49:33,677 --> 01:49:39,347
...or with knives or those jagged
tin cans they made music with.

1617
01:49:40,642 --> 01:49:44,058
As if they'd torn bits of him away...

1618
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:49,733
...and stuffed them
in their own gobbling mouths!

1619
01:49:52,529 --> 01:49:57,356
There wasn't a sound anymore.

1620
01:49:57,534 --> 01:50:00,737
There was nothing...

1621
01:50:02,122 --> 01:50:04,529
...but Sebastian...

1622
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:11,788
...lying on those stones...

1623
01:50:12,006 --> 01:50:16,384
...torn and crushed.

1624
01:50:27,105 --> 01:50:28,848
Oh, Cathy.

1625
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:35,730
Mrs. Venable.

1626
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,450
There you are.

1627
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:45,489
I thought you were still on deck.

1628
01:50:45,706 --> 01:50:50,249
And where's your hat?
Oh, dear, you'll get fever.

1629
01:50:50,419 --> 01:50:53,669
A whole day up there in the rigging
in the hot sun.

1630
01:50:53,881 --> 01:50:57,380
Watching those awful, hungry birds.

1631
01:50:57,593 --> 01:51:00,677
I don't know what you see
in such terrible sights.

1632
01:51:00,888 --> 01:51:04,339
It's too much for both of us,
my darling.

1633
01:51:04,558 --> 01:51:06,800
That horrible sun.

1634
01:51:36,047 --> 01:51:37,839
Of course God is cruel.

1635
01:51:38,049 --> 01:51:42,213
We didn't need to come to the
Encantadas to find that out, did we?

1636
01:51:42,387 --> 01:51:44,130
We've always known about him.

1637
01:51:44,306 --> 01:51:48,968
The savage face he shows to people,
and the fierce things he shouts.

1638
01:51:49,185 --> 01:51:54,143
It's all we ever see or hear
of him now. Nobody seems to know why.

1639
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:55,597
The difference is...

1640
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:59,274
...we know about him, the others don't.
That's where we're lucky.

1641
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:00,940
Go rest, my darling.

1642
01:52:01,156 --> 01:52:03,148
Look out for that fever.

1643
01:52:03,324 --> 01:52:07,701
I'm going to see the captain and tell
him to change our course for home.

1644
01:52:07,912 --> 01:52:10,485
Oh, Sebastian.

1645
01:52:10,707 --> 01:52:14,491
What a lovely summer it's been.
Just the two of us.

1646
01:52:14,669 --> 01:52:16,460
Sebastian and Violet.

1647
01:52:16,671 --> 01:52:18,498
Violet and Sebastian.

1648
01:52:18,715 --> 01:52:21,336
Just the way it's always going to be.

1649
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:24,124
Oh, we are lucky, my darling...

1650
01:52:24,303 --> 01:52:27,340
...to have one another
and need no one else, ever.

1651
01:52:41,362 --> 01:52:45,656
There's every possibility
that the girl's story is true.

1652
01:52:51,205 --> 01:52:53,778
George, tell her she's got
to come home with us.

1653
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:56,034
- Doctor?
- Catherine will be all right.

1654
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:58,701
- Can she come home?
- Don't worry, she will.

1655
01:52:58,879 --> 01:53:02,877
- Why don't you take your mother?
- Sure. Come on, Ma.

1656
01:53:13,393 --> 01:53:14,425
Miss Catherine?

1657
01:53:15,562 --> 01:53:17,471
She's here, doctor.

1658
01:53:19,316 --> 01:53:21,392
Miss Catherine's here.
