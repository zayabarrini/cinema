1
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:54,812
[Doctor]
Um... you have no actual
medical training?

2
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:59,950
No. I have kids.
Learned a lot right there.

3
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,860
I mean, I've seen nurses
give my son throat cultures.

4
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,230
What is it?
You stick a giant Q-Tip
down their throat and wait.

5
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,635
Or a urinalysis, where you
take a dipstick to see whether
or not the white count's high.

6
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,639
[Doctor]
Yes, I understand.
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,404
I'm great with people.
You'd have to observe me
to know for sure,

8
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,106
but you can trust me
on that.

9
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,114
Yeah.
I'm an extremely
fast learner.

10
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:26,777
You show me
something in a lab once,
and I've got it down.

11
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,222
Mm-hmm.
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

12
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,485
That was my first
interest really,

13
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,495
but then I got married
and had a kid too young
and that kind of blew that.

14
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,497
When I was first out
of high school,

15
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:43,228
I got a job
with Fleuer Engineers
and Constructors in Irvine.

16
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:46,465
I fell madly in love
with geology.

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,702
Geology?
[Erin]
Yeah.

18
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,709
I learned how to read maps.
I love maps.

19
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,940
Yeah, but I lost my job
because...

20
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,177
my boy came down
with the chicken pox,
had a 104 temperature,

21
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,379
and my ex-husband
was useless, so...

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,388
[Softly]
That didn't
really work out.

23
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,825
Uh-huh.

24
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,362
You got
a really nice office.

25
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,329
Thanks.

26
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,171
Look...

27
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:55,306
Aw, fuck.

28
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,308
[Sighs]

29
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:05,439
- [Nail Break]
- Goddamn it.

30
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,689
[Sighs]

31
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,068
[Starts Engine]

32
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,682
Good morning,
Mr. Masry.
Good morning,
Rosalind.

33
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,785
How are you doing today?
Fine, thanks.
And you?

34
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,853
Very well.
Thank you for asking.

35
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,865
Good morning.

36
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,902
Good morning.

37
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,701
How ya doing?
Hi, Donald.

38
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,902
[Brenda]
Did you see it last night?
I was out, but I taped it.

39
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:09,572
Don't tell me what happens.
It was so good.
Your 9:00's here already.

40
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:22,017
Remind me.
Erin Brockovich.

41
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,027
Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

42
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,025
She was referred.

43
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,703
Yeah.
All right?

44
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,671
Erin, hi.

45
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,833
Hi.
[Closes Door]
Ed Masry.

46
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,207
Sorry you had to wait.

47
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:44,374
That's okay.
Here, sit, sit.
Sit down, sit down.

48
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:55,781
Thank you.

49
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,090
Oh.

50
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:01,222
I never thought just standing
could take it out of you,

51
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,324
but ever since
that shithead hit me,

52
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,335
I feel like my whole body's
put together wrong.

53
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:07,837
You poor thing.

54
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,841
Uh, did anyone ask
if you wanted coffee?

55
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,345
Yeah. I'm fine.
[Clears Throat]
[Ed] Good.

56
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:19,111
Listen, whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake,

57
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:22,778
and, you and me,
we're gonna make him pay for it.

58
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,384
So, uh, why don't you tell me
what happened?

59
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:34,261
I was pulling out real slow
and, out of nowhere,

60
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:39,201
his Jaguar comes
racing around the corner
like a bat out of hell.

61
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,764
They took some bone
from my hip and put it
in my neck.

62
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,775
I don't have insurance,

63
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:50,109
so I'm about $ 17,000
in debt right now.

64
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:54,948
I couldn't take pain killers
'cause they made me too groggy
to take care of my kids.

65
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,079
Matthew's eight
and Katie's almost six...

66
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:01,216
and Beth's just nine months.

67
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,557
I just want to be a good mom,
a nice person,

68
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,722
a decent citizen.

69
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,993
I just want to take good care
of my kids, you know?

70
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,901
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,736
Seventeen thousand in debt?
[Sighs]

72
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,336
Is your ex-husband
helping out?
Which one?

73
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:29,082
There's more than one?
Yeah, there's two.
Why?

74
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:38,191
So, you must have been feeling
pretty desperate that afternoon.

75
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,854
What's your point?

76
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:42,525
[Attorney]
Broke, three kids,
no job.

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,865
- A doctor in a Jaguar must have
looked like a good meal ticket.
- Objection.

78
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,632
[Judge]
Sustained.
What? He hit me.

79
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:51,801
- So you say.
- He came tearing around
the corner, out of control!

80
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:56,506
An E.R. Doctor,
who spends his day saving lives,
was the one out of control?

81
00:06:56,581 --> 00:07:00,950
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck.

82
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,544
[Spectators Murmuring]

83
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,680
Open and shut.
Open and fucking shut!

84
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,691
That is exactly
the kind of language
that lost the case.

85
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,126
It was over long before that.
I told you the questions
might get personal.

86
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,356
No, you told me
I'd be set!
I never said that.

87
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,524
You told me
I had a good shot.
I had no shot!

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,966
Let's try
and settle down here.
Fuck "settle down"!

89
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:21,631
I've got $ 74 in the bank.
I can't afford
to settle down.

90
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,707
I'm sorry, Erin.

91
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,503
Do they teach lawyers
to apologize?

92
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,841
Because you suck at it.

93
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,309
Hello? Hi.
Hi, Erin.

94
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,875
You've come so soon.
Yeah.

95
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:12,854
Oh, were you
a good girl, huh?

96
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:15,221
You're my little baby.
[Coughs]

97
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,022
What is that,
a little cough?
She's got a little cough.

98
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:21,757
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up, but...

99
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,096
I think I've got
some cough medicine.
Ah, bueno.

100
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,434
Um, listen... I didn't want
to tell you before,
Yeah?

101
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,736
You know,
with your worries.
What?

102
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:35,539
My daughter
bought a big house
with a room for me.

103
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:37,546
I'm moving in with her.

104
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,548
When?
Next week.

105
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:42,813
Next week?
I know,
but it's good for me.

106
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:47,090
Now I can help my daughter
take care of my grandkids.
And it's good for you too.

107
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:50,249
Now you have money,
you can hire a good baby-sitter,
eh?

108
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,692
Not the old lady
next door.

109
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,696
Thanks.

Yeah.

112
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,572

Hey, get in the house.
No dripping.

115
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,806

Okay.

116
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:20,815

don't get sick on me. Please.

We're going out.

127
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:07,294
You kids go ahead
and order.

128
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,396
Okay, I'm gonna have
a cheeseburger deluxe
with a Coke.

129
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,566
Okay.

130
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,475
Mommy, can I have
a cheeseburger deluxe...

131
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,672
with no cheese
and no bread?

132
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,716
- Did you get that?
- Yes.

133
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:25,516
And she will have
a cup of chicken broth
and a few crackers, please.

134
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:29,752
And for you?
Okay.
Just a cup of coffee.

135
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:33,922
Mommy, you're not eating?
Well, my lawyer took me out
to a fancy lunch to celebrate,

136
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:35,931
and I'm still stuffed.

137
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,933
How about that?

I'm calling about the job ad
in the paper.

141
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,877
Yes, I'm calling
about the job ad.

142
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,745
Great personality, good voice.

143
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,909
I don't have any actual
sales experience.

144

I don't really have a resume,
but I can...

145
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,056
No, I don't have
any computer skills, but...

146
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:40,084
Oh. Well, I thought
it was the local store.

147
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,996
Okay. Thanks anyway.

No, but I've called

to put it in the middle
of the floor.

168
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,921
You did?
Well, I didn't know that.

169
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:26,901
Donald seems to think you...
There's two things that
aggravate me, Mr. Masry:

170
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,335
Being ignored
and being lied to.

171
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,839
I never lied.
You told me
things would be fine.

172
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,842
They're not.
I trusted you.

173
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,209
I'm sorry about that.
I am.
I don't need pity.
I need a paycheck.

174
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,681
I've looked, but when
you've spent the past
six years raising babies,

175
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,344
it's real hard to convince
someone to give you a job
that pays worth a damn.

176
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,515
Are you getting every word
of this, honey, or am I
talking too fast for you?

177
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,524
[Ed]
I'm sorry
about that.

178
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:52,356
I really am, but we have
a full staff right now...
Bullshit!

179
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:55,727
If you had a full staff,
this office would return
a client's damn phone call.

180
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:59,859
I'm smart,
I'm hard-working,
and I'll do anything,

181
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,870
and I'm not leaving here
without a job.

182
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,408
[Softly]
Don't make me beg.

183
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:21,218
If it doesn't work out,
fire me.

184
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,224
Don't make me beg.

185
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,994
No benefits.

186
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,036
What we do in here
is file all the cases.

187
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:41,634
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status
of a file.

188
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,407
You know,
where it is in the office,
stuff like that.

189
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,177
Here's where we
organize all the files
alphabetically.

190
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:52,517
Simple enough.
Okay.
Here's your desk.

191
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:55,216
Come with me.
I want to show you
where the Xerox machine is.

192
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,851
Everybody has a code,
and you need to know about that.

193
00:14:57,927 --> 00:15:00,361
Do I get to pick
my own code?
We'll see.

194
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,826
[Erin]
Mr. Masry?
Yeah?

195
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:08,962
I was wondering,
can you tell me who I talk to...

196
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:12,201
about maybe getting
an advance on my paycheck,
just for the weekend?

197
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:17,770
Rosalind's the office manager.
She handles the payroll
and petty cash.

198
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:23,542
But she's gone already.
She leaves early on Fridays.

199
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:30,123
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, for Pete's sake,
here, here.

200
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,463
I've only got hundreds.

201
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:40,926
Here.
[Clears Throat]

202
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:43,198
I don't want your money,
Mr. Masry.

203
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:47,140
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from?
Here.

204
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,008
Have a good weekend.
Thank you.

205
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,480
See you.
[Employees]
See you. Good night.

206
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:55,483
[Ed]
See you Monday.

207
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:10,559
Hey. Hi, my sweetie.
Hello. [Kisses]

208
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,568
How are you?
Matthew? Katie?

209
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:17,504
Hey, Mom.
Hi, sweetie.
Come on.

210
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,837
How are you?
Thanks a lot.

211
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,244
You're welcome.

212
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:28,140
[Kisses]

213
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:36,757

214
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,237

Hey!

00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:01,410
[Revving

Hey!

[Continues

219
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:07,148
Hey!
Hello.

220
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,952
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

221
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,960
Well, uh, I don't know.

222
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,962
We were just
introducing ourselves
to the neighborhood, I guess.

223
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,658
Well, I'm the neighbors.

224
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:20,462
There, we're introduced,
so shut the fuck up.

225
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:23,231
[Chuckling]
Hey, hey.

226
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:26,741
Hold on there.
Let's start over,
okay?

227
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,742
My name's George.
What's yours?

228
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,577
Just think of me as the person
next door who likes it quiet.

229
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,582
Hey, come on.
Don't be like that.

230
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,845
Hell, we live next door
to each other.
I feel bad.

231
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,854
I feel terrible. I'm sorry.
Will you accept my apology?

232
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:44,187
I mean, hell, we're living
right next door to each other.
If you need a cup of sugar...

233
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:47,251
I don't eat sugar.
You don't need
any sugar?

234
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,355
Why don't I take you
out to dinner to apologize
for my rudeness?

235
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:55,028
You give me your number.
I already got your address,
so you can't get away.

236
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:58,004
Huh? I'll call you up proper,
and I'll ask you out
and everything.

237
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,837
[Scoffs]
You want my number?

238
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,207
I do.
I do want your number.

239
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,614
Which number do you want,
George?

240
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:10,549
Now I like the way
you say "George."

241
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,552
How many numbers you got?

242
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,283
Oh, I got numbers coming out
of my ears. For instance, ten.

243
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:19,725
"Ten"?
Yeah. That's how many
months old my baby girl is.

244
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:24,494
You got a little girl?
Yeah. Sexy, huh?

245
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:26,500
How about this
for a number: Six?

246
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,503
That's how old
my other daughter is.
Eight is the age of my son.

247
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:32,369
Two is how many times
I've been married and divorced.

248
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,806
Sixteen is the number of dollars
I have in my bank account.

249
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:39,472
850-3943. That's my
phone number, and with all
the numbers I gave you...

250
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,846
I'm guessing zero is the number
of times you're gonna call it.

251
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,717
Hey, how do you remember
your bank balance off the top
of your head like that?

252
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:49,052
That impresses me.

253
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,251
You're dead wrong
about that zero thing,
baby.

254

255
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,426
[Erin]
How long has she been crying
like that?

256
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:07,366
She's got that tooth coming in.
Why don't you give her
a cold washcloth to suck on?

257
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:10,843
I gotta go.
There's a clean one in the bag.
I'll check back later.

258
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:14,939
- Where's Anna?
- She's out to lunch
with the girls.

259
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:19,112
Oh.
I have to open a file.

260
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:24,381
Real estate thing,
pro bono.
Okay.

261
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:26,927
You know how to do that,
don't you?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

262
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,929
No problem.

263
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,894
- You're a girl.
- Excuse me?

264
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,701
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls?
You're a girl.

265
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,975
I guess I'm not the right kind.

266
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,647
Oh.

267
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,280
Uh, look, now, you may want...

268
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:56,289
Now that you're working here,
you may want to, uh...

269
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:58,382
rethink your wardrobe a little.

270
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,951
Why is that?

271
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,294
Well, I think
some of the girls...

272
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,890
are a little uncomfortable...

273
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:09,163
because of what you wear.

274
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,073
Is that so?

275
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:17,077
Well, it just so happens,
I think I look nice.

276
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:20,046
And as long as I have one ass
instead of two,

277
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,708
I'll wear what I like,
if that's all right with you.

278
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:30,384
Uh-huh.

279
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,392
You might want
to rethink those ties.

280
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:48,008
[Erin]
Anna?

281
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:50,874
Huh?
This real estate stuff...
Could you remind me?

282
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,436
I'm a little confused
exactly how we do it.

283
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:58,077
Why are there medical
records and blood samples
in real estate files?

284
00:20:58,152 --> 00:21:00,086
Erin, you've been here
long enough.

285
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,088
If you don't know how
to do your job by now,

286
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,590
I'm not about to do it
for you.

287
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:23,708

00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:28,274

What are they doing here?
I just went to pick them up.

298
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:32,379
She came by about an hour ago
and said something came up and
she had to drop the kids off.

299
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,745
"Something came up"?
Why didn't she call me at work?

300
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,080
I don't know.
She... I was...

301
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,642
I don't know... why.

That stupid bitch.
Mom.

303
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:46,660
Sorry. I just can't believe
she dumps my kids off
when nobody's home.

304
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:49,663
I was home.
We're fine.

305

we cooked some burgers,
had some milk.

There's an extra one
on the grill.

it's slippery.

about me getting a tattoo?

What do you mean,
I cheat?

You cheat!

316
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,458

Yeah.

- What's that?
- This is a Harley-Davidson.

ever made.

either one of you near one,
I'll knock you silly.

Yeah.
You have great kids.

I'm obviously not
a good judge of character...

330
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:13,740
or I would have never left them
with that idiot...

331
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:17,374
who cost a fortune
and smelled like chicken fat.

332
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,714
After I find her and kill her,

333
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:22,687
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

334
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:26,054
If you need help with them,
I could do that.

335
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,593
I'm not leaving my kids
with you.
[George]
Why?

336
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,595
I don't even know you.

337
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:33,962
What do you want
to know? Ask me.

338
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,968
Look, thanks for today.
You're welcome.
It was my pleasure.

339
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,540
How many decks
do you guys have here?

340
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,600
We had more than enough.
What's the matter?

341
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,702
You got so many friends
in this world, you can't
use one more?

342
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,838
Huh? I'm serious.

343
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,849
If you need someone
to look after your kids...

344
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,851
after school
or whatever,

345
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,012
I don't have a job now,
so...

346
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:58,023
Oh, that's
a great recommendation.

347
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,254
I'm unemployed.
By choice.

348
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:03,261
I work when I need to.
Yeah?

349
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:07,026
What do you do
the rest of the time,
live off your trust fund?

350
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,400
No, I do construction,
which pays real good, and
I make it last by living cheap.

351
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:13,598
[Noise]
I hope that's not supposed
to impress me.

352
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:15,402
Hey, bed.

[Footsteps Departing, Rapidly]
[George]
Your little ghosts.

354
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:21,739
You always this hard
on people who try
to help you?

355
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,681
[Sorting Cards]
I'm out of practice.

356
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:27,379
Yeah, well, let me
remind you then.

357
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:31,651
The polite thing is
to say, "Thank you."
Let's start with that.

358
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:34,625
Then you could say,
"Hey, that's a really
nice offer.

359
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:37,185
I don't mind
taking you up on that."

360
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:41,063
Why the hell do you want
to watch my kids?
I like kids.

361
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:44,069
Yeah, I do. I like
hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

362
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:48,406
You're home every afternoon?

363
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:50,669
I'm usually just working
on my bike.

364
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:57,141
Listen,
it's no big deal.
If it doesn't work out,

365
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:59,343
you can always
send them back
to the chicken fat lady.

366
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:08,525
This isn't gonna get you laid,
you know?
[Laughs]

[Snaps Fingers]
Get in bed.

368
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:14,431
[Footsteps Departing, Rapidly]
That's good, 'cause I don't
find you attractive either.

369
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,731
Good, then we're even.
Right, so we don't have
to worry about that.

370
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:20,432
I'm so glad we got that
out of the way.
I feel much better.

371
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:23,839
I do too. Seriously.
Because now I can just
look after the kids,

372
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,209
and I don't have to worry
about you coming on
to me all the time.

Hold on. Just hold on.
Yeah?

380
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:37,248
Sorry. Would you mind
if I investigate this
a little further?

381
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:41,446
- Investigate what?
- This real estate thing
with the Jensens.

382
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:44,046
- The pro bono case.
- Yeah, yeah.

383
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,751
Yeah? Because I just want
to make sure I'm understanding
what I'm reading.

384
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,353
Yeah, yeah, sure.

Hi.

00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:08,299
Yes.
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry & Vititoe.

390
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:10,467
Oh. You're a lawyer?

391
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:14,138
Hell, no.
I hate lawyers.
I just work for them.

392
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,181
[Chuckles]
Um, do you have
a minute?

393
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:19,480
I don't mean to be a pain
in PG&E's backside,

394
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:22,020
especially after all
they've done for Hinkley,

395
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:24,556
but I look around here
and I think,

396
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:27,354
"If they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay
for it."

397
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,724
So you didn't
put the house up
for sale,

398
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:33,629
they just came to you
and wanted to buy it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

399
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,997
I don't want to move.

400
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:39,367
Uproot the kids?
I've got a couple of girls.

401
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,930
Honest to God,
I don't know
if I have the energy.

402
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:45,603
You know,
I've been sick.

403
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:48,408
Me and Pete both have.

404
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,676
So, the whole idea
of selling this house,

405
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,548
if they're not
gonna pay us properly,
I just don't see the point.

406
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:56,782
Yeah, yeah,
I can see that.

407
00:29:56,856 --> 00:30:00,758
But...
I guess the only thing
that confused me is,

408
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:03,795
not that your medical
problems aren't important,

409
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:08,664
but how come the files
on that are in with all
the real estate stuff?

410
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:13,728
Well, there's just
so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

411
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,400
Right. Right.

412
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:20,036
Um, I'm sorry,

413
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:23,775
I just don't see why
you're corresponding
with PG&E...

414
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,716
about your medical problems
in the first place.

415
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:29,755
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

416
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:31,756
They did?

417
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:35,225
You bet.
Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

418
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,819
Not like with insurance
where you pay...

419
00:30:37,897 --> 00:30:40,695
and a year goes by
and maybe you see some money.

420
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,428
They just took care of it
just like that.
[Snaps Fingers]

421
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:47,097
We never even saw a bill.
Wow.
Why'd they do that?

422
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:48,936
Because of the chromium.

423
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:51,238
The what?
The chromium.

424
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,940
That's what kicked
this whole thing off.

427
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,788
What kind of chromium
is it?
There's more than one type?

428
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,815
Yes, there's straight-up
chromium; does good things
for the body.

429
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:44,454
There's chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

430
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,124
Then there's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium,

431
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,327
which, depending on the amounts,
can be very harmful.

432
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:53,269
Harmful how?
What would you get?

433
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:55,704
With repeated exposure
to toxic levels,

434
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:59,266
God, anything, really,
from chronic headaches
and nosebleeds...

435
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,710
to respiratory disease,
liver failure,

436
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,771
heart failure,
reproductive failure,

437
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,783
bone or organ deterioration,

438
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:08,217
plus, of course,
any type of cancer.

439
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,381
So, that stuff,
it kills people?

440
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:15,085
Yeah, definitely.
Highly toxic,
highly carcinogenic.

441
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,492
It gets into your DNA too,
so you pass the trouble
along to your kids.

442
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,497
It's very, very bad.

443
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:23,057
What's it used for?
A rust inhibitor.

444
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:26,195
See, the utility plants
use these piston engines
to compress the gas.

445
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,432
The engines get hot.
You've got to run water
through them.

446
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:30,600
Chromium's in the water
to prevent corrosion.

447
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:34,976
Well, how do I find out
what kind of chromium
they use in Hinkley?

448
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:36,981
Have you been
to their water board?
Uh-uh.

449
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,210
What's that?
Every county has one.
They keep records...

450
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,718
of anything water-related
within their jurisdiction.

451
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,721
You should be able
to find something there.

452
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:46,917
County water board?
All righty. Thanks.
Uh-huh.

00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:49,222
Good luck.

I wouldn't advertise
what you're looking for
if I were you.

455

have a way of disappearing

and I'd be glad
to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew.

472
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:06,592
It's for my boss.
He's in this water dispute,

473
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:11,631

to find all kinds of papers
from all kinds of places.

be easiest...

squeezed back there

An on-site monitoring well?

661
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,903
That means that...
It was right up on the PG&E
property over there.

662
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:11,642
And you say that this stuff,
this... hexavalent chromium...

663
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:13,683
[Sighs]
It's poisonous.

664
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,651
Yeah.

it's just got to be different
than what's in our water
'cause ours is okay.

668
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:29,932
The guys from PG&E told me.

669
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,266
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

670
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,170
I know, I know, but...

671
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:40,539
the toxicologist that
I've been talking to...

672
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,737
he gave me a list
of problems...

673
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:45,474
that can come
from hexavalent
chromium exposure.

674
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:49,041
Everything you all have
is on that list.

675
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,054
No, no, no.

676
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:55,582
No, that's not what...

677
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:58,093
That's not what
our doctor said.

678
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:01,358
He said that...
[Sighs]

679
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:03,729
Well, that one's
got absolutely nothing
to do with the other.

680
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,462
Right.

681
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:09,733

for that doctor.

PG&E's claim department...

693
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:58,086

we scared them,
don't you?

taking the trouble
to send someone.

they're sitting up

Mr. Foil?

In the interest of putting this
whole thing to rest,

701
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:36,416
PG&E is willing
to offer the Jensens
$250,000 for their home.

702
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,484
[Scoffs]
Two hundred and fifty thousand?

703
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:42,224
In terms of land value
out in Hinkley,

704
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:45,097
Mr. Masry, we feel that's
a more than fair price.

705
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:48,035
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

706
00:50:48,104 --> 00:50:50,129
Two hundred and fifty thousand
isn't gonna come close...

707
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:52,800
to what this family's gonna have
to spend on doctors.

708
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:57,603
I understand they've
had a bad run of luck
healthwise.

709
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:01,139
They have my sympathies,
but that's not PG&E's fault.

710
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:03,082
You're kidding,
right?

711
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,845
Look at these readings.

00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,624
in those wells
on numerous occasions.

715
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,964
Everything
the Jensens
have had...

716
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:22,232
is proven reaction
to exposure to hexavalent
chromium.

717
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:25,035
They have had...

718
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:27,076
They have had...

719
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,774
Breast cysts,
uterine cancer,

720
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:34,043
Hodgkin's disease,
immune deficiencies,

721
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:38,213
asthma, chronic nosebleeds...
A million things could have
caused those problems.

722
00:51:38,288 --> 00:51:42,725
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

723
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:44,851
Our offer is final,
and it's more than fair.

724
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:48,625
Wait a minute.
I thought we were
negotiating here.

725
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:55,799
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is all I'm authorized
to offer.

to my clients.

727

they'll accept.

it was that much!

they made an offer.
That wasn't an offer.

been an offer.

- Why would they do that?
- Because they can.

Hi.
[Tom]
We used to live across
the street from the Jensens.

761
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:07,059
I think you know Donna.
[Erin]
Yeah.

762
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:11,267
Uh, PG&E bought our house
last year.

763
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:15,903
[Tom]
The vets said they had
a bunch of tumors and stuff...

764
00:54:15,979 --> 00:54:20,609
and, you can see,
they couldn't really walk.

765
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:22,743
How many were born
like this?

766

Uh, 12 or 13
or so.
Yeah.

767
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:31,587
When Donna told us about you
and what you told her
about the chromium,

768
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:34,687
we figured
that might have something
to do with this too.

769
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:38,860
Yeah, it might.
May I keep these?
Yes.

770
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:42,268
Okay. Great.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

771
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:46,070
Um...
There's something else too.

772
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:51,645
What?
Um... this, uh...

773
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:56,311

775
00:54:58,388 --> 00:55:01,152
I'm so sorry.

776
00:55:01,224 --> 00:55:05,058
I figured it was
something I did...

777
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:08,063
like when I smoked
marijuana maybe...

778
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:10,725
or took
birth control pills.

779
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,568
But then Donna said
you thought chromium might be
to blame for her problems.

780
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,904
So I figured...

781
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:23,745
maybe it wasn't just me.

about this whole thing...

807
00:57:39,315 --> 00:57:41,806
I don't quite understand,
Mr. Masry.

808
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:44,512
If PG&E messed
with our water,

809
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:48,114
why would they bother
saying anything about it
to us at all?

810
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,249
Why not just
keep quiet about it?

811
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:52,692
To establish
a statute of limitations.

812
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:55,356
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

813
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:58,958
from the time you first learn
about the problem to file suit.

814
00:57:59,035 --> 00:58:01,435
So PG&E figures...

815
00:58:01,504 --> 00:58:05,634
we'll let the cat out
of the bag, tell the people
the water's not perfect,

816
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,700
and if we can ride out the year
with no one suing,

817
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:10,973
we'll be in the clear forever.

818
00:58:11,047 --> 00:58:13,481
But it was more than a year ago
that they told us.

819
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:16,712
It's okay.
We're not suing.
Not yet.

820
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:19,687
All we're doing is using
this information...

821
00:58:19,755 --> 00:58:23,816
to get you a real nice
purchase price
on your house...

822
00:58:23,893 --> 00:58:27,693
and, you two,
a comparable retroactive bonus
on your sale price.

823
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:30,698
That way,
PG&E can still look good
to their shareholders...

824
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,734
because they're not involved
in an ugly lawsuit.

825
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:35,168
All they're doing
is buying a little property.

826
00:58:35,237 --> 00:58:40,140
It... doesn't say here
how much this thing
is gonna cost us.

827
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:44,236
My fee is 40% of whatever
you get awarded.

828
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:56,348
Boy, do I know
how you feel.

829
00:58:56,425 --> 00:59:01,021
The first time
I heard that number, I said,
"You've got to be kidding me.

830
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:04,931
Forty goddamn percent?
I'm the one that's injured."
Erin...

831
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,198
"This joker sits at a desk,
and he wants to walk away
with almost half my reward?"

832
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:11,398
Erin, can l...
But then...

833
00:59:11,474 --> 00:59:14,034
I asked him...

834
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,874
what he makes
if I don't get anything.

835
00:59:16,946 --> 00:59:20,382
Then I don't
get anything either.

836
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:22,781
[Erin]
Plus he's out
all the costs.

837
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:27,289
So I realized...
he's taking a chance too.

838
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:38,525
You got a pen, honey?

839
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:45,039
Well, all right then.

840
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:50,002
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

841
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,047
Let me put on some coffee.
Who would like coffee and cake?

842
00:59:52,114 --> 00:59:55,277
I do.
Thanks, but we have
to be getting back.

cup of coffee, Ed.

844
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:01,556

All right.
I'll help you.

846

really good bundt cake.

847
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,203

[Water Hose Running]

849
01:00:16,438 --> 01:00:21,000
[Bob Linwood] Seems like
everybody in the family
ended up with a rash somehow.

850
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:25,240
It also seemed like no matter
what we did for it,
it always came back.

851
01:00:25,314 --> 01:00:28,215
Over what kind
of period of time?

852
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:30,877
Oh... a long time.
You know, years.

853
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:35,481
Never did keep track of it.
Kids are sick.
Animals need to be fed.

854
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:37,582
Just couldn't
get rid of it.
That's all.

855
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:41,186
[Erin]
Well, Mrs. De Soto said...

856
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,494
that she wasn't
exactly sure what you had.

857
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:47,160
We know what it is.
It's gastro...

858
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:49,466
Gastrointestinal cancer.
Cancer. Yeah.

859
01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:52,837
She got sick about...
nine months ago.
[Laura Ambrosino] Nine months ago.

860
01:00:52,908 --> 01:00:55,172
[Mike Ambrosino]
They operated on her
about six months ago.

Mm-hmm. The intestine.
Right.

862
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:11,992
Hi, I'm Erin...
I know who you are.
Donna called me.

863
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,052
Oh.
Can I come in?

864
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,896
I told Donna
we're not interested
in getting involved.

865
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,969
Can I ask why?

866
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:25,029
What's the point?

867
01:01:26,608 --> 01:01:30,339
Well, Donna told me
that you've been sick...

868
01:01:30,412 --> 01:01:34,041
and that your kids
were sick...
You people don't give a shit.

869
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:36,641
Anything to get what you want.

870
01:01:44,593 --> 01:01:48,029
[Erin]
It's good of you to have me in
when I just stopped by.

871
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:50,155
She's feeling
pretty good today.
She's doing well.

872
01:01:50,232 --> 01:01:55,067
Mike Ambrosino remembered he had
seen you folks at the hospital
from time to time.

873
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:57,071
That's what
brought me out here.

01:01:57,139 --> 01:01:59,835
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
Yeah.

875
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:02,536
We've been there
from time to time.
Yeah.

And you... Wooftie.
Aren't you a beauty?

don't you?

01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:12,785
[Chuckling]
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive them wild.

879
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,685
You do, don't you?

880
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:18,522
You torture them.
It's good for them.

881
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:22,461
Don't teach her anything
too early.
[Laughs]
Yeah.

882
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:26,023
She can't wait
to get on her new dress.
Isn't that right?

883
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:29,434
[Ted Daniels]
She wants to go back to school.
We're trying to do that...

884
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:33,372
in the next couple months.
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown.

885
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:38,311
[Ted Daniels]
She's gonna do it.
She's gonna do it.

886
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:58,994
Absolutely not.
That's crazy.
Why not?

887
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,161
Because I said no.
The only reason PG&E's
even talking to us...

888
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:05,001
is because
this is a quiet, little
real estate dispute.

889
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,839
We add plaintiffs,
suddenly we're in the middle
or a toxic tort...

890
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,845
with a statute problem
against a massive utility.

891
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,074
No, thank you.
Okay.

892
01:03:14,149 --> 01:03:16,674
So I'll go
to Ted and Rita Daniels...

you could ever hope to meet...

894
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:22,352
who every single day watch
their little girl, Annabelle,
fight like a dog against cancer,

895
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,689
and I'll tell them
we can't help them because...

896
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:27,695
you just don't want
to work that hard.

897
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:33,258
Work hard?
Let me tell you something.
I've worked all my life.

898
01:03:33,335 --> 01:03:35,565
I've built a firm
and managed to keep it alive...

899
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:37,764
through lawsuits,
injunctions and evictions.

900
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,865
I've survived
a quadruple bypass, cancer,

901
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,706
being born with one kidney
and having diabetes.

902
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,873
I've personally managed
to save a million dollars...

903
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,610
over 30 years of getting
some clients ten times that.

904
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:51,879
Don't tell me
I don't work hard.

905
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:55,719
Don't tell me I haven't
earned the right to stop,
take a breath and enjoy life.

906
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:58,487
And what the hell do you know
about any of this anyway?

907
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,893
Something like this, Erin...
It could take forever.

908
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,897
They're a huge corporation.

909
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,559
They could bury us in paperwork
for the next 15 years.

910
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,865
I'm just a guy
with a small, private firm!

911
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:13,169

they poisoned people
and lied about it.

912
01:04:13,241 --> 01:04:15,232
We can get these people.

913
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:19,576
With a little effort,
I really think we can just
nail their asses to the wall.

914
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,912
You do? With all
your legal expertise,
you believe that?

915
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,918
Don't you ever just know?
You also "just know" where
the money's coming from?

916
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,920
That's why most
of these cases settle:
Lack of money.

what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

at 100 grand a month, easy.

a huge dent in my savings.

are we talking about?

to back this up,

Remind me of that when
I'm filing for bankruptcy.

938
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:46,693
Of course,
gathering evidence is a big job.

939
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:49,362
A hell of a lot bigger
than just filing.

940
01:05:49,437 --> 01:05:54,966
I'll be working a lot harder,
taking on more responsibility.
I don't believe this.

Another raise wouldn't hurt.
And I'm gonna be spending
a lot of time in my car,

one of those cell phones.

Hey, Scott,
tell me something.

Does PG&E pay you
to cover their ass...

or do you just do it
out of the kindness
of your heart?

I don't know
what you're talking about.

one word about it.

a pretty big event around here.

We're all
sitting around at lunch,

1002
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:50,167

and said:

01:10:50,237 --> 01:10:52,831
"Ball."

say out of their life,

her little finger...

01:11:12,259 --> 01:11:17,356
with her beautiful,
soft, chubby, little arm
and her little cheeks.

1009
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:20,525
She was looking at it like
she had been looking at it
for nine months...

get it out, but

how the plant works,

just everything, so...

1066

They use the hexachrome here,
in these cooling towers,

01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:46,865
as an anticorrosive.

the excess water
into these ponds.

any ponds out there.

this...

1077

in most cases, you
would line these ponds...

1078
01:15:16,636 --> 01:15:19,230
so this shit didn't
seep into the ground.

to share some of the cost.

"No, we don't have it."

to get rich...

on PG&E corporate
in San Francisco.

1104
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:51,194
What do you mean?
PG&E corporate
is claiming...

1105
01:16:51,263 --> 01:16:53,356
they had no way of knowing
what was going on
in Hinkley.

1106
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:57,630
- Oh, they knew.
- Show me the document
that proves it.

1107
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:04,865
Then they didn't know.
If they didn't know, we can't
hit them with punitive damages.

1108
01:17:04,944 --> 01:17:07,208
With punitive damages, we're
talking about a sum of money...

1109
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:09,839
that can actually
have some effect...

1110
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:13,214
on these
people's lives.

1111
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:15,310
So what do we do now?

1112
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:24,221
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG&E Hinkley
with PG&E corporate,

1113
01:17:24,296 --> 01:17:26,321
and they know
these documents exist.

1114
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,359
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up,

1115
01:17:31,437 --> 01:17:33,905
we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction,

1116
01:17:33,973 --> 01:17:38,273
to see if they offer
a reasonable settlement
or just throw more paper at us.

1117
01:17:38,344 --> 01:17:41,780
That sounds great.
Let's do that.
There's a downside.

1118
01:17:41,847 --> 01:17:45,180
PG&E will submit a demurrer,

1119
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:48,015
a list of reasons
attacking each complaint,

1120
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:51,181
claiming that each
cause of action has no merit.

1121
01:17:51,257 --> 01:17:54,852
If the judge agrees with them,
he'll dismiss our case.

1122
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:57,054
PG&E will have
no reason to settle,

1123
01:17:57,129 --> 01:18:00,189
and it's all over.

1124
01:18:04,437 --> 01:18:08,032
[Scoffs]
So, basically,
it all comes down...

1125
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:11,372
to what this
one judge decides.

1126
01:18:11,444 --> 01:18:14,140

come up benign...

I guess I just
didn't expect it.

to get used to the idea.

[Judge]
All right, I have before me...

1143
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:12,261
a complaint
on behalf of the residents
of Hinkley, California,

1144
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,822
who have filed this lawsuit
against Pacific Gas
and Electric...

1145
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:19,837
for damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1146
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:22,203
due to contamination
of the groundwater...

1147
01:20:22,274 --> 01:20:24,765
in their area
by the defendant.

1148
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:27,835
And I have here
84 motions to strike...

1149
01:20:27,913 --> 01:20:31,212
and demurrers
submitted by representatives
of Pacific Gas and Electric,

of this complaint.

1151
01:20:36,388 --> 01:20:40,518
I have reviewed
all of the information
carefully.

1152

I'm ready to give my decision.

1153
01:20:43,095 --> 01:20:46,326
Before I do, is there anything
anyone wants to say?

- No, Your Honor.
- No, Your Honor.

1155

Very well.

1156

In the matter of the plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California,

1157
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:58,509
versus Pacific Gas and Electric,
it is the order of this court...

1158
01:20:58,577 --> 01:21:04,345
that each of the 84 motions
to strike and demurrers
are denied...

1159
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:09,718
and the causes of action
against Pacific Gas and Electric
are upheld.

1160
01:21:09,788 --> 01:21:12,086
On a more personal note,

as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley,

1162

I am disturbed
by reference to evidence...

1163
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:24,527
that suggests that not only
was hexavalent chromium used...

1164
01:21:24,603 --> 01:21:28,198
but that your clients
actually sent these residents...

1165

that it was good for them.

Counselors.

1173
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:22,917
Let's be honest here.

1174
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:26,953
$20 million is more money
than these people
have ever dreamed of.

1175

See, now that
pisses me off.

1176
01:22:30,068 --> 01:22:34,198
First of all,
since the demurrer, we have
more than 400 plaintiffs,

1177
01:22:34,272 --> 01:22:37,264
and, let's be honest,
we all know there
are more out there.

1178

They may not be
the most sophisticated people,
but they do know how to divide.

1179
01:22:40,812 --> 01:22:43,178
$20 million isn't shit
when you split it between them.

[Erin]
Second of all,

1181
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:47,310
these people don't dream
about being rich.

1182
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:50,821
They dream about being able
to watch their kids
swim in a pool...

1183
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:54,188
without worrying they'll
have to have a hysterectomy
at the age of 20...

1184
01:22:54,259 --> 01:22:56,193

a client of ours.

Or have their spine
deteriorate like Stan Bloom,
another client of ours.

1186
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:04,829
So before you come back here
with another lame-ass offer,

1187
01:23:04,903 --> 01:23:09,272
I want you to think
real hard about what your
spine is worth, Mr. Walker.

1188
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,833
Or what you might expect someone
to pay you for your uterus,
Ms. Sanchez.

Then you take out
your calculator,

1190

and you multiply
that number by a hundred.

1191
01:23:17,382 --> 01:23:20,681
Anything less than that
is a waste of our time.

brought in special
for you folks.

in a mall one day.

I said, "Damn...
those would look good
on those beautiful ears."

nice or says something nice...

out there who don't mind

01:31:46,824 --> 01:31:50,487
- Make a point.
- It was Kurt Potter.

1294
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:52,495
When we got the PG&E decision
from the judge,

1295
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:54,656
I called him
and asked him to partner.

1296
01:31:54,732 --> 01:31:57,826
- He didn't hesitate.
- He wouldn't hesitate now.

1297
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:00,233
We did all the fucking work!
Where was he before?

1298
01:32:00,304 --> 01:32:03,330
It doesn't matter.
Erin, will you listen to me?

1299
01:32:03,407 --> 01:32:05,671
You want to win this?
He just gave me this check.

1300
01:32:05,743 --> 01:32:08,507
It covers all
our expenses to date,

1301
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:12,015
and he's got more
toxic tort experience
than anyone in the state.

1302
01:32:12,082 --> 01:32:14,676
This is good news.

1303
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:19,589
By the way,
I got Pamela Duncan.

1304
01:32:19,656 --> 01:32:21,590
Hey.

1305
01:32:31,803 --> 01:32:34,670
I'll open, Mommy.

1306
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:38,140
You want to open
the can for Mommy?
Here, I'll help you.

1307
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:40,473
Can you turn it?

1308

[Motorcycle Revving]
[Gasps]
Hi, George.

1309
01:32:43,047 --> 01:32:45,015
Hi, George.
Let's go see.

1310

Let's go see.

[Motorcycle Departing]

1313
01:33:11,108 --> 01:33:13,668
- Erin Brockovich?
- Yeah.

1314
01:33:13,744 --> 01:33:16,008
Package
from Masry & Vititoe.

1315
01:33:25,756 --> 01:33:29,021
Thank you.
Thank you.

1316
01:33:31,963 --> 01:33:33,897
What's in here?
Baby.

1317
01:33:33,965 --> 01:33:38,868
There's no baby in here.
What is it?
A dolly.

1318
01:33:38,936 --> 01:33:41,200
It's a dolly?
It's...

1319
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:55,947
Look.

1320
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,954
Look.

1321
01:33:58,022 --> 01:34:00,855
"Look" is right.

1322
01:34:00,925 --> 01:34:03,894
[Gasps]

1323
01:34:07,798 --> 01:34:09,891
Do you see that?
Do you see that?

1324
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:16,231
I want that.
I want that too.

1325
01:34:16,307 --> 01:34:19,401
It's our lucky day.
Matthew! Katie!

1326
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:33,883
PG&E has requested
that we submit
to binding arbitration.

1327
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,858
What's that?

1328
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:40,523
That's where we try
the case without a jury,
just before a judge.

1329
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:42,532
It's called
a test trial.

1330
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,865
The judge’s decision is final.
There is no appeal.

1331
01:34:45,937 --> 01:34:48,235
How many plaintiffs
do you have?

1332
01:34:48,306 --> 01:34:50,297
Six hundred
and thirty-four.

1333
01:34:50,374 --> 01:34:53,366
They'll never try
that many all at once.

1334
01:34:53,444 --> 01:34:57,210
So we need to get them
together in groups
of 20 or 30;

1335
01:34:57,281 --> 01:35:00,580
worst cases, the most
life-threatened, the sickest
in the first group.

1336
01:35:00,651 --> 01:35:02,585
And so on
and so on.

1337
01:35:02,653 --> 01:35:06,020
Each one gets a go
before the judge
to determine damages.

1338
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,388
PG&E has proposed that
they're liable...

1339
01:35:08,459 --> 01:35:12,395
anywhere between 50
and 400 million.

1340
01:35:12,463 --> 01:35:16,695
So... Wait a minute.
Let me just get this straight...

1341
01:35:16,767 --> 01:35:20,225
If we went to trial,
PG&E could stretch this
over ten years...

1342
01:35:20,304 --> 01:35:22,363
with appeal
after appeal.

1343
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,432
Those people
in Hinkley...
These people
are expecting a trial.

1344
01:35:25,509 --> 01:35:27,374
That's what
we told them.

1345
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:30,073
They won't understand this.

1346
01:35:31,816 --> 01:35:34,785
Kurt thinks it's
the best way to go.

1347
01:35:43,094 --> 01:35:48,691
[Kurt]
I promise you that we'll be
very sensitive on this point.

1348
01:35:48,766 --> 01:35:54,534
We will make sure that they
understand this is the only way
we can go forward at this time.

1349
01:35:54,605 --> 01:35:57,699
But we have a lot
of work to do...

1350
01:35:57,775 --> 01:36:01,336
before we even broach
that subject.

1351
01:36:02,446 --> 01:36:04,380
Why don't I take Erin
down the hall,

1352
01:36:04,448 --> 01:36:07,975
so we can start on this stuff,
and I'll fill her in on the rest
of the details.

1353
01:36:08,052 --> 01:36:11,146
[Kurt]
Thanks.
Those are my files.

1354
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:13,713
Yeah, we had them
couriered over.

1355
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:16,385
Listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1356
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:20,396
We're just going to have to
spend a little time filling in
the holes in your research.

1357
01:36:20,464 --> 01:36:23,058
Excuse me.
Theresa, is it?

1358
01:36:23,134 --> 01:36:25,432
There are no holes
in my research.

1359
01:36:25,503 --> 01:36:29,269
No offense. There are just
some things we need that you
probably didn't know to ask.

1360
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,740
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot, okay?

1361
01:36:31,809 --> 01:36:34,505
I may not have a law degree,
but I've spent 18 months
on this case,

1362
01:36:34,578 --> 01:36:38,014
and I know more about these
plaintiffs than you ever will.

1363
01:36:38,082 --> 01:36:41,609
Erin, you don't even have
phone numbers for some of them.

1364
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:44,018
Whose number do you need?
[Theresa]
Everyone's.

1365
01:36:44,088 --> 01:36:46,852
This is a lawsuit.
We need to be able
to contact the plaintiffs.

1366
01:36:46,924 --> 01:36:49,324
I said,
"Whose number do you need?"

1367
01:36:49,393 --> 01:36:53,090
You don't know 600 plaintiffs'
numbers by heart.

1368
01:37:07,445 --> 01:37:13,350
- Annabelle Daniels.
- 714-454-9346.

1369
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:15,942
Ten years old, eleven in May.
Lived on the plume since birth.

1370
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:17,954
Wanted to be
a synchronized swimmer,

1371
01:37:18,022 --> 01:37:21,651
so she spent every minute
she could in the PG&E pool.

1372
01:37:21,726 --> 01:37:23,887
She had a tumor
on her brain stem
detected last November,

1373
01:37:23,961 --> 01:37:27,158
an operation on Thanksgiving,
shrunk it with radiation
after that.

1374
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:30,200
Her parents are Ted and Rita.
Ted's got Crohn's disease.

1375
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:34,328
Rita has chronic headaches
and nausea and underwent
a hysterectomy last fall.

1376
01:37:34,405 --> 01:37:37,169
Ted grew up in Hinkley.
His brother Robbie
and his wife May...

1377
01:37:37,241 --> 01:37:40,677
and their five children...
Robbie, Jr., Martha, Ed,
Rose and Peter...

1378
01:37:40,745 --> 01:37:42,872
also lived
on the plume.

1379
01:37:42,947 --> 01:37:47,384
Their number is 454-9554.
You want their diseases?

1380
01:37:51,822 --> 01:37:54,985
Okay, look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

1381
01:37:55,059 --> 01:37:59,052
That's all you got, lady:
Two wrong feet
and fucking ugly shoes.

1382
01:38:04,668 --> 01:38:06,602
[Erin]
She insulted me.

1383
01:38:06,670 --> 01:38:08,695
Bullshit. It was
a misunderstanding.

1384
01:38:08,773 --> 01:38:12,038
Instead of handling it
politely, instead of
treating her with respect,

1385
01:38:12,109 --> 01:38:14,043
you insult her.
Why the fuck
should I respect her?

1386
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:16,045
Just because she's not
supporting three kids...

1387
01:38:16,113 --> 01:38:18,377
with no husband
and no education,
doesn't make her an idiot.

1388
01:38:18,449 --> 01:38:20,542
Just because
she dresses like a lawyer,

1389
01:38:20,618 --> 01:38:22,711
doesn't mean she didn't
work her ass off...

1390
01:38:22,787 --> 01:38:24,880
in law school
and shit positions
to earn her way.

1391
01:38:24,955 --> 01:38:27,014
Excuse me
for not going to law school.

1392
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:30,720

when the symptoms began...

prior to the first
medical visit.

1405
01:39:24,247 --> 01:39:29,207
If you could reserve
sentimental embellishments,
I'd appreciate it.

1406

in court.
All right.

1407
01:39:32,088 --> 01:39:35,353

dates... time.

1408
01:39:35,425 --> 01:39:39,623

isn't real warm, but they say
she's a good lawyer.

1409
01:39:39,696 --> 01:39:42,324
[Ted]
She's asking the same
questions you asked.

1410
01:39:42,398 --> 01:39:45,492
I already told you everything.
I don't want her coming
to the house again.

1411
01:39:45,568 --> 01:39:48,662
She's kind of stuck-up,
and she upsets Annabelle.

If you don't like Theresa,
that's okay.

Annabelle is to me.

for you.

and he still hasn't
called me back.

but... everyone's pretty upset
about this arbitration thing.

What?

1418

in the Hinkley news...

1419

telling everybody
to get new lawyers,
that we've been lied to.

Is it true?
No.

I promise.
We're trusting you here.

I'll talk to you soon, okay?
All right. Bye-bye.

1426
01:40:36,419 --> 01:40:39,149
Ed, I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1427
01:40:39,222 --> 01:40:42,316
If it wasn't a strong case,
every demurrer wouldn't
have been dismissed.

1428
01:40:42,392 --> 01:40:46,192
I wouldn't be here.
What I am saying
is we still don't have...

1429

San Francisco to Hinkley;

1430

that prior to 1987...

the water was bad in Hinkley

you were taking a sick day.

in there?

about the PG&E thing.

Yep.

or we don't have a big win.

for a moment?

01:41:35,445 --> 01:41:38,642
You told me you weren't feeling
great. I wanted you to rest.
You know, that is bullshit.

1442

If I was on my deathbed,

1443
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,644

you'd drag me out of it!

How could you
take this away from me?

1445
01:41:49,892 --> 01:41:53,828
Nobody's taking anything.
Bullshit!
You stuck me in Siberia...

goddamn steno clerk...

1447

so you could
finish this without me!

Do I have your attention now?
They admit it.

The arbitration proposal
they sent might as well have
been written in Sanskrit...

1450
01:42:07,643 --> 01:42:09,668
for all the sense it made
to the people in Hinkley.

1451
01:42:09,746 --> 01:42:14,274
I know. L-I spoke to Ted.
Pamela Duncan wouldn't even
get on the phone with me!

1452
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:17,183
Pamela's got everybody
seeing red with that letter
she wrote to the press.

1453
01:42:17,253 --> 01:42:19,187
She called us thieves.
They're all listening
to her.

1454
01:42:19,255 --> 01:42:21,519
The whole thing
is about to fall apart!
Why? Why?

1455
01:42:21,591 --> 01:42:23,684
Before we even go
to arbitration,

1456
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,694
we have to get
the plaintiffs to agree.
How many?

1457
01:42:25,762 --> 01:42:28,526
Usually they're required
to get about 70%.

1458
01:42:28,598 --> 01:42:32,534
PG&E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1459
01:42:32,602 --> 01:42:34,797
Now do you understand?
This is serious.

1460
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:37,362
And what?
I'm not serious?

1461
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,635
You're emotional.
You're erratic.

1462
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:41,643
You say any goddamn thing
that comes into your head.

1463
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:44,976
You make this personal
and it isn't.
Not personal?

1464
01:42:45,048 --> 01:42:48,984
That is my work, my sweat,
my time away from my kids!

1465
01:42:49,052 --> 01:42:52,146
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is!

1466
01:42:52,221 --> 01:42:56,885
[Coughing]

1467
01:42:56,959 --> 01:43:01,828
Come on.
Come on.

1468
01:43:01,898 --> 01:43:04,662
Go home.
Get well.

1469
01:43:04,734 --> 01:43:07,669
You're no good
to me sick.

1470
01:43:07,737 --> 01:43:10,331
I need you,
all right?

1471
01:43:10,406 --> 01:43:13,341
This case needs you.

1472
01:43:15,244 --> 01:43:17,906
Did you tell them that?

1473
01:43:42,271 --> 01:43:46,207
Binding arbitration
isn't all that different
from a trial.

1474
01:43:46,275 --> 01:43:50,371
It's overseen by a judge,
evidence is presented
in much the same way.

1475
01:43:50,446 --> 01:43:52,505
[Man]
And then a jury decides?
[Coughs]

1476
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:55,049
Oh, no. Sorry I forgot
to mention that.

1477
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:58,280
There's no jury
in binding arbitration.
[Crowd Murmuring Loudly]

1478
01:43:58,354 --> 01:44:01,585
- No jury and no appeal.
- [Crowd Continues Murmuring]

1479
01:44:01,657 --> 01:44:04,683
What option do we have
if we don't like the result?

1480
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,955
You have none.
The judge's decision is final.

1481
01:44:07,029 --> 01:44:10,465
Not a good answer.
[Ed] We don't anticipate
that being a problem.

1482
01:44:10,532 --> 01:44:13,057
As I already told you,

1483
01:44:13,135 --> 01:44:17,196
it's definitely between
$50 and $400 million.

1484
01:44:17,272 --> 01:44:19,763
Well, which?
There's a big
difference there.

1485
01:44:19,842 --> 01:44:21,969
I wouldn't like
to speculate at this point.

1486
01:44:22,044 --> 01:44:25,445
[Tom Mumbling]
Well, how does it
get divided?

1487
01:44:25,514 --> 01:44:28,915
- Yeah. Who gets what?
- [Crowd Chattering]

1488
01:44:28,984 --> 01:44:34,718
My medical bills
started two years ago, before
some of the other people here.

1489
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:38,157
My daughter has been in and out
of hospitals more than his.

1490
01:44:38,227 --> 01:44:40,695
It shouldn't matter
when it started.
[Crowd Agreeing]

1491
01:44:40,763 --> 01:44:44,756
Just a minute, please.
People, listen, please!

1492
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:47,301
The point we have
to address tonight...

1493
01:44:47,369 --> 01:44:51,601
is getting everyone
to agree that going
binding arbitration...

1494
01:44:51,673 --> 01:44:55,837
is preferable to a trial
that could go on for ten years
before you see any money.

1495
01:44:55,911 --> 01:45:00,075
Maybe some of us want
to wait ten years.

1496
01:45:00,149 --> 01:45:03,482
[Crowd Chattering]

1497
01:45:03,552 --> 01:45:07,079
Everyone has to agree
or no one has a chance.

1498
01:45:07,156 --> 01:45:10,455
Those of you about to leave,
I'd like you to keep
this date in mind:

1499
01:45:10,526 --> 01:45:12,721
1978.

1500
01:45:12,795 --> 01:45:16,060
That's the year
of the Love Canal controversy,

1501
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:18,656
and those people are still
waiting for their money.

1502
01:45:18,734 --> 01:45:23,433
Think about where you'll be
in 15 or 20 years. Huh?

1503
01:45:23,505 --> 01:45:27,703
[Crowd Murmuring]

1504
01:45:27,776 --> 01:45:32,338
Look, everyone,
is this a big decision?

1505
01:45:32,414 --> 01:45:37,681
Absolutely.
But I do not believe
this is a sellout.

1506
01:45:37,753 --> 01:45:40,950
This is the best shot
at getting everyone
some money now!

1507
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:45,621
You and I both know...

1508
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:49,790
there are people in this room
who can't afford to wait...

1509
01:45:49,865 --> 01:45:52,299
to take that chance.

1510
01:45:52,367 --> 01:45:56,098
Are you gonna make them wait?

1511
01:46:02,144 --> 01:46:05,375
So how many
altogether?
[Sighs]

1512
01:46:05,447 --> 01:46:08,382
We got just about everybody
that came here tonight,

1513
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:11,214
but that still leaves us
about 150 short.

1514
01:46:11,286 --> 01:46:13,379
Oh, shit.

1515
01:46:13,455 --> 01:46:16,549
[Clears Throat]
We'll have to go
door-to-door.

1516
01:46:18,961 --> 01:46:21,395
I gotta go
pick up my kids.

1517
01:46:25,134 --> 01:46:28,399
You need a hand
with that?
No, I got it.

1518
01:46:30,672 --> 01:46:34,972
Hey... you did good.

1519
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,245
We'll see.

1520
01:46:38,313 --> 01:46:40,679
Yeah.

1521
01:47:08,277 --> 01:47:10,541
Hey.
Hey.

1522
01:47:12,781 --> 01:47:14,874
Thanks for coming.

1523
01:47:16,118 --> 01:47:19,053
[Sighs]

1524
01:47:19,121 --> 01:47:21,214
Don't take them anywhere
on your bike, okay?

1525
01:47:21,290 --> 01:47:23,724
I'll give you some money
for a cab if you want
to go somewhere.

1526
01:47:23,792 --> 01:47:26,226
[Chuckles]
I got money.

1527
01:47:26,295 --> 01:47:29,731
So how long
is this gonna take?

1528
01:47:29,798 --> 01:47:33,234
Uh... I don't know.
A few days.

1529
01:47:34,736 --> 01:47:37,000
You got your own room.

1530
01:47:48,417 --> 01:47:51,045
I am really sorry, George.

1531
01:47:52,588 --> 01:47:54,579
Have the kids eaten?

1532
01:47:57,759 --> 01:47:59,693
No.

1533
01:48:20,449 --> 01:48:24,078
(sing)(music) I've wept for those
who suffer long (music)

1534
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:29,049
(sing)(music) But how I weep
for those who've gone (music)

1535
01:48:30,392 --> 01:48:35,193
(sing)(music) Into rooms of grief
and questioned wrong (music)

1536
01:48:35,264 --> 01:48:37,824
(sing)(music) But keep on killing (music)

1537
01:48:40,902 --> 01:48:44,838
(sing)(music) It's in the soul
to feel such things (music)

1538
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:50,808
(sing)(music) But weak to watch
without speaking (music)

1539
01:48:50,879 --> 01:48:55,213
(sing)(music) Oh, what mercy
sadness brings (music)

1540
01:48:55,284 --> 01:48:58,219
(sing)(music) If God be willing (music)

1541
01:49:06,828 --> 01:49:11,356
[George]
You want to get some pancakes?
Let's go. Everybody, up.

1542
01:49:11,433 --> 01:49:13,435
Everybody, up today.
All right.

1543
01:49:13,435 --> 01:49:15,403
Everybody, up today.
All right.

1544
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:17,870
Let's get some pancakes.
[Erin]
What time is it?

1545
01:49:17,939 --> 01:49:21,875
It's early.
I'm gonna take your car
and get some breakfast.

1546
01:49:21,943 --> 01:49:25,242
Mm-hmm.
No, I need my car.

1547
01:49:25,314 --> 01:49:27,714
We'll be back in a minute.

1548
01:49:27,783 --> 01:49:30,547
Okay.
Get some sleep.

1549
01:49:30,619 --> 01:49:33,554
Hey, Matt, buddy.
Let's go.
What?

1550
01:49:33,622 --> 01:49:36,648
Put it down.
Let's go.
I'll be there in a minute.

1551
01:49:38,393 --> 01:49:41,658
Let's go get some
pancakes, girlie.
Come on.

1552
01:49:50,806 --> 01:49:52,831
Baby, don't play with that.

1553
01:49:52,908 --> 01:49:55,638
It took me so long
to get it organized.
Will you put that back?

1554
01:49:55,711 --> 01:49:59,147
Please?
This girl is
the same age as me.

1555
01:50:04,419 --> 01:50:07,855
She's one of the sick people?

1556
01:50:07,923 --> 01:50:12,360
Uh... she is, but...
that's why I'm helping her.

1557
01:50:12,427 --> 01:50:14,759
We'll get her some medicine
and make her feel better.

1558
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:17,390
Why can't her own mama
help her?

1559
01:50:20,435 --> 01:50:22,562
Because her own mom
is real sick too.

1560
01:50:28,877 --> 01:50:31,471
[Sighs]

1561
01:50:36,218 --> 01:50:39,244
I'll bring you back
some breakfast.

1562
01:50:39,321 --> 01:50:41,846
You want eggs?

1563
01:50:43,892 --> 01:50:45,985
Eggs would be great.

1564
01:50:48,864 --> 01:50:51,162
[Door Closes]

01:50:51,233 --> 01:50:53,827
[Chuckles Softly]

1566
01:50:53,902 --> 01:50:56,666
Eggs would be perfect.

1567
01:52:07,008 --> 01:52:09,841
Hey, Matt.
Hey, Erin,
how are you?

1568
01:52:09,911 --> 01:52:12,778
That's good.

1569
01:52:12,848 --> 01:52:15,749
So, been at this
all day?
Yeah.

1570
01:52:15,817 --> 01:52:18,012
You look tired.
You want some coffee?
I'd love some.

1571
01:52:18,086 --> 01:52:20,987
I'll make
a fresh pot.
Thanks.

1572
01:52:34,102 --> 01:52:37,435
[Men Laughing]

1573
01:52:45,847 --> 01:52:50,341
Hey,
don't I know you?
I don't think so.

1574
01:52:50,418 --> 01:52:53,478
Sure, you were
at the barbecue
in Hinkley...

1575
01:52:53,555 --> 01:52:56,149
and at the town meeting.
Hmm.

1576
01:52:56,224 --> 01:52:58,715
I was watching you.

1577
01:53:00,195 --> 01:53:02,789
I had my eye on you.

1578
01:53:04,366 --> 01:53:07,802
How nice.
Sure, you were talking
to everybody...

1579
01:53:07,869 --> 01:53:10,201
and writing down
a lot of stuff.

1580
01:53:10,272 --> 01:53:12,968
When I saw you,
I said to myself,

1581
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:16,010
"There's something
about her.

1582
01:53:16,077 --> 01:53:18,637
I really like
that girl."

1583
01:53:20,448 --> 01:53:23,417
Matt, can I get that coffee
to go?
Sure thing.

1584
01:53:26,855 --> 01:53:30,416
I feel like I can talk
to you too.

1585
01:53:30,492 --> 01:53:34,223
Like you're the type
of person I could
say anything to.

1586
01:53:35,997 --> 01:53:38,056
Here you go.
Great.
What do I owe you?

1587
01:53:38,133 --> 01:53:41,591
There's no charge.
Thanks, Matt.

1588
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:44,662
Well,
nice talking to you.

1589
01:53:44,739 --> 01:53:47,333
Would it be important to you
if I told you that when I worked
at the Hinkley plant,

1590
01:53:47,409 --> 01:53:49,343
I destroyed documents?

1591
01:53:55,216 --> 01:53:58,515
Maybe.
[Sets Down Keys, Purse]

1592
01:53:58,586 --> 01:54:02,579
What did you say
your name was?
Charles Embry.

1593
01:54:02,657 --> 01:54:06,423
Charles, Erin.
Nice to meet you.

01:54:06,494 --> 01:54:08,792
[Sighs]

1595
01:54:08,863 --> 01:54:11,127
Can you excuse me
for just a quick...

1596
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:13,133
Sure.
I'm just gonna run
to the...

1597

[Panting]

1598
01:54:26,314 --> 01:54:28,373
[Phone Beeping]
Oh, come on.

1599
01:54:29,951 --> 01:54:34,285
[Phone Beeping]
Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1600
01:54:34,356 --> 01:54:37,018
Fuck! Oh.

1601
01:54:47,969 --> 01:54:52,372
[Phone Rings]

1602
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:55,102
Yeah?
[Erin]
Ed. Ed, oh, my God.

1603
01:54:55,176 --> 01:54:58,805
This guy Charles
said that he destroyed records.
He worked at Hinkley.

1604
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,782
Slow down, slow down.
I'm trying to relax
and this guy tells me...

1605
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:04,785
Who? Who?
Charles Embry.

1606
01:55:04,853 --> 01:55:07,913
First I thought he was trying
to kill me, but then I thought
he was trying to pick me up.

1607
01:55:07,989 --> 01:55:10,480
Maybe he is, but why would
he say that? Why would he
use that as his line?

1608
01:55:10,558 --> 01:55:14,324
It's crazy.
[Stammering]
Shit.

1609
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:18,264
Now go back and see
if he'll make a declaration.

1610
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:21,962
A declaration.
Yeah, but be careful.
Don't scare him off.

1611
01:55:22,037 --> 01:55:24,665
Now stay calm, stay calm.

1612
01:55:24,739 --> 01:55:28,607
Remember, if it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs now.

1613
01:55:28,676 --> 01:55:31,270
You're good at talking
people into things.

1614
01:55:31,346 --> 01:55:34,179
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that.

1615
01:55:34,249 --> 01:55:36,615
Just... Just let...

1616
01:55:36,684 --> 01:55:40,484
People want to tell their story.
Just let him talk.

1617
01:55:40,555 --> 01:55:43,456
Let him do all
the talking, all right?
Okay.

1618
01:55:43,525 --> 01:55:47,825
[Erin Approaches,
Sighs, Puts Down Purse]

1619
01:55:47,896 --> 01:55:51,525
Sorry.
[Clears Throat]

1620
01:55:54,102 --> 01:55:57,196
Would you like another beer
or...

1621
01:56:01,876 --> 01:56:07,473
My cousin passed away
yesterday.

1622
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:13,646
He had kidney tumors,
no colon.

1623
01:56:13,721 --> 01:56:16,315
His intestines
were eaten away.

1624
01:56:16,391 --> 01:56:19,019
Forty-one years old.

1625
01:56:19,094 --> 01:56:21,153
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1626
01:56:21,229 --> 01:56:25,165
He's be cleaning
the cooling towers,
wearing one of those...

1627
01:56:25,233 --> 01:56:28,168
What do you
call them?
Mask?

1628
01:56:28,236 --> 01:56:30,602
Yeah, yeah.
Doctors' masks.

1629
01:56:30,672 --> 01:56:34,836
They'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1630
01:56:47,522 --> 01:56:50,514
I was working
in the compressor.

1631
01:56:50,592 --> 01:56:53,186
Out of nowhere,
the supervisor calls me up
to the office...

1632
01:56:53,261 --> 01:56:56,355
and says,
"I'm gonna give you
a shredder machine...

1633
01:56:56,431 --> 01:57:00,458
and send you on down
to the warehouse to get rid
of the documents stored there."

1634
01:57:02,437 --> 01:57:04,371
Did he say why?

1635
01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:08,341
Nope...
and I didn't ask.

1636
01:57:11,713 --> 01:57:14,978
Did you get a look
at the stuff you destroyed?

1637
01:57:15,049 --> 01:57:17,882
A lot of dull stuff.
Vacation schedules
and the like.

1638
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:20,987
But then there were
a few memos...

1639
01:57:21,055 --> 01:57:23,148
about the holding ponds,
the water in them...

1640
01:57:23,224 --> 01:57:25,988
and readings
from the test wells.

1641
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:28,028
Stuff like that.

1642
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:35,859
You were told
to destroy those?
That's right.

1643
01:57:37,906 --> 01:57:43,469
Of course, as it turns out,
I wasn't a very good employee.

1644
01:57:51,753 --> 01:57:52,854
[Chuckles]

1645
01:57:52,854 --> 01:57:53,684
[Chuckles]

1646
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:01,585
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.

1647
01:58:01,663 --> 01:58:04,291
Ed, Erin,
what's this?

1648
01:58:04,365 --> 01:58:07,129
May I?
[Ed]
Definitely. Go ahead.

1649
01:58:07,202 --> 01:58:10,467
[Erin Sighs]
Well... you know what,
Mr. Potter?

1650
01:58:10,538 --> 01:58:12,802
We completely forgot
your birthday this year,

1651
01:58:12,874 --> 01:58:17,641
and seeing as how
you've been so good to me,
it seemed a terrible oversight.

1652
01:58:17,712 --> 01:58:19,646
So what Ed and I
have been doing
the last few days...

1653
01:58:19,714 --> 01:58:21,944
is putting together
a present for you.

1654
01:58:22,016 --> 01:58:24,143
Six hundred
and thirty-four.

1655
01:58:24,219 --> 01:58:26,187
They're all signed.
Every single one.

1656
01:58:26,254 --> 01:58:30,054
Holy shit.
Now, don't go
getting jealous, Theresa.

1657
01:58:30,124 --> 01:58:33,218
She's getting jealous.
We have something
for you too.

1658
01:58:33,294 --> 01:58:36,991
Internal PG&E documents
all about the contamination.

1659
01:58:37,065 --> 01:58:38,999
The one
that I like best says...

1660
01:58:39,067 --> 01:58:43,026
I'm paraphrasing,
but it says: Yes,
the water's poisonous,

1661
01:58:43,104 --> 01:58:45,038
but it would be better
for all involved...

1662
01:58:45,106 --> 01:58:48,166
if this matter was not discussed
with the neighbors.

1663
01:58:48,243 --> 01:58:50,177
It's to the Hinkley station
from PG&E headquarters,

1664
01:58:50,245 --> 01:58:52,645
stamped,
"Received March 1966."

1665
01:58:52,714 --> 01:58:56,514
[Stammering]

1666
01:58:56,584 --> 01:58:58,609
H-How did you do this?

1667
01:58:58,686 --> 01:59:03,885
Well, seeing as
I have no brains
or legal expertise...

1668
01:59:03,958 --> 01:59:06,426
and Ed was losing all faith
in the system...
[Ed] Completely.

1669
01:59:06,494 --> 01:59:09,463
No faith, no faith.
I just went out there
and performed sexual favors:

1670
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:12,328
634 blow jobs
in five days.

1671
01:59:18,873 --> 01:59:22,639
I'm really quite tired.
[Chuckles]

1672
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:25,736
[Sighs]

1673
01:59:29,717 --> 01:59:32,151
[Ed Chuckling]

1674
01:59:48,002 --> 01:59:51,494
I'm still not sure
why you wanted me to come.

1675
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:56,511
I want to show you
what you helped do.

1676
02:00:20,535 --> 02:00:23,231
Hey.
[Donna]
Hi.

1677
02:00:23,304 --> 02:00:25,465
How are you
feeling today?
Good, good.

1678
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:28,475
It's a good day.
Oh, I'm glad.

1679
02:00:28,543 --> 02:00:34,106
Well, come on in.
What a nice surprise
this is.

1680
02:00:34,181 --> 02:00:37,708
Um... Donna...

1681
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:45,154
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1682
02:00:45,226 --> 02:00:49,253
because the judge
came back with a number.

1683
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:52,322
[Sighs]

1684
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:55,494
Uh...

1685
02:00:55,570 --> 02:01:00,473
for the whole group
or... for us?

1686
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:02,839
Both.

1687
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:08,542
He's gonna make them pay
333 million.

1688
02:01:10,685 --> 02:01:14,621
[Sighs, Laughs]
Oh, my God.
And...

1689
02:01:14,689 --> 02:01:16,554
And, um...

1690
02:01:16,624 --> 02:01:20,526
he's gonna make them
give 5 million of that
to your family.

1691
02:01:22,196 --> 02:01:25,723
Five million dollars?
Five million dollars.

1692
02:01:29,036 --> 02:01:32,631
[Laughing]
I don't even know
how much money that is.

1693
02:01:32,707 --> 02:01:36,643
Well, it's enough.
It's enough for whatever
you could ever need...

1694
02:01:36,711 --> 02:01:41,478
or whatever your girls need
or your girls' girls need.

1695
02:01:41,549 --> 02:01:46,009
It will be enough.
[Crying]
Oh, Erin...

1696
02:01:46,087 --> 02:01:48,146
[Continues Crying]

1697
02:01:48,222 --> 02:01:51,487
Thank you so much.

1698
02:01:54,095 --> 02:01:57,394
[Softly]
It's over now.

1699
02:01:57,465 --> 02:02:00,059
[Donna Continues Crying]

1700
02:02:00,134 --> 02:02:03,592
I don't know what
I would have done without you.

1701
02:02:03,671 --> 02:02:07,664
It's a good day.
[Laughing]
Yes.

1702
02:02:07,742 --> 02:02:10,176
This is too much.

1703
02:02:20,187 --> 02:02:25,022
[Rosalind]
Masry & Vititoe.
Can l... Shoot.

1704
02:02:25,092 --> 02:02:27,356
[Phone Ringing]

1705
02:02:27,428 --> 02:02:29,692
Hi, I have a delivery
for Ed Masry.

1706
02:02:29,764 --> 02:02:33,530
It's the last office
down the corridor on the right.
Thank you.

1707
02:02:33,601 --> 02:02:38,903
Masry & Vititoe...
Damn it. Does anyone...

1708
02:02:38,973 --> 02:02:41,533
know anything
about these phones?

1709
02:02:45,546 --> 02:02:48,208
[Ed]
Everybody loves the desk
you picked out for me.

1710
02:02:48,282 --> 02:02:51,740
It's great.
Yeah.
[Knocking]

1711
02:02:51,819 --> 02:02:55,721
And guess who's on the cover
of Los Angeles Lawyer magazine?

1712
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:57,724
Talk to you later, baby.
Bye.

1713
02:03:02,463 --> 02:03:04,397
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1714
02:03:18,746 --> 02:03:21,681
I would rather walk her
through this in person.

1715
02:03:21,749 --> 02:03:24,843
There's some things
I want to show her:
Visual aids and documents.

1716
02:03:24,919 --> 02:03:29,856
If you could just
tell her I won't take up
too much of her time.

1717
02:03:29,924 --> 02:03:32,688
Right.

1718
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:37,026
It's a little more
complicated than Hinkley,
so let me do that.

1719
02:03:38,766 --> 02:03:41,530
Tell her I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1720
02:03:41,602 --> 02:03:45,038
Great.
Why don't you give me
the address now?

1721
02:03:45,106 --> 02:03:47,540
Just in case.

1722
02:03:47,608 --> 02:03:50,975
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

1723
02:03:51,045 --> 02:03:53,946
All right.
Thanks so much. Bye.

1724
02:03:54,014 --> 02:03:55,948
[Sighs]
What's up?

1725
02:03:56,016 --> 02:03:59,110
I, uh...
I have your bonus check.

1726
02:03:59,186 --> 02:04:03,213
Oh, yea...
But... now...

1727
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:06,487
I want you to be prepared.

1728
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,792
The figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1729
02:04:13,734 --> 02:04:16,328
Why not?

1730
02:04:16,403 --> 02:04:20,362
Because,
after careful
consideration,

1731
02:04:20,441 --> 02:04:24,810
I felt that figure
was not... appropriate.

1732
02:04:24,879 --> 02:04:28,212
Although
you may not agree,

1733
02:04:28,282 --> 02:04:30,876
you'll have to trust
my experience...

1734
02:04:30,951 --> 02:04:34,011
Trust?
You want me to trust you?

1735
02:04:34,088 --> 02:04:36,886
Do me a favor, Ed.
Don't use big words
you don't understand.

1736
02:04:36,957 --> 02:04:40,051
It's a complicated issue.
You're not a qualified lawyer.
I did a job.

1737
02:04:40,127 --> 02:04:43,494
You should
reward me accordingly.
It's not complicated.

1738
02:04:43,564 --> 02:04:45,691
That is
the fucking
problem.

1739
02:04:45,766 --> 02:04:48,234
All you lawyers do
is complicate situations
that aren't complicated.

1740
02:04:48,302 --> 02:04:51,362
Do you know why people think
all lawyers are backstabbing,
bloodsucking scumbags?

1741
02:04:51,438 --> 02:04:55,340
Because they are.
I cannot believe you are
doing this to me now...

1742
02:04:55,409 --> 02:04:57,377
when I'm up to my ass
in Kettleman plaintiffs,

1743
02:04:57,444 --> 02:05:00,174
which looks like double
the amount we had in Hinkley.

1744
02:05:00,247 --> 02:05:02,181
You expect me
to go out there,

1745
02:05:02,249 --> 02:05:05,047
leave my kids to be
looked after by strangers,
knock on doors,

1746
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:08,020
get these people to trust you
with their lives, and the whole
time you're screwing me!

1747
02:05:09,557 --> 02:05:12,583
I want you to know
something, Ed. It is
not about the number.

1748
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,992
It is about the way my work
is valued in this firm.

1749
02:05:15,062 --> 02:05:18,031
It's about how no matter
what I do, you're not...

1750
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:25,129
As I was saying,

1751
02:05:25,206 --> 02:05:30,143
I decided that
the figure you proposed...

1752
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:32,611
was inappropriate.

1753
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,614
So I increased it.

1754
02:05:45,426 --> 02:05:49,362
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1755
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:52,797
Because you suck at it.

1756
02:06:05,546 --> 02:06:08,310
Uh, thank you, Ed.

1757
02:06:08,382 --> 02:06:10,646
(sing)(music) I hitched a ride (music)

1758
02:06:10,718 --> 02:06:12,811
(sing)(music) With a vending machine
repairman (music)

1759
02:06:12,887 --> 02:06:16,823
(sing)(music) He said he's been down
this road more than twice (music)

1760
02:06:16,891 --> 02:06:20,987
(sing)(music) He was high
on intellectualism (music)

1761
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:26,021
(sing)(music) I've never been there
but the brochure looks nice (music)

1762
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,500
(sing)(music) Jump in
Let's go (music)

1763
02:06:29,570 --> 02:06:33,006
(sing)(music) Lay back
Enjoy the show (music)

1764
02:06:33,073 --> 02:06:35,837
[Knocking]
(sing)(music) Everybody gets high (music)

1765
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:38,037
(sing)(music) Everybody gets low (music)

1766
02:06:38,112 --> 02:06:39,580
(sing)(music) These are the days
when anything goes (music)

1767
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:41,673
(sing)(music) These are the days
when anything goes (music)

1768
02:06:41,748 --> 02:06:45,184
(sing)(music) Every day
is a winding road (music)

1769
02:06:47,421 --> 02:06:50,015
(sing)(music) I get a little bit closer (music)

1770
