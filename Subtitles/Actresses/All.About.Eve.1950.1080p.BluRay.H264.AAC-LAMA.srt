1
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,573
(narrator) The Sarah Siddons Award
is perhaps unknown to you.

2
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,576
It has been spared
the sensational publicity

3
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,079
of such questionable honors
as the Pulitzer Prize

4
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:25,001
and those awards presented annually
by that film society.

5
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:29,088
The distinguished-looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor.

6
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,592
Being an actor,
he will go on speaking for some time.

7
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,762
It is not important
that you hear what he says.

8
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:40,099
However, it is important that you know
where you are and why you are here.

9
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,770
This is the dining hall
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

10
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:49,358
It is the annual banquet and presentation
of the highest honor our theatre has:

11
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:53,112
the Sarah Siddons Award for
Distinguished Achievement.

12
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,032
These hallowed walls,
indeed many of these faces,

13
00:01:56,158 --> 00:02:00,286
have looked upon Modjeska,
Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.

14
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,623
Mansfield's voice filled this room.

15
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,543
It is unlikely that the windows
have been opened since his death.

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:12,465
The minor awards, as you can see,
have already been presented.

17
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,052
Minor awards are for such
as the writer and director,

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,805
since they merely construct a tower

19
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,809
so that the world can applaud
a light which flashes on top of it.

20
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,313
And no brighter light has ever
dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,733
Eve... But more of Eve later.

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,985
All about Eve, in fact.

23
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,029
To those who do not read,

24
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,825
attend the theatre,
listen to unsponsored radio programs

25
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,661
or know anything of the world
in which you live,

26
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,164
it is perhaps necessary
to introduce myself.

27
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,416
My name is Addison DeWitt.

28
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:53,172
My native habitat is the theatre.
In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.

29
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,758
I am a critic and commentator.

30
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,511
I am essential to the theatre.

31
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,680
This is Karen Richards.

32
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,268
She is the wife of a playwright,
therefore of the theatre by marriage.

33
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:09,480
Nothing in her background should have
brought her closer to the stage

34
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,816
than Row E.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,485
However,
during her senior year at Radcliffe,

36
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,946
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,117
The following year
Karen became Mrs. Lloyd Richards.

38
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,954
There are, in general,
two types of theatrical producers.

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,542
One has a great many wealthy friends
who will risk a tax-deductible loss.

40
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,044
This type is interested in art.

41
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,549
The other is one to whom each production
means potential ruin or fortune.

42
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,718
This type is out to make a buck.

43
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,137
Meet Max Fabian.

44
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,014
He is the producer of the play

45
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,310
which has won for Eve Harrington
the Sarah Siddons Award.

46
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,814
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,234
She made her first stage appearance at
the age of four

48
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,695
in Midsummer Night's Dream.

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:02,408
She played a fairy and entered,
quite unexpectedly, stark naked.

50
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,994
She has been a star ever since.

51
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,081
Margo is a great star. A true star.

52
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,169
She never was or will be
anything less or anything else.

53
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:20,509
Having covered in tedious detail not only
the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,

54
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,428
but also the history of acting

55
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,098
since Thespis
first stepped out of the chorus line,

56
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,519
our distinguished chairman has finally
arrived at our reason for being here.

57
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:36,943
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre,

58
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:42,031
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage,

59
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,618
and I've been honored to be, for 40 years,

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,664
chief prompter
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

61
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,544
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

62
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,298
this highest honor the theatre knows.

63
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,301
Surely no actor is older than I.

64
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,012
I've earned my place out of the sun.

65
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,430
(laughter)

66
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:12,395
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.

67
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,691
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.

68
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,528
Such young hands. Such a young lady.

69
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:25,533
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.

70
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,994
Some of us are privileged to know her.

71
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,414
We have seen
beyond the beauty and artistry

72
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,750
that have made her name
resound through the nation.

73
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,754
We know her humility, her devotion,

74
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,923
her loyalty to her art,

75
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,594
her love, her deep and abiding love for us,

76
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:50,433
for what we are
and what we do, the theatre.

77
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,269
She has had one wish,

78
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,105
one prayer, one dream,

79
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,775
to belong to us.

80
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,445
Tonight her dream has come true,

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,365
and henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.

82
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,203
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre,

83
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:15,291
the Sarah Siddons Award
to Miss Eve Harrington.

84
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,483
Bravo!

85
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,585
(Addison) Eve.
Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.

86
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,090
The girl next door, the girl on the moon.
Time has been good to Eve.

87
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:09,345
Life goes where she goes. She's been
profiled, covered, revealed, reported,

88
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,348
what she eats and what
she wears and whom she knows

89
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,601
and where she was and
when and where she's going.

90
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,520
Eve.

91
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,147
You all know all about Eve.

92
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,692
What can there be to know
that you don't know?

93
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,780
(Karen) When was it? How long?

94
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,533
It seems a lifetime ago.

95
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,285
Lloyd always said that in the theatre
a lifetime was a season

96
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,204
and a season a lifetime.

97
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,999
It's June now. That was early October.

98
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,128
Only last October.

99
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,967
It was a drizzly night.
I remember I asked the taxi to wait.

100
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,975
Where was she?

101
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,729
Strange. I'd become so accustomed
to seeing her there night after night,

102
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,983
I found myself looking for a girl
I'd never spoken to.

103
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,569
Wondering where she was.

104
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,201
Mrs. Richards?

105
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,663
There you are.

106
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,001
It seemed odd, suddenly,
your not being here.

107
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,504
-Why should you think I wouldn't be?
-Why should you be?

108
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,339
Six nights a week for weeks

109
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,259
of watching even Margo Channing
enter and leave a theatre.

110
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,095
-You don't mind my speaking to you?
-Not at all.

111
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,932
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.

112
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,602
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

113
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,104
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

114
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,525
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.

115
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,446
And Mr. Sampson. What's he like?

116
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,949
Bill Sampson? He's a director.

117
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,285
-He's the best.
-He'll agree with you.

118
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:01,457
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?

119
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,043
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

120
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,129
Oh, no. I see the play.

121
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,884
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?

122
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,053
Yes.

123
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,471
But don't you find it...

124
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,807
Apart from everything else,
don't you find it expensive?

125
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,061
Standing room doesn't cost much.
I manage.

126
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,315
-I'm gonna take you to Margo.
-Oh, no!

127
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,069
-Oh, yes. She's got to meet you.
-No, I'd be imposing on her.

128
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,238
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

129
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,574
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.

130
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,410
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this.

131
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,081
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?

132
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,250
Eve. Eve Harrington.

133
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,006
-Good evening, Gus.
-Good evening, Mrs. Richards.

134
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,926
-Good night.
-Good night, Gus.

135
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,656
You can breathe it, can't you?

136
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,368
Like some magic perfume.

137
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,959
(laughter from behind the door)

138
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,045
Wait right here. Don't run away.

139
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,465
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."

140
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,884
-Hi.
-Hello!

141
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,804
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."

142
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,473
"We was more starved out,
you might say."

143
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,561
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."

144
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,231
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."

145
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,900
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.

146
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,321
When it gets printed, they're
gonna fire on Gettysburg again.

147
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,408
-It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
-I never played Fort Sumter.

148
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,080
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.

149
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,501
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.

150
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,087
-You need new girdles.
-Buy some.

151
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,089
-Same size?
-Of course.

152
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,259
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.

153
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:21,597
-Aged in Wood happens to be a fine play.
-That's my loyal little woman.

154
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,183
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.

155
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,853
Packed houses, tickets
four months in advance.

156
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,522
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurt you any.

157
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,693
-Easy now.
-Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.

158
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,821
You get me so mad sometimes.

159
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,449
Of all the women
with nothing to complain about...

160
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,701
-Ain't it the truth?
-Yes, it is.

161
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,204
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

162
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,541
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.

163
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,378
Autograph fiends. They're not people.

164
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,047
Little beasts that run around in packs
like coyotes.

165
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,966
-They're your fans.
-They're nobody's fans.

166
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,887
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.

167
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,808
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

168
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,311
Well, there's one indoors right now.

169
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,898
-I've brought her back to see you.
-You've what?

170
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,818
She's just outside the door.

171
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,903
The heave-ho.

172
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,656
But you can't put her out. I promised.

173
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,699
Margo, you've got to see her.

174
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,494
She worships you.
It's like something out of a book.

175
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,163
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.

176
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,500
But if you'd only see her.
You're her whole life.

177
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,337
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.

178
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,508
Oh, the mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.

179
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,678
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinee.

180
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,350
Come in, Eve.

181
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,273
-I thought you'd forgotten about me.
-Not at all.

182
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,525
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

183
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,111
-How do you do, my dear?
-Oh, brother.

184
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,196
-Hello, Miss Channing.
-My husband.

185
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,365
-Hello, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?

186
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,702
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

187
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,037
-Oh, brother.
-Miss Coonan.

188
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,790
-Oh, brother, what?
-When she gets like this,

189
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,042
she starts playing Hamlet's mother.

190
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,963
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.

191
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,550
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.

192
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,806
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

193
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:28,974
Harrington.

194
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,853
-I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

195
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,399
Would you like a drink?

196
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,235
I was saying how often
you've seen the play.

197
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
No, thank you.

198
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,822
Yes, I've seen every performance.

199
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:48,243
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

200
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,332
-I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
-Would you really? How sweet.

201
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,585
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.

202
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,505
Please don't misunderstand me,
Mr. Richards.

203
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,343
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pick the best plays.

204
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,595
Your new play
is for Miss Channing, isn't it?

205
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,597
Of course it is.

206
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,351
-How did you hear about it?
-There was an item in The Times.

207
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,270
I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.

208
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,356
Yes, but let's get back to this one.

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,692
-Have you really seen every performance?
-Yes.

210
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,778
Why? I'm curious.

211
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:28,408
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

212
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,369
There are other plays.

213
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,205
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards.

214
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,750
But you must have friends,
a home, family?

215
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,547
Tell us about it, Eve.

216
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,801
-If I only knew how.
-Try.

217
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,471
-Well...
-(door opens)

218
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,076
Well, it started
with the play before this one.

219
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,495
-Remembrance.
-Remembrance.

220
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,582
-Did you see it here in New York?
-San Francisco.

221
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,168
It was the last week. I went one night.

222
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,338
The most important night
of my life, until now.

223
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,509
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.

224
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
Every performance.

225
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,765
Then, when the show went East,
I went East.

226
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,854
-Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?
-Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you.

227
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,273
Please.

228
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:46,111
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.

229
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,530
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

230
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,407
I was an only child.

231
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,951
I used to make believe a lot
when I was a kid.

232
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,039
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.

233
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:02,210
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.

234
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,048
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

235
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,468
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...

236
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,556
-I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
-Not at all.

237
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:20,228
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.

238
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,481
I had to help out.

239
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:30,238
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary in a brewery.

240
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:35,577
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.

241
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,663
Everything is beer.

242
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,667
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.

243
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:48,090
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.

244
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,258
That's where I met Eddie.

245
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,261
He was a radio technician.

246
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,056
We played Liliom for three performances.

247
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,685
I was awful.

248
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,355
Then the war came and we got married.

249
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,524
Eddie was in the air force.

250
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,110
They sent him to the South Pacific.

251
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,781
You were with the OWI,
weren't you, Mr. Richards?

252
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,157
That's what Who's Who says.

253
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,287
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went back to beer.

254
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,623
Except for a letter a week.

255
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,960
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.

256
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:30,382
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.

257
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,302
But Eddie wasn't there.

258
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,305
They forwarded the telegram
from Milwaukee.

259
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,975
The one that came from Washington.

260
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,978
To say that Eddie wasn't coming at all.

261
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,982
That Eddie was dead.

262
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,574
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

263
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,119
I was alone.
I couldn't go back without Eddie.

264
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,081
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

265
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,753
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

266
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:12,507
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in Remembrance,

267
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,676
and I went to see it.

268
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,847
Well...

269
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,099
Here I am.

270
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:31,276
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.

271
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:36,114
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!

272
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:40,494
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.

273
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:46,333
-I want to apologize for Birdie.
-You don't have to apologize for me.

274
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:54,382
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talking.

275
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,135
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

276
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,304
Call me Birdie.

277
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,307
And as for being fifth-rate,

278
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,645
I closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it.

279
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:16,154
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?

280
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,157
-Not ready, looking like a junkyard.
-Thank you so much.

281
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,661
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?

282
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,581
-Show me a human and I might have.
-Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.

283
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,918
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.

284
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,170
Zanuck, Zanuck!
What are you two? Lovers?

285
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,090
-Only in some ways. You're prettier.
-I'm a junkyard.

286
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,510
-Bill. This is Eve Harrington.
-Hi.

287
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:43,181
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.

288
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,100
Heaven help me.

289
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,269
I love a psychotic.

290
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:53,024
-Hello. What's your name?
-Eve Harrington.

291
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,694
-You've already met.
-Huh? Where?

292
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,906
-Right here, just a minute ago.
-That's nice.

293
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,121
-You're not going, are you?
-I think I'd better.

294
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,876
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.

295
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,961
No, don't go.

296
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:18,049
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr. Sampson leaving.

297
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,386
No, stick around, please.

298
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,725
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.

299
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,561
Well, if I'm not in the way...

300
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,771
I won't be a minute.

301
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,903
Lloyd, we've got to go.

302
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,826
Good night, Margo.

303
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,829
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Not too early.

304
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,003
-Good luck, genius.
-Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.

305
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,841
-I'm not worried about you.
-Keep the thought.

306
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,178
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.

307
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:08,266
-I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee.
-Not just that way. As a friend.

308
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,435
I'd like that.

309
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,275
-It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
-I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night.

310
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,694
Good night.

311
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,696
Mrs. Richards?

312
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,699
I'll never forget this night as long as I live.

313
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,203
And I'll never forget you
for making it possible.

314
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,461
(Karen) And I'll never forget you, Eve.

315
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,798
Where were we going that night,
Lloyd and I?

316
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,467
Funny, the things you remember

317
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,386
and the things you don't.

318
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,022
-So you're going to Hollywood?
-Mm-hm.

319
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,236
-Why?
-I just wondered.

320
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,322
-Just wondered what?
-Why?

321
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,535
-Why what?
-Why you have to go out there.

322
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,206
-I don't have to. I want to.
-Is it the money?

323
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,376
80% of it'll go for taxes.

324
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:21,256
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...

325
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,925
The theatre. The theatre.

326
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,679
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings

327
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,515
crowded into one
square mile of New York City?

328
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,726
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

329
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,355
Listen, Junior, and learn.

330
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,360
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.

331
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,197
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

332
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,535
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band, all theatre.

333
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,623
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.

334
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,794
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

335
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,215
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.

336
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,427
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse,
all theatre.

337
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,972
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.

338
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,057
Why should you?

339
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:16,186
The theatre's for everybody, you included,
but not exclusively.

340
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,897
So, don't approve or disapprove.

341
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,817
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.

342
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,445
I just asked a simple question.

343
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,240
And I shot my mouth off.

344
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,410
Nothing personal, Junior. No offense.

345
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:37,832
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,

346
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,335
sometimes it gets up around my chin.

347
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,838
But Hollywood.
You mustn't stay out there.

348
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,634
-It's only a one-picture deal.
-So few come back.

349
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,598
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

350
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,102
-Also Addison DeWitt.
-Every day.

351
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,689
-You didn't have to tell me.
-(door opens)

352
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,858
It's the latest thing, one earring.

353
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,946
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.

354
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,532
Throw that dreary letter away.
It bores me.

355
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,868
-Where do you suppose it could be?
-It'll show up.

356
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,122
Oh, I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.

357
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,041
Real diamonds in a wig.
The world we live in.

358
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,044
-Where's my coat?
-Right where you left it.

359
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,383
The seams.

360
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,886
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

361
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,055
Like a nylon lemon peel.

362
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,308
Byron couldn't have said it
more graciously.

363
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,477
Here we go.

364
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,021
Got any messages?

365
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,149
What do you want me
to tell Tyrone Power?

366
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,569
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.

367
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,321
Kill the people.

368
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,576
-You got your key?
-See you at home.

369
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,418
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.

370
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,254
I mean, you haven't had a minute
alone yet.

371
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,758
And I could take care of everything here
and meet you at the gate with the ticket,

372
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,844
if you'd like.

373
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,846
I think we'd like very much.

374
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,432
-Sure you won't mind?
-Of course not.

375
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:31,446
-She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
-Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.

376
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,617
That lack of pretense, that strange
directness and understanding.

377
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,369
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?

378
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,872
No, I told her. I sounded off.

379
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,958
All the religions in the world
rolled into one,

380
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,461
and we're gods and goddesses.

381
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:51,216
Isn’t it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.

382
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,052
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

383
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,895
-Take care of yourself out there.
-They have the Indians pretty well in hand.

384
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,146
Bill.

385
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,358
-Don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
-I'll try.

386
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,153
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.

387
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,492
-Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
-You're a setup for some young babe.

388
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,078
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?

389
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,914
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.

390
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,166
And cut that out right now.

391
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:28,336
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

392
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,838
As of this moment, you're six years old.

393
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,675
All ready.

394
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,776
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

395
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,028
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

396
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,031
-Knit me a muffler?
-Call me when you get in.

397
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,882
(Bill) Hey, Junior!

398
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,344
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her get lonely.

399
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,388
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

400
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,557
Don't worry.

401
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:41,075
(Margo) That same night, we sent for Eve's
things, her few pitiful possessions.

402
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,704
She moved into the little guest room
on the top floor.

403
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,460
The next three weeks
were out of a fairy tale,

404
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,004
and I was Cinderella in the last act.

405
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:58,760
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,
friend, psychiatrist and cop.

406
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,597
The honeymoon was on.

407
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,599
(inaudible)

408
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,778
(applause)

409
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,150
(cheering)

410
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,332
One more?

411
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,501
From now on it isn't applause,

412
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,921
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.

413
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,842
What, again?

414
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,141
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.

415
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,019
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long,

416
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:35,481
will take place
in a well-padded booby hatch.

417
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:42,530
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.

418
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,699
You certainly can.

419
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,619
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.

420
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,956
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.

421
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,542
Something maybe grew a size larger.

422
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:58,129
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.

423
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,841
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours.

424
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:11,225
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.

425
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,062
(Margo) But you've done so much.
What's new?

426
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,648
The curtains. I made them myself.

427
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,570
They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

428
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,071
Adorable.

429
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:28,326
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop.

430
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,745
Just because
you can't even work a zipper!

431
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,248
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.

432
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,168
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

433
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,629
Don't bother.
Mrs. Brown will be along soon.

434
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,589
No trouble at all.

435
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,097
May I be so bold as to say something?

436
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,935
-Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
-Behind in your dues? How much?

437
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,438
-I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
-Well?

438
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,691
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor,

439
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,362
a wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.

440
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,488
Oh, oh.

441
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,950
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.

442
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,286
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

443
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,214
Eve.

444
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,303
We'd better let Mrs. Brown
pick up the wardrobe.

445
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,610
(phone rings)

446
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,000
Hello.

447
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,085
We are ready
with your call to Beverly Hills.

448
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:06,424
-Call? What call?
-Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?

449
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,759
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

450
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,054
We are ready with the call you placed
for 12 midnight, California time,

451
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,931
to Mr. Sampson.

452
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,851
-I placed?
-Go ahead, please.

453
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,521
(Bill) Margo, what a wonderful surprise.

454
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,941
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do.

455
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:27,612
Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?

456
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,364
-You're my girl, aren't you?
-That I am.

457
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,533
Then you're crazy.

458
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,871
-When are you coming back?
-I leave in a week.

459
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,707
The picture's wrapped up.
We previewed last night.

460
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
Oh, those previews.

461
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,213
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.

462
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,466
You're trapped. You're in a tin can.

463
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:54,221
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.

464
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,143
-You in a hurry?
-In a big hurry, so be quick about it.

465
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,146
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

466
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,191
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't even said it yet.

467
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:10,237
Oh, now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...

468
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,407
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

469
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,244
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it.

470
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,414
-And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
-Sing it?

471
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,417
Sure, like the Western Union boys
used to do.

472
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,715
Bill...

473
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,760
It's your birthday.

474
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:38,015
And who remembered it?
Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?

475
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,017
Happy birthday, darling.

476
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,521
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.

477
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,856
Now, "Many happy returns of the day."

478
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,859
Many happy returns of the day.

479
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,948
-I get a party, don't I?
-Of course. Birthday and coming home.

480
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,952
-Who will I ask?
-I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.

481
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,623
-She did?
-She hasn't missed a week since I left.

482
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,459
But you know that.
You probably tell her what to write.

483
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,379
I sent her a list of guests,
so check with her.

484
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,964
Yeah, I will.

485
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,634
-How is Eve? OK?
-OK.

486
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,470
-I love you.
-I'll check with Eve.

487
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,638
Hm?

488
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:22,059
I love you, too. Good night, darling.

489
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,478
See ya.

490
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,609
-Birdie.
-Hm?

491
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,945
You don't like Eve, do you?

492
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,281
You want an argument or an answer?

493
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,034
-An answer.
-No.

494
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,620
-Why not?
-Now you want an argument.

495
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,874
-She works hard.
-Night and day.

496
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,337
-She's loyal and efficient.
-Like an agent with only one client.

497
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,716
She thinks only of me,

498
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,552
doesn't she?

499
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:42,139
Well, let's say she thinks
only about ya, anyway.

500
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:45,226
-How do you mean that?
-I'll tell ya how.

501
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,895
Like...

502
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,980
Like she's studying you.

503
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:53,234
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.

504
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,569
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

505
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,739
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.

506
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,366
(knock on door)

507
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:05,412
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?

508
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,915
It looks much better on you
than it did on me.

509
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:12,837
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.

510
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,463
Are you sure you won't want it yourself?

511
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,092
Quite sure.
I find it too seventeenish for me.

512
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,511
Come now,
as though you were an old lady.

513
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,097
I'm on my way. Is there anything else?

514
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,599
-That script to take to the Guild.
-I've got it.

515
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,185
And those checks
for the income-tax man.

516
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,396
Right here.

517
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,191
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.

518
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,027
That's my job. See you at teatime.

519
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,031
Eve?

520
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:46,745
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?

521
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,041
-Golly, I forgot to tell you!
-Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.

522
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,961
I was sure you'd want to,
being his birthday.

523
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,883
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.

524
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,552
I guess I was asleep when you got home.

525
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,972
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.

526
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:09,143
Mr. Sampson's birthday,
I couldn't forget that.

527
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,644
You'd never forgive me.

528
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,613
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.

529
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:52,102
(Margo) Bill's welcome-home birthday
party, a night to go down in history.

530
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:56,774
Even before the party started,
I could smell disaster in the air.

531
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:02,529
I knew it. I sensed it even as I finished
dressing for that blasted party.

532
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,659
-You all put together?
-My back's open.

533
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,704
-Extra help get here?
-There's some characters

534
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,708
dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?

535
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,045
You're not funny. Actors would cost less.
How about the food?

536
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,798
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.

537
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,132
Voilà!

538
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,719
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.

539
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,722
There was nothing he didn't know.

540
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,729
There's a message from the bartender.

541
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,483
"Does Miss Channing know that
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

542
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,403
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.

543
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,489
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.

544
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,492
-Where's Bill? He's late.
-Late for what?

545
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,868
Don't be dense. The party.

546
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,830
I ain't dense.
He's been here for 20 minutes.

547
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,917
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...

548
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,187
-(laughter)
-The cameraman said,

549
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:21,442
"Even DeMille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...

550
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,611
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

551
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,948
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.

552
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:32,119
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.

553
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:36,707
-I'd like to hear it.
-Some snowy night in front of the fire.

554
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,877
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

555
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,297
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.

556
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,466
Of course.

557
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
Looks like I'm going to have a fancy party.

558
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,399
-I thought you were going to be late.
-Well, I'm guest of honor.

559
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,568
I had no idea you were even here.

560
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,821
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.

561
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,407
That's never stopped you before.

562
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,496
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...

563
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,666
-She's a girl of so many interests.
-It's a pretty rare quality these days.

564
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,170
-A girl of so many rare qualities.
-So she seems.

565
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,589
So you've pointed out so often.

566
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,674
So many qualities so often.

567
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:32,096
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young.

568
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,264
So young and so fair.

569
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,435
I can't believe you're making this up.

570
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,688
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.

571
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,609
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time.

572
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,695
I always deny that
you were in Our American Cousin

573
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,030
the night Lincoln was shot.

574
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,117
-I don't think that's funny.
-Of course it is.

575
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,786
This is all too laughable
to be anything else.

576
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,288
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.

577
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,166
And this getting into a jealous froth

578
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,210
because I spent ten minutes
with a stage-struck kid.

579
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,712
-20!
-30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?

580
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,298
Stage-struck.
She's a young lady of qualities.

581
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,386
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities.

582
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,889
Studying me as if I were a play
or a blueprint.

583
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,976
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.

584
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,896
How can you take offense at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?

585
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,524
Stop calling her a kid.

586
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,821
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life

587
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:35,159
to which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.

588
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,495
-For instance, what?
-For instance, you.

589
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,668
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.

590
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,587
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

591
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,255
-Guilty!
-Mad!

592
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,049
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous,

593
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,509
on stage and off.

594
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:57,097
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.

595
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:01,852
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".

596
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,521
You have to keep your teeth sharp,
all right.

597
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,524
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.

598
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:12,196
-What about her teeth? Her fangs?
-She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

599
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,365
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid

600
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,494
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards
of this megalomaniac society,

601
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,704
I won't have it!

602
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,374
Eve Harrington has never by word,
look, thought or suggestion

603
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:29,046
indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love.

604
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,214
To intimate anything else

605
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:34,009
spells a paranoiac insecurity
that you should be ashamed of.

606
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,428
Cut. Print it.
What happens in the next reel?

607
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,139
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

608
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,308
(Eve) Miss Channing?

609
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,648
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?

610
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,072
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.

611
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,282
I'll get it.

612
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,828
-What'll you have?
-A milk shake?

613
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,457
A martini, very dry, please.

614
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,168
(laughter and chatter)

615
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,756
-The party's on the first floor.
-Hi, Bill.

616
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,175
-Hello, Mrs. Richards.
-How are you, dear?

617
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,095
Good evening, Mr. Richards. Mr. Fabian.

618
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,514
-May I have your coat?
-I'll take it up.

619
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,683
-Please.
-Thank you.

620
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,352
-Hi.
-Hi, Margo.

621
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,939
-The house looks lovely.
-I like that girl.

622
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,191
That quality of quiet graciousness.

623
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,111
Among so many quiet qualities.

624
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,113
Shall we?

625
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:41,368
-It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
-I'm so happy you're happy.

626
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,955
You haven't been running
a settlement house exactly.

627
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,623
The kid has earned her way.

628
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,376
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.

629
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,795
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

630
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,799
-You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
-Make it Bergdorf Goodman.

631
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,720
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.

632
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,806
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.

633
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,142
-How about you, Max?
-How about me what?

634
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,395
Suppose you dropped dead.
What about your inventory?

635
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,733
I ain't going to drop dead.
Not with the heat.

636
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,569
This is the most ghoulish conversation.

637
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,821
-Thank you.
-Nothing.

638
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,906
Max! Mon vieux!

639
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,409
Fife!

640
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,913
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.

641
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,834
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.

642
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,754
The general atmosphere
is very Macbethish.

643
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,923
-What has or is about to happen?
-What is he talking about?

644
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,510
-Macbeth.
-We've seen you like this before.

645
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,096
Is it over or is it just beginning?

646
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:56,902
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

647
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,114
-Margo, darling!
-How are you?

648
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,992
Mademoiselle, je vous remercie
pour l'invitation.

649
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:07,287
Enchantée to you too.

650
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:11,792
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?

651
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:16,213
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.

652
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,799
-Remember Miss Casswell?
-I do not. How do you do?

653
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:22,052
-We've never met. Maybe that's why.
-She is an actress.

654
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,472
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.

655
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,892
Ah... Eve.

656
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,396
-Good evening, Mr. DeWitt.
-I had no idea you knew each other.

657
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,232
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.

658
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:40,153
-Until now, we've only met in passing.
-That's how you met me. In passing.

659
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,739
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr. DeWitt's mother.

660
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:46,243
-Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.
-How do you do?

661
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,246
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.

662
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,416
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.

663
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,919
-You know of her interest in the theatre?
-We have that in common.

664
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,921
Then you two must have a long talk.

665
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,007
I'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.

666
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,594
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.

667
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,805
Claudia, come here.

668
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,768
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.

669
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,187
Now, go and do yourself some good.

670
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,023
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?

671
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,861
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.

672
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,951
Now, don't worry about your little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.

673
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,839
Amen!

674
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,220
("Liebestraum" by Liszt)

675
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,254
(changes to a jaunty tune)

676
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:27,010
-Liebestraum.
-I just played it.

677
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,347
-Play it again.
-But that was the fourth straight time.

678
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,724
Then this will be five.

679
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:40,106
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to view the body.

680
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:44,444
-Where has it been laid out?
-It hasn't been laid out.

681
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,781
We haven't finished with the embalming.

682
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,867
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.

683
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,787
The remains of Margo Channing

684
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,790
sitting up.

685
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,377
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

686
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,963
Wouldn't you feel more natural
taking a bow?

687
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:07,384
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.

688
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:11,137
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be

689
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,558
a shade more on the,
shall we say, happier side?

690
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,893
If my guests do not like it here,

691
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:20,230
I suggest they accompany you
to the nursery

692
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:24,150
where I'm sure
you will all feel more at home.

693
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:29,239
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

694
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,659
Poor Max. Heartburn?

695
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,162
It's that Miss Casswell.

696
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:39,416
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.

697
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,750
No heart to burn.

698
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:45,171
Everybody has a heart,
except some people.

699
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,508
Of course I've got bicarb.

700
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,094
I've got a box in the pantry.

701
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,764
We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."

702
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,269
It will stay there always, just for you.

703
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,773
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.

704
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,942
It's friends that count.

705
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:10,864
-And I have friends.
-I love you, Max. I really mean it.

706
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,199
I love you.

707
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,619
Come to the pantry.

708
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,372
She loves me like a father.
Also, she's loaded.

709
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,057
There you are, Maxie dear.

710
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,310
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Casswell.

711
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,980
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.

712
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,484
-I made a promise.
-To Miss Casswell? What?

713
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,236
For an audition
for this part we are replacing.

714
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:52,405
What's her name? Your sister?

715
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,824
-One?
-No, two, please.

716
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,243
If she can act, she might not be bad.

717
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,497
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.

718
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,416
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.

719
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,419
-When's the audition?
-A couple of weeks.

720
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,256
Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

721
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,094
-Would you?
-Anything to help you out, Max.

722
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,180
Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.

723
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:21,101
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favor.

724
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,269
Just name it.

725
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:26,731
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

726
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,946
-(belches)
-You get quick action, don't you?

727
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,949
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.

728
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,535
You said yourself
my inventory was in shape,

729
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,787
all my merchandise put away.

730
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:44,457
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.

731
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,460
-And you need her, Max.
-What will she do?

732
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,380
She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,

733
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:54,968
interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.

734
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,637
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

735
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,140
-Well...
-Think of your health.

736
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,727
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.

737
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,397
-I don't think it's such a good idea.
-Promise?

738
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,607
-Promise.
-That's my Max.

739
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,069
Oh, there you both are.

740
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,405
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

741
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,074
-Where is she now?
-Up in your room.

742
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,494
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Casswell.

743
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,834
-Who's left out there?
-Too many.

744
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,421
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.

745
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:36,259
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph book to the cleaners.

746
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,099
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don't you?

747
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:47,854
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.

748
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,482
-When you do, let me in on it.
-I will.

749
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:56,821
-How's the new one coming?
-The play? Oh, all right, I guess.

750
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,201
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

751
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,369
20-ish. It's not important.

752
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,289
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?

753
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,542
-How do you mean?
-Don't be evasive.

754
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,045
Margo, you haven't got any age.

755
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,799
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.

756
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,718
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.

757
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,887
Spoken like an author.

758
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,141
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.

759
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,061
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

760
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,730
40! Four-0.

761
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,276
That slipped out.

762
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,404
I hadn't quite made up my mind
to admit it.

763
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,077
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.

764
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,083
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.

765
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,919
As young as they want, you mean.

766
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,840
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600.

767
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,425
Just one person, isn't that so?

768
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,681
You know what this is all about.

769
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,267
It has little to do with
whether you should play Cora.

770
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,436
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.

771
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,606
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

772
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:18,194
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.

773
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,405
I hate men.

774
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,869
Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.

775
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:30,123
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.

776
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,922
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.

777
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,302
Hold that coat up.

778
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,721
(wolf-whistles)

779
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,641
-Whose is it?
-Some Hollywood movie star.

780
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,061
-Her plane got in late.
-Discouraging, isn't it?

781
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:55,565
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.

782
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,734
Hollywood.

783
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,823
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?

784
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,159
There should be a new word for happiness.

785
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,996
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.

786
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,499
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.

787
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,629
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage

788
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,673
by overplaying reality.

789
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,678
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.

790
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:31,184
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.

791
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,103
-Mrs. Richards?
-Karen.

792
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,189
Karen.

793
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,859
Isn’t it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favor,

794
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,945
after all you've done already.

795
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,947
Nobody's done so much.

796
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:47,700
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.

797
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,955
-What is it?
-Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,

798
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,124
so there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.

799
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:58,544
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.

800
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:02,215
But the other day
when Mr. Fabian told Miss Channing

801
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:06,886
that her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...

802
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:11,724
-You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
-I don't let myself think about it even.

803
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,395
But I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging,

804
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,398
there'd be no need to break in a new girl.

805
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,235
Suppose I had to go on one night

806
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,571
to an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.

807
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:29,242
-Oh, no, I couldn't possibly!
-I wouldn't worry too much about that.

808
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:34,914
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.

809
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,502
-The show must go on.
-No, dear. Margo must go on.

810
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,755
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.

811
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,426
-You think Miss Channing would approve?
-I think she'd cheer.

812
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:50,888
-But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson?
-They'll do as they're told.

813
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:55,018
Then would you speak
to Mr. Fabian about it?

814
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,895
-Of course.
-You won't forget?

815
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,273
I won't forget.

816
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,446
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?

817
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,373
-The bed looks like a dead animal act.
-(Karen chuckles)

818
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,960
-Which one is sable?
-But she just got here.

819
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:24,630
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.

820
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,301
-It's only a fur coat.
-What do you expect? Live sable?

821
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:32,430
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know, picture people.

822
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,393
(Addison) Elder statesmen
of the theatre or cinema

823
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:41,981
assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks,

824
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,651
ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public

825
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:49,405
is their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.

826
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,909
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.

827
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,495
-And probably has.
-Sable.

828
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:59,082
-Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
-Either one.

829
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,335
We all have abnormality in common.

830
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:06,255
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.

831
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,592
We are the original
displaced personalities.

832
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:13,513
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.

833
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,934
-I don't agree, Addison.
-That's your particular abnormality.

834
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,770
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.

835
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,941
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.

836
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:30,196
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.

837
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,240
Oh, waiter.

838
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,700
That isn't a waiter, my dear.
That's a butler.

839
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,203
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

840
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,872
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

841
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,543
You have a point.
An idiotic one, but a point.

842
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,630
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.

843
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,509
-Leave it to me. I'll get you one.
-Thank you, Mr. Fabian.

844
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:57,014
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.

845
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:03,563
-You were saying?
-The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.

846
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,401
Work done the hard way, by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.

847
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,238
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre,

848
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,158
means wanting to be that
more than anything else.

849
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,493
Yes. Yes, it does.

850
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,330
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice

851
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,749
such as no other profession demands.

852
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,670
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary,

853
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,922
can't be just someone.

854
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,009
To give so much
for almost always so little.

855
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,344
"So little?"

856
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,597
"So little," did you say?

857
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,268
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.

858
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,605
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

859
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,607
It's like...

860
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:52,612
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.

861
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:58,117
Imagine, to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.

862
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,371
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.

863
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,625
They want you. You belong.

864
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,129
Just that alone is worth anything.

865
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:28,648
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother.

866
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,651
-I'm sorry, I didn't...
-Outside of a beehive, Margo,

867
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,904
your behavior
is hardly queenly or motherly.

868
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,073
You're in a beehive, pal.

869
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:41,827
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.

870
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,996
-Aren't we, honey?
-Margo, really.

871
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,999
Please don't play governess, Karen.

872
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:50,586
I haven't your unyielding good taste.

873
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:55,341
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.

874
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,177
He needed help behind a notions counter.

875
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:02,348
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, ain't I?

876
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:06,435
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.

877
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,938
How about calling it a night?

878
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,607
And you pose as a playwright.

879
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:16,362
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep."

880
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,782
-It's a good thought.
-It won't play.

881
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:24,787
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.

882
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,624
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

883
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,544
-Happy little housewife.
-Cut it out.

884
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,549
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.

885
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,469
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.

886
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,222
-Let's not get into a big hassle.
-It's time we did.

887
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,476
Margo has to realize what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.

888
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:50,062
All right!

889
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,315
I'm going to bed.

890
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:04,076
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.

891
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,746
And we who are about to die salute you.

892
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,914
Need any help?

893
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:18,382
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?

894
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:22,845
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?

895
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,932
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

896
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,685
-If you'd like.
-I wouldn't like.

897
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,779
-Oh, I forgot I had it.
-I didn't.

898
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,623
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

899
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,209
They're gonna play it offstage.

900
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,714
-Coming, Max?
-In a minute.

901
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:06,138
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.

902
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,642
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.

903
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,646
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

904
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,232
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...

905
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,819
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.

906
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,029
But I know Margo.
And every now and then,

907
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:27,243
there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.

908
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,912
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

909
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,498
I'd just as soon it was me.

910
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,753
-Max is gonna drop us.
-Good night.

911
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,005
-Good night.
-Good night.

912
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:44,927
Mrs. Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

913
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,096
No, Eve. I won't forget.

914
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,541
Why so remote, Addison?

915
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:19,211
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.

916
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:23,382
Miss Casswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.

917
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,718
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

918
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,137
Being violently ill to her tummy.

919
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,639
It's good luck before an audition.

920
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,893
Miss Casswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.

921
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:37,730
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Casswell. I promised Max.

922
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,316
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.

923
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,153
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.
I never have, you know.

924
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,572
Who read with Miss Casswell?

925
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,241
-Bill? Lloyd?
-No.

926
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,162
-Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
-Naturally, your understudy.

927
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,832
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...

928
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:01,837
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.

929
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:04,590
Eve? My understudy?

930
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:08,427
-Didn't you know?
-Of course I knew.

931
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,596
It just slipped your mind?

932
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,019
How was Miss Casswell?

933
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,855
Frankly, I don't remember.

934
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,525
-Just slipped your mind?
-Completely.

935
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,945
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Casswell read,

936
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:29,031
or whether Miss Casswell read
or rode a pogo stick.

937
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,367
Was she that bad?

938
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:36,038
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.

939
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,874
I have no other world, no other life.

940
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:42,044
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation

941
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,214
for which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.

942
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:51,136
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.

943
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:53,556
Eve Harrington will be among them.

944
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,724
I take it she read well.

945
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,227
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

946
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,897
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.

947
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,149
How nice.

948
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:07,069
In time, she'll be what you are.

949
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,655
A mass of music and fire.

950
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,951
That's me.
An old kazoo with some sparklers.

951
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,999
Tell me, was Bill swept away, too?

952
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,626
Or were you
too full of revelation to notice?

953
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,420
Bill didn't say.

954
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,089
But Lloyd listened to his play

955
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,508
as if it had been written by someone else,
he said.

956
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,845
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.

957
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:37,850
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.

958
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:42,605
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.

959
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,942
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.

960
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:50,279
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?

961
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:54,867
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.

962
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,368
(door opens)

963
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,500
Ah! Feeling better, my dear?

964
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:09,965
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?

965
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,219
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.

966
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:21,560
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?

967
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:25,648
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.

968
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,529
Oh, Margo, darling.

969
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,119
Mm-hm!

970
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:47,836
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.

971
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,256
-Where's Miss Casswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
-Hello, Miss Channing.

972
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,009
How are you making out
in Mr. Fabian's office?

973
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:57,054
Now, Max, I don't want you
working this child too hard

974
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,681
just because you promised.

975
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,850
As you see, I kept my promise, too.

976
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,269
It's all over.

977
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,439
-What's all over?
-The audition.

978
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:12,194
-Eve read with Miss Casswell.
-Eve? How enchanting.

979
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,698
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Casswell?

980
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,035
-Well, she's your understudy.
-Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.

981
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,371
I thought you knew.
She started a week ago.

982
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,707
I've never seen her backstage,

983
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:28,711
but with so many people loitering about...
Well, well.

984
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,463
So Eve is not working for Max, after all.

985
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,134
Max, you sly puss.

986
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:42,224
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am that you arrived so late.

987
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,017
Really, Eve? Why?

988
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,478
Otherwise,
I never would have dared to read.

989
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,148
-Why not?
-If you'd come in the middle,

990
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,316
I couldn't have gone on.

991
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:55,404
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.

992
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,990
-What fire and music?
-You wouldn't understand.

993
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,159
How was Miss Casswell?

994
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,411
Back to the Copacabana.

995
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,164
But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.

996
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,999
I was dreadful, Miss Channing.

997
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,836
I have no right to be anyone's understudy,
much less yours.

998
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:13,672
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.

999
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,758
You were about to tell me about Eve.

1000
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,926
-You'd have been proud of her.
-I'm sure.

1001
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,679
-She was a revelation.
-Oh, to you too?

1002
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:24,099
-What do you mean by that?
-It must have been a revelation

1003
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:28,103
to have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.

1004
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,606
-That's beside the point.
-It is the point.

1005
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,025
It must have seemed
so new and fresh to you,

1006
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,445
so exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them.

1007
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,782
-Addison.
-So full of meaning, fire and music.

1008
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,036
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.

1009
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,955
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac.

1010
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,125
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.

1011
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,711
Playing that childish game
of cat and mouse.

1012
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,048
Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.

1013
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,884
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl

1014
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,969
out of a perfectly innocent
misunderstanding.

1015
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,806
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less.

1016
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,308
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

1017
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,561
accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel.

1018
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,480
I never said it was.

1019
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:15,901
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?

1020
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,238
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?

1021
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,865
-May I say a word?
-No!

1022
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,995
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?

1023
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,375
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!

1024
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,254
All playwrights should be dead
for 300 years!

1025
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:40,676
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!

1026
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:48,392
The stars never die and never change.

1027
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,186
You may change this star
any time you want

1028
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,524
for a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.

1029
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,778
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.

1030
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,947
This is for lawyers to talk about.

1031
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,784
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.

1032
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:10,289
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr. Fabian?

1033
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,877
-Are you breaking the contract?
-Answer my question.

1034
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,047
-Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
-I don't hear you.

1035
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:23,051
-I said I'm a dying man!
-Not until the last drugstore

1036
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,888
has sold its last pill.

1037
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:29,725
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice

1038
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,227
suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

1039
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,813
Just when does an actress decide

1040
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:38,483
they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?

1041
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,237
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethink them

1042
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,990
to keep the audience
from leaving the theatre.

1043
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,953
It's about time the piano realized
it has not written the concerto!

1044
01:10:55,001 --> 01:11:01,798
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

1045
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,178
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

1046
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,764
-Who?
-The kid. Junior.

1047
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,356
-Gone.
-I must have frightened her away.

1048
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,359
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.

1049
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,862
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.

1050
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,282
-Don't mix your metaphors.
-I'll mix what I like!

1051
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,535
I'm nothing but a body with a voice.
No mind.

1052
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:33,121
What a body. What a voice.

1053
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:37,876
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.

1054
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,921
The gong rang, the fight's over,
calm down.

1055
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,547
I will not calm down.

1056
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:45,175
Don't calm down.

1057
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:52,224
-You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
-I'm trying terribly hard.

1058
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,812
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.

1059
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,148
-Here we go.
-Such nonsense. What do you take me for?

1060
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,109
Little Nell from the country?

1061
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,820
Been my understudy for a week
without me knowing it.

1062
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,990
-Carefully hidden, no doubt.
-Don't get carried away.

1063
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,576
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here,

1064
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:16,498
-and gives a performance out of nowhere.
-You've been all through that with Lloyd.

1065
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:20,752
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesn't just happen.

1066
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,755
Full of fire and music and whatnot.

1067
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,258
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.

1068
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,094
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

1069
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,681
-I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
-Paranoiac?

1070
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,851
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.

1071
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,853
Tell that to Dr. Freud
along with the rest of it.

1072
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:41,773
No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.

1073
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:46,361
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two
of us by these paranoiac tantrums.

1074
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,572
That word.
I don't even know what it means.

1075
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,115
It's time you found out.

1076
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,784
-I love you. I love you.
-Hah!

1077
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,954
-You're beautiful and intelligent.
-A body with a voice.

1078
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,791
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.

1079
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:05,047
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.

1080
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,049
-Except happiness.
-Every reason.

1081
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:11,803
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...

1082
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:15,807
-A kid!
-...a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.

1083
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,268
Now, once and for all, stop it.

1084
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,663
It's obvious you're not a woman.

1085
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,668
-I've been aware of that for some time.
-Well, I am.

1086
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,837
I'll say.

1087
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,423
Don't be condescending.

1088
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,009
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

1089
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,053
I may have seen better days,

1090
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,348
but I'm still not to be had
for the price of a cocktail.

1091
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,517
Like a salted peanut.

1092
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:04,356
-Margo, let's make peace.
-The terms are too high.

1093
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,860
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?

1094
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,613
-And Eve and me?
-It's not nonsense.

1095
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,992
But if I tell you it is, as I just did,
were you listening to me?

1096
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:21,373
-Isn’t that enough?
-I wish it were.

1097
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,042
Then what would be enough?

1098
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,461
If we got married?

1099
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:29,798
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just to prove something.

1100
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,635
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.

1101
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:38,223
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

1102
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,308
I don't know, Bill.

1103
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,811
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

1104
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,896
I think you do know.

1105
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,691
But you won't or can't tell me.

1106
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:53,655
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.

1107
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:57,325
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.

1108
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,913
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.

1109
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,666
Then it comes up again
and everything's fine.

1110
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,877
But not this time.

1111
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,673
No playwright in the world
could make me believe

1112
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,093
this would happen
between two adult people.

1113
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,555
Goodbye, Margo.

1114
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,897
Bill?

1115
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:31,026
Where are you going?

1116
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,403
To find Eve?

1117
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,617
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.

1118
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,212
(sobs)

1119
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,303
(door opens)

1120
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:02,974
Lloyd.

1121
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,812
-Lloyd, what's happened?
-Up to here, that's where I've got it.

1122
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,649
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...

1123
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,651
-Margo again.
-And again and again.

1124
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,904
-Two hours late for the audition.
-That's on time for Margo.

1125
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,908
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.

1126
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,327
-It's possible she didn't.
-She knew.

1127
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:26,498
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.

1128
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,835
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.

1129
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,256
Sensitive, understanding,
young, exciting...

1130
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,507
You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

1131
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:39,010
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about,

1132
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,097
until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.

1133
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,182
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

1134
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:47,102
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.

1135
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,438
She can play Peck's Bad Boy
all she wants and who's to stop her?

1136
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:54,693
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?

1137
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,947
It's gonna be a cozy weekend.

1138
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:02,117
-What is?
-We're driving to the country tomorrow.

1139
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,537
Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.

1140
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,457
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.

1141
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:14,170
Just be sure to lock up all blunt
instruments and throwable objects.

1142
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,883
(Karen) Newton, they say,

1143
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,304
thought of gravity
by getting hit on the head by an apple.

1144
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,973
And the man
who invented the steam-engine,

1145
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,891
he was watching a teakettle.

1146
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:31,646
But not me. My big idea came
to me just sitting on a couch.

1147
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:36,651
That boot in the rear to Margo.
Heaven knows, she had one coming.

1148
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:41,072
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
Bill, Max and so on.

1149
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:44,576
We'd all felt those size fives
of hers often enough.

1150
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:48,246
But how? The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly.

1151
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,249
I had it.

1152
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:55,587
But I let it go.
Screaming and calling names is one thing,

1153
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,756
but this could mean...

1154
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:03,928
Why not? "Why," I said to myself, "not?"

1155
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,348
It would all seem perfectly legitimate.

1156
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:09,184
And only two people in the world
would know.

1157
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:13,355
Also, the boot would land where it would
do the most good for all concerned.

1158
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,358
After all,
it was no more than a harmless joke

1159
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,527
which Margo herself
would be the first to enjoy.

1160
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:23,782
And no reason why she shouldn't
be told about it, in time.

1161
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:36,294
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

1162
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,798
Not at all. I'll wait.

1163
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:45,553
(Karen) It was a cold weekend,
outside and in.

1164
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,472
Bill didn't come at all.

1165
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:52,394
Margo didn't know where he was
and didn't care, she kept saying.

1166
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,979
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

1167
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:58,900
and by the time we drove Margo
to the station late Monday afternoon,

1168
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:04,072
she and Lloyd had thawed out
to the extent of being civil to each other.

1169
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,615
What time is it?

1170
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,326
When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.

1171
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:11,579
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...

1172
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:16,084
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.

1173
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,921
5.55. We'll be at the station
in plenty of time.

1174
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,758
That little place
"just two hours from New York."

1175
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,760
It's on my list of things
I'll never understand,

1176
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:29,180
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

1177
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:32,684
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.

1178
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,520
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

1179
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,772
Lloyd. Please.

1180
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:41,609
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.

1181
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:45,864
-Karen and I just don't want an accident.
-I don't intend to have an accident.

1182
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:50,201
It isn't important whether you do.
We are wearing long underwear.

1183
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,497
Now what's this?

1184
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,045
(car fails to start)

1185
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:12,390
But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.

1186
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:17,145
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?

1187
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,732
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.

1188
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,400
Just incredible.

1189
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:25,570
-How much time have we got?
-Roughly ten minutes.

1190
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,656
-How far is the station?
-About three or four miles.

1191
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:33,077
-Any houses where we can borrow gas?
-There's not much along this back road.

1192
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,414
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.

1193
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,710
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.

1194
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,223
("Liebestraum" by Liszt)

1195
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,439
-You want it on?
-It doesn't matter.

1196
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,275
I detest cheap sentiment.

1197
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,277
(radio off)

1198
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,117
-Karen?
-Mm-hm?

1199
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:14,369
No, thank you.

1200
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:19,123
-I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.
-We've all been a little tense lately.

1201
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,168
Come to think of it,
I haven't been very pleasant for weeks.

1202
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,295
For that, I'm truly sorry.

1203
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:28,299
More than any two people I know, I don't
want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.

1204
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:32,387
We're never deeply angry.
We just get mad the way you do.

1205
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,556
We know you too well.

1206
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,225
So many people know me.

1207
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:40,478
I wish I did.
I wish someone would tell me about me.

1208
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,481
You're Margo. Just Margo.

1209
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:48,987
And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

1210
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,867
Besides a temperament, which consists
mostly of swooping about on a broomstick

1211
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:57,245
and screaming at the top of my voice.

1212
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,831
Infants behave the way I do, you know.

1213
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,335
They carry on and misbehave.
They'd get drunk if they knew how,

1214
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,255
when they can't have what they want.

1215
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,592
When they feel unwanted or insecure or...

1216
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,344
...unloved.

1217
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:18,349
-What about Bill?
-What about Bill?

1218
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,101
He's in love with you.

1219
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:25,023
More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.

1220
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,191
And I want him to want me.

1221
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,360
But me, not Margo Channing.

1222
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,323
And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

1223
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:36,534
Well, why should he and why should you?

1224
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,620
Bill's in love with Margo Channing.

1225
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,539
He's fought with her, worked with her,
loved her.

1226
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:45,960
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.

1227
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:49,672
And what's left will be... What?

1228
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:54,052
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.

1229
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:59,140
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.

1230
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
Not to you, not to Bill.

1231
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,395
Isn’t that what they always say?

1232
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:12,070
I don't suppose the heater runs
if the motor doesn't.

1233
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:13,363
Silly, isn't it?

1234
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:17,742
You'd think they'd fix it so people
could just sit in a car and keep warm.

1235
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,912
About Eve.

1236
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,374
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.

1237
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:28,252
-Well...
-Don't fumble for excuses.

1238
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:31,089
Not here and now with my hair down.

1239
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:35,927
At best,
let's say I've been oversensitive to...

1240
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:40,932
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.

1241
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:44,268
To so many things I want to be for Bill.

1242
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,146
It's funny, a woman's career.

1243
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:51,859
The things you drop on your way up
so you can move faster.

1244
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:55,863
You forget you'll need them again
when you get back to being a woman.

1245
01:23:55,948 --> 01:24:00,868
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.

1246
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,037
Being a woman.

1247
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,748
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.

1248
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:10,128
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.

1249
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:15,299
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can

1250
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,969
look up just before dinner or

1251
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:20,722
turn around in bed and there he is.

1252
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,057
Without that, you're not a woman.

1253
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:28,646
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... A book full of clippings.

1254
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,483
But you're not a woman.

1255
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,489
Slow curtain. The end.

1256
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:45,830
Margo. Margo, I want you
to know how sorry I am about this.

1257
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,750
-About what?
-This.

1258
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,502
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1259
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,589
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.

1260
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:59,343
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.

1261
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,519
(Addison) Eve, of course, was superb.

1262
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,771
Many of the audience

1263
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,691
understandably preferred to return
another time to see Margo.

1264
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:18,279
But those who remained cheered loudly,
lustily and long for Eve.

1265
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:22,033
How thoughtful of her to call
and invite me that afternoon.

1266
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,536
And what a happy coincidence
that several representatives

1267
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:28,122
of other newspapers
happened to be present.

1268
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:30,458
All of us invited that afternoon

1269
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:33,294
to attend an understudy's performance,

1270
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,213
about which
the management knew nothing

1271
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:38,883
until they were forced
to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.

1272
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,384
Coincidence.

1273
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,804
(Bill) You were better than all right.

1274
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,474
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.

1275
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,143
Be proud of yourself.
You've got a right to be.

1276
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,312
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1277
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,398
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.

1278
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:58,986
-You shouldn't have had any doubts.
-After all, the other day was one scene.

1279
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,656
The woods
are full of one-scene sensations.

1280
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,576
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress

1281
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:08,996
-if that's what you wanna be.
-Is that what you want me to be?

1282
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:13,167
-I'm talking about you and what you want.
-So am I.

1283
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,422
-What have I got to do with it?
-Everything.

1284
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:25,721
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.

1285
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,185
Don't run away, Bill.

1286
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,771
From what would I be running?

1287
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:39,443
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?

1288
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:43,573
-I'm for it.
-Then face it. I have.

1289
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:47,118
Ever since that first night in here.

1290
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,287
I told you
what every actress should know.

1291
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:53,374
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.

1292
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,460
-Make-up's a little heavy.
-And for you.

1293
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,464
-You're quite a girl.
-You think?

1294
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:05,553
-I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
-You hear all kinds of things.

1295
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:09,557
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.

1296
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,560
-Find out.
-Only thing:

1297
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,896
what I go after I want to go after.

1298
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,064
I don't want it to come after me.

1299
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:27,825
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.

1300
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,180
(knocking)

1301
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,016
Who is it?

1302
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,811
May I come in?

1303
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,940
Certainly, Mr. DeWitt.

1304
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:06,113
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people at your feet.

1305
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:10,701
-I'm lucky they didn't throw things.
-Your performance was no surprise to me.

1306
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:14,205
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.

1307
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:18,376
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.

1308
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,712
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.

1309
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:27,051
-You're more than modest.
-It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.

1310
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,553
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

1311
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:34,058
-But if I may make a suggestion...
-Please do.

1312
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:37,228
I think the time has come
to shed some of your humility.

1313
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:41,524
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.

1314
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,652
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.

1315
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:48,823
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.

1316
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,992
If we don't blow them, who else will?

1317
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:57,498
Even so. One pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.

1318
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,669
It needn't be.

1319
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:07,425
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn,

1320
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,595
how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

1321
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:16,183
-I'm somebody.
-You certainly are.

1322
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:21,230
Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk.

1323
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,448
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.

1324
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,909
I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?

1325
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:38,456
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column about you.

1326
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,875
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

1327
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,877
Perhaps more than one.

1328
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:45,796
There's so much I want to know.
I've heard your story in part.

1329
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:48,215
Your home in Wisconsin,
your tragic marriage,

1330
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,718
your fanatical attachment to Margo.

1331
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,888
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1332
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:59,226
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1333
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:00,478
That's right.

1334
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:04,482
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilization in the California desert.

1335
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:08,903
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?

1336
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,072
Yes, I do.

1337
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:16,077
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage,

1338
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:20,331
what theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?

1339
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,500
Yes, the Shubert.

1340
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:26,754
Fine old theatre, the Shubert.
Full of tradition.

1341
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,633
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?

1342
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,511
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1343
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:36,597
-Eddie.
-Eddie what?

1344
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:44,355
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.

1345
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,273
Well, it can wait.

1346
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:49,610
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.

1347
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,947
You take charge.

1348
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,949
I believe I will.

1349
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,375
(shower running)

1350
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:13,050
(Karen) Some morning papers carried
a squib about Eve's performance.

1351
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,553
Not much, but full of praise.

1352
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,222
I couldn't imagine
how they found out about it.

1353
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:22,476
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man
probably sent out the story.

1354
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:25,896
At any rate, I felt terribly guilty
and ashamed of myself

1355
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:29,400
and wanted nothing so much
as to forget the whole thing.

1356
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,819
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

1357
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,530
just like girlfriends, with hats on.

1358
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,909
-Has Miss Channing come in?
-Not yet.

1359
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,078
Thank you.

1360
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,500
Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things about your performance.

1361
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:48,961
Relief that I managed
to stagger through it.

1362
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,087
She was magnificent.

1363
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,423
-Then you've heard, too.
-I was there.

1364
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,509
-You were at the play last night?
-A happy coincidence.

1365
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:59,847
-We're having lunch with a talent scout.
-They certainly don't waste much time.

1366
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:03,684
-It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
-They'll be wasting their time.

1367
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,854
Eve has no intention
of going to Hollywood.

1368
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:10,191
By your smart dress,
I take it your companion is a lady?

1369
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,526
-Margo.
-Margo lunching in public?

1370
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:15,446
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.

1371
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:18,073
She may be later than you think.

1372
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,288
Why not read my column
to pass the time?

1373
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,208
-The minutes will fly like hours.
-Thank you, Addison.

1374
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,960
Now we must join
our sunburned eager beaver.

1375
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,129
-Goodbye, Karen.
-Goodbye.

1376
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:57,738
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons,

1377
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:01,659
"become firmly rooted about my ears,
is lifted to Miss Harrington.

1378
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:05,746
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."

1379
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,583
I thought that one went out
with Woollcott. Now listen to this.

1380
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:14,004
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and
these columns shall report her faithfully

1381
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:18,008
"about the lamentable practice
in our theatre of permitting

1382
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:21,011
"mature actresses
to continue playing roles

1383
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:25,516
"requiring a youth and vigor
of which they retain but a dim memory."

1384
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:28,769
-I just can't believe it.
-It gets better.

1385
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:33,357
"About the understandable reluctance
of our entrenched first ladies of the stage

1386
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:36,277
"to encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses,

1387
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,947
"and Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."

1388
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,117
-I can't believe Eve said those things.
-In this rat race,

1389
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,953
everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

1390
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:50,708
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilization.

1391
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,001
What gets me

1392
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:55,796
is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.

1393
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,965
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

1394
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,801
The witch
must have sent out Indian Runners,

1395
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:06,140
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.

1396
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,516
She won't get away with it.

1397
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,977
Nor will Addison DeWitt
and his poison pen.

1398
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:13,731
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it,

1399
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:18,777
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr. DeWitt's ugly throat!

1400
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,237
(footsteps)

1401
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:34,418
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.

1402
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:48,182
Bill's here, baby.

1403
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,351
Everything's all right now.

1404
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:02,112
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call "de trop."

1405
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,907
Maybe just a little around the edges.

1406
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:21,548
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.

1407
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:24,301
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words,

1408
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:27,137
making her say what he wanted her to say.

1409
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:30,724
-Where did you get all that information?
-Eve.

1410
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:33,811
-Eve?
-She's been to see me.

1411
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:37,231
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.

1412
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:40,818
-That was a pity.
-Wanted to explain about the interview.

1413
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:44,655
Wanted to apologize to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.

1414
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,659
-I wonder why.
-She started talking and couldn't finish.

1415
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:50,828
She cried so.

1416
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:56,500
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1417
01:35:56,626 --> 01:36:01,088
-That's quite a change of subject.
-What with taxes coming up, and,

1418
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:05,092
since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...

1419
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,428
I'm trying hard to follow you.

1420
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:11,265
Instead of waiting until next season
to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,

1421
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:13,183
which is in pretty good shape,

1422
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:17,187
and if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with Aged in Wood,

1423
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:20,441
we could put Footsteps
into production right away.

1424
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:24,278
-I'm beginning to catch up.
-If we can cast it properly, that is.

1425
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:26,989
Maybe get some younger actress?

1426
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,199
Someone who'd look the part
as well as play it?

1427
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:33,954
-You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
-Now you're quoting Addison or Eve.

1428
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,457
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

1429
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,543
She'd never have the nerve
to ask to play a part like Cora.

1430
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:42,713
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.

1431
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:46,133
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.

1432
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,052
-With gestures, of course.
-To write something

1433
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:53,891
and have it realized completely.
For once, not to compromise.

1434
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,435
Lloyd Richards, do not consider

1435
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,146
giving that contemptible little worm
the part of Cora!

1436
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:04,234
-Now just a minute...
-Margo's not been exactly a compromise.

1437
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:07,988
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.

1438
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,239
Now just a minute...

1439
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:12,743
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious.

1440
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,497
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid

1441
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:19,500
and a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt.

1442
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:23,420
-She apologized, didn't she?
-On her knees, I've no doubt.

1443
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:26,673
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.

1444
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:30,761
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.

1445
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:35,641
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.

1446
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:37,184
(phone rings)

1447
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,269
Hello.

1448
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,772
Oh, hi, Margo.

1449
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,441
No, not at all.

1450
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,695
Karen and I were just chatting.

1451
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:49,821
Hm?

1452
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:55,244
Yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.

1453
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,455
Right. 11.45ish.

1454
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:02,459
See you then.

1455
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:08,966
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.

1456
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,635
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

1457
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:15,222
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.

1458
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:19,476
-I'm glad Bill's back.
-They'd die without each other.

1459
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:23,981
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part

1460
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:26,400
but there were practical difficulties.

1461
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,569
-Such as?
-You, for one.

1462
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:32,823
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would want your approval.

1463
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,075
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

1464
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:39,329
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.

1465
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:47,921
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.

1466
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:51,466
-Hear, hear.
-But you may quote me as follows.

1467
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:56,096
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play,

1468
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:02,352
"the like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."

1469
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:06,023
-He does not exaggerate. I was good.
-You were great.

1470
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:11,361
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.

1471
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,614
-Too bad.
-I'm broken up about it.

1472
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:16,533
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.

1473
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:19,119
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.

1474
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,288
I shall propose the toast,

1475
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:24,541
without wit, with all my heart.

1476
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,294
To Margo.

1477
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:30,505
-To my bride-to-be.
-Glory hallelujah.

1478
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,799
-Margo.
-Drink.

1479
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,806
-When? When are you going to do it?
-Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.

1480
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,643
-And you're going to be on time.
-Yes, sir.

1481
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,978
City Hall, that's for prizefighters
and reporters.

1482
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:48,065
I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

1483
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:52,069
It's only for the license.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.

1484
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:55,364
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.

1485
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:58,575
-What are you going to wear?
-Something simple,

1486
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,661
a fur coat over a nightgown.

1487
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:05,749
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade,

1488
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,753
we want you two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.

1489
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:13,173
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

1490
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:18,011
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.

1491
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:22,015
To each of us and all of us,
never have we been more close.

1492
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,601
May we never be farther apart.

1493
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,939
-Mrs. Richards?
-Yes.

1494
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,108
-For you.
-Thank you.

1495
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:35,362
Very indiscreet.
A note in the open like that.

1496
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,699
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.

1497
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:41,118
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this.

1498
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:44,788
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.

1499
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:50,544
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.

1500
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:55,465
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion,

1501
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,801
"but it's important that I speak with you.

1502
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,387
"'Please"' and that's underlined,

1503
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:03,473
"meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

1504
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:07,644
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.

1505
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,480
Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.

1506
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:15,569
Well, look. There's Rasputin.

1507
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:22,826
Encore du champagne.

1508
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,580
-More champagne, Miss Channing?
-That's what I said, bub.

1509
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,832
Maybe she just wants to apologize.

1510
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,752
I have no interest in anything she may say.

1511
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:35,255
But what could she say?
That's what fascinates me.

1512
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:39,676
-Go on, find out.
-Karen, in all the years of our friendship,

1513
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:43,346
I have never let you go
to the ladies' room alone.

1514
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:46,266
Now I must. I am busting to find out

1515
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:50,854
what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.

1516
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,650
Well... All right.

1517
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:02,699
Karen!

1518
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,868
How nice.

1519
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,299
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

1520
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:46,576
I was wondering
whether you'd come at all.

1521
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,579
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.

1522
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:51,748
I don't expect you to be pleasant.

1523
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,000
I don't intend to be.

1524
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:58,088
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of its easy.

1525
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:00,674
-There can't be very much.
-But there is.

1526
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:04,678
-Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
-Why should you?

1527
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:07,681
Please sit down.

1528
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:17,023
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.

1529
01:43:17,108 --> 01:43:20,360
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.

1530
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:23,947
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

1531
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,533
But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt.

1532
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,037
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

1533
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:34,374
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.

1534
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,293
It affected me strangely.

1535
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:40,130
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.

1536
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:44,301
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.

1537
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:47,804
-And you felt like that talking to Addison?
-In a way.

1538
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:50,515
You find yourself
trying to say what you mean,

1539
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,475
but somehow the words change.

1540
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,644
They become his words.

1541
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:58,982
And suddenly you're not saying
what you mean, but what he means.

1542
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:01,776
Do you expect me to believe
that you didn't say any of that?

1543
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,486
That they were all Addison?

1544
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:05,989
I don't expect you to believe anything,

1545
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:10,160
except that the responsibility
is mine, and the disgrace.

1546
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:14,080
Let's not get overdramatic.

1547
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,835
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven't you?

1548
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,005
I'll give you some pleasant news.

1549
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:26,426
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.

1550
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,012
Miss Channing should be happy
to hear that.

1551
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:32,015
To know how loyal her friends are,

1552
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:36,353
how much more loyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.

1553
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:39,356
-Eve, don't cry.
-I'm not crying.

1554
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:45,278
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?

1555
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:48,114
Some vague promises of a test.

1556
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,617
If a particular part should come along,
one of those things.

1557
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:55,038
-But the raves about your performance...
-An understudy's performance.

1558
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:59,960
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.

1559
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:04,339
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.

1560
01:45:04,674 --> 01:45:07,217
He's not my friend. You were my friends.

1561
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:10,220
-He can help you.
-I wish I'd never met him.

1562
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,389
I'd like him to be dead.

1563
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:14,557
I want my friends back.

1564
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:20,230
Eve. I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.

1565
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:24,567
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.

1566
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:27,821
-I'll never get over it.
-Oh, yes, you will.

1567
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:32,492
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is forever in the theatre.

1568
01:45:32,576 --> 01:45:36,913
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up,
burns hot,

1569
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:39,082
and it's gone.

1570
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:43,420
-I wish I could believe that.
-Give yourself time.

1571
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:46,089
Don't worry too much
about what people think.

1572
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,883
You're very young and very talented.

1573
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:54,431
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...

1574
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:56,933
There is something.

1575
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:03,940
-I think I know.
-Something most important you can do.

1576
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:08,570
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

1577
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:11,865
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.

1578
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:16,786
After all you've said. Don't you know
that part was written for Margo?

1579
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,622
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.

1580
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:25,128
-You talk just as Addison said you did.
-Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.

1581
01:46:25,463 --> 01:46:27,797
Nothing in the world
will make me say that.

1582
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,632
Addison wants me to play it.

1583
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:32,886
-Over my dead body.
-That won't be necessary.

1584
01:46:33,262 --> 01:46:36,890
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance,

1585
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:42,228
how I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.

1586
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:45,732
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.

1587
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,942
Imagine how snide
and vicious he could get,

1588
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:50,153
and still tell nothing but the truth.

1589
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:52,989
I had a time persuading him.

1590
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:57,410
You better sit down.
You look a bit wobbly.

1591
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:06,503
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.

1592
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:09,672
A simple exchange of favors.

1593
01:47:09,799 --> 01:47:13,259
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.

1594
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:17,597
Your friendship with Margo,

1595
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:20,308
your deep, close friendship.

1596
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:22,310
What would happen to it

1597
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:26,272
if she knew the cheap trick
you played on her for my benefit?

1598
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:30,151
You and Lloyd, how long,
even in the theatre,

1599
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,490
before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?

1600
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:39,202
No.

1601
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:44,707
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.

1602
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:47,335
So much better theatre, too.

1603
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,213
A part in a play.

1604
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:54,801
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

1605
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,804
I'd do much more for a part that good.

1606
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:23,204
Hungry?

1607
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:28,668
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

1608
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:32,589
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.

1609
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,757
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

1610
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:39,512
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

1611
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:41,764
I discussed it very openly.

1612
01:48:41,849 --> 01:48:44,434
I told her I'd spoken to Lloyd,
and that he was interested.

1613
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:48,771
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?

1614
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:52,692
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.

1615
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:57,363
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I play it.

1616
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:01,117
Just like that, eh?

1617
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:03,786
Just like that.

1618
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:07,749
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.

1619
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:12,378
-I don't think that's funny.
-It wasn't meant to be.

1620
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:16,216
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.

1621
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,219
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason,

1622
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:21,638
when I need you more than ever.

1623
01:49:21,764 --> 01:49:24,307
I hope you mean what you say.

1624
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,893
I intend to hold you to it.

1625
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:31,314
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.

1626
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:44,827
-Well, what happened?
-Nothing much. She apologized.

1627
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:46,913
-With tears?
-With tears.

1628
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:50,917
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.

1629
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,503
-Check.
-Very classy. Lots of technique.

1630
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:58,424
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologize? What did you say?

1631
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:01,177
Not much.

1632
01:50:03,681 --> 01:50:06,599
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1633
01:50:06,684 --> 01:50:11,104
-What would you like? Texas?
-I want everybody to shut up about Eve.

1634
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:14,023
Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.

1635
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:16,276
Give Karen more wine.

1636
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,444
Never have I been so happy.

1637
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:21,698
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

1638
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:26,119
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.

1639
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:30,540
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me,

1640
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:35,128
waiting for me to crack that little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.

1641
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:39,632
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.

1642
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,969
There they go.

1643
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,805
There goes Eve.

1644
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:49,017
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

1645
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:53,229
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?

1646
01:50:53,355 --> 01:50:55,815
Something about the good
they leave behind.

1647
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:58,234
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.

1648
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,070
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.

1649
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:04,824
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.

1650
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:09,495
The four of us here together,
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.

1651
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,417
And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.

1652
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:17,170
You know, she probably
means well after all.

1653
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:20,715
-She is a louse.
-Never try to outguess Margo.

1654
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:23,593
-Groom?
-Yes, dear.

1655
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:26,012
-Do you know what I'm going to be?
-A cowboy?

1656
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:29,182
-A married lady.
-With a paper to prove it.

1657
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:33,102
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.

1658
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:36,564
-Remember, Karen?
-I remember.

1659
01:51:37,441 --> 01:51:41,444
-You'll be there, won't you?
-Often enough to keep the franchise.

1660
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:44,197
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

1661
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:47,033
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.

1662
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:50,286
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?

1663
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:53,748
-That depends.
-No, I mean deeply angry.

1664
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,209
I don't think I could be.

1665
01:51:56,293 --> 01:51:59,295
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

1666
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,882
-What?
-You're always so touchy about his plays.

1667
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:07,387
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me anymore.

1668
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:11,808
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.

1669
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:14,394
What's your being married
got to do with it?

1670
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:17,814
It means I've finally got a life to live.

1671
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,817
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for

1672
01:52:20,943 --> 01:52:24,320
just because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.

1673
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:27,824
Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.

1674
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:32,829
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don't you?

1675
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:42,255
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

1676
01:52:42,673 --> 01:52:46,175
-Nothing?
-Everything. Everything's so funny.

1677
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:00,857
(Karen) Lloyd never got around to asking

1678
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:05,027
whether it was all right with me
for Eve to play Cora.

1679
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:10,199
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct
the play at first, with Eve in it.

1680
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:13,035
Lloyd and Max finally won him over.

1681
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,121
Margo never came to rehearsal.

1682
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:19,208
"Too much to do around the house,"
she said.

1683
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:23,296
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd
to fight as bitterly and often,

1684
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:26,048
and always over some business for Eve,

1685
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:29,552
or a move, or the way she read a speech.

1686
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:33,556
But I'd never known Lloyd
to meddle as much with Bill's directing,

1687
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,893
as far as it affected Eve, that is.

1688
01:53:37,019 --> 01:53:39,645
Somehow Eve kept them going.

1689
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:43,232
Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.

1690
01:53:47,154 --> 01:53:51,491
And I thought it might be best
if I skipped rehearsals from then on.

1691
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:57,497
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen. And here it was.

1692
01:53:57,581 --> 01:54:02,502
I felt helpless. That helplessness you
feel when you have no talent to offer,

1693
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:04,837
outside of loving your husband.

1694
01:54:04,922 --> 01:54:08,925
How could I compete?
Everything Lloyd loved about me,

1695
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,093
he'd gotten used to long ago.

1696
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:12,678
(phone rings)

1697
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:18,184
Hello?

1698
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:20,603
Who? Who's calling Mr. Richards?

1699
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:24,774
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.

1700
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,444
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.

1701
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:30,696
She doesn't want a doctor and...

1702
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:33,199
Who is it? What's it all about?

1703
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:37,787
-Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
-Oh, no. Eve didn't say to call him.

1704
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:41,207
I saw Mr. Richards with her
a couple of times.

1705
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:43,292
I thought, they being such good friends...

1706
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:46,546
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.

1707
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,966
Hello, Mr. Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.

1708
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,803
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling,

1709
01:54:53,929 --> 01:54:57,723
I've been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrow for New Haven.

1710
01:54:57,808 --> 01:55:00,893
Tell her not to worry.
Tell her I'll be right over.

1711
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:22,832
(Addison) To the theatre world,
New Haven, Connecticut,

1712
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:27,753
is a short stretch of sidewalk between
the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,

1713
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:31,340
surrounded by what looks
very much like a small city.

1714
01:55:31,466 --> 01:55:36,429
It is here that managers have
what are called out-of-town openings,

1715
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:40,808
which are openings for New Yorkers
who want to go out of town.

1716
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:44,854
What a day. What a heavenly day.

1717
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,024
-D-day.
-Just like it.

1718
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,067
Tomorrow morning,
you will have won your beachhead

1719
01:55:50,152 --> 01:55:52,445
on the shores of immortality.

1720
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:54,655
Stop rehearsing your column.

1721
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:57,617
Isn’t it strange, Addison?

1722
01:55:57,701 --> 01:56:01,912
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.

1723
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:06,208
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.

1724
01:56:06,376 --> 01:56:08,628
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1725
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,380
-Aren't you?
-Frankly, yes.

1726
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:20,056
It'll be a night to remember.

1727
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:22,892
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

1728
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,645
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.

1729
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:29,982
-All paved with diamonds and gold?
-You know me better than that.

1730
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:32,151
Paved with what, then?

1731
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:35,154
Stars.

1732
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,240
What time?

1733
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:40,409
Almost four.

1734
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:43,329
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

1735
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:45,915
We rehearsed most of last night.

1736
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:48,250
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

1737
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:51,420
-Why not?
-The mark of a true killer.

1738
01:56:52,381 --> 01:56:55,591
Sleep tight, rest easy
and come out fighting.

1739
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:58,427
Why did you call me a killer?

1740
01:56:58,512 --> 01:57:02,765
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.

1741
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:07,436
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1742
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:10,022
I've got something to tell you.

1743
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:23,202
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.

1744
01:57:23,286 --> 01:57:28,124
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.

1745
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:33,879
-Can I fix you a drink?
-With the reluctant compliments of Max?

1746
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:36,465
Lloyd. I never have any.

1747
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:39,802
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.

1748
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:43,973
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.

1749
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:47,560
That's for tonight. You're invited.

1750
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:50,896
We're having everyone up
after the performance.

1751
01:57:50,981 --> 01:57:52,982
"We are?"

1752
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:55,151
Lloyd and I.

1753
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:59,321
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.

1754
01:57:59,406 --> 01:58:01,991
-Addison...
-She was always so devoted to Lloyd.

1755
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:04,285
One would think only death
could keep her...

1756
01:58:04,369 --> 01:58:05,828
Addison.

1757
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:12,501
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.

1758
01:58:12,586 --> 01:58:14,378
Oh, yes.
Something about an old road ending

1759
01:58:14,463 --> 01:58:17,173
and a new one starting,
all paved with stars.

1760
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:19,842
I didn't mean just the theatre.

1761
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:22,011
What else?

1762
01:58:24,765 --> 01:58:27,308
Lloyd Richards.

1763
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:31,312
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.

1764
01:58:32,647 --> 01:58:35,608
So that's it. Lloyd.

1765
01:58:35,692 --> 01:58:38,444
Still just the theatre, after all.

1766
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,529
It's nothing of the kind.

1767
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:42,823
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

1768
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,742
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves.

1769
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:47,369
I leave those to Louisa May Alcott.
But I know you.

1770
01:58:47,496 --> 01:58:49,205
I'm in love with Lloyd.

1771
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,374
He is a commercially
successful playwright.

1772
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:56,295
-You have no right to say that.
-And, artistically, very promising.

1773
01:58:56,379 --> 01:58:58,672
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

1774
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:03,219
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1775
01:59:03,303 --> 01:59:06,806
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling how far we can go.

1776
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:10,476
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.

1777
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,479
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.

1778
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:15,648
-And Karen.
-She doesn't know.

1779
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:18,734
-She knows enough not to be here.
-But not all of it.

1780
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,987
-Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
-I see.

1781
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:25,741
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1782
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:29,328
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.

1783
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:32,665
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

1784
01:59:32,749 --> 01:59:36,418
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.

1785
01:59:36,545 --> 01:59:38,921
The setting wasn't romantic,

1786
01:59:39,047 --> 01:59:41,090
but Lloyd was.

1787
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:44,510
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.

1788
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:48,097
He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.

1789
01:59:48,223 --> 01:59:52,768
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.

1790
01:59:52,853 --> 01:59:55,771
We sat and talked until it was light.

1791
01:59:55,856 --> 01:59:58,190
He never went home.

1792
01:59:58,275 --> 02:00:02,695
-You sat and talked until it was light?
-We sat and talked, Addison.

1793
02:00:03,697 --> 02:00:06,240
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

1794
02:00:07,868 --> 02:00:12,037
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.

1795
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,624
Well, say something. Anything.

1796
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:18,377
Congratulations. Skål. Good work, Eve.

1797
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,344
What do you take me for?

1798
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:29,972
I don't know
that I "take you" for anything.

1799
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:33,225
Is it possible that you've confused me

1800
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:36,478
with those backward children
you've played tricks on?

1801
02:00:36,563 --> 02:00:39,398
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?

1802
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,151
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.

1803
02:00:42,277 --> 02:00:44,820
Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.

1804
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:49,950
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.

1805
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:54,413
-I never intended you to be.
-Yes, you did, and you still do.

1806
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,167
I don't know what you mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...

1807
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:02,087
-It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
-Champion to champion.

1808
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:05,174
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.

1809
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:07,968
Please say what you have to say,
plainly and distinctly,

1810
02:01:08,053 --> 02:01:09,595
and then let me take my nap.

1811
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:15,517
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.

1812
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:19,438
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.

1813
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:23,859
-What do you mean by that?
-More plainly and more distinctly?

1814
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:27,529
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams,

1815
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:30,449
or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.

1816
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:34,286
I came to tell you that you will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,

1817
02:01:34,371 --> 02:01:36,455
because I will not permit it.

1818
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:39,166
-What have you got to do with it?
-Everything.

1819
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:42,878
Because after tonight
you will belong to me.

1820
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:46,382
Belong? To you?

1821
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:49,385
I can't believe my ears.

1822
02:01:49,511 --> 02:01:51,470
A dull cliché.

1823
02:01:51,554 --> 02:01:53,722
"Belong" to you?

1824
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:57,059
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.

1825
02:01:57,143 --> 02:02:00,312
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.

1826
02:02:00,397 --> 02:02:02,481
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

1827
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:06,068
I'd hoped that you would have
taken it for granted that you and I...

1828
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:08,237
"Taken it for granted?"

1829
02:02:08,363 --> 02:02:10,406
"That you and I...?"

1830
02:02:15,495 --> 02:02:18,664
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.

1831
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:21,750
At anything or anyone else,
but never at me.

1832
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:29,174
-Get out.
-You're too short for that gesture.

1833
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:31,760
Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.

1834
02:02:32,929 --> 02:02:36,098
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.

1835
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:39,184
Don't pick up that phone.
Don't even touch it.

1836
02:02:39,269 --> 02:02:41,770
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?

1837
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:45,691
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.

1838
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:49,236
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.

1839
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:55,117
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.

1840
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:56,326
What of it?

1841
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:59,038
True, your parents were poor,
and still are.

1842
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:01,373
They would like to know how you are.

1843
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:03,876
They haven't heard from you
for three years.

1844
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:06,045
What of it?

1845
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:08,797
A matter of opinion, granted.

1846
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:11,383
It's also true you worked in a brewery.

1847
02:03:11,468 --> 02:03:15,137
But life there was not as dull
as you pictured it.

1848
02:03:15,221 --> 02:03:20,059
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.

1849
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:24,063
-She never proved a thing!
-But the $500 you got to get out of town

1850
02:03:24,147 --> 02:03:27,399
brought you straight to New York,
didn't it?

1851
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:38,327
That $500 brought you
straight to New York.

1852
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:40,329
She was a liar. She was a liar!

1853
02:03:40,413 --> 02:03:44,083
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?

1854
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:50,839
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.

1855
02:03:51,049 --> 02:03:53,926
That was not only a lie,
it was an insult to dead heroes

1856
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,053
and the women who loved them.

1857
02:03:56,137 --> 02:04:00,349
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.

1858
02:04:00,475 --> 02:04:04,103
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.

1859
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:06,146
I had to get in to meet Margo.

1860
02:04:06,231 --> 02:04:09,358
I had to say something, be somebody.
Make her like me!

1861
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:11,777
She did like you.
She helped and trusted you.

1862
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:14,780
-You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
-That's not true!

1863
02:04:14,864 --> 02:04:19,034
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.

1864
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:23,539
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.

1865
02:04:23,623 --> 02:04:26,708
-You lied to me about it.
-No!

1866
02:04:26,876 --> 02:04:29,628
I had lunch with Karen
not three hours ago.

1867
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:34,716
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.

1868
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,010
Now do you want to change your story

1869
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:39,805
about Lloyd beating at your door
that night?

1870
02:04:39,889 --> 02:04:41,723
Please, please.

1871
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:51,483
That I should want you at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.

1872
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:55,237
But that in itself is probably the reason.

1873
02:04:55,321 --> 02:05:00,159
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.

1874
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:04,580
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.

1875
02:05:04,664 --> 02:05:08,417
Insatiable ambition and talent.

1876
02:05:08,543 --> 02:05:12,004
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?

1877
02:05:14,257 --> 02:05:17,217
-Then say so.
-Yes, Addison.

1878
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:21,555
And you realize and you agree
how completely you belong to me?

1879
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:23,599
Yes, Addison.

1880
02:05:24,267 --> 02:05:27,603
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.

1881
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:34,860
I won't play tonight.

1882
02:05:34,944 --> 02:05:39,531
I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.

1883
02:05:39,616 --> 02:05:43,869
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.

1884
02:05:58,009 --> 02:05:59,259
(door closes)

1885
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:05,557
(Addison) And she gave
the performance of her life.

1886
02:06:05,642 --> 02:06:08,393
And it was a night to remember,
that night.

1887
02:06:08,478 --> 02:06:11,104
(applause and cheering)

1888
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:21,657
Honored members of
the Sarah Siddons Society,

1889
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:25,160
distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

1890
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,914
What is there for me to say?

1891
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:32,501
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said

1892
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:37,005
by minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.

1893
02:06:37,131 --> 02:06:40,592
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.

1894
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:43,178
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

1895
02:06:43,304 --> 02:06:46,431
and have much to learn from all of you.

1896
02:06:46,516 --> 02:06:50,185
Let me say only that I am proud and happy,

1897
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:54,189
and that I regard this great honor

1898
02:06:54,274 --> 02:06:57,442
not so much as an award
for what I have achieved,

1899
02:06:57,527 --> 02:07:00,946
but as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.

1900
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:02,698
(applause)

1901
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:08,203
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.

1902
02:07:09,372 --> 02:07:13,875
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre,

1903
02:07:14,002 --> 02:07:16,545
and to the theatre itself

1904
02:07:16,671 --> 02:07:19,548
which has given me all I have.

1905
02:07:21,009 --> 02:07:25,178
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.

1906
02:07:26,681 --> 02:07:30,309
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

1907
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:34,980
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian,

1908
02:07:35,064 --> 02:07:38,900
who took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.

1909
02:07:43,573 --> 02:07:47,159
To my first friend in the theatre,

1910
02:07:47,243 --> 02:07:51,163
whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget,

1911
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:53,749
Karen. Mrs. Lloyd Richards.

1912
02:07:59,922 --> 02:08:03,925
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolized,

1913
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:07,346
one who became
my benefactress and champion.

1914
02:08:08,556 --> 02:08:12,392
A great actress and a great woman,

1915
02:08:12,769 --> 02:08:14,311
Margo Channing.

1916
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:15,729
(cheering)

1917
02:08:19,776 --> 02:08:22,194
To my director,

1918
02:08:22,278 --> 02:08:27,199
who demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide,

1919
02:08:27,283 --> 02:08:30,035
but who taught me patiently and well,

1920
02:08:31,621 --> 02:08:33,080
Bill Sampson.

1921
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,498
(applause)

1922
02:08:36,542 --> 02:08:40,629
And one without whose
great play and faith in me,

1923
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:44,132
this night could never have been.

1924
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:46,510
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1925
02:08:46,594 --> 02:08:47,928
(applause)

1926
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,807
How can I repay the many others,

1927
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:54,976
so many,
I couldn't possibly name them all,

1928
02:08:55,103 --> 02:08:58,146
whose help, guidance, and advice

1929
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:04,820
have made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.

1930
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:13,245
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film,

1931
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:16,665
do not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.

1932
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:18,917
How could I?

1933
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:21,837
My heart is here in the theatre,

1934
02:09:21,963 --> 02:09:26,425
and 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.

1935
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:29,511
I'll be back to claim it, and soon.

1936
02:09:31,264 --> 02:09:35,183
That is, if you want me back.

1937
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:44,943
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.

1938
02:09:52,535 --> 02:09:57,038
For services rendered beyond
whatever it is of duty, darling.

1939
02:10:01,836 --> 02:10:07,132
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor.

1940
02:10:09,886 --> 02:10:12,721
-Congratulations, Eve.
-Thank you, Karen.

1941
02:10:16,017 --> 02:10:19,978
-Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
-Oh, thank you so much.

1942
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:25,650
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much about your heart.

1943
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:29,529
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.

1944
02:10:32,033 --> 02:10:34,075
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1945
02:10:34,202 --> 02:10:36,995
-You can have one at Max's.
-I don't think I'm going.

1946
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:41,082
-Why not?
-Because I don't want to.

1947
02:10:41,209 --> 02:10:44,753
-I'm so happy for you, Eve.
-Thank you so much.

1948
02:10:46,255 --> 02:10:47,839
Max has gone to a lot of trouble.

1949
02:10:47,924 --> 02:10:51,343
This is going to be an elaborate party
and it's for you.

1950
02:10:51,427 --> 02:10:54,930
No, it isn't. It's for this.

1951
02:10:55,056 --> 02:10:57,766
-It's the same thing, isn't it?
-Exactly.

1952
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,937
Here, take it to the party instead of me.

1953
02:11:02,021 --> 02:11:04,272
You're being very childish.

1954
02:11:04,357 --> 02:11:08,527
-I'm tired. I want to go home.
-Very well. I'll drop you off.

1955
02:11:08,611 --> 02:11:12,280
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.

1956
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:40,952
-Who are you?
-Miss Harrington.

1957
02:12:41,037 --> 02:12:44,831
-What are you doing here?
-I... I guess I fell asleep.

1958
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,047
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.

1959
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:56,051
-How did you get in here?
-I hid outside till the maid came in.

1960
02:12:56,177 --> 02:12:58,970
She went out to get something
and left the door open.

1961
02:12:59,055 --> 02:13:03,141
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.

1962
02:13:03,225 --> 02:13:06,978
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.

1963
02:13:07,063 --> 02:13:10,649
-Then I guess I fell asleep.
-You were just looking around?

1964
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,651
-That's all.
-What for?

1965
02:13:12,735 --> 02:13:15,403
-You probably won't believe me.
-Probably not.

1966
02:13:15,529 --> 02:13:17,989
-It was for my report.
-What report? To whom?

1967
02:13:18,074 --> 02:13:20,909
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear,

1968
02:13:21,035 --> 02:13:25,163
what kind of perfume
and books, things like that.

1969
02:13:25,247 --> 02:13:29,250
You know the Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?

1970
02:13:29,377 --> 02:13:33,338
-I've heard of them.
-Ours was one of the first, Erasmus Hall.

1971
02:13:33,422 --> 02:13:37,759
-I'm the president.
-Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

1972
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:42,263
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.

1973
02:13:42,348 --> 02:13:44,766
Of course, they're just movie stars.

1974
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:47,519
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

1975
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:48,770
Mm-hm.

1976
02:13:48,938 --> 02:13:52,607
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.

1977
02:13:52,692 --> 02:13:54,776
I might.

1978
02:13:58,781 --> 02:14:01,700
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

1979
02:14:01,784 --> 02:14:04,285
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

1980
02:14:05,204 --> 02:14:08,123
-I'll just clean up the mess.
-Don't bother.

1981
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:12,043
-How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
-Subway.

1982
02:14:13,129 --> 02:14:15,380
How long does it take?

1983
02:14:15,464 --> 02:14:18,383
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.

1984
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:22,137
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.

1985
02:14:23,973 --> 02:14:26,057
I don't care if I never get home.

1986
02:14:26,142 --> 02:14:27,392
(buzzer)

1987
02:14:28,436 --> 02:14:30,478
That's the door.

1988
02:14:33,607 --> 02:14:35,650
You rest. I'll get it.

1989
02:14:43,826 --> 02:14:46,161
Hello. Who are you?

1990
02:14:46,996 --> 02:14:50,999
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.

1991
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:53,168
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

1992
02:14:53,294 --> 02:14:58,423
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?

1993
02:14:59,675 --> 02:15:02,677
Tell me, how did you know my name?

1994
02:15:03,471 --> 02:15:06,181
It's a very famous name, Mr. DeWitt.

1995
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:08,683
-And what's your name?
-Phoebe.

1996
02:15:09,351 --> 02:15:12,353
-Phoebe?
-I call myself Phoebe.

1997
02:15:13,689 --> 02:15:15,607
And why not?

1998
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:21,029
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?

1999
02:15:21,113 --> 02:15:26,534
-More than anything else in the world.
-Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.

2000
02:15:27,703 --> 02:15:30,622
Miss Harrington knows all about it.

2001
02:15:39,173 --> 02:15:41,299
(Eve) Who was it?

2002
02:15:41,383 --> 02:15:43,551
Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.

2003
02:15:43,677 --> 02:15:47,555
You left your award in his cab,
and he brought it back.

2004
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:51,643
(Eve) Put it on one of the trunks,
will you? I wanna pack it.

2005
02:15:51,727 --> 02:15:53,853
Sure, Miss Harrington.

2006
02:18:13,953 --> 02:18:14,953
