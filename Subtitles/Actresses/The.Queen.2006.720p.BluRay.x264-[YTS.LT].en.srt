1
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,312
After weeks of campaigning on the road...

2
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:42,391
Tony Blair and his family,
finally strolled the few hundred yards

3
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:45,207
to the polling station,
this election day morning.

4
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,791
Amongst the Labour faithful
up and down the country...

5
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,083
there is an enormous sense
of pride in Mr. Blair's achievements.

6
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,915
And the confidence
that he is about to become

7
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,040
the youngest Prime Minister
this century.

8
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,831
Have you voted yet,
Mr. Crawford?

9
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:58,935
Yes, Ma'am...

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,849
I was there when they opened,

11
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:02,956
first in line, at 7 o'clock...

12
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,649
I don't mind telling you...

13
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:08,817
It wasn't for Mr. Blair.

14
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,498
-Your not a moderniser then?
-Certainly not...

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,915
We're in danger of losing too much,
that is good about this country, as it is.

16
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,685
There is a growing sense
of excitement...

17
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,247
I envy you, being able to vote.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,851
Not the actually
ticking of the box, although...

19
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,787
it would be nice
to experience that once.

20
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,955
But the sheer joy of being partial.

21
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:35,281
Yes...

22
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,665
Of course one forgets
that as Sovereign,

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,124
you're not entitled to vote.

24
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:41,346
No...

25
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,289
Still, you won't catch me
feeling sorry for you.

26
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:48,555
You might not
be allowed to vote, Ma'am...

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,330
but it is your government.

28
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:55,190
Yes...

29
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,822
I suppose that is some consolation.

30
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:01,504
Good morning.

31
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,202
-Shall I draw the curtains.
-Yes...

32
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:09,906
So, did you stay up all night?

33
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:11,910
Yes, Ma'am.

34
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:14,334
And was it as expected?

35
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,109
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:17,819
Mr. Blair.

37
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:19,817
By a landslide.

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,242
Oh, I see...

39
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:29,226
They've stopped the traffic, completely...

40
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,730
For Tony Blair's first
day of power, in London.

41
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,557
You got the ceremonial
with tourists, the official...

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,939
and you got
a lovely summer's day...

43
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,147
Tony Blair waving to the crowds,
people waving to them there...

44
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,463
I guess most of them
do know it's the...

45
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,462
the Prime Minister waiting...
Lining in the streets there.

46
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,753
The Prime Minister
is on his way, Ma'am.

47
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,680
To be, Robin...
The Prime Minister to be...

48
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,292
I haven't asked him yet.

49
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:03,654
He's a hard one to read,
isn't he?

50
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,451
Yes... On the one hand his
background is quite establishment...

51
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,677
father a conservative,
educated at Fettis.

52
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,520
Where he was tutored by the same
man as the Prince of Wales.

53
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,461
Well, we'll try not
to hold that against him.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,125
On the other, his manifesto promises
the most radical modernisation...

55
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:23,122
and shake up of the
constitution in 300 years.

56
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,535
Oh, you mean he is
going to try and modernise us?

57
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,112
I wouldn't let it past him...

58
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,667
he's married to a woman with known
anti-monarchist sympathies...

59
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:33,773
you may remember her curtsy,
the first time you met.

60
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,642
It could best
be described as... shallow.

61
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:42,467
I don't measure the depth of a
curtsy, Robin. I leave that to my sister.

62
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:46,008
The atmosphere at Downing Street
is expected to very informal...

63
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:48,215
Everyone on first name terms...

64
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,377
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

65
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,038
-What, as in call me Tony?
-Yes, Ma'am.

66
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,303
Oh, I don't like that.

67
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,083
Could we send him a protocol sheet?

68
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,851
Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

69
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,968
Why? You've met her
often enough before.

70
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,487
I know, but...
never one to one...

71
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,890
and never as Prime Minister.

72
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,623
Well, just remember...

73
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,516
you're a man that's just been
elected by the whole nation.

74
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:22,927
But she's still...

75
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:24,418
you know...

76
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,127
The Queen.

77
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,432
When we reach the
audience room...

78
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:43,014
I will knock. We will not wait to be called...
we shall go straight inside.

79
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,771
Standing by the door,
we bow... from the neck...

80
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,287
I will introduce you...

81
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,895
The Queen will extend her hand...
you go to her...

82
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:53,999
bow again...
then shake her hand.

83
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,942
A couple of other things...

84
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,788
It's Ma'am as in ham...

85
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,177
not mam as in farm.

86
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,746
And when you're in the presence...

87
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,855
at no point must you
show your back.

88
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,186
-The presence?
-Yes, sir...

89
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,082
That's what it is called, when you're
in Her Majesty's company.

90
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:19,458
Would you like
to sit down, Mrs. Blair?

91
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,312
How nice to see you
again, Mr. Blair.

92
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,011
And congratulations.

93
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:43,611
The children must be very proud?

94
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,136
-I hope so.
-You have three, haven't you?

95
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,878
-That's right.
-Oh, how lovely.

96
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,627
Such a blessing... children.

97
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:50,875
Please, do sit down.

98
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:51,848
Thank you.

99
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,709
Have they shown you how to
start a nuclear war, yet?

100
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,058
Ah, no...

101
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,498
Oh, first thing we do.
Apparently...

102
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:11,581
Then we take away your passport,

103
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:14,688
and spend the rest of the time
sending you around the world.

104
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:17,225
You obviously know my job,
better than I do...

105
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,948
Well you are my 10th
Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.

106
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,226
My first, of course,
was Winston Churchill

107
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,538
he sat in your chair... in a frock coat...
and top hat.

108
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,442
He was kind enough to give,
a shy young girl like me,

109
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:31,545
quite an education.

110
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,041
I can imagine...

111
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:36,947
With time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education.

112
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:37,985
And a little wisdom...

113
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,761
better enabling us to execute our
constitutional responsibility.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,807
To advise, guide, and warn
the government of the day.

115
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,251
Advise which I...

116
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,248
look forward to receiving.

117
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,193
Yes, we'll save that for
our weekly meetings.

118
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,693
If there's nothing else, I believe we
have some business to attend to.

119
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,459
Of course...

120
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,235
Your Majesty, my party has
won the election...

121
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:11,169
so I come now to ask your
permission to form a govern...

122
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,463
No, Mr. Blair.
Mr. Blair, I ask the question.

123
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,548
The duty falls upon me
as your Sovereign

124
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:20,098
to invite you
to become Prime Minister...

125
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,141
and to form a
government in my name.

126
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,137
And if you agree,
the custom is to say yes...

127
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:30,323
Yes...

128
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,754
Mrs. Blair...
Lovely to see you again.

129
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,006
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

130
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,165
-Yes...
-And exhausted, I imagine...

131
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,782
Where will you be spending
the summer?

132
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:05,744
-France.
-Oh, lovely.

133
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,395
-You'll be at Balmoral, right?
-Yes, I can't wait. It's a wonderful place.

134
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,399
You know my great great
grandmother Victoria said of it...

135
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,629
in Balmoral all seems to breed...

136
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,979
freedom and peace and make one
forget the world and its sad turmoils.

137
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,547
Oh, excuse me.

138
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:29,614
Oh, yes of course...

139
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,313
I'm so sorry, we're going to
have to leave it there.

140
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,443
Not to short was it?
15 minutes...

141
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:50,875
One doesn't want to be rude.

142
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:51,619
No, no.

143
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,764
Thank you very much
for coming, now fuck off!

144
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,115
I know,
what was all that about?

145
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,221
God knows...

146
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,234
Diana. Whatever it is it will
be something to do with Diana.

147
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,543
Princess Diana embroiled
in more controversy

148
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:10,003
as she pulls out
of a meeting with MP's...

149
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,815
Princess Diana moved today
to patch up

150
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:15,125
her relations with
the former royal nanny...

151
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:18,088
Princess Diana flew to Milan today
for the memorial service

152
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,178
for the murdered
Italian fashion designer...

153
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,415
Gianni Versace.

154
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:24,361
Where tonight, another royal
controversy sparkles...

155
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:28,214
after finding herself embroiled
in her second controversy this week...

156
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:30,012
I am not a political figure...

157
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,286
Princess Diana sailed out
into the Mediterranean...

158
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,187
in one of Mr. Mohamed
al-Fayed's yachts today...

159
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,964
with his son.

160
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,526
A quarter of a
million pounds, for photographs

161
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,735
which appear
to show the couple embracing...

162
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,701
Once again,
her judgement's under scrutiny...

163
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,344
Robin Janvrin.

164
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:52,873
What?

165
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:10,041
I want everyone in, ASAP.

166
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:21,966
Ma'am?

167
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,244
Ma'am?

168
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,026
Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin
is here to see you.

169
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:31,157
What?

170
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:42,967
Good evening, Ma'am.

171
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,792
I'm sorry to disturb.

172
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:48,080
But I just had a call from
our Embassy in Paris.

173
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,626
It's The Princess of Wales.

174
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,528
Why? What's she done now?

175
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,654
I see, em...

176
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:57,995
Who are we speaking to then?

177
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:01,541
Right, well keep me updated.

178
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,407
It's Diana, she's been in
a car accident in Paris.

179
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:10,005
Is it serious?

180
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,660
Apparently... Dodi Fayed is dead.

181
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,293
Let's just recap on the
details of those injuries, Maxine.

182
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,075
Yes Nick, what they're saying is...

183
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:23,782
that the Princess is in the intensive
care unit of a south-east Paris hospital.

184
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:26,066
She has a concussion,
a broken arm, and...

185
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:29,397
What was she doing in Paris? I thought
she was supposed to be in London.

186
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,154
Oh, you know what she's like.

187
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,104
Charles, isn't this awful?

188
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:40,829
What are you
going to do about the boys?

189
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,046
Let them sleep until we know more.

190
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,398
Yes, that's sensible.

191
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:48,829
I should go to Paris. I told
my people to start organising a jet.

192
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,829
-What, a private one?
-Yes...

193
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,775
Isn't that precisely the sort of
extravagance they always attack us for?

194
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,112
How else am I supposed to
get to Paris at this time of night?

195
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,400
The airport at Aberdeen
will be closed.

196
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,503
Charles...

197
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,746
Use the royal flight.

198
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:06,485
They keep one plane on
permanent standby...

199
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,180
in case I should kick the bucket.

200
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,597
No mummy! That's out of the question.
This isn't a matter of state.

201
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:13,244
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:16,241
Diana is no longer a member
of the royal family.

203
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:19,239
She's not a HRH.
This is a private matter.

204
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:20,956
She's mother to your grandchildren.

205
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:25,470
-What is happening now?
-I don't know... I can't hear...

206
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:26,748
everyone's shouting.

207
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,257
Thank's for coming in.

208
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,017
The Ambassador, from Paris.

209
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,372
Good evening, sir.

210
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,059
Yes?

211
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:03,168
I have just spoken to
our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am...

212
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:06,077
I'm afraid it's not good news...

213
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:07,436
No!

214
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,882
No,

215
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:14,082
no, no...

216
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:26,705
Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died, after a car crash in Paris.

217
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,583
The French government
announced her death

218
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,467
just before
5 o'clock this morning.

219
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,931
What have I got on this week?

220
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:35,685
You're writing your maiden
conference speeches, Prime Minister.

221
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:37,894
Well, let's cancel everything else.

222
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,050
This is going to be massive...

223
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,979
I'd better make a statement
in the morning.

224
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,081
Well, you'll be pleased to know I've
already started coming up with ideas.

225
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,122
God, she's only been dead an hour...

226
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,257
Well, would you prefer
I didn't do my job?

227
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:26,374
They're going go to
go back to sleep.

228
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,716
Try anyway...

229
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,758
My private secretary's
office have...

230
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:46,476
found a travel agency open
in New York that will...

231
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:50,543
sell me a flight to Paris, with
an hours stop over in Manchester.

232
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,912
Perhaps now you might
like to consider whether it's

233
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,290
still an extravagance
to bring back the mother...

234
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:59,685
of the future King of England...

235
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,827
in one of our planes.

236
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,477
Alright...

237
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:04,639
of course.

238
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,853
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset...

239
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,137
first thing in the morning,
I want the radio taken

240
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:26,510
out of the bedroom, and the
television taken out of the nursery.

241
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:27,420
Yes, Ma'am.

242
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,385
Well, well, well...

243
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,026
Yes.

244
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,851
Are you alright?

245
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,615
Your sister called.

246
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:47,285
From Tuscany.

247
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,583
Well, I hope you told her to
come back, cut her holiday short.

248
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,567
I did.

249
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,659
I can't imagine she
was pleased...

250
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,290
That's putting it mildly.

251
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,992
-What did she say?
-Something about Diana managing...

252
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,024
to be even more annoying
dead than alive...

253
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,419
Just make sure you never let
the boys hear you talk like that.

254
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,659
Of course...

255
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,968
Something to help you go down.

256
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,744
No, I think I'll write
my diary a little longer.

257
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:17,801
Fine.

258
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:19,569
I'm going to bed.

259
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:55,338
We've heard nothing official from
the Palace yet, we still don't know

260
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,303
when we're gonna get any further
statements from inside the Palace...

261
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,998
Or of course when the royal
family are due back.

262
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:05,489
That's how she will remain,
in our minds, our hearts...

263
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:07,024
forever.

264
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:09,512
OK?
Got it!

265
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:10,813
Where will you do it?

266
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,649
We'll do it at the church.
On the way in.

267
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,187
Alright, I'll organise it.

268
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:19,967
Hang on...
I wanna watch this.

269
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:26,173
This is not the time for
incriminations, but for sadness...

270
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,025
however I would say
that I always believed

271
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,682
the press would
kill her in the end...

272
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,572
but not even I
could imagine they'll take

273
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:35,162
such a direct hand in her death...

274
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,489
as seems to be the case.

275
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,015
It would appear that every
proprietor and editor...

276
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,848
of every publication
that has paid for intrusive

277
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,088
and exploitative
photographs of her...

278
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,236
has blood on his hands today.

279
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:49,694
Not the press, mate.

280
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,426
You got the wrong villain.

281
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:52,260
Tony...

282
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:54,971
Oh! Got to go...

283
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:56,530
You about to speak to The Queen?

284
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:57,381
Yeah...

285
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,678
Ask her if she
greased the breaks.

286
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:00,743
Now, now...

287
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,362
Hello?

288
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:18,399
Right, okay...

289
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,627
Is The Prince of Wales
with the boys?

290
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:22,984
Yes, Ma'am

291
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,029
-And he's going to Paris?
-Yes...

292
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:33,042
I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am...

293
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:34,190
Ma'am...

294
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:38,152
but I have the Prime Minister for you,
from his constituency.

295
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:39,861
Lucky you...

296
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,088
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

297
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,699
-Good morning, Your Majesty.
-Prime Minister.

298
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:00,480
May I say right away,
how very sorry I am...

299
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,290
and that the thoughts
and prayers of my family

300
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,101
are with you
at this terrible time.

301
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,723
And with the Princes,
in particular.

302
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:08,706
Thank you.

303
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,164
Is it your intention to make
some kind of appearance?

304
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:14,810
Or statement?

305
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,631
No, no!
Certainly not.

306
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,964
No member of the royal family
will speak publicly about this.

307
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,566
This is a private matter.

308
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:28,036
We would all appreciate it,
if it could be respected as such.

309
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:29,004
I see.

310
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:35,538
I don't suppose anyone has had
time to think about the funeral, yet?

311
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:39,087
We've spoken with the
Spencer family, and it is their wish...

312
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:42,148
it is their expressed wish,
that this should be a private funeral.

313
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,924
With a memorial service to follow,
in a month or so.

314
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:46,134
Right...

315
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:49,653
And given that Diana was
no longer a member of the royal family...

316
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,143
we have no other choice,
but to respect their wishes.

317
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:53,885
I see...

318
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,080
you don't feel...

319
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:59,774
that in view of her high
profile popularity...

320
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,874
it might be an idea to pay
tribute to her life and achievements?

321
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:09,147
Or even just to her as a mother?

322
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,750
Well, as I said,
it's her family's wish...

323
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,499
And the public, Ma'am?

324
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,227
The British people...

325
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:20,414
you don't think a private funeral
might be denying them a chance...

326
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,357
A chance to what?

327
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,955
To share in the grief.

328
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,408
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

329
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:34,155
I think The Princess has
already paid a high enough price...

330
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:36,225
for exposure to the
press, don't you?

331
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,850
Now, if there's nothing else,
I must get on.

332
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:42,045
The children have to be looked after.

333
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:44,194
Of course...
well, goodbye Your Majes...

334
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,177
Her instinct is to do nothing.

335
00:23:58,123 --> 00:23:58,848
Say nothing...

336
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,409
and give her a private funeral.

337
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:02,870
Are you surprised?

338
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,646
She hated her guts.

339
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,416
Well, I think it's a mistake...

340
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,438
They screwed up her life, let's
hope they don't screw up her death.

341
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:11,780
Where can I find a black tie?

342
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:15,622
Oh, the chaplain called.

343
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,733
He wanted to know,
whether we should make any

344
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,441
changes in the service...
any...

345
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,744
special mention of Diana.

346
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:23,000
What did you say?

347
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,481
Well, I told him
not to change a thing.

348
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:26,588
Quite right...

349
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,164
I think the less attention one
draws to it, the better.

350
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:31,755
-For the boys.
-Yes...

351
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,908
But I think maybe we should find
some company for them...

352
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:36,308
Some young people.

353
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:39,816
I'll take them for a long walk,
this afternoon... up Craggie Head.

354
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,950
Yes, but no guns Phillip...
It is Sunday.

355
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:48,991
And we're going... in fact...
I believe...

356
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:50,683
to Sedgefield,

357
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:53,764
the Prime Minister's constituency,
where he is about...

358
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,230
to make a statement...

359
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,358
yes the Prime
Minister coming now,

360
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,747
with his wife Cherie...

361
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:04,923
He's on. Alastair, he's on.
Come on!

362
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,527
...as her own life...

363
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,616
was often,

364
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,463
sadly touched by tragedy...

365
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,074
she touched the lives,
of so many others in...

366
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:20,280
in Britain, throughout the world...

367
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,844
with joy...

368
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,700
and with comfort.

369
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,652
The people, everywhere...

370
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,379
not just here in Britain,
everywhere...

371
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,817
they kept faith,
with Princess Diana.

372
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,440
They liked her, they loved her...

373
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:42,097
they regarded her,
as one of the people...

374
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:46,813
she was the people's Princess.

375
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:53,149
And that's how she will...

376
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,901
stay... how she will remain.

377
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:58,538
In our hearts...

378
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,587
and in our memories...

379
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:02,646
forever.

380
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:05,297
A little over the top,
don't you think?

381
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,269
The people of Britain, he said...

382
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,812
kept faith...

383
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:14,784
with Princess Diana...

384
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:19,293
they loved her...
she was the people's Princess.

385
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,071
Did we remember the
Royal Standard?

386
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,111
Yes, Sir.

387
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,693
-And flowers?
-Yes, Sir.

388
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:35,130
Good, 'cause if we leave it
to the rural undertakers...

389
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:36,873
they'll bring her
back in a wooden crypt.

390
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:30,793
Hello?

391
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,797
This is Lord Airlie, may I speak
with the Prime Minister, please?

392
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,865
One moment, please.

393
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:38,172
Lord Airlie...
The Lord Chamberlain

394
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,500
in charge of the funeral...
you're meeting him at the airport.

395
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:43,170
Lord Airlie.

396
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,684
Good afternoon, Prime Minister,
it's my job to organise

397
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,272
all the ceremonial events.

398
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:52,417
There is simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

399
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,966
Perhaps we shall plan
for any contingency.

400
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,550
Yes, I propose a meeting
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning

401
00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:59,909
at Buckingham Palace...

402
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,211
officials from all three Palaces,
representatives from the

403
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:05,994
Spencer family,
the emergency services...

404
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,143
would you send some of your people?

405
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,674
Absolutely, of course.

406
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:15,509
Precedent!?

407
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,128
Where do they find these people?

408
00:28:42,526 --> 00:28:43,373
Prime Minister...

409
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,632
I'm so sorry, Sir.
If there's anything I...

410
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,673
Or my government, can do...

411
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:53,051
They stood up, as we drove past,
in cafes, in restaurants...

412
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:54,612
removed their hats,

413
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:57,815
this was Paris, one of the
busiest cities in the world...

414
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,772
and you could hear a pin drop.
I imagine it will be the same here.

415
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,722
The Palace would still prefer
to see this as a private funeral.

416
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,015
What are your feelings on that?

417
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:06,301
I...

418
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:10,996
I think that will...

419
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,464
present us...

420
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,639
with difficulties.

421
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,591
So do I...

422
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:16,695
My mother,

423
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:18,160
The Queen...

424
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:20,740
comes from a generation
of best equipped...

425
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:23,612
she grew up in the war...
I think...

426
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:25,995
what we need... what
this country needs...

427
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:29,179
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow...

428
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,747
Balmoral is...

429
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:33,100
I think I understand...

430
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,307
An aircraft of the Queen's flight...

431
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:43,602
brought The Princess'
body home this evening...

432
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,457
where the Prime
Minister, Tony Blair,

433
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,879
had gathered with members
of his government.

434
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,865
A single black hearse crossed the tarmac...

435
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,598
and a Royal Air Force guard
of honour, moved slowly forward.

436
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,392
Has anyone heard from
the Spencer's yet?

437
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,915
Have they made up their minds
when the funeral will be?

438
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,350
Well I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

439
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:07,441
President Clinton was with his wife,
when he heard the news last night.

440
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,989
We liked her very much...

441
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,846
we admired her work for children...

442
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,592
for people with AIDS,

443
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:16,733
for the cause of ending
the scour of land mines...

444
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:19,954
On our walk today one of the
ghillies said he'd seen a large stag

445
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,318
up Craggie Head...

446
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,066
He reckoned, 14 pointer.

447
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:30,052
We haven't had one as big as
that on the estate, for years...

448
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:31,492
No,

449
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,793
quite...

450
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:38,233
Anyway...

451
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:40,754
I thought it might be
a good distraction...

452
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:42,625
for the boys.

453
00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:43,651
What... stalking?

454
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,913
You don't think that's
a bit soon, do you?

455
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:49,308
I think anything that gets
them outside, is a good idea.

456
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,292
...she became an
increasingly unhappy figure.

457
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,062
The couple divorced
in August of last year.

458
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:07,545
It was the love story that
brought crowds into the streets...

459
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,881
they came to see The Queen,
of course, and The Prince...

460
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,698
but most of all,
they came to see Diana.

461
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,271
I'm going to bed.

462
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:39,834
I'll ring the Lord
Chamberlain's office.

463
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,364
Say we are going to
send representatives

464
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:43,130
for the meeting tomorrow
morning, 10 o'clock.

465
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,288
Thank you, Stephen.

466
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,053
She gave us so much.

467
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:02,643
Why couldn't we have
given her a little something...

468
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,135
and left her alone?

469
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,338
It just hurts me so much.

470
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:10,742
I've never experienced
anything like this. I can't...

471
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:14,271
I keep waiting to
wake up, like it's a bad dream.

472
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:31,312
Right, it's 10 o'clock.
Let's get started, shall we?

473
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,498
And thank you all for coming,
at such short notice.

474
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,067
I think we all agree that this is
an extraordinarily sensitive occasion...

475
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,273
which presents us
with tremendous challenges.

476
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:42,798
Modestically,

477
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,848
constitutionally...

478
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:46,723
practically,

479
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:48,568
diplomatically

480
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:50,908
and procedurally.

481
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:53,175
Christ...

482
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:01,385
After 18 years of opposition...

483
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,422
I am proud to stand before you,

484
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,249
as the new Prime Minister
of our country...

485
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,958
Labour, Prime Minister.

486
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:11,371
I want to set an ambitious
course to modernise this country...

487
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:14,345
to breed new life
in to old institutions.

488
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:17,566
To make privileged something for
the many... not the few...

489
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,672
Flippin' heck...
You think the royals are nutters?

490
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:22,245
You should meet their flunkies...

491
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,071
Two and a half hours of
whether she should be carried

492
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,691
in a hearse or a gun carriage.

493
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,422
Anyway, you got raves in the press.

494
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:31,294
This lot calls you the
nation's mourner-in-chief

495
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,263
This lot says
you're the only person who's

496
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:34,955
correctly judged,
the mood of the country.

497
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,001
Even The Mail is impressed.

498
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,013
The people's Princess, mate...
you owe me.

499
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,662
Gordon for you...

500
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:47,765
Tell him to hang on.

501
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:48,938
Alastair...

502
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:53,447
So they've come to their senses?
Is it going to be a public funeral?

503
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,398
Yeah, Saturday...
It's a whopper!

504
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:57,528
-The Abbey, the works...
-Great.

505
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,237
Has anyone told the queen yet?

506
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:03,510
I don't know. No doubt
some flunkey will be dispatched.

507
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,254
Grovelling on all fours.

508
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,027
Do you think it's wise for
the boys to go stalking so soon?

509
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:21,025
Anything that gets them into
the fresh air, is a good thing.

510
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:24,249
Maybe they shouldn't take their guns?
I mean, if a photographer

511
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,778
were to see them, it might send
out the wrong signal?

512
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:29,253
If there is
a photographer out there...

513
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,048
he could be
the first kill of the day.

514
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:38,764
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night...

515
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,857
At midnight.
No cameras, no fuss.

516
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,176
Very dignified.

517
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,356
Why do they do that?
Why do they bury their bodies

518
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:51,104
so soon after their death?

519
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,974
Islamic tradition...

520
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,626
something to do with the heat.

521
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:59,871
It stops the body decomposing

522
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:01,223
Yes, come in!

523
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,439
Good morning, Ma'am...

524
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,915
-Ma'am.
-Yes, Robin... what can we do for you?

525
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:10,631
Ma'am.

526
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,778
There was a meeting at the
Palace, this morning...

527
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,955
About the funeral arrangements, yes...

528
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:20,390
The Lord Chamberlain faxed over
these plans for you to consider.

529
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:25,908
There is now
general agreement, Ma'am...

530
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:30,185
that a public funeral,
would be more appropriate.

531
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,171
I see...

532
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:41,148
And what form will this funeral take?

533
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:43,560
At the moment they're suggesting...

534
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:47,174
and of course, these are early days...

535
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,750
basing it on Taye Bridge.

536
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:52,144
-Taye Bridge?
-What?

537
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:56,370
But Taye Bridge is
to go down for my funeral.

538
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:57,980
Indeed, Ma'am.

539
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:01,849
But it would be
for practical reasons only...

540
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:06,324
it's the only one which
has been... rehearsed.

541
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,754
The only one that could be
put together, in time...

542
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,951
But I supervised
those plans myself...

543
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:15,260
Indeed...

544
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:18,010
And the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

545
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,618
that the spirit of the occasion

546
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,117
will be quite different,
for example...

547
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:25,659
the suggestion is that
instead of 400 soldiers...

548
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:30,744
400 representatives of the Princess'
various charities march behind...

549
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:32,297
the coffin.

550
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,905
And instead of
foreign heads of state...

551
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,822
and crown heads of Europe...

552
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,900
the guests would include...

553
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:43,674
a sprinkling of actors
of stage and screen...

554
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:45,243
fashion designers...

555
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:50,209
and other... celebrities.
Celebrities?

556
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,935
Was there anything else?

557
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,106
No, Ma'am.

558
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,745
Oh, yes, one other thing...

559
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:11,681
the police commissioner was
keen that you consider...

560
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:14,449
the idea of a condolence book.

561
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,362
It would give the growing crowds

562
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:20,028
something to do...
make marshalling them easier.

563
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:21,381
Oh, yes, yes of course...

564
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:25,639
Oh, and the flowers...

565
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:27,615
What flowers?

566
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:31,410
The flowers outside
Buckingham Palace... At the moment

567
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,820
they're blocking the path
through the Main Gate...

568
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:35,448
And will make things difficult

569
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,454
for the changing of the guards.

570
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,253
Oh, fine.
Just move them away.

571
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,300
Actually, the
Lord Chamberlain was

572
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,632
wondering whether we
shouldn't leave the flowers...

573
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:47,652
and send the guards
through the North Gate

574
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:49,975
Oh, yes, yes of course.

575
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,267
Yes, that's quite right.

576
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:02,580
Stephen Lamport on one.

577
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:06,207
-Who?
-The Prince of Wales' private secretary.

578
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:08,186
-Balmoral.
-He says it's urgent.

579
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:16,498
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Prime Minister.

580
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,598
The Prince of Wales has asked me
to thank you again

581
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:21,943
for your kind words yesterday.

582
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:22,685
Not at all.

583
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,204
The Prince feels that...
you and he...

584
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,580
are both modern men,
of similar mind...

585
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,435
who could work well together,
at this difficult time.

586
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:39,824
Ah, well...
please thank His Highness

587
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:42,848
and assure him
he can count on my full support.

588
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:44,870
At all times.

589
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:48,867
Was that it?

590
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:50,756
Yes...

591
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:52,623
Goodbye.

592
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,062
Bizzare.

593
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,407
-Why is Charles doing this?
-What?

594
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,069
Creeping up to me like this.

595
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:08,779
Banging on about being modern.

596
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,562
He did it at the airport, when he
asked me to deal with his mother.

597
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:16,267
Because he knows that if the Queen
continuous to get it wrong over Diana...

598
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:18,773
then the royals become
public enemy number one.

599
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,721
And he's terrified of
being shot, apparently.

600
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:22,688
Who, Charles?

601
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,491
His people have already been on
to us... to ask for extra protection.

602
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:28,019
He probably thinks that if
he seems to be on our side...

603
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,617
then that would leave
The Queen in the firing line.

604
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:34,027
What... so it's okay for his mother
to take the bullet, and not him...

605
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,974
What a family!

606
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:42,484
-Wait, where are they?
-They're up at Craggie Head.

607
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:49,906
I'll come with you.
Do you want me to drive?

608
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,551
No, certainly not.

609
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,027
I thought you were going
to get a new one of these?

610
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,989
What for... it's perfectly alright.

611
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:10,556
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done...

612
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,325
had it been me
that died in the tunnel in Paris.

613
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:16,606
She would certainly
have taken the boys to Paris.

614
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,390
I rather regret
not doing that now.

615
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,573
What, and expose them to the media?

616
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,448
That would have
been a dreadful thing to do.

617
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,953
No, they're much better of here...

618
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,592
it's private, they're protected.

619
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:30,511
Whatever else you may have thought
of Diana, she was a wonderful mother.

620
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:33,131
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

621
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:36,532
Always warm, and physical...

622
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:38,862
never afraid to show her feelings...

623
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:41,175
Especially whenever
a photographer was in sight.

624
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:43,915
She may have encouraged all that,
but still...

625
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:47,273
that was always the
extraordinary thing about her...

626
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,811
her weaknesses,
and transgressions...

627
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:52,816
only made the public love her more.

628
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,541
And ours only make them hate us.
Why is that?

629
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:56,737
Why do they hate us so much?

630
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,240
-Not us, dear...
-What?

631
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,299
Yesterday, when we
brought the coffin back...

632
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,193
there was a noise, a bang,
I don't mind telling you...

633
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,028
I thought it was a gun.

634
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,203
I thought someone
had taken a shot at me.

635
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,921
I think I'm going to walk back.

636
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:17,736
I don't feel like stalking.

637
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,153
-Oh, are you sure?
-I'll take the dogs.

638
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,624
Walkies? Yes...

639
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,946
Come on...

640
00:42:31,837 --> 00:42:34,246
Do you think...
you'll ever be Queen?

641
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,989
No I don't, no.

642
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,581
Why do you think that?

643
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:47,139
I like to be a Queen of people's
hearts, in people's hearts.

644
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:51,176
But I don't see myself as
being Queen of this country.

645
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:54,146
I don't think many people
would want me to be Queen...

646
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:56,551
Actually, when
I say many people, I mean

647
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:58,898
the establishment
that I married into.

648
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,747
Because they've decided...

649
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,503
that I'm a non-starter.

650
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:08,620
Charles and I
had a talk in the car today.

651
00:43:11,137 --> 00:43:14,543
He was good enough to share with me,
his thoughts on motherhood.

652
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:16,276
What did he say?

653
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,897
How wonderful Diana was...

654
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:20,986
That's changing his tune.

655
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:22,215
...and natural.

656
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,647
They see me as
a threat of some kind.

657
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,729
Oh, for Gods sake!

658
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:35,767
Maybe he's got a point...
Maybe we are partly to blame...

659
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,335
Oh, I can't watch this.

660
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:41,775
No, no wait...
please, no... leave it!

661
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,123
We encouraged the match.

662
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:55,753
We signed of on it, both of us.

663
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,287
You were very
enthusiastic, remember?

664
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,793
She was a nice girl.

665
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,221
Then...

666
00:44:03,315 --> 00:44:05,419
And I was sure he'd give
the other one up...

667
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:08,145
or at least make sure
his wife toed the line.

668
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:11,152
Isn't that what everyone does?

669
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:12,755
Is it?

670
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:19,692
Well, there were three of us,
in this marriage...

671
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,200
so it was a bit crowded.

672
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,055
I can't bear it any more...

673
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:28,421
If you're watching,
I'll sleep next door.

674
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:29,854
Early start tomorrow.

675
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,678
Any luck with your stag?

676
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,771
No, but close... A couple of
hundred yards at one point.

677
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:37,966
One of the boys
even got a shot off.

678
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,962
We'll get him tomorrow.

679
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:45,129
See you in the morning.

680
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,299
Not to worry.

681
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:49,786
Night night.

682
00:44:55,882 --> 00:44:59,736
Charles continued to love a woman
he'd fallen for years before...

683
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,852
The good news is that the
Palace has agreed to video screens

684
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:21,073
in the Royal Parks...

685
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:22,863
-And the bad news?
-Crash barriers...

686
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:24,436
-What about them?
-Well they're now predicting...

687
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:26,512
more than two million people
in the centre of London.

688
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:28,635
There aren't enough barriers
to line the route.

689
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:31,831
So we've gone tapping into
the French for theirs.

690
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,040
And there's something else
I think you should see...

691
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:38,231
-Can we run that piece again?
-Of course.

692
00:45:38,427 --> 00:45:39,676
You're gonna love this...

693
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:42,643
I don't like their behaviour...
very disgraceful.

694
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,496
What do you think madam?

695
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,309
I think it's disgusting, that they
have not appeared or said a word...

696
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:49,384
relating to all this.

697
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,869
-Look, I know all this.
-Wait for it...

698
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:55,694
Not to have a flag up, I think it's
a disgrace on the whole royal family.

699
00:45:56,138 --> 00:45:57,982
OK, The Queen's not
in residence today...

700
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:59,364
but where the hell is the flag?

701
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:02,694
You see what I'm saying
about the establishment?

702
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:06,949
Don't tell me there isn't a flag flying
at half mast over Buckingham Palace...

703
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:11,352
To people she was their king and
queen, when them two were together

704
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:12,955
it was a fairytale come true...

705
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:16,409
Will someone please save
these people from themselves.

706
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:18,949
Fine, I'll call Balmoral.

707
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:22,425
Because as Prime Minister, I really
got nothing better to do.

708
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:24,166
Come on dogs, come on...

709
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,322
-Is the fire lights alright?
-A bit damp.

710
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:42,292
Well I brought some stew...
just in case.

711
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,264
I think it's lamb... we could
always have that cold.

712
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:45,700
No, we'll be alright.

713
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:48,389
Stay.

714
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,790
Robin had a call from
the Prime Minister,

715
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,014
who expressed his concern...

716
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:57,823
About what?

717
00:46:58,612 --> 00:47:00,924
About the flag
above Buckingham Palace.

718
00:47:02,008 --> 00:47:04,295
He thinks it should
be flying at half mast.

719
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:08,100
I hope Robin told him there
isn't a flag above Buckingham Palace.

720
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,531
There's the Royal Standard,
which flies for one reason only...

721
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:13,199
to denote the presence
of the monarch.

722
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:15,011
Since you're here,

723
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:18,096
the flag pole is bare,
which is as it should be.

724
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:21,071
Isn't it possible, that for some people...

725
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:24,459
the Royal Standard,
is just a flag...

726
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:29,314
And that the flag pole being bare,
sends out the wrong signal...

727
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,618
No, that's not the point.

728
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:34,228
The point is, it's
more than 400 years old.

729
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:36,262
It hasn't been
lowered for anyone.

730
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:40,284
Your grandfather didn't get the
flag at half mast, when he died.

731
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:44,954
If you're mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

732
00:47:45,015 --> 00:47:49,140
Yes, granny. But sometimes, in a
situation like this, one has to be flexible.

733
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:51,653
It is just a flag.

734
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:55,229
What about the Union Jack?
Was Mr. Blair's next suggestion...

735
00:47:56,282 --> 00:47:58,017
-For heavens sake?
-The next thing he'll be suggesting...

736
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:00,180
you change your name
to Hilda and mine to Hector.

737
00:48:01,155 --> 00:48:02,647
Who does he think he's
talking to?

738
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:05,146
You're the Sovereign, the
Head of State...

739
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:07,376
you don't get dictated to.

740
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:10,265
You've conceded the idea
of a public funeral...

741
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:13,200
you've opened up the parks,
that's enough.

742
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:15,152
Shh... the boys...

743
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:19,645
You wait... In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

744
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:54,459
Where once it seemed comforting...

745
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:56,879
for the first time
my parents can see...

746
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,549
what it's been like for me
all these years...

747
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,756
being up against her popularity.

748
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,059
But they're still making the mistake
of thinking that the Diana they knew...

749
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,571
from living and dealing with her...

750
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:09,424
will eventually be the one
seen by the public... but it won't!

751
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:11,871
The two Dianas,

752
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,669
the public's and ours, bear no
relation to one another, at all...

753
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:19,606
I've been thinking,

754
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:22,743
the flag of St. George's is
at half mast over High Grove?

755
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,674
Yes, sir.

756
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,770
Well, make sure we get a picture
of that in the papers, will you?

757
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:28,487
I'll get on to the tabloids,
call in a few favours.

758
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:32,284
What about a statement
of gratitude, to the crowds?

759
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:36,458
Something heartfelt,
from myself and the boys...

760
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:39,688
thanking people for all the flowers...
and so on.

761
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:40,714
Right.

762
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:44,006
Di was wonderful, because she
stood up to the establishment...

763
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:45,770
we have no-one doing that now...

764
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:48,290
she said you're detached,
elitist people...

765
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,039
we are paying million of
pounds to be better than us...

766
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:53,399
and you gotta get out
there amongst the people...

767
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:57,053
we have a wonderful new
Prime Minister in England, Tony Blair...

768
00:49:57,114 --> 00:50:00,583
a compassionate young man,
who after 18 years...

769
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:02,582
of establishment toil and row...

770
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:06,219
is such a breath of fresh air,
and I feel he will...

771
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,174
do something about this
in England...

772
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:09,755
Do you think this will
be the first stirrings of...

773
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:10,395
Of what?

774
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:12,565
I don't know...
something more interesting...

775
00:50:14,283 --> 00:50:17,627
Maybe this time people will finally have
seen them for what they actually are.

776
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:19,501
Which is?

777
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:21,633
A bunch of free loading...

778
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:23,174
emotionally retarded...

779
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,912
nutters!

780
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,694
-That's just absurd.
-Why?

781
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:31,620
They have a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth...

782
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:33,331
-and they don't pay tax.
-Yes they do.

783
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:34,378
Not on all their income.

784
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:36,849
The Queen alone costs us,
what... 30... 40 million a year?

785
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,032
Look... If you wanna have
a serious conversation...

786
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:40,777
-I do...
-About the constitution.

787
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:44,051
-We don't have one.
-About ways in which we as a government...

788
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:47,194
could phase out hereditary
privileges, then fine...

789
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:48,799
If you're gonna leave
will you take the plates?

790
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:52,090
But, you know, spare me the
whole off with their heads thing.

791
00:50:52,153 --> 00:50:52,716
Why?

792
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:54,720
Because it insults your intelligence.

793
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:57,624
The Queen can not
be expected to change...

794
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:00,986
It's unimaginable this
country being a republic.

795
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:03,785
-Certainly in her lifetime.
-Why?

796
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:05,903
Because no-one would wear it...

797
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,808
No-one wants it.

798
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,495
It's just...

799
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:12,078
daft.

800
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,762
It's not a mother thing, is it?

801
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:16,848
What?

802
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,139
Well, if she were alive now...

803
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,428
your mother would
be exactly the same age.

804
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,755
I mean... you always say
how stoical she was...

805
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:27,563
old-fashioned, uncomplained...

806
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:28,728
lived through the war...

807
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,692
Oh, come on...
who does that sound like?

808
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:32,200
I'm gonna go do the washing-up.

809
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:52,359
That's the stalking party off...

810
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:53,896
Right...

811
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:56,586
I'd better have
a look at those papers.

812
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,959
'Show us there's a heart, in the
house of Windsor', says The Sun.

813
00:52:02,543 --> 00:52:05,188
'It's proof the royals are
not like us', The Mirror.

814
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:09,602
'Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace', Express.

815
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:14,870
'One can't help wondering
who's advise they're taking...

816
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,240
for it's clearly
the wrong advise'...

817
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,423
I'll try not to take that personally.

818
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:25,242
People have been yearning
for a change in this country...

819
00:52:25,303 --> 00:52:28,658
good... the result is a quiet
revolution now taking place...

820
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,435
lead by the real modernisers...
the British people.

821
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,007
Revolution?
Who wrote this?

822
00:52:36,178 --> 00:52:37,660
Where does this come from?

823
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:39,712
Where does it come from?

824
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:41,815
You just won a
huge landslide majority.

825
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,292
People wanna see a change.

826
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:46,684
Why, what did you
think it meant?

827
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:53,493
Hurry up dear,
your tea is getting cold.

828
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:54,135
Is that it?

829
00:52:54,196 --> 00:52:56,498
Yes Ma'am, just the
letter of condolence...

830
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,073
to the widow of
the Ambassador to Brazil.

831
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:02,566
Good, thank you.

832
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:06,989
Tea!

833
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:10,426
Mr. Janvrin...

834
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,763
The Prime Minister wishes
to speak to Her Majesty.

835
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,514
Ma'am...

836
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:23,501
Apparently the Prime Minister
is on the phone, for you...

837
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:25,303
Tell him to call back.

838
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:29,767
No, no. It's alright.
I'll take it.

839
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:40,418
Prime Minister...

840
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,751
Good morning, Your Majesty...

841
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:42,802
sorry to disturb...

842
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:47,230
but I was just wondering whether
you'd seen any of today's papers?

843
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:50,646
We've managed to
look at one or two...

844
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:52,545
In which case my...

845
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,107
next question would be...
whether you felt...

846
00:53:56,899 --> 00:54:00,035
some kind of response,
might be necessary?

847
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:03,219
No...

848
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:06,584
I believe a few, over
eager editors...

849
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:08,354
are doing their best
to sell newspapers...

850
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,811
and it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune...

851
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,567
Under normal circumstances
I would agree.

852
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,362
But...

853
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,524
well, my advise is...

854
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:23,325
I've been taking the temperature
among people on the streets...

855
00:54:24,604 --> 00:54:26,791
And... well, the
information I'm getting...

856
00:54:27,212 --> 00:54:28,849
is that the mood...

857
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,887
is quite delicate...

858
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,322
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

859
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:39,187
Some kind of a statement?

860
00:54:39,496 --> 00:54:40,119
No, Ma'am.

861
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,577
I believe that the
moment for statements,

862
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,999
has passed...

863
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:52,144
I would suggest flying the flag
at half mast above Buckingham Palace...

864
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:54,955
and...

865
00:54:56,344 --> 00:54:57,539
coming down to London,

866
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,777
at the earliest opportunity.

867
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,122
It would be a
great comfort to your people...

868
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,672
and would help them

869
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:08,425
with their grief.

870
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:09,784
Their...

871
00:55:10,301 --> 00:55:11,201
grief?

872
00:55:12,582 --> 00:55:14,823
If you imagine I am going
to drop everything, and come

873
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,205
down to London, before I
attend to my grandchildren...

874
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:18,685
who have just lost their mother...

875
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,672
Then you're mistaken!

876
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:25,113
I doubt there is anyone,
who knows

877
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:27,437
the British people
more than I do, Mr. Blair...

878
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:30,654
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgement.

879
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:35,062
And it is my belief they will
any moment reject this...

880
00:55:36,178 --> 00:55:37,216
this mood...

881
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:40,297
which is being tired up
by the press.

882
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:44,312
In favour of a period of
restrained grief...

883
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:46,956
and sober private mourning.

884
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:50,872
That's the way we do
things in this country...

885
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,650
quietly...

886
00:55:53,736 --> 00:55:54,600
with dignity.

887
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:59,532
That's what the rest of
the world has always admired us for.

888
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:01,446
If that's your decision, Ma'am...

889
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:03,462
then of course,
the government will support it...

890
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:06,624
Let's keep in touch.

891
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:07,816
Yes.

892
00:56:08,238 --> 00:56:08,987
Let's.

893
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:17,376
Bloody fool...

894
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:20,097
and now your tea's gone cold.

895
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:25,924
Tony...

896
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:28,085
Robin Janvrin on one.

897
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:29,861
He was listening in...

898
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,042
Robin.

899
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:39,304
I understand how
difficult her behaviour must

900
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:41,575
seem to you.
How unhelpful...

901
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,336
but try to see it
from her perspective.

902
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:46,578
She's been brought
up to believe...

903
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,152
it's God's will...

904
00:56:48,314 --> 00:56:49,959
she is who she is.

905
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,853
I think we should
leave God out of it.

906
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:55,629
It's just...
not helpful.

907
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,961
She just won't have seen anything
like this since the abdication...

908
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:02,167
and I can not emphasise enough
what affect that had on her.

909
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:06,111
Unexpectedly becoming King
as good as killed her father.

910
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,746
I'm afraid she's in
a state of shock.

911
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:11,951
This public reaction
has completely thrown her.

912
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,856
Alright...

913
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:18,215
but first we have to
deal with these terrible headlines.

914
00:57:19,776 --> 00:57:21,371
I'll see what I can do
with the press.

915
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:23,140
I'm most grateful,
Prime Minister.

916
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:26,641
Well I can't promise anything...

917
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:29,681
it's not me they want to see.

918
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,830
Ask Alastair to come and see me.

919
00:57:56,236 --> 00:57:57,146
Yes...

920
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:03,373
Cancel what I'm doing tonight.

921
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,560
Good morning.

922
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,408
-Your Majesty.
-Morning, Ma'am.

923
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,348
Thomas... where have
they gone today?

924
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:15,018
Up to Ardverikie Reach, Ma'am.

925
00:58:15,555 --> 00:58:16,499
All that way...

926
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:19,316
Remind me... that's
the track up north...

927
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:23,355
That's right, Ma'am... You follow
the track for about a mile...

928
00:58:23,505 --> 00:58:24,881
-and then you come to...
-The river.

929
00:58:27,676 --> 00:58:30,325
-One of the lads will drive you...
-No, no. I'll manage... thank you.

930
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:38,996
Oh...

931
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,812
Oh! Stupid...

932
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:28,728
-Hello, Thomas...
-Hello, Ma'am...

933
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:30,612
I'm afraid I've done
something rather foolish.

934
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:32,665
I've broken the
prop shaft crossing the river.

935
01:00:33,228 --> 01:00:35,845
-Are you sure, Ma'am?
-Yes, of course I'm sure.

936
01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:37,179
It's the front one, not the rear.

937
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,806
It was a four-wheel drive.

938
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:41,580
Don't forget... I used to be a
mechanic during the war.

939
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:44,929
-And, are you alright?
-Yeah yeah, I'm perfectly alright...

940
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:46,797
-We'll come about straight away.
-Oh, would you...

941
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:49,959
Thank you very much. I'll wait by the car.
You are kind... bye.

942
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,886
Oh... you're a beauty...

943
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:30,088
Shoo... go on!

944
01:02:31,717 --> 01:02:32,344
Go on...

945
01:02:34,094 --> 01:02:35,021
go on...

946
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:14,194
Just been told
there are news crews outside...

947
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:16,596
waiting for you to
come and speak to the people...

948
01:03:16,745 --> 01:03:17,479
Yes...

949
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,366
What's all that about?

950
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,280
I told The
Queen's private secretary

951
01:03:21,341 --> 01:03:23,244
I'd do what I could,
to help with the press.

952
01:03:23,993 --> 01:03:24,641
Why?

953
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,094
Don't you think she deserves it?

954
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:30,711
Sitting up there
on her 40000 acres.

955
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:34,703
Yeah, but allowing her to hang herself,
might not be in our best interest either.

956
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,205
Besides...

957
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,279
I think there's something...

958
01:03:40,252 --> 01:03:43,100
ugly, about the way
everyone started to bully her...

959
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:07,086
The first thing you
obviously think about, is...

960
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:10,250
the rest of your family.
And I think...

961
01:04:15,892 --> 01:04:20,587
She wanted me to pass on to
the people here, crowding around her...

962
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,622
How are the boys?

963
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,121
Not so good, tonight.

964
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:29,757
A lot of slamming doors...

965
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:32,066
I think they saw the papers.

966
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:33,349
Oh no...

967
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:35,697
I'll take them out early
again, tomorrow morning...

968
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:39,385
Let them take
it out on the stag.

969
01:04:42,526 --> 01:04:44,952
What do you think of the way
the royal family have behaved?

970
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:47,535
-They've made a serious mistake.
-Pardon?

971
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,845
They've made a serious mistake.

972
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,262
Why, what do you mean?

973
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:54,401
Well, they should have came...

974
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,313
the family should
have come down...

975
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,170
to Buckingham Palace,
on Sunday afternoon...

976
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:00,825
all of them...

977
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:05,105
That girl has been left on her own.
She's on her own up there...

978
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,358
and the place is empty.

979
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:08,368
Oh please...

980
01:05:09,023 --> 01:05:11,743
Sleeping in the streets and
pulling out their hair...

981
01:05:12,194 --> 01:05:13,782
for someone they never knew...

982
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,505
And they think we're mad.

983
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:19,477
Have you seen the latest
funeral guest list?

984
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:20,577
No...

985
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:22,688
I suggest you keep it that way...

986
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:25,837
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals...

987
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:29,848
Apparently Elton John
is going to be singing.

988
01:05:30,543 --> 01:05:32,620
That would be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

989
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,745
Condolence books are now being
signed in our embassies

990
01:05:36,806 --> 01:05:38,520
in every major city
in the world.

991
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,684
And in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

992
01:05:43,502 --> 01:05:45,359
It reminds me of one
of those films.

993
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:47,444
A few of us in a fort...

994
01:05:48,026 --> 01:05:49,960
hordes of Zulus outside.

995
01:05:51,872 --> 01:05:54,007
So it's vital you hold firm.

996
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:55,891
Stick to your guns...

997
01:05:56,608 --> 01:05:57,303
you wait...

998
01:05:57,646 --> 01:05:59,425
they will come to
their senses soon...

999
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:01,363
They have to.

1000
01:06:02,615 --> 01:06:03,448
Come on!

1001
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:04,955
Move over cabbage!

1002
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:18,376
Good morning,
it's 6 o'clock on Thursday

1003
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:20,099
the 4th of September.
I'm Penny Smith...

1004
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:21,230
and I'm Matthew Lorenzo...

1005
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,769
As the first people
start camping out...

1006
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,850
on the route of Princess
Diana's funeral courtage...

1007
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:27,099
questions are being asked
about why the Queen...

1008
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,676
hasn't addressed her subjects...

1009
01:06:28,737 --> 01:06:30,716
at this time of national grief.

1010
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,100
This is what the newspapers
are saying this morning. The Sun...

1011
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,751
Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?

1012
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:43,838
The Express,

1013
01:06:44,488 --> 01:06:45,526
show us you care...

1014
01:06:45,595 --> 01:06:46,841
picture of a grumpy Queen.

1015
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:50,556
The Mail, let the
flag fly at half mast...

1016
01:06:50,618 --> 01:06:53,983
and inside... the Queen should
be here to show her respect.

1017
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,282
But the flip side is,

1018
01:06:56,937 --> 01:07:00,045
they're more popular now...
than Churchill's chocolate.

1019
01:07:00,527 --> 01:07:02,727
Did any of them pick up
on our statement of support?

1020
01:07:02,788 --> 01:07:03,909
Well, just the one...

1021
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:10,405
Statements of support,
doesn't sell papers.

1022
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:19,323
Ma'am...

1023
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:20,660
Ma'am...

1024
01:07:22,507 --> 01:07:23,857
the Prime Minister
for you, Ma'am.

1025
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:27,708
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

1026
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:31,348
I'll take it in the kitchen.

1027
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:41,095
Good morning,
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

1028
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:43,760
I'm just expecting a
phone call to come through here.

1029
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:44,631
Out!

1030
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:47,470
Oh, there it is...

1031
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:52,810
Thank you.

1032
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,405
Good morning, Prime Minister.

1033
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:01,474
Good morning, Ma'am.

1034
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,840
You've seen today's headlines?

1035
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:06,779
Yes, I have.

1036
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:08,470
Then I'm sure you'll agree...

1037
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:10,865
the situation has become...

1038
01:08:11,782 --> 01:08:12,677
Quite critical.

1039
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,639
Ma'am?

1040
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:21,359
A poll that's to be published in
tomorrow's papers...

1041
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:24,346
suggests that
70 percent of people believe

1042
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:27,026
that your actions
have damaged the Monarchy.

1043
01:08:28,488 --> 01:08:29,225
And that,

1044
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:31,605
one in four,

1045
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:34,785
are now in favour... of abolishing
the Monarchy all together.

1046
01:08:37,185 --> 01:08:38,621
As your Prime Minister...

1047
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:43,302
I believe it is my
constitutional responsibility...

1048
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:46,058
to advise the following...

1049
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:01,384
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

1050
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:09,617
Mummy?

1051
01:09:11,532 --> 01:09:12,188
One...

1052
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:16,197
fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

1053
01:09:16,258 --> 01:09:18,299
and all other
royal residences...

1054
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:20,913
two...

1055
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:24,877
leave Balmoral and fly down to London
at the earliest opportunity...

1056
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:26,901
three...

1057
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,185
pay respects, in person,
at Diana's coffin...

1058
01:09:33,092 --> 01:09:34,035
and four...

1059
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:36,923
make a statement via
live television...

1060
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:38,706
to my people and the world.

1061
01:09:40,464 --> 01:09:43,261
Swift prosecution of
these matters might,

1062
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:44,699
he felt...

1063
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:47,552
just might...
avert disaster.

1064
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:51,693
You will have to talk to the
Lord Chamberlain about all this.

1065
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:52,754
Well I have...

1066
01:09:53,182 --> 01:09:56,182
And to Robert Fellows, and it
seems they both agree with Mr. Blair.

1067
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,213
Oh, I see...

1068
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:00,955
Something's happened...
there's been a change... some...

1069
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:03,399
shift in values.

1070
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,481
When you no longer
understand your people, mummy...

1071
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:11,163
maybe it is time to
hand it over to the next generation?

1072
01:10:11,224 --> 01:10:12,808
Oh, don't be ridiculous...

1073
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:15,970
Remember the vow you took?

1074
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:22,116
I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short...

1075
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,384
shall be devoted to your service.

1076
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:27,038
Your whole life.

1077
01:10:27,965 --> 01:10:29,861
That is a commitment to God...

1078
01:10:30,056 --> 01:10:31,242
as well as your people.

1079
01:10:31,303 --> 01:10:33,771
But what if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

1080
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:35,041
Damaging it!?

1081
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:39,124
You're the greatest asset
this institution has...

1082
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:41,473
one of the greatest
it has ever had.

1083
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:46,857
The problem will come
when you leave...

1084
01:10:47,552 --> 01:10:49,896
but you mustn't think
about that now...

1085
01:10:49,964 --> 01:10:51,245
Certainly not today.

1086
01:10:51,306 --> 01:10:52,431
Oh, mummy...

1087
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:55,008
You must show your strength...

1088
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,386
reassert your authority.

1089
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,108
You sit on the most
powerful throne in Europe.

1090
01:11:02,903 --> 01:11:07,148
Head of an unbroken line that
goes back more than a thousand years.

1091
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:11,817
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything...

1092
01:11:12,191 --> 01:11:15,537
and gone up to London
because a bunch of hysterics...

1093
01:11:15,598 --> 01:11:18,973
carrying candles,
needed help with their grief?

1094
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:22,542
As for that...

1095
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:25,081
silly Mr. Blair...

1096
01:11:26,002 --> 01:11:27,276
with his Cheshire Cat grin...

1097
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:44,366
Mr. Janvrin on the
phone for you, Sir...

1098
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:47,369
Yes?

1099
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:49,388
What?

1100
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:51,722
I can't hear!

1101
01:11:54,337 --> 01:11:55,228
That's madness...

1102
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:57,274
the whole thing!

1103
01:11:58,302 --> 01:11:59,618
Bloody madness!

1104
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:05,537
I've just been told...

1105
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:07,888
You've...

1106
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,300
decided to follow the Prime
Minister's advise...

1107
01:12:12,482 --> 01:12:13,950
I just want to say, I...

1108
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:16,916
admire...

1109
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,312
I think it's the right decision.

1110
01:12:23,324 --> 01:12:25,113
Let's hope we haven't
left it too late.

1111
01:13:12,839 --> 01:13:14,923
Clearly The Queen
has had a change of heart...

1112
01:13:14,984 --> 01:13:17,590
she's clearly responding to
the need to feel...

1113
01:13:17,651 --> 01:13:20,628
that the royal family
is somehow engaged.

1114
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:24,409
These are flowers that have been
brought to the gates of Balmoral...

1115
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,804
so that she can actually see

1116
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:29,030
some token, of what's been
expressed down here in London...

1117
01:13:29,373 --> 01:13:31,987
-Fish Fingers... do you want any?
-I'll be right there...

1118
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,455
Thank God, for that!

1119
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:12,157
Britain's Queen Elisabeth will
deliver a televised address Friday...

1120
01:14:12,217 --> 01:14:15,500
the royal family has been accused
of not showing enough remorse...

1121
01:14:15,561 --> 01:14:17,102
over Princess Diana's death...

1122
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,453
Where are the boys?
Have they already left?

1123
01:14:40,664 --> 01:14:41,325
Yes...

1124
01:14:42,226 --> 01:14:44,727
they left for London,
after breakfast, with Charles.

1125
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:47,726
It's not right, you know...

1126
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:50,777
No, but further discussion
is no longer helpful, either.

1127
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:52,909
Oh, well...

1128
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:58,453
I suppose it does give the ghillies time
to find another stag for the boys.

1129
01:14:59,134 --> 01:15:00,939
-Now there's has been shot.
-What?

1130
01:15:01,608 --> 01:15:02,650
Haven't you heard?

1131
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,169
He wandered over to one
of the neighbouring estates...

1132
01:15:05,848 --> 01:15:07,956
where one of the
commercial guests got him.

1133
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:13,532
Oh... really?

1134
01:15:15,621 --> 01:15:16,517
Which estate?

1135
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,282
Here's your box.

1136
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:39,576
There's some policy and
stuff in here that's important.

1137
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,046
Have you seen the papers?

1138
01:15:41,391 --> 01:15:42,710
No, I thought I'd give
them a miss today...

1139
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,003
of course I've seen the papers!

1140
01:15:44,064 --> 01:15:47,155
Not bad, eh... Your Majesty
have come down to London...

1141
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,352
Who says that?
Tony Blair.

1142
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:53,586
Mr. Father of the nation.

1143
01:16:10,797 --> 01:16:11,463
Ma'am...

1144
01:16:12,705 --> 01:16:14,246
-Good morning, Ma'am.
-Good morning.

1145
01:16:14,723 --> 01:16:16,921
Is it his Lordship,
you've come to see?

1146
01:16:16,982 --> 01:16:20,630
No, please don't disturb him...
I've come on another matter...

1147
01:16:20,691 --> 01:16:21,666
I hope you don't mind?

1148
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:45,039
There he is...

1149
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:49,293
A beauty, isn't he?

1150
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:51,837
An imperial, Ma'am.

1151
01:16:54,638 --> 01:16:56,076
14 pointer.

1152
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:07,478
-He was wounded?
-Yes...

1153
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:12,027
We got our guest in very close...
had him lined up perfect.

1154
01:17:13,957 --> 01:17:14,846
And still...

1155
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:18,650
an investment banker, Ma'am...
from London.

1156
01:17:19,699 --> 01:17:23,227
I'm afraid the stalkers had to
follow him for miles, to finish him off...

1157
01:17:27,087 --> 01:17:28,849
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

1158
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:41,714
Please pass my congratulations,
to your guest.

1159
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:42,850
I will, Ma'am...

1160
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:51,498
God bless you, Ma'am.

1161
01:17:52,385 --> 01:17:53,312
Thank you.

1162
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:27,371
Ma'am?

1163
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:28,973
Yes, Robin...

1164
01:18:29,517 --> 01:18:32,271
I've done a draft,
of your television address.

1165
01:18:32,905 --> 01:18:33,717
Thank you.

1166
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:40,046
Was there anything else?

1167
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:42,572
No, Ma'am.

1168
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:45,786
Landing in 15 minutes.

1169
01:18:57,223 --> 01:18:58,597
I've got The Queen's speech.

1170
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:02,959
-Shall I give Tony a copy?
-No, let me have a look at it first...

1171
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:04,550
He's next door.

1172
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,749
The Queen is getting out of the car...
and is going to talk to people.

1173
01:19:59,849 --> 01:20:03,580
It's extremely unusual...
this is almost unprecedented...

1174
01:20:03,641 --> 01:20:08,070
I think perhaps the last time
The Queen was among her people...

1175
01:20:08,255 --> 01:20:12,252
outside the Palace...
was the day the war in Europe ended.

1176
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,980
They sent a copy
of The Queen's speech...

1177
01:20:39,694 --> 01:20:41,514
Well, let's get the frost off it first.

1178
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:51,796
I've phoned them
with a couple of suggestions...

1179
01:20:52,429 --> 01:20:54,357
to make it sound like it
came from a human being.

1180
01:20:54,418 --> 01:20:55,223
Yeah, alright Alastair...

1181
01:20:58,338 --> 01:21:01,119
Well at least the old bat has
finally agreed to visit Diana's coffin.

1182
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,993
When you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong...

1183
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:08,515
that woman has given her
whole life in service to her people.

1184
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,202
50 years doing the job,
she never wanted...

1185
01:21:11,795 --> 01:21:13,816
a job she watched kill her father...

1186
01:21:13,879 --> 01:21:17,934
she's executed it with honour, dignity,
and as far as I could tell...

1187
01:21:17,995 --> 01:21:20,956
without a single blemish,
and now we're all baying for her blood.

1188
01:21:21,263 --> 01:21:23,972
All because she's struggling
to lead the world in mourning

1189
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:26,853
for someone who threw everything
she offered back in her face.

1190
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:29,537
And who for the last few years
seemed committed 24/7

1191
01:21:29,696 --> 01:21:32,530
to destroying everything
she holds most dear.

1192
01:22:37,592 --> 01:22:40,779
Hello... would you like
me to place those for you?

1193
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:41,949
No...

1194
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,853
Oh...

1195
01:22:44,568 --> 01:22:45,991
These are for you.

1196
01:22:48,933 --> 01:22:49,534
For me?

1197
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,076
Thank you.

1198
01:22:56,776 --> 01:22:57,916
Thank you very much.

1199
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:31,347
There's been a last minute
addition from Downing Street.

1200
01:23:31,408 --> 01:23:34,627
They're suggesting adding,
'and as a grandmother'...

1201
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:36,285
here.
Right.

1202
01:23:41,957 --> 01:23:46,086
So what I say to you now, as
your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1203
01:23:46,915 --> 01:23:48,388
I say from my heart.

1204
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,191
You think you can say it?

1205
01:23:51,784 --> 01:23:53,968
-Do I have a choice?
-We're ready for you, Your Majesty.

1206
01:23:57,602 --> 01:23:59,571
Just to confirm,
this is going out live.

1207
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,222
-Fine.
-And you'll be at the front of

1208
01:24:02,283 --> 01:24:04,095
the 6 o'clock news...
on all the channels.

1209
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:04,932
Yes.

1210
01:24:48,556 --> 01:24:51,272
-Okay, nice and quiet...
-Ten seconds, everyone!

1211
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:58,553
We cross now, live,
to Buckingham Palace...

1212
01:24:58,614 --> 01:25:01,403
for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.

1213
01:25:07,704 --> 01:25:10,251
Since last Sundays'
dreadful news...

1214
01:25:10,327 --> 01:25:13,390
we have seen throughout Britain,
and around the world...

1215
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,252
an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana's death.

1216
01:25:19,046 --> 01:25:21,984
We have all been trying,
in our different ways, to cope...

1217
01:25:23,324 --> 01:25:25,886
it is not easy
to express a sense of loss...

1218
01:25:26,214 --> 01:25:28,744
since the initial shock,
is often succeeded

1219
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:30,579
by a mixture
of other feelings...

1220
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,596
disbelief,
incomprehension, anger...

1221
01:25:33,865 --> 01:25:36,270
and concern for
those who remain.

1222
01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:41,857
We have all felt those
emotions in these last few days...

1223
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:46,742
so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1224
01:25:47,824 --> 01:25:49,471
I say from my heart.

1225
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:52,697
Heart...
What heart?

1226
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:54,800
She doesn't mean a word of this.

1227
01:25:55,236 --> 01:25:58,029
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

1228
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:02,187
That's how to survive.

1229
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,389
Listen to you...

1230
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:07,051
A week ago you were the
great moderniser...

1231
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,784
making speeches
about the people's Princess.

1232
01:26:10,424 --> 01:26:12,424
Now you've gone weak at the knees.

1233
01:26:16,355 --> 01:26:18,547
You know... I don't know
why I'm so surprised...

1234
01:26:19,589 --> 01:26:21,568
At the end of the day,
all Labour Prime Ministers...

1235
01:26:21,629 --> 01:26:23,511
go Ga-Ga for the Queen.

1236
01:26:24,803 --> 01:26:25,307
What?

1237
01:26:32,598 --> 01:26:36,421
I, for one, believe that there are
lessons to be drawn from her life...

1238
01:26:36,854 --> 01:26:40,184
and from the extraordinary,
and moving, reaction to her death.

1239
01:26:42,313 --> 01:26:45,433
I share in your determination,
to cherish her memory.

1240
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:50,371
I hope that tomorrow we
can all, wherever we are...

1241
01:26:50,583 --> 01:26:53,742
join in expressing our grief,
at Diana's loss...

1242
01:26:54,152 --> 01:26:57,003
and gratitude for her
all too short life.

1243
01:26:58,285 --> 01:27:00,656
May those who died,
rest in peace...

1244
01:27:01,207 --> 01:27:03,599
and may we,
each and everyone of us...

1245
01:27:04,173 --> 01:27:09,361
thank God, for someone who
made many, many people, happy.

1246
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:19,350
Diana's coffin, now on the move...

1247
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,836
the short distance
from St. James' Palace...

1248
01:27:22,407 --> 01:27:25,279
to her home at Kensington
Palace, for the final night...

1249
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:27,200
before her burial tomorrow.

1250
01:27:28,642 --> 01:27:29,368
It's incredible...

1251
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:30,977
less than a week.

1252
01:27:31,857 --> 01:27:33,899
Who could have imagined,
such scenes?

1253
01:28:48,982 --> 01:28:53,050
Diana was the very essence
of compassion, of duty...

1254
01:28:53,727 --> 01:28:55,871
of style, of beauty.

1255
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,999
A very British girl...

1256
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,311
who transcended nationality.

1257
01:29:01,134 --> 01:29:03,279
Someone with
a natural nobility...

1258
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:07,040
who was classless, and who
proved in the last year...

1259
01:29:07,281 --> 01:29:10,422
that she needed no royal title
to continue to generate...

1260
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,214
a particular brand of magic.

1261
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:19,398
I would like to end by,
thanking God...

1262
01:29:19,606 --> 01:29:22,440
for the small mercies he's
shown us at this dreadful time...

1263
01:29:23,185 --> 01:29:25,859
for taking Diana at
her most beautiful and radiant.

1264
01:29:26,198 --> 01:29:28,348
And when she had joy,
in her private life.

1265
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:32,196
Above all, we give thanks
for the life of a woman...

1266
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:34,756
I'm so proud
to be able to call my sister.

1267
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:37,391
The unique, the complexed...

1268
01:29:38,146 --> 01:29:40,733
the extraordinary,
and irreplaceable, Diana.

1269
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:44,235
Who's beauty, both internal
and external...

1270
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:47,237
will never be extinguished
from our minds.

1271
01:30:42,316 --> 01:30:45,954
-So, off to see your girlfriend?
-Now, now.

1272
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:51,310
You know, I hope she
shows you some respect this time.

1273
01:30:52,087 --> 01:30:54,294
It's quite a debt of gratitude,
she owes you.

1274
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:57,781
Mr. Saviour of the Monarchy.

1275
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:00,088
I doubt she'll see it that way...

1276
01:31:05,907 --> 01:31:07,736
-Robin... good to see you.
-Prime Minister.

1277
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:08,839
Tony, please.

1278
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,400
The Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

1279
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,472
Do sit down.

1280
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:32,771
Thank you.

1281
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:46,979
It's good to see you again.

1282
01:31:48,654 --> 01:31:51,282
After what's been...
quite a summer.

1283
01:31:52,218 --> 01:31:54,719
I'm referring to your visit
to India... and Pakistan.

1284
01:31:56,204 --> 01:31:58,824
Where your comments on
ending historic disagreements...

1285
01:31:58,885 --> 01:31:59,994
went down very well.

1286
01:32:02,325 --> 01:32:04,366
On the commonwealth heads
of government meeting...

1287
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,097
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi...

1288
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,978
and he was saying
how much he appreciated your...

1289
01:32:10,384 --> 01:32:12,110
tough stands on Nigeria...

1290
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:14,185
I meant to tell you at the time, but...

1291
01:32:16,014 --> 01:32:17,672
you were being monopolised, rather...

1292
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:23,194
I imagine those occasions
must be quite difficult.

1293
01:32:24,774 --> 01:32:28,534
24 heads of government, each
clamouring for a private audience.

1294
01:32:33,332 --> 01:32:37,628
Also we have another
chance to speak, since... that week.

1295
01:32:41,203 --> 01:32:42,885
And I wanted to offer my apologies.

1296
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:44,398
Whatever for?

1297
01:32:44,923 --> 01:32:48,981
In case you felt manhandled, or...
managed, in any way.

1298
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,542
No, not at all.

1299
01:32:56,746 --> 01:32:59,751
I don't think I shall ever understand,
what happened this summer.

1300
01:33:00,164 --> 01:33:04,182
Well... the circumstances
were exceptional, Ma'am...

1301
01:33:05,617 --> 01:33:08,483
And in the end you showed
great personal strength...

1302
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:10,891
courage and humility.

1303
01:33:11,228 --> 01:33:13,562
You're confusing humility,
with humiliation.

1304
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:15,115
That's not true.

1305
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:19,194
You didn't read the cards on the
flowers outside the Palace, that Friday.

1306
01:33:20,103 --> 01:33:23,036
I actually think history will show,
it was a good week for you.

1307
01:33:23,273 --> 01:33:25,315
And an even better one
for you, Mr. Blair.

1308
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:28,547
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, Ma'am...

1309
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:33,375
and 2500 in the time
since you've been Queen.

1310
01:33:36,682 --> 01:33:39,205
And when people come
to assess your legacy...

1311
01:33:39,793 --> 01:33:41,827
they won't remember those few days.
Oh, really?

1312
01:33:43,559 --> 01:33:46,808
You don't think what affection
people once had for...

1313
01:33:48,282 --> 01:33:49,567
for this institution...

1314
01:33:50,893 --> 01:33:51,914
has been diminished?

1315
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:52,805
No...

1316
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:54,187
not at all.

1317
01:33:55,464 --> 01:33:57,418
You're more respected now,
than ever...

1318
01:33:57,764 --> 01:34:01,391
I gather some of your closest advisers
were less fulsome in their support.

1319
01:34:03,383 --> 01:34:04,617
One or two...

1320
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,284
but as a leader, I could never
have added my voice to that chorus.

1321
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:10,983
Because you saw those headlines,
and you thought...

1322
01:34:11,044 --> 01:34:12,578
one day that might happen to me.

1323
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,967
And it will, Mr. Blair.

1324
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:19,650
Quite suddenly, and without warning.

1325
01:34:22,862 --> 01:34:25,172
So... shall we get on
with the business in hand?

1326
01:34:27,338 --> 01:34:28,394
Oh, look...

1327
01:34:30,353 --> 01:34:32,531
I do love this time of day.

1328
01:34:33,024 --> 01:34:34,789
Shall we walk, while there is still light?

1329
01:34:35,048 --> 01:34:38,048
You know the clocks go back
next week, it will be dark before five.

1330
01:34:38,721 --> 01:34:41,133
-I do hope you're a walker?
-I am...

1331
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:44,748
Good... I always think these meetings
have a far greater chance of success...

1332
01:34:45,017 --> 01:34:46,538
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

1333
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:49,869
As a matter of fact, that's
how I think best... on my feet...

1334
01:34:50,009 --> 01:34:52,602
I've never been one
for sitting around endlessly...

1335
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:55,299
a good walk and fresh air
sorts everything out.

1336
01:35:00,918 --> 01:35:04,272
One in four... you said...
wanted to get rid of me.

1337
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:05,954
For about half an hour.

1338
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:07,788
But then...

1339
01:35:08,477 --> 01:35:11,095
you came down to London,
and all that went away.

1340
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:15,639
I've never been hated
like that before.

1341
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:18,081
Then, that
must have been difficult...

1342
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:19,900
Yes...

1343
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:22,563
very.

1344
01:35:26,898 --> 01:35:30,510
Nowadays people want glamour,
and tears, the grand performance.

1345
01:35:31,027 --> 01:35:33,323
I'm not very good at that,
I never have been...

1346
01:35:34,698 --> 01:35:37,197
I prefer to keep
my feelings to myself.

1347
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:42,345
And foolishly I believed that was
what people wanted from their Queen...

1348
01:35:42,406 --> 01:35:45,292
not to make a fuss, nor wear one's
heart on one's sleeve...

1349
01:35:45,546 --> 01:35:47,880
duty first, self second.

1350
01:35:49,852 --> 01:35:51,399
That's how I was brought up...

1351
01:35:53,349 --> 01:35:54,786
that's all I've ever known.

1352
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:57,389
You were so young
when you became Queen.

1353
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:05,306
Yes...

1354
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,725
Yes, a girl.

1355
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:17,706
But I can see
that the world has changed...

1356
01:36:18,722 --> 01:36:19,535
and one must...

1357
01:36:20,802 --> 01:36:21,830
modernise.

1358
01:36:24,008 --> 01:36:26,524
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

1359
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:31,009
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister, and remember...

1360
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:33,219
I am the one
supposed to be advising you.

1361
01:36:38,078 --> 01:36:38,856
Come, dogs!

1362
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:51,079
Tell me, Mr. Blair, what might we expect
from our first parliament?

1363
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:56,147
Er... well, ma'am,
top of the list is education.

1364
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:59,591
We want to reduce classroom sizes.

1365
01:37:00,246 --> 01:37:00,981
Yes.

1366
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:05,426
And create a lower teacher-pupil ratio.
