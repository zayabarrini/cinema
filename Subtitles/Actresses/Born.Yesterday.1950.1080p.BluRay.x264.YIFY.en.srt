1
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,112
Captain!

2
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,412
-Eddie, my briefcase?
-Here.

3
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,331
Hang on to it.

4
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,014
All right, already. Come on, come on.

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,441
This way, Mr. Brock.

6
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,877
Mr. Brock, welcome to
the Washington Statler. Your wing--

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,840
-I ain't got a whole floor?
-You've got an entire wing.

8
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,760
I don't want one wing.
I want the whole bird.

9
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,974
-Your private elevator.
-Private? That's more like it.

10
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,226
-Hello.
-How are you?

11
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,477
Mr. Brock--

12
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,273
I thought you said this
was private. Take off.

13
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,735
You should be satisfied.

14
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,697
The public corridor and elevators--

15
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,993
-West, East and South Suite.
-Which one's mine?

16
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,496
The South Suite.
Each a private apartment.

17
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,753
Sleeping quarters upstairs,
terrace overlooks Washington.

18
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,797
-I'd like to point out--
-It's all right.

19
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,259
I'd like to point out
that this suite--

20
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,353
This suite is usually reserved
for foreign diplomats.

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,398
Oh, I almost forgot.
We thought you'd like this.

22
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,152
-Compliments of the management.
-Okay. Don't bother me.

23
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
May I?

24
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,996
May I show you the rest
of the accommodations?

25
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,257
Hey, Billie!

26
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,889
-What?
-Not bad, huh?

27
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,602
-It's all right.
-You know what this place costs a day?

28
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,647
Four hundred, you told me.

29
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,827
-Mrs. Brock seems delighted.
-It's not '' Mrs. Brock.''

30
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,038
Ain't no Mrs. Brock except my mother.
She's dead.

31
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,331
I see.

32
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,127
-Now look, don't get nosy.
-Oh, not at all.

33
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:18,383
She's a fiancÃ©e. Mine, in fact.
Eddie, take care of him.

34
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,719
Pardon me, sir.

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,931
-Thank you, Mr. Brock.
-Okay. Don't bother me.

36
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,184
How's the monarch of all he surveys?

37
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,396
-You plastered again?
-Still. Welcome.

38
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,606
I got things that can't wait.

39
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,985
-I got this ticket to get fixed.
-What about?

40
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,113
Some louse, just as we blew into town.

41
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,325
-I'm a lawyer, I don't own the law.
-What'd I do?

42
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,786
I'll see what I can manage.

43
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,748
-How'd we do?
-May cost a shade more.

44
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,624
-How much?
-It's negligible.

45
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,085
-Why more?
-Supply and demand, Harry.

46
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,422
Crooks are rare in these parts.
Don't worry.

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,383
Don't worry?
This stuff ain't deductible.

48
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,763
I'm not so sure.
'' ltem: One bribe, $80,000.''

49
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,766
Eighty! You're very handy
with my dough!

50
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,480
Fellow's coming up here any minute
to interview you. Paul Verrall.

51
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,982
Freelance snoop. Political stuff.

52
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,569
I don't wanna talk to no writer.
Eddie!

53
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,197
-You better talk to this one.
-Why?

54
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:27,827
He's one to look out for.
Take him in, then he won't go poking.

55
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,955
What's so important?

56
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,708
What we're after is important.

57
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,879
Listen, to get by in this town
takes power. You got some.

58
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,006
Takes money. You got plenty.

59
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,927
But above all, it takes
judgement and intelligence.

60
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,472
That's why you pay me
1 00,000 a year.

61
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:53,103
-What's all the excitement?
-Just making it clear where I fit in.

62
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,231
-Eddie, get me a shave up here.
-Right.

63
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,691
-Harry.
-What?

64
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,983
Barber shop!

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,821
Tell Billie to wear something plain
for the congressman.

66
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,824
Tell her yourself. You ain't pregnant.

67
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,743
Send up a barber
and a manicure right now.

68
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,414
Harry Brock! That's right.
Okay, make it snappy.

69
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,250
-And a shine!
-And a shine! Be right up.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,755
Look, don't you worry about Billie.
One thing, she knows how to dress.

71
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,590
Probably Verrall.

72
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,386
-Hello, Paul.
-Hello, Jim.

73
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,179
Harry Brock, Paul Verrall.

74
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,181
-How do you do?
-How are you?

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
-Ain't I seen you before?
-I'll leave you.

76
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,770
What'll you drink?

77
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,648
-Scotch, if you got it.
-lf I got it? Eddie.

78
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,692
Where do you think you are?

79
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,611
Where you been?
Get him a Scotch and--

80
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,071
-Soda?
-Water.

81
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,451
-Rye ginger ale for you?
-Right. He knows.

82
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,872
Worked for me many years.
He's my cousin. He knows me.

83
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,666
-Right.
-Maybe I'll interview Eddie.

84
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,920
Pretty good. Maybe you
got something there. Sit down.

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,799
What's it gonna be, pal?
A plug or a pan?

86
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,594
I know how to talk
if I know your angle.

87
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,388
-No angle, just facts.
-A pan?

88
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,224
-Not exactly.
-Write whatever you want.

89
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,185
Come up. I wanna get shaved.

90
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:20,231
Nobody can hurt me.
I'm only talking because Jim asked me.

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,444
Pay him 1 00 grand for advice,
I'm a sucker not to take it.

92
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,947
-That's right.
-Butt out, will you?

93
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,576
Devery likes it
when I get wrote about.

94
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,622
-What do you wanna know?
-How much money you got?

95
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,873
What?

96
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,043
-How much money?
-What am l, an accountant?

97
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,212
-You don't know?
-Not exactly.

98
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,631
-Fifty million?
-I don't know.

99
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,299
-Ten million?
-Maybe.

100
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,009
-One million?
-More.

101
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,011
-How much more?
-Plenty.

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,266
-I made every nickel of it.
-Nice work.

103
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,270
You're gonna give me the business.
That's all right.

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,565
-You got me all--
-Tell how I'm a roughneck.

105
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,276
Everybody's scared.
For me, that's good.

106
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,986
Well, not everybody.

107
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,366
Enough. You can't hurt me.
All you can do is build me up.

108
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,120
-Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.
-No, thanks, really.

109
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,832
Do what I tell you.
Who pays you around here?

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,462
At home, he shaves me.
I got my own barber chair, right?

111
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,131
That's right.

112
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,760
-Go ahead, pal. lnterview me.
-Where were you born?

113
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:36,224
Plainfield, New Jersey. 1 907. I went
to work when I was 1 2 years old.

114
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,146
I been working ever since.
My first job was a paper route.

115
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,898
I bought a kid out with a swift kick.

116
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,443
And you've been
working ever since.

117
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:51,573
Tell you how I'm top man in my racket.
Been in it 25 years.

118
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,160
-Steel.
-Not steel, junk.

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,622
-And I ain't ashamed to admit it.
-All right.

120
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,792
Here's some advice:
Never bull a bull artist.

121
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,212
I can sling it with the best of them.

122
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:10,842
-For 25 years, you say?
-Yeah. I'm a kid with a paper route.

123
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,804
I got a wagon. Going home,
I pick up junk in alleys.

124
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,266
I'm not the only one.
Other kids do it too.

125
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,895
Difference is, they keep it.
Not me. I sell it.

126
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,274
I'm making eight dollars in junk
and three from papers.

127
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,653
I see which is the right racket.
I'm a kid, but I see that.

128
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,282
Soon the guy I sell to
is handing me 20 a week.

129
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,745
Then he turns around,
offers me a job for 1 0. Dumb jerk.

130
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,082
I'd sell him his own stuff
and he never knew.

131
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,417
-How do you mean?
-Look....

132
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,213
In the night,
I drag it out, I load it up.

133
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,633
In the morning I go in
the front and collect.

134
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,803
-Twelve years old?
-Something like that.

135
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,806
-Pretty soon you own the yard.
-Right.

136
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,518
The jerk works for me now.
Know who else does?

137
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:07,065
The kid whose paper route I swiped.
I figure I owe him.

138
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,236
Good last few years
for the junk business.

139
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:16,032
-I ain't kicking.
-Do you anticipate any decline now?

140
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,494
-Talk plain.
-Is it still going to be good?

141
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,287
-We'll make it good.
-Who?

142
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,081
-Me, that's who.
-I see.

143
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,750
-Fancy talk don't go with me.
-Come in.

144
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,753
-Good evening.
-Hello.

145
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,173
-I'll get out--
-No, don't go. I like you.

146
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:36,136
Play your cards right,
I'll put you on the payroll.

147
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:41,474
Once over light, no talk.
I get a manicure every day.

148
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,020
Over there someplace.

149
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,982
Okay, fellow, go ahead.

150
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,360
I wonder what you're doing
in Washington.

151
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,739
What are you, a wonder boy?
Not so tight.

152
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,867
Sightseeing, that's what I'm doing.

153
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,786
Some talk you've come
to find out--

154
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,914
So far I've been nice to you.
Don't pump me.

155
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,669
How's it going? How are you getting
on with King Junk?

156
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,798
He was born in New Jersey.
Sure is a tough man to dig.

157
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,260
I can't believe that.
He loves to talk. Billie!

158
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,763
This is Paul Verrall.
Billie Dawn.

159
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,056
How do you do?

160
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,393
-Wait.
-What's the matter?

161
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,772
Where you going? Put it back!

162
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,316
-I just wanted--
-Put it back!

163
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,068
-Why--?
-Because I say.

164
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,196
Somebody's coming.
I don't want you stinking.

165
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:41,326
-Can't I just--?
-Go change. Don't give me no trouble!

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,037
Do what I'm telling you!

167
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,886
Barber, what'll you take
to cut his throat?

168
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,597
Some jokes I don't like.

169
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,351
-Don't get excited.
-Don't tell me what to do!

170
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,648
-Just a joke, Harry.
-That's all. I said beat it.

171
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,316
Eddie, take care of them.

172
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,819
-I'll be going too.
-No, don't.

173
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,113
You're the only friend
I got left.

174
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,534
I live around the corner.
lf anybody beats you, scream.

175
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,160
I'll come running.

176
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,038
-Goodbye, Jim. Thanks.
-Goodbye.

177
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,251
I need Billie's signature.

178
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,713
Sure. Billie!

179
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,759
-You sore?
-Not sore, Harry.

180
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,513
-You look funny.
-I know.

181
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,643
-You want an aspirin?
-No, no, I'm fine.

182
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,272
Considering I've been dead
for 1 6 years...

183
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,358
...I'm in remarkable health.

184
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,993
-Billie!
-What?

185
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,037
Billie!

186
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,500
-What?
-Come over here right away!

187
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,837
Honey, would you please
fix the safety catch?

188
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,215
-He sure got good lungs.
-Yeah. Thanks.

189
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,136
There's a shortcut through
the service. This way.

190
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,269
-That's the door, honey.
-Thanks, honey.

191
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,072
Sometime I don't understand you.

192
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,991
-Sometime?
-What do you want?

193
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,242
Jim.

194
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,245
Few things I want you to sign, honey.

195
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,958
-That's all I do around here.
-Too bad about you.

196
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,961
-When's this congressman coming?
-Anytime.

197
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,255
I better get fixed up, huh?

198
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,133
-She look all right?
-Look who's talking.

199
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,471
You tell me. I don't wanna start off
on no left foot.

200
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,142
What got into him?

201
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,270
Nothing. Wants to make
a good impression.

202
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,106
So let him.

203
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,152
Two places on this one, please.

204
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,489
What happened to all that stuff
I signed last week?

205
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,324
All used up.

206
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,036
I must've signed
about a million of these.

207
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,580
What you get as corporate officer.

208
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,917
I am? What do you know?

209
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,212
Come a long way from the chorus.

210
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,632
I wasn't only in the chorus.
I spoke lines.

211
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,301
-Really?
-Of course.

212
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,097
-How many?
-How many what?

213
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,850
-Lines did you speak?
-Five.

214
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,145
-I never knew that.
-Ask anybody.

215
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,980
I believe you.

216
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,818
I could've been a star
if I'd have stuck to it.

217
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:06,197
-Why didn't you?
-Harry didn't want me in the show.

218
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:10,326
He didn't wanna share me
with the general public.

219
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,953
I see.

220
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,834
Harry's changed. Don't you think so?

221
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,755
-How?
-He used to be more satisfied.

222
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,341
Now he's always
running around like this.

223
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,260
What'd he have to come
to Washington for?

224
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,431
-Long story.
-Well, don't tell it to me.

225
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,436
-I just wish he'd settle down.
-He's ambitious.

226
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,898
He talks all the time now.
He never used to.

227
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:45,195
Now he always tells me how
he's gonna be bigger, run everything.

228
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:50,950
-He may, at that.
-I don't care one way or the other.

229
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,663
-Take it easy.
-Now don't you start!

230
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,375
Better to drink after they're gone.

231
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,960
-This congressman?
-And Mrs. Hedges.

232
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,130
-This fella works for him.
-In a way.

233
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,841
So what's he putting it on for?

234
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,011
Just be nice. No rough language.

235
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,556
-I won't open my mush.
-I didn't mean that.

236
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:18,269
I don't have to be down here.
I could go back to my place.

237
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,980
In fact, I think I will.

238
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,777
-I tell you, Harry wouldn't like it.
-All right, all right!

239
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,247
How are you, Norval?
Haven't seen you in ages, Anna.

240
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,998
-You haven't.
-Come in.

241
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:44,004
You remember this little lady.
She used to be Billie Dawn.

242
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,297
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

243
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,217
This is Mr. Hedges
I've told you about.

244
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,094
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

245
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,848
-And this is Mrs. Hedges.
-Glad to meet you.

246
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,058
Glad to meet you.

247
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,026
-How about the terrace?
-That'd be nice.

248
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,360
-A drink?
-Love one.

249
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,446
-Sounds all right.
-Scotch?

250
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,115
-Scotch all around, Eddie.
-Right.

251
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,247
He's awfully tired.

252
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:24,377
-Stand over a hot resolution all day?
-Just about.

253
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,808
How do you like Washington,
Mrs. Brock?

254
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:51,112
-I haven't seen it yet.
-This is the first time you've been?

255
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,075
That's what I mean.
I never went on the road.

256
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,287
Well, we must show you around.
Beautiful city.

257
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,249
Too bad the Supreme Court
isn't in session.

258
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,085
What is it?

259
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,801
Lots of people'd
like to know that.

260
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,470
-Hello.
-Mr. Hedges, Harry Brock.

261
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,722
It's about time we got together.

262
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,725
Mrs. Hedges, I'm happy to meet you.

263
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,853
-Thank you.
-Sit down. Congressman.

264
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,488
-Have a good trip?
-I come in my car.

265
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:38,076
Stopped in Baltimore.
I got a junkyard there, second one.

266
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,579
-Before, I only had one.
-How many do you have?

267
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,957
I couldn't answer that, baby.

268
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,877
-Excuse me.
-That's all right.

269
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,424
I don't know why I like Baltimore.
I get a feeling from it.

270
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,385
-Sentimental.
-Yes, I'm sentimental.

271
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,264
I think we're all a bit sentimental.

272
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,435
Well, it's a free country.

273
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,278
-Do you play bridge, Mrs. Brock?
-No, only gin.

274
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,739
-I beg your pardon?
-Gin rummy.

275
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,866
Oh, yes, of course.

276
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:22,495
I was going to ask you to join us.
A few of the girls meet.

277
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,248
I don't play bridge.

278
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,501
-You could learn!
-I don't think so.

279
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:33,256
She couldn't play till I learned her.
Now she beats my brains out.

280
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,094
How're you fixed for time tomorrow?

281
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,805
-Ten o'clock?
-Pretty early for me.

282
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,058
I'll say.

283
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,936
-Eleven?
-Okay.

284
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,982
-I can drop by here.
-Sure, it's on your way.

285
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:55,362
We can discuss the operation
and get a head start.

286
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,452
Wanna wash your hands
or anything, honey?

287
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,246
<i>NO, thank yOu.</i>

288
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,919
I hope you're free
for Friday night dinner.

289
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,589
-People I want Harry to meet.
-Who wanna meet him.

290
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,010
-Thank you for everything, Mr. Brock.
-Call me Harry.

291
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,555
I haven't written you....
You understand.

292
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,475
You know I'm interested
in scrap iron.

293
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,646
I wanna sell it and not get stuck
with falling prices.

294
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:34,025
-I have a copy--
-Boil it down and give it to me.

295
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,738
I didn't come here to do paperwork.
The way I work is this:

296
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,825
Get the other guy
before he gets you.

297
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:48,415
I got in mind a worldwide
operating combo. Enough for everybody.

298
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:53,128
Up till now, everybody's lined up
and understands everybody.

299
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,090
-I wanna move.
-You understand that legislation--

300
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:02,595
That's a lot of hot air.
I ain't talking about peanuts....

301
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,933
Give them enough rope. I've said so.

302
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,524
The trouble with these do-gooders is--

303
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,987
They never seem to know when to stop.
I've said--

304
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,242
We can do this.
It's up to you to find out how.

305
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,995
One amendment, for example...

306
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,583
...guarantees government support
of scrap iron price levels.

307
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,626
We want to get it through.

308
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:38,131
See that you do. I'm here
to see that I get what I paid for.

309
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,593
-How do things look to you?
-Generally?

310
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:47,432
This country has to decide if
the people will run the government...

311
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,976
...or the other way around.

312
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,811
That's sound thinking.

313
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,855
-Thank you.
-Worthy of Holmes.

314
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,774
Great man, Holmes.

315
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,319
-My personal god.
-Who?

316
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,615
-Oliver Wendell Holmes.
-A wonderful man.

317
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,201
He gonna be here Friday night?

318
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,120
-I don't think so.
-Too bad.

319
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,873
-We mustn't keep you.
-We mustn't.

320
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,125
-Good night.
-Good night.

321
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,629
-Good night. See you tomorrow.
-That's right.

322
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,965
-Good night, Anna.
-Thank you so much.

323
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:25,136
Wait a while. I'll give you
something to thank me for.

324
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,681
Good night, all.

325
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,951
Drips.

326
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,412
-They're drips.
-Who are you to say?

327
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,748
-I'm myself.
-Nobody asked you. Shut up.

328
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,752
-Pardon me for living.
-Get lost.

329
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,797
-Not yet.
-Get lost, I told you.

330
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,313
-She'll be in the way.
-What are you gonna do?

331
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,650
-I'd like to give her the brush.
-Complicated.

332
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,154
-I know.
-She owns more of you than you do.

333
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:29,117
She's gonna louse me up down the line.
Dumb broad.

334
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,869
You may be right.

335
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,955
-Listen, Harry. Send her home.
-No.

336
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,707
Why not?

337
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,921
-I'm nuts for her.
-Can't have your cake and eat it.

338
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,423
Just a saying.

339
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:47,052
-That don't make any sense.
-All right.

340
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,768
-What's cake got to do with it?
-Nothing, Harry.

341
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,979
-Must be a way to smarten her up.
-I guess so.

342
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,899
-Some kind of school?
-I doubt that.

343
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,317
Then what?

344
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,112
We might find someone
to smooth the rough edges.

345
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,990
-How?
-Let me think about it.

346
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:14,037
I want you to think about something.
About marrying her.

347
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,706
Why marriage all of a sudden?

348
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,460
A wife couldn't testify
against her husband.

349
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,172
You've been engaged for seven years.
Why wait?

350
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,174
I didn't wanna be rushed.

351
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,928
We get married,
she'll think she's got it coming.

352
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,305
-She's different.
-A broad's a broad.

353
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,016
-You'll be sorry.
-I'll let you know.

354
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,977
We still gotta do something about her.

355
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:42,774
She opens her kisser,
something wrong come out. Talk to her.

356
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,235
-Take more than a talk.
-Then what?

357
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:48,571
It's not easy to make a person over.

358
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,826
Wait. That interview guy.
He's a smart cookie.

359
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,285
Paul Verrall.

360
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,996
He knows this town. He's classy.

361
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,082
-But he won't do it.
-Why?

362
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,585
-I'll pay him what he wants.
-I don't think so.

363
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,005
I bet you. What's his number?

364
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:09,259
-I'm not sure--
-What's his number? Come on.

365
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,304
-You ate already?
-Yeah.

366
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,348
-Piece of pie?
-No.

367
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,226
-Sit. How about a drink?
-No, thanks.

368
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,609
Okay, pal.

369
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,904
-I wanna ask you something.
-Sure.

370
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,033
-How much you make?
-Am I an accountant?

371
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:36,411
-I love this guy. Your name again?
-Verrall.

372
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,496
-Your regular name.
-Paul.

373
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:43,918
I got a friend, a good kid--
Maybe you seen her around. Billie?

374
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,796
She's a little on the stupid side.

375
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,341
I got her out of the chorus.

376
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,471
She'll be unhappy here,
never been with such kind of people.

377
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,473
-Know what I mean?
-I don't.

378
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,143
-You could help her out. Me too.
-How?

379
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:05,190
Explain things to her in your
spare time. What do you say?

380
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,028
-I don't think I could handle it.
-Mean an awful lot to me.

381
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,782
I'll give you 200 bucks a week.

382
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,329
-I'll do it.
-I love this guy.

383
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,247
-When do I start?
-Now.

384
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:26,711
Come with me and I'll introduce you.
You can take it from there.

385
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,718
Billie!

386
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,764
-What?!
-Come down here a minute. Come on in.

387
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,684
She's a nice kid.
You're gonna like her.

388
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:46,523
-I'm getting dressed.
-He's a friend of the family.

389
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,234
Come on, I'm telling you!

390
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,115
-This is Paul Verrall.
-I know.

391
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,991
He wants to talk to you.

392
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,244
-What about?
-You'll find out.

393
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:03,832
Jim and I got work to do.
I'll have to leave you two.

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,889
Your friend, Mr. Brock, has an idea.

395
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,268
He'd like us to spend
a little time together.

396
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,145
You and me, that is.

397
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,439
-You don't say.
-Yes.

398
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,984
-What are you, a gigolo?
-Not exactly.

399
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,738
-So what's the idea?
-Well, it's nothing special.

400
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:39,659
He'd like me to put you wise
to a few things, show you the ropes.

401
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,412
-Answer any questions.
-I got none.

402
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,749
-I'll give you some.
-Thanks.

403
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,378
It might be fun for you.
There's a lot to see here.

404
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,672
I'd be glad to show you around.

405
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,175
-You know the Supreme Court?
-Yes.

406
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:58,094
-I'd like to take that in.
-Fine.

407
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,597
-We're on, then?
-How you mean?

408
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,015
The arrangement.

409
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:06,019
-I don't mind. Got nothing to do.
-Good.

410
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,147
-What's he paying you?
-Two hundred.

411
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,233
You could've got more.
He's got plenty.

412
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,694
Oh, I'd have done it for free.

413
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,363
-I would.
-Why?

414
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,532
This isn't work. I like it.

415
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,410
-He thinks I'm too stupid, huh?
-No.

416
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,205
He's right. I'm stupid and I like it.

417
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,248
-You do?
-Sure.

418
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,836
I got everything I want.
Two mink coats, everything.

419
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:35,006
lf there's something I want, I ask.

420
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,884
And if he don't act friendly...

421
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,055
...I don't act friendly.

422
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:47,227
As long as I know how to get
what I want, that's all.

423
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,563
-As long as you know what you want.
-Sure.

424
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,526
-What?
-As long as you know what you want.

425
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:58,655
-Are you trying to mix me up?
-Well, no.

426
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,413
-I'll tell you what I would like.
-Yes?

427
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:10,083
-I'd like to learn how to talk good.
-All right.

428
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,877
-Is it hard?
-I don't think so.

429
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,963
What do I have to do?

430
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,550
I might give you
a few books to start with.

431
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:22,345
Every now and then I'll correct you.

432
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,265
-Go ahead.
-Well, that is, when I know.

433
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,184
-I don't talk so good myself.
-You'll do.

434
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:31,396
-Good.
-I never say ''ain't.'' Did you notice?

435
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,315
-Oh, I do.
-I'll correct you then.

436
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,153
-Do that.
-Since I was small I never say it.

437
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,031
Our teacher used to slug you
if you did.

438
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,116
-Did what?
-Said ''ain't.''

439
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,911
-I got out of the habit.
-Was it worth the slugging?

440
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,288
Oh, not hard.

441
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,167
There's too much slugging.
I don't believe in it.

442
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,836
-I don't believe in it either.
-Good.

443
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,797
-I learn fast.
-You're great, Miss Dawn.

444
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,092
-Billie.
-Billie. An odd name, isn't it?

445
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,762
Half the kids I know are named it.

446
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,932
-Anyway, it isn't my real name.
-Oh? What is?

447
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,769
Holy cats. Emma.

448
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,856
-What's the matter?
-Do I look to you like an Emma?

449
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,443
No. You don't look
like a Billie either.

450
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,528
What do I look like?

451
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,989
-To me?
-Yeah, you.

452
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,160
You look like a lovely girl.

453
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,416
Let me ask you....

454
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:40,715
Are you one of these talkers, or would
you be interested in a little action?

455
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:45,136
-What?
-I got a yen for you right off.

456
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:49,015
-Well, do you get many?
-Now and then.

457
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:52,560
-What do you do about it?
-You'll find out.

458
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,815
-I will.
-Want a tip? Sweet-talk me, I like it.

459
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:02,028
Like that '' lovely girI'' line.
Don't worry, he don't see a thing.

460
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,156
He's too dizzy from being a big man.

461
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,201
This is gonna be different
than I thought.

462
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,620
-Do you mind?
-No.

463
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,708
It's only fair.
We'll educate each other.

464
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,711
-About those books.
-Yes?

465
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:23,216
I'll look around. lf there's anything
interesting, I'll drop it back.

466
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:27,637
You can drop it back even
if it's not so interesting.

467
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,604
-You two gonna get together?
-I think we're all set.

468
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:41,359
-Great, great. Appreciate it.
-So do l.

469
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,320
Well, I guess-- I guess I'll be going.

470
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,908
So long, kid!

471
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,330
So long, kid.

472
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,125
Gin!

473
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,507
Forty-one.

474
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,968
-Forty-one?
-Forty-one.

475
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,268
Pay attention, that Verrall guy
can do you some good.

476
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,312
All right.

477
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:12,487
You're in the big league.
You should watch your step.

478
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,739
All right.

479
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:22,872
You gotta learn to fit in.
Can't have you around if you don't.

480
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,753
Have to be careful
of what you do and say.

481
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,588
Three.

482
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:37,929
Twenty-eight.

483
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,390
-Twenty-eight?
-Twenty-eight!

484
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,574
You could use a little
education yourself.

485
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,576
-Who asked you?
-Nobody.

486
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,870
So shut up!

487
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:19,387
-Can't I talk?
-Go on, play your cards.

488
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:31,900
-It's a free country.
-That's what you think.

489
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:08,436
Do you mind?!

490
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,567
Gin.

491
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,701
Thirty-four.

492
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,704
-Thirty-four?
-Thirty-four!

493
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,003
-Schneider!
-What?

494
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,505
$55.60.

495
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,675
-All right, that's enough.
-Pay me now.

496
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:42,512
-Don't you trust me?
-Sore loser!

497
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,389
Shut up!

498
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:49,060
Fifty-five dollars and 60 cents.

499
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:16,796
Thanks.

500
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,768
-You gonna play like that all night?
-What?

501
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,738
Hurt your eyes.

502
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,022
-Hello.
-Hello.

503
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,359
I tried your suite. No answer.

504
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,278
Yeah, I know. I'm not in.

505
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:27,867
-Morning papers.
-Oh, I don't read papers.

506
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:31,913
-Never?
-Once in a while, the funnies.

507
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:35,166
I think you should.
The not-so-funnies.

508
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,418
Why?

509
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:39,587
-Well, it's interesting.
-Not to me.

510
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,423
How do you know?

511
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:45,844
lf you're gonna turn out
to be a pest, we can call it off.

512
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,095
Sorry.

513
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:51,850
I look at the papers sometimes,
but I never understand it.

514
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,935
So what's the sense?

515
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:58,189
Look through these, and anything
you don't understand...

516
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,735
...make a circle around it.
Then I'll explain.

517
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,571
-Whatever I can. All right?
-All right.

518
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:08,116
And I thought you might like these.

519
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,660
Well, I'll try.

520
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:16,249
Start reading. lf you don't
like it, start something else.

521
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,169
One thing, my eyesight isn't so hot.

522
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:21,546
Why don't you wear glasses?

523
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,632
-Sure, why not?
-Because it's terrible.

524
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:44,110
Of course, they're not so bad on men.

525
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:50,283
-Good night, Billie.
-Good night.

526
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,763
Hello!

527
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,976
Miss Dawn around?

528
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,399
-Have you seen Miss Dawn?
-In her room.

529
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,030
-Hello?
-Yes?

530
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:32,158
-Ready to start.
-Come on up!

531
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:07,444
-Hello.
-Hello.

532
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,451
-Been reading, huh? That's good.
-Yeah.

533
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,454
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

534
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:29,549
-Did you have your breakfast yet?
-And lunch.

535
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:36,014
-There's a few things here.
-Which?

536
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:52,906
Read it out.

537
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,034
You want me to read?

538
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,829
Billie, things
are complicated enough...

539
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,333
...without complicating them further.

540
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,589
I ought to take this pencil
and make a circle around you.

541
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,471
-Here are a few places you should see.
-A few?

542
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,476
The Capitol. I'll tell you all I know,
then we'll join a tour.

543
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,396
Senate's in session today.

544
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:28,149
Let's go to the rotunda.
It's famous for its--

545
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:32,654
-Come on. You'll find it interesting.
-I'm coming.

546
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,656
--now before Congress.

547
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:40,036
On the walls of this rotunda
are eight historical paintings....

548
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,291
--with the landing of the Pilgrims....

549
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,129
--Revolutionary War paintings,
depicting the start...

550
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:53,633
...and finish of that war,
and its two greatest battles.

551
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:59,973
The east wall contains paintings
predating the Revolutionary period.

552
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:04,269
<i>--The GlOrificatiOn</i>
<i>Of the Spirit Of GeOrge WashingtOn.</i>

553
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:08,857
Washington is the figure
with the purple robe on his lap.

554
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:14,154
The figures around him
represent Liberty and Victory.

555
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:19,284
Brumidi did most of that work
lying on his back...

556
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:23,580
...on a scaffold built
from the floor to the dome...

557
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:27,917
...a distance of 1 80 feet
and 3 inches.

558
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,171
Now if you'll follow me....

559
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:35,091
How could anybody paint
upside down like that?

560
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,219
Hey, give me one of those.

561
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:53,026
-Hello.
-How are you?

562
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,626
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

563
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,051
There's the Constitution...

564
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,016
...the Declaration of lndependence.
And come here.

565
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:13,565
And the Bill of Rights.
Know how old these are?

566
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,318
-Oh, about 1 60 years.
-Who told you?

567
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:21,031
-What else do you know about it?
-What else?

568
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:25,410
-What else?
-This whole country...

569
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:29,581
...is founded on these
three pieces of paper.

570
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,292
This whole country?

571
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:41,092
''The right of the people
to keep and bear arms...

572
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:45,221
-...shall not be in-fringed.''
-lnfringed.

573
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:51,353
Good thing it's covered with glass.
I'd be making circles all over it.

574
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:54,397
How about some ice cream?

575
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:58,985
Anything but tutti-frutti.

576
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,572
-How's chocolate?
-Fine.

577
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:06,117
-I like you better with them on.
-What?

578
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,370
Your glasses!

579
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:16,461
Thanks. You know, chocolate's
the most popular.

580
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,171
I read that.

581
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:24,010
It's interesting how many things
a person could learn if they read.

582
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,180
I don't suppose you read my piece.

583
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,892
What are you talking?
Of course I read it. Twice.

584
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,811
What did you think?

585
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:38,108
It's the best thing I ever read.
I didn't understand one word.

586
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,987
-What didn't you understand?
-None of it.

587
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,533
Here. Show me what.

588
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:59,713
What's so funny?
That I'm blind, practically?

589
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,756
Practically blind.

590
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,426
-Practically blind?
-You're wonderful.

591
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:08,888
-I'm sorry I look funny to you.
-You look lovelier than ever.

592
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:12,642
You sound like one of those
ads for eyeglasses.

593
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:14,978
What didn't you understand?

594
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:19,733
Well, like the name of it:
''The Yellowing Democratic Manifesto.''

595
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:24,070
-Simple.
-To who? Whom? Who?

596
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,364
Well, anyway, not to me.

597
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,951
-You know what ''yellowing'' means.
-Not this time.

598
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,621
When a piece of paper gets old,
what happens to it?

599
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,000
-Throw it away?
-No, it turns yellow.

600
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,918
-It does?
-Of course.

601
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,046
What do you know?

602
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:45,216
-You know what '' Democratic'' means.
-Not Republican.

603
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:48,970
Well, not exactly.

604
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,933
It means pertaining to our form
of government, which is a democracy.

605
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:58,104
-What's pertaining?
-'' Has to do with.''

606
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:00,732
Pertaining. Nice word.

607
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,735
-All right. '' Manifesto.''
-I don't know.

608
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:07,572
-Why didn't you look it up?
-I did. I still don't know.

609
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:12,660
By ''manifesto'' I mean the rules,
principles, ideals and hopes...

610
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,580
...on which the United States is based.

611
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:19,209
The ideas of the men who
wrote the Constitution.

612
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:22,128
-You think it's turning yellow?
-Yes.

613
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:25,674
The original inspiration
has been forgotten.

614
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,760
-And that's bad?
-And that's bad.

615
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:33,723
'' Even a--''

616
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:35,767
-'' Cursory''?
-Cursory.

617
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:39,229
''--examination of contemporary...

618
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,148
...society in terms of the Greek...

619
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:46,277
...philosophy, which defines
the whole as a representation...

620
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:49,406
...of its parts,
sends one immediately...

621
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:53,576
...to the consideration of
the individual as a citizen...

622
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,830
...and the citizen as an individual.''

623
00:49:57,038 --> 00:50:01,334
-Well?
-I looked up every word.

624
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,005
Listen.

625
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:08,758
Thousands of years ago,
a Greek philosopher said...

626
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,429
...the world could only be
as good as its inhabitants.

627
00:50:12,637 --> 00:50:14,431
-Makes sense.
-So I said...

628
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,516
...take one look at America...

629
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:21,229
...and you figure you better look
at the people in it. One by one.

630
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,981
That's all.

631
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,109
-That's this?
-Sure.

632
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:29,029
Well, why didn't you say so?

633
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:21,581
-What's the name of this number?
-Beethoven's Second Symphony, Opus 36.

634
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,127
I didn't ask you who made it up.
I just asked the name of it.

635
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,606
Here. Wait a minute.

636
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:53,279
-There.
-Thanks.

637
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:59,911
-I can't get over it.
-Music that bad?

638
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:04,749
-The music? Oh, it was swell.
-Well then, what?

639
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:07,877
I got a letter today, from my father.

640
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,421
-New York?
-Yeah.

641
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,132
-I can't get over it.
-Why?

642
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,094
It's the first time he wrote me
in about eight years.

643
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:21,850
We had a fight, sort of.
He didn't want me to go with Harry.

644
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:23,393
What does he do?

645
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,186
-My father?
-Yeah.

646
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,772
Gas company. He read metres...

647
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:31,443
...but he can't get around
so good anymore...

648
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:35,613
...so they gave him a different job.
Elevator man.

649
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:39,659
He's a goofy old guy.
He used to take a frying pan...

650
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,163
...to work every day
and cook his lunch.

651
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,875
He said everybody
should have a hot lunch.

652
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,878
I don't know how he did it.

653
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:53,757
Four of us. Me and my three brothers.
He did everything.

654
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:56,676
My mother died. I never knew her.

655
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:01,348
He used to feed us and give us
our bath and buy our clothes.

656
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,350
Everything.

657
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:09,731
All my life I used to think how
someday I'd like to pay him back.

658
00:53:13,276 --> 00:53:16,071
It's funny how it worked out.

659
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:22,535
Once I brought home $1 00 and gave it
to him. You know what he did?

660
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:28,708
Well, it sure didn't
do the plumbing no good.

661
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:34,839
I thought he'd hit me, but he didn't.
His whole life, he never hit me once.

662
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:39,344
How'd he happen to write you,
after all this time?

663
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:41,721
Because I wrote him.

664
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,475
He says he's thought about me
every day.

665
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,186
Gosh!

666
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:54,651
I haven't thought about him,
I bet once even, in five years.

667
00:53:55,694 --> 00:54:00,365
Oh, that's nothing against him.
I haven't thought of anything.

668
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,992
Be nice to see him, maybe.

669
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:05,328
I guess so.

670
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:10,709
He says I should write again, and
I should have a hot lunch every day.

671
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:13,503
And I should let him know how I am.

672
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:18,258
But he won't see me if I'm still
living in any way unethical.

673
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:20,510
I looked it up.

674
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,638
He always said, '' Never do nothing...

675
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:27,809
...you wouldn't want printed
in the <i>New YOrk Times. ''</i>

676
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:34,691
I practically told you the whole
story of my life by now.

677
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,444
I enjoyed it very much.

678
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:41,573
-How about the story of your life?
-Oh, no.

679
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:43,867
Much too long...

680
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:46,995
...and mostly untrue.

681
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:23,406
This is even more gorgeous than
the Radio City Music Hall, even.

682
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:26,618
And do you notice? It smells nice.

683
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:28,536
It does!

684
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,627
-Come on. Sit down.
-No.

685
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:37,671
You're tired.

686
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,633
I'm not a bit tired.

687
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:45,845
See?

688
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:49,057
You know the thing you gave me
about Napoleon?

689
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:51,309
-What?
-By Robert G. lngersoll?

690
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,895
-Oh, yes.
-I'm not sure I get it.

691
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:56,981
-There's no deep meaning.
-There must be.

692
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,276
He goes and looks in Napoleon's tomb...

693
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:03,446
...and he thinks
of Napoleon's sad life.

694
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:08,493
And then he says he himself
would have rather been a happy farmer.

695
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:14,791
'' I would rather have been a French
peasant, and worn wooden shoes.

696
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,879
I would rather have lived in a hut
with a vine growing over the door.

697
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:24,384
And the grapes growing purple
in the kisses of the autumn sun.

698
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:30,181
I would rather have been a poor
peasant, with my wife by my side...

699
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,560
...knitting as the day
died out of the sky...

700
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:38,148
...with my children upon my knee
and their arms about me.

701
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:41,443
I would rather have been that man...

702
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:46,072
...and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust...

703
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:50,702
...than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder...

704
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:53,580
...known as Napoleon the Great.''

705
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,002
How do you remember
all that stuff?

706
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:09,304
So he'd rather be a happy peasant
than Napoleon. Who wouldn't?

707
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:11,639
Harry wouldn't, for one.

708
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:14,851
-What makes you think that?
-Ask him.

709
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,645
He probably never heard
of Napoleon.

710
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:21,733
What's worse, he probably never
heard of a peasant.

711
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,153
Do you hate him like poison?

712
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,030
-Who? Harry?
-Yeah.

713
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,032
-No.
-You don't like him.

714
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,492
No.

715
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:34,371
-On account of me and him?
-One reason. There are lots more.

716
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:38,124
-What?
-Think about it. Harry's a menace.

717
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,794
He's not so bad. I seen worse.

718
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:43,880
Has he ever thought of anyone
but himself?

719
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,507
Who does?

720
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:49,135
History is the story
of the struggle between...

721
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:52,847
-...the selfish and the unselfish.
-I can hear you.

722
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,975
All that's bad is bred by selfishness.

723
00:57:56,184 --> 00:58:00,730
Sometimes selfishness can get to be
a cause, an organized force.

724
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:04,192
Even a government.
Then it's called fascism.

725
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:07,696
-Can you understand that?
-Sort of.

726
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:12,534
-Well, think about it.
-You're crazy about me, aren't you?

727
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:16,079
-Yes.
-That's why you get so mad at Harry.

728
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:21,209
I hate his life, what he does,
what he stands for. Not him.

729
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:26,589
-He just doesn't know any better.
-I go for you too.

730
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,926
I'm glad of it.

731
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:48,611
'' I've sworn upon the altar of God...

732
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,950
...eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny...

733
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,454
...over the mind of man.''

734
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:03,335
So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?

735
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,920
I heard quite a bit about him.

736
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:09,341
I mean even before
I hit town, even.

737
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,062
Come in.

738
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:30,779
What are you trying to do
with those books, hatch them?

739
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:33,948
Blue?

740
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:37,911
Nice, that.

741
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,873
Beethoven. Op 36.

742
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,712
-What's up?
-It's because of you I'm doing this.

743
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:50,215
-I guess you know.
-No, I didn't.

744
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,845
A lot of good it did me.
I never had this trouble before.

745
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,932
-Trouble?
-Sure.

746
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,520
When I met you, I figured everything
is gonna work out dandy.

747
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:07,357
Then when you wouldn't
step across the line...

748
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:11,361
...I figured maybe the way
to you is through your head.

749
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:13,988
Well, no.

750
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:19,411
Well, anyway, what's the diff now?
Difference.

751
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:23,498
But I like you anyway.
It's too late for the rest.

752
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:26,543
-Why?
-Why?

753
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:30,505
There's a certain time
between a fellow and a girl...

754
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:35,385
...when it either comes off or not.
lf it doesn't then, it never does.

755
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:41,474
-Maybe we haven't got to our time yet.
-I think so. You dropped the ball.

756
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:43,309
Don't be so sure.

757
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:47,480
I never thought I'd
go through a thing like this.

758
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:50,859
-Like what?
-Like getting all mixed-up.

759
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:55,321
Like wondering and worrying
and thinking. Stuff like that.

760
01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:00,660
Last night I started thinking.
I couldn't fall asleep for 1 0 minutes!

761
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:04,831
I don't know if it's good
to find out so much so quick.

762
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,003
Nobody's born smart. Know what
the stupidest thing on earth is? A baby.

763
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,380
What have you got against babies?

764
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,718
I've got nothing against a brain
that's three weeks old.

765
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:20,680
But if it's still empty after
30 years, I begin to wonder.

766
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,433
-Who says I'm 30?
-I didn't--

767
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:25,018
-You did!
-I swear.

768
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:27,645
-You sure can get me sore.
-Sorry.

769
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:29,856
-Do I look 30 to you?
-No.

770
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,859
-Then why'd you say it?
-I don't know.

771
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,945
-How old are you?
-Twenty-nine!

772
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:41,826
Don't stop.

773
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,287
I meant, don't stop studying.

774
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,373
Will you?

775
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,043
I don't know why
it's so important to you.

776
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:53,213
Sort of a cause.
I want everyone to be smart.

777
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:55,548
As smart as they can be.

778
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,593
A world of ignorant people
is dangerous.

779
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:04,224
-That's why I wish I was doing better.
-You're doing wonderfully.

780
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:08,687
Most people would laugh
if they knew what I was trying....

781
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:13,608
-I'm not laughing.
-I am. I'm sort of laughing at myself.

782
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:16,611
Who do I think I am, anyway?

783
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,704
Once in a while, for a change.

784
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:29,165
Don't try so hard.
You miss the whole point.

785
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:33,670
-I wanna like what's best to like.
-You have room for a lot.

786
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,131
One learns to be bigger, not smaller.

787
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:38,550
-I'm getting bigger?
-Yes.

788
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,802
Glad to hear it.

789
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,013
But all them books!

790
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:45,932
I told you, it's not only books.

791
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,059
-It's mostly.
-It is not.

792
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:51,604
Who said, ''The proper study
of mankind is man''?

793
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,314
-Who?
-You should know.

794
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:54,566
-Why?
-I told you.

795
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:56,026
-I forgot.
-Pope.

796
01:02:56,234 --> 01:02:59,946
-The pope?
-Not ''the pope.'' Alexander Pope.

797
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,617
-''The proper study--''
-''--of mankind is man.''

798
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:07,954
-Of course, that means women too.
-Yes.

799
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:09,789
Yes, I know.

800
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,877
I've been studying
different mankind lately.

801
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:18,757
Like the ones you told me.
Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine.

802
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,469
And all by myself
I got to thinking about Harry.

803
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:26,890
He works so hard
to get what he wants, for instance.

804
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,559
But he doesn't know what he wants.

805
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,896
-More of what he's got, probably.
-Money.

806
01:03:33,104 --> 01:03:36,816
Money, more people to push around,
more money.

807
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:39,903
He's not so bad as you think he is.

808
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,990
We were just talking about you.

809
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,953
That ain't why I pay you.
She knows enough about me. Too much.

810
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:51,831
Jim phone? I had a date with him.

811
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,668
-What about Paine?
-He was quite a fellow.

812
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:58,797
-Where was he born?
-London or England. A place like that.

813
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:02,258
-London or--? It's the same thing.
-It is?

814
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:06,304
London's a city
in the country of England.

815
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:08,556
-You got patience.
-Take it easy.

816
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:12,352
-How can she be so dumb?
-We can't all know everything.

817
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,689
-Who's Tom Paine, for instance?
-What?

818
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:19,275
-You heard me. Tom Paine.
-What do I care?

819
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:20,527
I know.

820
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:24,656
lf I wanted to know who he is,
I'd know. I don't care.

821
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:28,159
-Don't let me butt in.
-Which book did you like?

822
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:31,996
I didn't read by him.
Only about him. I made a list.

823
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:34,666
-Who's '' Rabbit'' Maranville?
-Who?

824
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:37,711
-'' Rabbit'' Maranville.
-I don't know rabbits.

825
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:41,965
-Think you're smart, huh?
-He was shortstop for the Braves.

826
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:45,010
-What are you? Some kind of genius?
-No.

827
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:48,263
-I hire and fire geniuses every day.
-I'm sure.

828
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:50,265
-Where's the list?
-Here.

829
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:53,643
Suppose you start
with <i>The Age Of ReasOn.</i>

830
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,187
<i>-The Age Of ReasOn</i>?
-Then, next--

831
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:59,107
-Who's Willie Hop?
-Billiard champion.

832
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:02,193
-It's pronounced '' Hoppe.''
-I asked her.

833
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:05,530
-Sorry. Where were we?
<i>-The Age Of ReasOn.</i>

834
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,117
-Yes. Next, <i>The Rights Of Man.</i>
<i>-The Rights Of Man.</i>

835
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,578
-I think--
-What's a peninsula?

836
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,914
You think you're so smart?
What's a peninsula?

837
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:19,252
-Not you. Her.
-It's that new medicine.

838
01:05:21,546 --> 01:05:23,048
It is not.

839
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:26,134
-What then?
-A body of land...

840
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,845
...surrounded on three sides
by water.

841
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:32,015
-So what?
-So what about Sam Paine?

842
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:35,894
Some difference between--
Tom Paine! Not Sam Paine!

843
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:40,357
Tom Paine practically started
this whole country.

844
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:43,318
-You mean he's dead?
-Of course.

845
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:47,364
I want you to learn her how to act
with live people.

846
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:50,325
Education's difficult to control--

847
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:52,660
-Work on her.
-No extra charge.

848
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:56,122
-I don't need nothing you can tell me.
-We could...

849
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,167
...tell each other some
interesting things.

850
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:01,628
-What's the idea?
-Being friendly.

851
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:03,254
Who asked you?

852
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,341
The more I see you
I don't like you as much.

853
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:08,510
You're awful fresh.

854
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,889
-Watch out. I got my eye on you.
-Okay. We'll both watch out.

855
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:16,559
-I could knock your block off.
-Yes, I know.

856
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:20,146
Just do what you're supposed
to do, that's all.

857
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:21,606
We'll stop now.

858
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:25,110
-Go on. I wanna see how you do it.
-Not now.

859
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:28,947
I've gotta lie down.
You don't realize how hard I work.

860
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,407
Some joke!

861
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:35,578
-200 bucks a week and I can't watch.
-Take you on separately. Glad to.

862
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:39,374
Got a special course
for backward millionaires.

863
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:50,427
'' London or England.''
Why don't you give up?

864
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,732
-Harry?
-What?

865
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:08,528
What's this business we're in
down here? Could you tell me?

866
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,405
What do you mean, ''we''?

867
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:14,409
-I figure I'm a partner, in a way.
-A silent partner.

868
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:17,120
-So?
-So shut up.

869
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:20,498
I got a right to know.

870
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:23,793
Keep out of my hair.
Put your nose in a book.

871
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:27,172
I don't want to do anything
against the law.

872
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,923
Do what I tell you.

873
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:32,135
I think I know what it is,
only I'm not sure.

874
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,888
What's the matter?
You do all right.

875
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,807
Something you want
you ain't got, maybe?

876
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:44,022
-What?
-I wanna be like the happy peasant.

877
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,569
All right, I'll buy it for you.
Now will you quit crabbing?

878
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,615
I finished finally.
Thanks loads for the loan.

879
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:56,117
-How'd you like it?
-Oh, not me.

880
01:07:56,326 --> 01:08:00,413
I don't like when everyone
has a beef against the world.

881
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:04,501
-I like to look on the cheerful side.
-Well, the point--

882
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:10,256
-Can the coffee klatch. You, knock off.
-Sorry, Mr. Brock.

883
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:14,052
-Don't get so pally.
-Paul says it's okay.

884
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:17,806
-Never mind him. I don't like it.
-Know what you are?

885
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:19,265
What?

886
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:31,861
-Antisocial!
-You can say that again.

887
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,531
Where you guys been?

888
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,533
-Sorry.
-You're always sorry.

889
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:39,744
-My fault. How do you do?
-How do you do?

890
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:44,457
-How are you, Billie?
-Superb. A new word.

891
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:49,087
-All right, what happened?
-It may take more time--

892
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,047
-And more money.
-Why more?

893
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,259
The amendment has to be redrafted.

894
01:08:56,511 --> 01:09:00,974
-You make me feel like a sucker.
-NorvaI's doing his best.

895
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:04,728
-It ain't good enough.
-There are a lot of votes.

896
01:09:04,936 --> 01:09:07,856
-NorvaI's just one guy.
-He's the wrong guy.

897
01:09:09,482 --> 01:09:11,317
I'm sick of waiting.

898
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:16,197
Pull your weight in this deal
or I'll get somebody who can.

899
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:19,367
Quite a temper.

900
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:25,373
Don't mind him. He's always lived
at the top of his voice. So long, Norval.

901
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:43,767
Harry shouldn't talk to you like that.
You're a congressman.

902
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:45,268
Oh, well.

903
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:50,148
No one should talk to a congressman
like that, or be able to.

904
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:54,778
-Being a congressman is wonderful.
-Thank you.

905
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:57,489
I think I could use a drink.

906
01:09:57,697 --> 01:10:01,201
Oh, sure, congressman. Come on in.

907
01:10:02,118 --> 01:10:06,915
lf he pushes you around, he's
pushing a few million people around.

908
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:09,417
-Who?
-The ones who picked you.

909
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:12,045
-Not quite that many.
-How many?

910
01:10:12,253 --> 01:10:15,465
306,434.

911
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:18,760
That's quite a few to push around.

912
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:23,556
You're not one of my constituents
by any chance, are you?

913
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:35,360
-One of the people who voted for me?
-Oh, I never voted for anybody.

914
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:37,904
-Why not?
-I wouldn't know how.

915
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:42,117
-Simple. You just press a button.
-Yeah. But which one?

916
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:47,956
You listen to the speeches.
You make up your own mind. That's all.

917
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:50,458
Why do you take it from Harry?

918
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:54,838
You're more important than him.
You're a congressman.

919
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:58,383
Yes, and as such,
I have a great many duties...

920
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:01,469
...and responsibilities and....

921
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:05,056
The operation of government
is very complex.

922
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:10,228
Why should it be? I understand it in
the books, and when Paul tells me.

923
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:13,732
But when I see this
happen, it's different.

924
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,191
How?

925
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,113
When it's a matter of the law,
is Harry more important than others?

926
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,322
No.

927
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:26,327
Then how come he's got so much to say?
Who ever voted for him?

928
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:34,461
Well, we'll have a nice,
long talk about it sometime.

929
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:38,006
All right.

930
01:11:38,256 --> 01:11:40,550
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

931
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,594
And thank you.

932
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:54,272
Quite a little girl.

933
01:11:56,775 --> 01:11:58,401
-Billie?
-Come in.

934
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:02,822
Will you come inside?
A few things for you.

935
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:14,918
Sign those, will you, honey?

936
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:20,298
-What is this?
-Same old stuff.

937
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:24,094
-What?
-Take too long to explain.

938
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:28,932
I like having things explained
to me. I found that out.

939
01:12:29,182 --> 01:12:32,018
-Some other time.
-Now.

940
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:36,606
-It's an agreement about a merger.
-Merger?

941
01:12:36,856 --> 01:12:40,694
-What's that?
-Several companies becoming one.

942
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,987
-All Harry's?
-No.

943
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:44,322
Whose, then?

944
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:48,702
A few of Harry's and some others.
French, ltalian and so on.

945
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,954
A cartel!

946
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:55,917
-What are you talking about?
-Cartels. I'm against it.

947
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,794
Paul explained it to me.

948
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:01,131
-It's perfectly all right.
-Are you sure?

949
01:13:01,339 --> 01:13:02,882
-Ask Harry.
-I will.

950
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,884
-He won't like it.
-Why not?

951
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:08,763
-He doesn't like people butting in.
-I'm not '' people.''

952
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,724
Listen to me. Be smart.

953
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:13,977
How can I be smart if nobody
telIs me anything?

954
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,687
I'll tell you something.

955
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:19,107
-Sign this. Don't start with him.
-Tomorrow.

956
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:20,400
Why tomorrow?

957
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,570
-I wanna look it over.
-It's all right.

958
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:26,448
Must be fishy or you'd tell me.

959
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,491
Take my word for it.

960
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:31,327
No.

961
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:35,790
I know you feel bad.
You don't like doing his dirty work.

962
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,586
-You know you're better than him.
-That's enough!

963
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:43,965
But I'm not so sure.
Maybe you're worse.

964
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:48,154
-lnteresting?
-Not very.

965
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:51,741
You're used to reading
more high-toned stuff.

966
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:53,993
Yes, I am.

967
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:56,705
-What's the matter, kid?
-Nothing.

968
01:14:56,913 --> 01:15:00,041
-All of a sudden--
-I don't like that Jim.

969
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,211
Why? What'd he do to you?

970
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:07,298
He didn't do anything to me.
It's what he's done to himself.

971
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:08,800
Done what?

972
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:14,014
Paul said he could have been Assistant
Attorney General of the United States.

973
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:17,017
-Who?
-Jim.

974
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:22,397
-So what's wrong with that?
-So nothing's wrong. Look at him now.

975
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:26,151
Hangs around. Helps you promote.

976
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:30,697
Lets you walk all over him
just because you pay him.

977
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:34,409
So we finally get around to me.

978
01:15:35,785 --> 01:15:41,583
I'm not sure I like you, either.
You're selfish, that's your trouble.

979
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:45,295
-Since when is all this?
-Since now.

980
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:51,176
I used to think you were a big man.
I'm beginning to see you're not.

981
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:55,638
Through history there's been bigger
men than you. Now too.

982
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,223
-Who?
-Thousands.

983
01:15:57,432 --> 01:15:59,267
Name one.

984
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,353
My father.

985
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:04,481
Twenty-five a week.

986
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:08,693
Don't get nervous just because
you read a book.

987
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:11,404
-You're as dumb as ever.
-Think so?

988
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:16,034
Yeah, but I don't mind. You know why?
Because you're the greatest--

989
01:16:16,242 --> 01:16:18,328
-Leave me alone!
-Come here!

990
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:22,082
-I feel like I wanna go away someplace!
-Where?

991
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,918
-We'll go to Florida.
-I mean alone.

992
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:27,796
-You've gone nuts! Calm down!
-I can't!

993
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:29,673
-Why not?
-I don't know!

994
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:32,884
I hate my life.
There's a better kind.

995
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:38,306
lf you'd read some books you'd know.
Maybe you're right. I'm still dumb.

996
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:43,311
But I know there's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

997
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:45,563
Or you!

998
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:49,567
You'd rather be with
that saxophone player?

999
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:52,612
-At least he was honest!
-He was a chump.

1000
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:56,157
-He worked for a living.
-I worked since I was 1 2.

1001
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:59,994
-Nobody give me nothing.
-Robbing a house is work too.

1002
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:02,455
In my whole life--!

1003
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:10,213
I never robbed a house in my life!

1004
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:13,758
-What are you talking about?
-You can't understand.

1005
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:16,469
Get off that high horse,
you dumb pot!

1006
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:17,929
You...

1007
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:19,764
...menace!

1008
01:17:21,599 --> 01:17:24,811
You never had a decent meal
until you met me!

1009
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,356
But I had to eat with you!
You got no manners.

1010
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:32,652
Taking your shoes off all the time
and picking your teeth.

1011
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,405
You're just not couth!

1012
01:17:42,328 --> 01:17:44,789
I'm as couth as you are!

1013
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,503
-And that cheap perfume you put on.
-Cheap?

1014
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:54,341
I don't own nothing cheap except you.

1015
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:58,970
You don't own me. Nobody can
own anybody. The law says.

1016
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:02,766
-lf I was scared, I wouldn't be here.
-Where are you?

1017
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:06,269
You don't like it here, beat it!

1018
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:11,524
-Wait a minute! First this.
-Not now.

1019
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:12,984
-Right now!
-No!

1020
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:16,696
I won't sign anything
till I know what it is.

1021
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:19,407
Do what I'm telling you!

1022
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,370
Harry, please don't!

1023
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,503
There.

1024
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,186
All right, now go on. Blow.

1025
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:53,400
I don't want you bawling here.
You don't appreciate nothing.

1026
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:59,239
Go sit on a park bench until you learn
how to behave. Go on, beat it!

1027
01:19:02,575 --> 01:19:04,661
This way out.

1028
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:06,913
I gotta put something on.

1029
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:10,917
Hurry up. I don't want you around.
You bother me!

1030
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:17,799
Big fascist!

1031
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,824
All set?

1032
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:46,828
You think I'm gonna
let a broad talk back?

1033
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:51,416
-Where is she?
-She's leaving. I can't stand a crier.

1034
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:54,711
-What's she crying about?
-How do I know?

1035
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:57,756
Becoming a strange girl.

1036
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:01,634
She's all right. It's these books.
They got her nervous.

1037
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,304
Educating her was a mistake.

1038
01:20:04,512 --> 01:20:09,517
I didn't know it would be like this.
I'll fire that Verrall skunk.

1039
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:10,727
Why blame him?

1040
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:16,858
He taught her too much. You know
what she called me? A ''fatch-ist'' !

1041
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:21,821
That don't make sense. I was born
in New Jersey. She knows that.

1042
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,409
What's the matter, Harry?

1043
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,874
I love that broad.

1044
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:39,547
You think we could find somebody
to make her dumb again?

1045
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:51,434
Don't be late if you don't
want no bloody nose.

1046
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,649
-Would you do me a favour, Harry?
-What?

1047
01:20:57,857 --> 01:21:00,402
Drop dead.

1048
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:58,376
<i>I have swOrn upOn the altar Of GOd...</i>

1049
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:01,421
<i>... eternal hOstility...</i>

1050
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,258
<i>...against every fOrm Of tyranny...</i>

1051
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:09,179
<i>... Over the mind Of man.</i>

1052
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:27,405
Oh, hello. Chestnut-7 1 80.

1053
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:31,534
I'd like to speak to
Thomas Jefferson, please.

1054
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:35,288
Oh, no. I mean Thomas Verrall.

1055
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:39,626
No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.

1056
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:42,379
Well, it's very important.

1057
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:46,132
Well, I'll hold on.

1058
01:22:57,185 --> 01:22:59,104
-Jim!
-Yes?

1059
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:01,106
-What time is it?
-1 1 :30.

1060
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:04,192
-I'll slug her when she gets back.
-lf.

1061
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:09,280
-She always winds up where I want her.
-I hope so.

1062
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,465
Jim!

1063
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,426
-What time is it?
-1 1 :30.

1064
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:33,138
-You said that before.
-1 1 :31 .

1065
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:38,476
-She's been gone eight hours.
-Maybe she's seeing a double feature.

1066
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:41,604
That don't take eight hours.

1067
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:44,774
-Could've had an accident.
-You'd hear.

1068
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:48,319
Could have got attacked.
Happens all the time.

1069
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:53,283
Not to Billie. Maybe the other
way around. But not to her.

1070
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:08,798
She here?

1071
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,426
What do you mean?
No. Look some more.

1072
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:14,804
-I been all over town.
-Well, go over it again.

1073
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:20,143
-Do what I'm telling you.
-Sure. Just changing my socks.

1074
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:23,772
-Harry.
-What?

1075
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:26,024
Marry her.

1076
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,526
Still harping?

1077
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,571
I'm thinking of your legal safety.
She--

1078
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,698
I know what she owns.

1079
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,201
You've got to do it, Harry.

1080
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:41,456
Broads always hook you in the end.
All this because a dame reads a book.

1081
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:45,168
It's the new world.
Force and reason changing places.

1082
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,879
-What?
-Knowledge is power.

1083
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:51,716
I don't like this. You stewed,
that broad out of line.

1084
01:24:51,966 --> 01:24:54,803
-And some congressman!
-I think he's cute.

1085
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:56,721
I'd like to trade him in.

1086
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,932
-On what?
-On a senator!

1087
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,684
On a senator?

1088
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:05,689
Take the blinders off and let in
the light. Just for a second.

1089
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:10,902
You can't buy senators and congressmen
as if they wore price tags.

1090
01:25:11,152 --> 01:25:14,823
These guys are honest.
Sincerely trying to do a job.

1091
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:19,160
Sometimes you find
a rotten apple, like Hedges.

1092
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:23,373
But just once in a while.
In a great while.

1093
01:25:56,614 --> 01:26:00,869
Are you sure you're ringing
Mr. Brock's suite, operator?

1094
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:03,747
Well, how about the bedroom?

1095
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:07,125
Ring a few more times.
I wanna make sure.

1096
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:10,462
-He's not in.
-Just one more ring.

1097
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,007
Let's go.

1098
01:26:25,143 --> 01:26:27,854
The stuff's in his briefcase.

1099
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:30,106
In his bedroom.

1100
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:35,987
I probably won't see you again, Paul.

1101
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,198
-I wanna say goodbye.
-What?

1102
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:41,159
-And thanks.
-Where are you going?

1103
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:45,121
-Away from here, that's all I know.
-Where?

1104
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:47,665
You can tell me.

1105
01:26:47,874 --> 01:26:52,212
I don't know. I thought
I might go see my father for a while.

1106
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:55,173
-I've got a better idea.
-What?

1107
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:57,634
Let's get married.

1108
01:26:59,177 --> 01:27:02,013
You must be daffy.

1109
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:05,016
I love you, Billie.

1110
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:09,938
You don't love me.
You just love my brain.

1111
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:11,815
That too.

1112
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:17,821
I'll think it over, but I can
tell you now, the answer's no.

1113
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:26,121
What are you doing?

1114
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:29,666
lf you don't know,
I must be doing it wrong.

1115
01:27:44,222 --> 01:27:46,224
Fine time!

1116
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,523
-Hello, Harry.
-Where you been?

1117
01:27:53,773 --> 01:27:57,610
I took a walk, like you told me.
I met Paul.

1118
01:27:57,819 --> 01:28:00,405
Okay, buster, knock off.

1119
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:04,534
Good night, Paul.

1120
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:08,079
Good night, Billie.
Good night, Harry.

1121
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:13,001
What's the matter, Harry?
You miss me?

1122
01:28:29,392 --> 01:28:32,354
I got something to say
and I don't like to wait.

1123
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:33,480
I know.

1124
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:36,232
-Now I'm not so sure.
-Why not?

1125
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:40,028
Talking fresh, slamming doors.
I knew you'd be back.

1126
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,739
-You did?
-Jim was worried, not me.

1127
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:44,783
Not yet.

1128
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:48,411
-What took you so long?
-I had a lot to think.

1129
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,289
-For instance?
-Where I stand around here.

1130
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:53,416
-I'm trying to tell you.
-What?

1131
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:54,959
Where you stand.

1132
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:58,797
First, Verrall is out.
I don't like to see you upset.

1133
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,257
-Next, we'll get married.
-No.

1134
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:03,718
But you gotta behave--
No?

1135
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:07,555
-What do you mean, '' no''?
-I don't wanna, that's what.

1136
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:12,727
-In fact, I've never been so insulted!
-Who are you to say no?

1137
01:29:12,936 --> 01:29:17,357
Don't knock yourself out.
You got a lot of surprises coming.

1138
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:23,738
-Just tell me.
-What?

1139
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:27,492
-How can you not wanna marry me?
-For one, you're dumb.

1140
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:32,789
I got a different kind of life in mind.
Sorry, you wouldn't fit in.

1141
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:35,667
-I don't understand!
-I do.

1142
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,544
What did I do?

1143
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:42,590
I talked rough to you. Maybe I hit you
a couple of times. Easy.

1144
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,719
Is that any reason
to treat me like this?

1145
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:49,222
I done good too.
Can't we straighten it out?

1146
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:51,099
-No.
-Why not?

1147
01:29:51,349 --> 01:29:57,022
All that stuff I've been studying,
it just mixed me up.

1148
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:59,232
But when you hit me before...

1149
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:04,320
...it was like it all knocked
together in my head and made sense.

1150
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:06,364
I realized what it means.

1151
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:11,786
How some people are always giving it,
and some taking. And it's not fair.

1152
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:16,332
So I'm not gonna let you anymore.
Or anybody else.

1153
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:21,963
Listen, kid. I got an idea.
You wanna come to Florida?

1154
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:27,844
We used to have some good times
together. Remember?

1155
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:31,181
I think you should
marry me. Don't you?

1156
01:30:31,389 --> 01:30:35,977
I want you to marry me.
Do what I tell you or you'll be sorry.

1157
01:30:36,227 --> 01:30:41,358
-I'm not scared of you anymore, Harry.
-You're not, huh?

1158
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,155
-And something else. I'm leaving.
-What?

1159
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:48,865
For good.

1160
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,618
You just can't walk out.

1161
01:30:51,868 --> 01:30:56,164
You're in too deep. I was wrong
hooking you in, but you're in.

1162
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:59,459
-I'm not gonna be.
-You wanna wash it up?

1163
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:03,505
Fine! I'm too important
to monkey around with you.

1164
01:31:03,713 --> 01:31:06,591
Jim! Jim, wake up!

1165
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:10,595
What is it?

1166
01:31:10,845 --> 01:31:15,809
-Come on, you've got some work to do.
-All right. Be right with you.

1167
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:18,478
Okay. Well, get a move on!

1168
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:23,900
I'll fix it so you're out.
You're spoiled. I spoiled you.

1169
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:28,947
I was gonna make you be a real partner.
You don't want it? Fine!

1170
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:33,576
And you don't look like you used to.
I'll be glad to be rid of you.

1171
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:36,246
And as far as I'm concerned....

1172
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:39,749
Vice versa.

1173
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,545
You're back.

1174
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:45,213
-All set?
-Shut up!

1175
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:48,508
Settle things up
and get her out of here.

1176
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:51,261
-Are you sure?
-First time I am.

1177
01:31:51,469 --> 01:31:54,639
-Where's that stuff?
-In your bedroom.

1178
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:57,308
-No!
-What do you mean, '' no''?

1179
01:31:57,559 --> 01:32:01,646
I mean, let's take the shortcut.
The sooner, the better.

1180
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:10,822
They're in the bottom drawer.

1181
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:21,875
-Blue covers?
-Yeah.

1182
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:26,254
-Three copies?
-That's right.

1183
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:29,632
Paul took them.

1184
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,885
-When?
-Just now.

1185
01:32:32,093 --> 01:32:33,136
What for?

1186
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:36,890
Why do you think?
To put in the newspapers.

1187
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:39,809
-Some jokes I don't like.
-It's no joke.

1188
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:42,395
Paul says it's
the biggest swindle...

1189
01:32:42,645 --> 01:32:45,774
...since ''the teapot.''
Something like that.

1190
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:48,943
Why are you getting so white?

1191
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:52,364
You told me it was perfectly
all right.

1192
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:55,408
-You double-crossing--
-It's not like that.

1193
01:32:55,617 --> 01:33:00,163
lf there's a fire and I call
the engines, who am I double-crossing?

1194
01:33:00,372 --> 01:33:02,374
The fire?

1195
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:09,464
lf this breaks,
nobody will play with us.

1196
01:33:09,714 --> 01:33:13,385
-What's to do?
-Might be best to call it off.

1197
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:15,929
-What?
-Let him publish--

1198
01:33:16,179 --> 01:33:19,516
I've spent a lot of dough.
Just let that ride?

1199
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,935
-Play it safe.
-I want my deal.

1200
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:25,647
-Gonna be tough to get.
-Because of some weasel?

1201
01:33:25,855 --> 01:33:27,148
-Harry--
-You're chicken!

1202
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:28,441
-Think so?
-Yes.

1203
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:32,612
-I've been right and you've been wrong.
-Shut up!

1204
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:34,698
I'll handle this.

1205
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:36,783
All right.

1206
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:45,458
-Looking for someone?
-Billie.

1207
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,627
Come on in.

1208
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:55,969
-Billie!
-Gee, I'm tired. I was down--

1209
01:33:56,511 --> 01:33:59,931
-I think you got something of mine.
-That so?

1210
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:12,027
How about it?

1211
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,117
Sit down.

1212
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:26,958
-Hello.
-How you been?

1213
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,501
-Fine, you?
-Fine.

1214
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:32,714
-Go to his place and get the stuff.
-It's not there.

1215
01:34:32,922 --> 01:34:34,549
Where then?

1216
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:38,887
You wanna play rough?
I can do that too.

1217
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:45,727
I mean business.
I got too much at stake.

1218
01:34:45,935 --> 01:34:49,147
You wanna get out alive,
you better give it back.

1219
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:52,859
-I'm no blowhard. Tell him.
-He's no blowhard.

1220
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:56,571
He's had people killed before.
About six years ago--

1221
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,741
You ain't gonna tell
nobody nothing soon.

1222
01:35:00,283 --> 01:35:04,079
-Double negative! Right?
-Right.

1223
01:35:05,914 --> 01:35:09,793
You're gonna be in trouble
unless you do what I say.

1224
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,338
Wait. There's another way
to handle this.

1225
01:35:13,546 --> 01:35:17,008
You've pulled a boner, friend.
My advice is lay off.

1226
01:35:17,217 --> 01:35:19,803
Stop sticking your noses
in my business.

1227
01:35:20,011 --> 01:35:22,722
You're the biggest buttinsky
I ever met.

1228
01:35:22,972 --> 01:35:27,477
That's my job. Your papers are
in the mail, addressed to myself.

1229
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:30,438
-Your job? Getting in my way?
-Not exactly.

1230
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:32,732
What, then? I'd like to know.

1231
01:35:32,941 --> 01:35:36,444
To find out what goes on
and get it to the people.

1232
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:38,113
-What people?
-''The'' people.

1233
01:35:38,321 --> 01:35:40,740
-Never heard of them.
-You will.

1234
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:43,535
They're more well-known
all the time.

1235
01:35:43,743 --> 01:35:48,998
-And if we're operating within the law?
-Then the law needs revision.

1236
01:35:49,207 --> 01:35:51,209
-Are you the government?
-Yes.

1237
01:35:51,459 --> 01:35:54,421
-Since when?
-Since 1 7 7 9. Right?

1238
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:56,089
Right.

1239
01:35:56,715 --> 01:35:58,967
What do you think you've got?

1240
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:02,345
Harry's connection
to Hedge's amendment.

1241
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:04,889
-Why single us out?
-Yeah, why?

1242
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:07,976
What we're doing is done every day.

1243
01:36:08,184 --> 01:36:13,398
Murders could go undiscovered
every day. What does that prove?

1244
01:36:13,648 --> 01:36:19,070
Undercover pressure, bribery,
corruption, government between friends!

1245
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:23,366
It's tough to crack.
Ask me, I've tried for years.

1246
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:27,370
You need more than knowing.
You gotta have facts.

1247
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:31,708
-And most important, the names.
-He's got them.

1248
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:36,755
All right. Let's get down to it.
What will you take, Paul?

1249
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:38,631
I'll take a drink.

1250
01:36:38,882 --> 01:36:41,593
I ain't met a guy
didn't have his price.

1251
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:43,720
-I have.
-I mean big numbers!

1252
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:48,350
You'll be wearing
a big number across your chest!

1253
01:36:48,558 --> 01:36:50,727
I'll get to you later.

1254
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:55,648
There's two ways to do this. One,
play ball. Two, watch your step...

1255
01:36:55,857 --> 01:37:00,945
...because there's no place you can
live if you monkey-wrench me.

1256
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:03,031
What do you say?

1257
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:09,913
-I'd like to think it over.
-All right. You got two minutes.

1258
01:37:33,895 --> 01:37:35,772
Come on, Billie.

1259
01:37:37,482 --> 01:37:39,109
Wait a minute, Harry!

1260
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,777
Cut it out, Harry!

1261
01:37:40,985 --> 01:37:44,322
-Operator!
-Behave yourself.

1262
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:51,830
You stupid fool.
What do you think you are?

1263
01:37:52,038 --> 01:37:55,959
This muscle stuff is a thing
of the past. Cut it out!

1264
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:57,627
I got mad.

1265
01:37:58,211 --> 01:37:59,754
Who are you to get mad?

1266
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:03,717
-Be grateful you're free!
-You don't know me to talk like that!

1267
01:38:03,925 --> 01:38:07,679
I know you. A kick in the keister
and your problems are solved.

1268
01:38:07,929 --> 01:38:11,433
Bigger problems, bigger kicks.
Who's next? The nation?

1269
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:15,770
Don't blow your top.
I'm still ready to do business.

1270
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:18,523
How's 1 00 grand?

1271
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:21,860
A hundred grand is beautiful,
but I can't take it.

1272
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,486
Why not?

1273
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:28,950
-My girl wouldn't like it, would she?
-No, she wouldn't.

1274
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:30,869
Then what's your idea?

1275
01:38:31,202 --> 01:38:36,291
No idea. Legislation's
not meant for buying and selling.

1276
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:39,586
''This country belongs
to the people who inhibit it'' !

1277
01:38:39,919 --> 01:38:41,254
-lnhabit.
-lnhabit it!

1278
01:38:41,463 --> 01:38:43,340
-I'll do what I want.
-Try it.

1279
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,799
-Who'll stop me?
-Us two.

1280
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:46,885
Youse two? It'll be some day...

1281
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:51,014
...when a hundred-a-week hick
and a dumb broad can stop me.

1282
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:56,186
And you, standing around like
you're deaf! Say something!

1283
01:38:56,394 --> 01:38:58,563
-All right, I'll say something.
-Well?

1284
01:38:58,813 --> 01:39:00,023
They're right.

1285
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:03,902
Whose side are you on?
What do you want?

1286
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:05,862
-Rye ginger ale.
-Who asked you?

1287
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,990
Tell that congressman he's
alI washed up. I guarantee.

1288
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,701
You won't
get away with it either.

1289
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:15,830
-Don't worry about me.
-But I do. I worry like the devil.

1290
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:20,418
When you live in Washington
it's enough to break your heart.

1291
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:23,963
You see a piece of machinery,
the democratic structure...

1292
01:39:24,172 --> 01:39:27,258
...and somebody's always
tampering with it.

1293
01:39:27,467 --> 01:39:31,471
Steal from the government and
you steal from yourself, you dumb ox!

1294
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,139
I'm going right ahead.

1295
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:35,892
-I'll tell you where you're going.
-You?

1296
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:40,897
In this whole thing, I guess you
forgot about how I'm a partner.

1297
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:45,068
Jim once told me.
1 26 different yards I own.

1298
01:39:45,318 --> 01:39:46,486
Control.

1299
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:49,864
Same thing. Here's how it is.
I don't want them.

1300
01:39:50,115 --> 01:39:53,201
I don't want what's yours,
so I'm signing them back.

1301
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:56,329
-All right.
-Only not all at once. One at a time.

1302
01:39:56,579 --> 01:39:58,164
One a year.

1303
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:01,251
Only you gotta behave!

1304
01:40:01,459 --> 01:40:04,212
lf you don't,
I could let go on everything.

1305
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:07,173
For what you've done,
even since I've known you...

1306
01:40:07,424 --> 01:40:11,302
...I bet you could be put in jail
for about 900 years.

1307
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,848
You'd be a pretty old man
when you got out.

1308
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:17,600
What's going on around here?

1309
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:18,977
A revolution.

1310
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:21,938
Come on, Paul.
I'll send for my things.

1311
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:25,900
You little crumb. You'll be
sorry for this. Wait and see.

1312
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:27,986
Go ahead.
You don't stand a chance.

1313
01:40:28,194 --> 01:40:30,238
You'll outsmart yourself.

1314
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,990
-Goodbye, all.
-And you!

1315
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:33,241
-Me?
-Yeah!

1316
01:40:33,491 --> 01:40:37,370
-You're fired.
-Sorry. I enjoyed working for you.

1317
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:41,708
-Open up.
-All right, Harry?

1318
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:44,502
Do what I'm telling you!

1319
01:40:56,723 --> 01:40:58,641
How do you like that?

1320
01:40:59,225 --> 01:41:02,187
He could've had 1 00 grand.
She could've had me.

1321
01:41:02,395 --> 01:41:04,314
Both wind up with nothing.

1322
01:41:04,564 --> 01:41:06,566
Dumb chump!

1323
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:08,193
Crazy broad.

1324
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:11,738
To all the dumb chumps
and all the crazy broads...

1325
01:41:11,946 --> 01:41:13,907
...past, present and future...

1326
01:41:14,115 --> 01:41:17,243
...who thirst for knowledge
and search for truth...

1327
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:21,748
...who fight for justice
and civilize each other...

1328
01:41:21,956 --> 01:41:25,752
...and make it so tough
for crooks like you.

1329
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,420
And me.

1330
01:41:37,013 --> 01:41:38,723
License, please.

1331
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,979
-No, not this license.
-Sorry.

1332
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,815
Forget it.
My wedding present.

1333
01:41:47,023 --> 01:41:50,110
-Take it easy, or you'll never make it.
-We'll make it.

1334
01:41:50,318 --> 01:41:53,113
It's a clear case
of predestination.

1335
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:54,489
'' Pre'' what?

1336
01:41:54,698 --> 01:41:56,199
Look it up.

1337
01:41:57,242 --> 01:42:02,455
