1
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,476
Evening, handsome.

2
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,520
- Hey, Lucille. How you doing?
- Okay.

3
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,733
- Evening, Hank.
- Hey, Betty. How's your mama now?

4
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,026
She's good.

5
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,869
Here you go.

6
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,507
So, how you been?

7
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,552
- Pretty good. You?
- Pretty good.

8
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,056
How's Sonny?

9
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,518
He's all right, I guess.

10
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,157
- Vera, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

11
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,242
I'm good.

12
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,119
Here.

13
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,454
Sorry.

14
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,458
- You want a drink?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, hon.

15
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,836
Wild Turkey.

16
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,931
- Now, I'm sore, so go easy, darling.
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,142
Bye.

18
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,728
- Thanks, Vera.
- You're welcome.

19
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,396
Yeah.

20
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,002
What's the matter, hon? You look so sad.

21
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,255
I'm fine. Hey...

22
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,302
You wanna get something to eat?

23
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,309
- Talk?
- You take care, Sonny.

24
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,797
Morning, Pop.

25
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,219
This shit's cold. I'm gonna get some more.

26
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,386
What the hell
those niggers doing out there?

27
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,349
I said something to you. Did you hear me?

28
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,561
Yeah.

29
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,396
Damn porch monkeys.

30
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,065
Be moving in here soon.

31
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,152
Sitting next to me.

32
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,905
Watching my TV.

33
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,993
There was a time
when they knew their place.

34
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,955
Wasn't none of this mixing going on.

35
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,174
Your mother, she hated them niggers, too.

36
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,855
Tell them to get the hell off my property.

37
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,776
- You put that thing down.
- We came by to see Sonny.

38
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,903
I don't give a damn
who you come by to see.

39
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,780
Get them out of here right now.

40
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,283
Tell them. They're your buddies.
Tell them to get out of here.

41
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,994
Well, what are you standing there for?

42
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,925
You watch your ass, all right?

43
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,437
We'll include a 11/2-pound bread machine
at no extra cost to you...

44
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,690
- You got everything you need?
- Yep.

45
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,567
...only while supplies last, so stay tuned.

46
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,569
Now, let's join...

47
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,364
- Be careful walking around.
- Yeah, yeah.

48
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,367
...as he teaches us
the secrets of losing weight,

49
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,704
being young and fighting
disease with fresh juices.

50
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,383
You see these two boys here?

51
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,885
They're my sons.

52
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,805
They were on my property.

53
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,890
Ain't no need to be scaring no little boys.

54
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,767
They ain't coming to hurt you.

55
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,646
Ain't no need to be letting off no shotgun
to tell them to leave, either.

56
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,023
You understand?

57
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,151
Well, then keep them off my property.

58
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,612
They're friends of your son, okay?

59
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,697
He invited them here.

60
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,616
They ain't trespassing,
they ain't hurting nobody.

61
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,662
Next time you wanna play cowboy,
I'm over here all the time.

62
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,208
- Well, you keep them off my property.
- I think you heard me, sir.

63
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,086
Yeah, well, I think you heard me, too.
All right?

64
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,214
Come on, boys. Let's go.

65
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,067
Shit.

66
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,864
- You all right, Dappa?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

67
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,908
- You sure?
- Yeah. It was loose.

68
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,992
Yeah?

69
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,455
Do you see what you did, Sonny?

70
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,375
Yeah, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

71
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,294
- Yeah, it was.
- It won't happen next time.

72
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,048
Let's just keep going
till we get it right, huh?

73
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,851
That's none of your goddamn business.

74
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,897
No, I'm surprised
you talking like that to me,

75
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,232
you being a woman and all.

76
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,067
I'm a liberated woman.

77
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,735
Better watch out, Georgia Ann.

78
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,904
Tommy's gonna sue you
for sexual harassment.

79
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,489
Oh, that's all right.

80
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,745
Booter, how you doing?

81
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,792
- Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.
- I got it, Booter.

82
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,090
- You keep the rest of it.
- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.

83
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,512
Just like I said, no more mistakes, all right?

84
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,058
I wanna make damn sure
nobody makes any mistakes,

85
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,435
especially you.

86
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,192
So when it gets time for us to do it,
you know, you can't mess up.

87
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,699
That goes for me, too, and the rest of them.

88
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,371
You ain't no different than us.
You can't screw it up.

89
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,294
- That's Hank's boy.
- You think it's in the genes?

90
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,962
Yeah, but he is a boy.

91
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,257
He will be a man tomorrow.

92
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,219
In England, they go as far
as to give the guy a party the night before.

93
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,222
They call it the Monster's Ball.

94
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,813
They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,
or anything like that around,

95
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,732
so it's just you and me.

96
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,488
Like I said,
we can't think about what he did

97
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,283
or anything else about him.
It's a job. We have to do our job right.

98
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,966
I've been drawing a lot. What about you?

99
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,134
Yeah.

100
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,641
Look here. We ain't got a lot of time.

101
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,397
I'm gonna give you all my drawings
and all my clothes.

102
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,319
When you get older, they may fit you,
and you may want to wear them.

103
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,574
- I'm not gonna see you again after this?
- No.

104
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,993
Why?

105
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,289
'Cause I'm a bad man.

106
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,665
Who says?

107
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,667
I do.

108
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,047
- But I want you to know something.
- What?

109
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,634
You ain't me.

110
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,388
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

111
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,392
You're everything that's good about me.

112
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,104
You're the best of what I am,
that's what you are.

113
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,400
This man you see sitting here today,
you ain't.

114
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,034
Hey, baby. You look nice today.

115
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,578
You always look nice.

116
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,167
Tyrell, tell your daddy
what you won at school.

117
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,627
Oh, yeah, right.

118
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,380
My drawing is gonna be used
on the school magazine cover.

119
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,674
- You know what I did?
- What'd you do?

120
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,886
Go on. Just tell him.
Don't be playing no guessing game.

121
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,391
I made a picture of you,
sitting alone, in jail.

122
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,773
Theme was solitude.

123
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,028
Way to go, Ty. Way to go. Put it there, boy.

124
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,448
Not too bad.

125
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,543
What's going on with the car?

126
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,089
It's leaking radiator fluid.

127
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,551
You need to take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.

128
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,971
That car get too hot,
you gonna be in trouble.

129
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,063
The house?

130
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,857
I'm losing it.

131
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,277
I can't afford to make the payments
no more.

132
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,364
Not no more.

133
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm sorry, baby.

134
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,543
Ty, let me and your mama talk for a second.

135
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,877
Okay.

136
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,721
Come on now.

137
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,810
Only reason I'm here
so you could say goodbye to your son.

138
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,521
Okay.

139
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,275
I been coming here
for damn near 11 years, Lawrence,

140
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,278
and I'm tired.

141
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,281
I'm tired of coming here.

142
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,577
- Time.
- Come on, so soon?

143
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,294
Well, I gotta get going, baby.

144
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,392
It's time for me to go, Ty.

145
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,687
I'm gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?

146
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,816
Come on now.
Come on, Ty, you gotta let go. Come on.

147
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,651
Come on, Tyrell.

148
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,534
For every time I hurt you, I'm sorry.

149
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,036
Come on.

150
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,706
Ma'am, let's go.

151
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,875
Let's go.

152
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,045
Ma'am, let's go.

153
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,341
I know my way out of here. Come on, Tyrell.

154
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,731
Well, he don't have
any outstanding appeals,

155
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,984
so, looks like
we're definitely going to do it tonight.

156
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,279
Everybody okay?

157
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,657
- You all right, Georgia Ann?
- I'm okay.

158
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,205
- Dappa, is that hood ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's fixed and ready to go.

159
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,414
All right.

160
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,292
Anybody got anything to say?

161
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,839
- Tommy.
- He likes to draw. It calms him down.

162
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,759
Draw. Okay.

163
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,513
Phil, will you make sure he's got
whatever it is he needs to draw with?

164
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,639
Yes, sir.

165
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,727
All right.
Tommy, why don't you lead us in a prayer?

166
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,271
Okay.

167
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,944
Open cell 13!

168
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm here for your stuff, man.

169
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,912
"Now know I that the Lord
saveth his anointed.

170
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:12,252
"He will hear him in his holy heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand."

171
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,676
- Be careful with this.
- Don't worry about it, man.

172
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,678
Close 13!

173
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,391
Worry's all I got.

174
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,644
"...trust in chariots, some in horses,

175
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,106
"but we will remember
the name of the Lord our God.

176
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,028
"They are brought down and fallen,
but we are risen and stand upright.

177
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,364
"Save, Lord, let the king
hear us when we call."

178
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,244
Sky surfing is when you skydive
with a board attached to your feet

179
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,079
and try to do different maneuvers.

180
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,665
A camera flyer flies with a camera

181
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,460
on top of their helmet,
filming the sky surfer,

182
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,546
and flies interactively with the sky surfer,
capturing the moves.

183
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,382
My camera flyer
is my husband Craig O'Brien.

184
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,514
Now, I'm gonna put
these on nice and loose.

185
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,100
Everything gonna be okay, right?

186
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,352
Yes, sir.

187
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,194
What about my last phone call?

188
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,447
Warden says it's a bad idea.

189
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,117
Turn around.

190
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,542
Think maybe he could call my son
and tell him that I tried?

191
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,212
I don't think so.

192
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,422
Okay.

193
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,802
Open 13!

194
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,609
Our free fall is usually around 60 seconds,

195
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:04,072
and the normal altitude that
we jump from is 12,500 feet.

196
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,199
Let's go.

197
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,372
Close 13!

198
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,676
...starting to feel a little cramped
by your present surroundings?

199
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,929
Maybe it's time to expand your horizons.

200
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,473
Maybe it's time to think about Re/Max.

201
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,601
Re/Max and associates lead
the real estate industry...

202
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,229
I'm gonna be right back. Stay right there.

203
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,442
Re/Max can help you find a new home
that meets all your needs.

204
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,571
While selling your current house to
someone who'll find it absolutely perfect...

205
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,073
If you're looking for results,
look for Re/Max.

206
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,200
Nobody sells more real estate.

207
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:18,146
Where's my paper and pencil?
It's my right to have my paper and pencil.

208
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,315
I know it.

209
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,525
Your paper and pencil's on the way.

210
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,444
I promise you this.

211
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,380
Hey.

212
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,362
Thank you.

213
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,366
You're welcome.

214
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,262
Here you go, Lawrence.

215
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,101
Is that done?

216
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,648
Let's see.

217
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,447
Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.

218
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,825
I don't look this good in person.

219
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,621
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

220
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,333
You're welcome.

221
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,966
You all right, Lawrence?

222
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:53,885
Sonny.

223
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,722
- Just you breathe.
- Sonny.

224
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,061
Sonny, sit down.

225
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,563
Sonny, I said sit down.

226
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,815
Sit down.

227
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,110
Come on.

228
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,410
Come on, Lawrence.
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

229
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,872
Let's go. It's all right.
It's all right. Just let go. Let go.

230
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,002
Let go. It's all right.
Let go. Come on. Come on.

231
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,144
I've always believed that a portrait

232
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,480
captures a person

233
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,066
far better than a photograph.

234
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,367
It truly takes a human being
to really see a human being.

235
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,595
Wait a minute.

236
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,431
Come here.

237
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,569
What the hell is this, Tyrell?

238
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,197
What'd I tell you about eating this shit?

239
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,325
Didn't I tell you don't be eating that shit?

240
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,827
Look at this! Look at all this fat!

241
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,829
This fat, fat ass!

242
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,832
Look at all this nasty fat! Where they at?

243
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,419
Look at all this candy.

244
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,130
You ain't gonna eat all this candy!
You crazy?

245
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,424
Look at this room. It's a mess.

246
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,842
Why is it a mess, Tyrell?

247
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,012
'Cause a fat little piggy lives in this room!

248
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,097
Get your fat ass on this scale.

249
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,601
Get on the scale!
What does it say? What's it say?

250
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,271
- 189.
- 189.

251
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,106
You ain't lost no weight!

252
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,953
Come on. Come on. Come on.

253
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,499
Let's go wait for your daddy to call.

254
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,630
It is ordered and adjudged

255
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,340
that the judgment pronounced and set forth

256
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,885
in this order sentencing
the defendant to death

257
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,263
in the manner and by the authorities
as provided by statute

258
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,599
shall be executed at this time.

259
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,306
Lawrence Musgrove, do you have anything
you'd like to say?

260
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,651
Push the button.

261
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:03,314
Hey. You know what you did?
Do you know what you did?

262
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,360
Are you listening to me?
Do you know what you did?

263
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,655
Do you know what you did?
You fucked him up!

264
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,573
You fucked up that man's last walk!

265
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,576
How would you like it
if somebody fucked up your last walk?

266
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:19,038
You're like a goddamn woman.
You're like your fucking mother!

267
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,792
You shouldn't have done that,
you son of a bitch!

268
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,127
Get up, you fucking pussy! Come here!

269
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,423
You are a piece of fucking shit!
Do you understand me?

270
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,425
Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on.

271
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,593
Get off me!

272
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,306
Get your fucking hands off me,
you fucking nigger!

273
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,516
Hank! Hank!

274
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,396
- Hank, this ain't you.
- This is me, Phil. This is me!

275
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,023
And I'm the man
who could have your goddamn job!

276
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:50,194
Don't you ever let me catch you
touching anybody that outranks you again!

277
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,321
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

278
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,198
- Hank...
- Yes, sir.

279
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,867
- I don't wanna hear it out of you.
- I just keep the peace.

280
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,495
- You piece of shit! Piece of shit!
- Hey.

281
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,793
You got... bleeding.

282
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,462
Sonny.

283
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,367
All right. Let's move. Get up.

284
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,911
You get out of
my goddamn house right now.

285
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,998
Hey! You get out!

286
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,417
Come on!

287
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,380
You lousy piece of shit.

288
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,842
Get up.

289
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,846
What you gonna do? Huh?

290
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,514
What you gonna do?

291
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,354
See? How do you like that, huh?

292
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,150
Huh? Come on! Are you a tough guy now?
Are you tough?

293
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,324
Say something.

294
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,327
Say something!

295
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,802
Get up.

296
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,438
You hate me?

297
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,616
Answer me.

298
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,622
You hate me, don't you?

299
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,083
Yeah, I hate you.

300
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,213
I always did.

301
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,259
Well, I always loved you.

302
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,354
Give me them scissors.

303
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,668
Here.

304
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,638
Hold up, wait a minute.

305
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,183
- Where you going?
- I wanna put these up.

306
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,444
- How much?
- That'll be $2.85.

307
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,550
Hey, Billy. Moving as fast as I can, man.

308
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,011
Let me just get this dress on,
and I'm gonna be right out there.

309
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,430
- You don't need to get dressed.
- Damn car's still acting up.

310
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,223
Leticia, listen. It's not just your car.

311
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,516
You've been late every day this week.

312
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,351
Billy, I've been trying to get here.

313
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,687
I need this money.
I'm gonna lose my house.

314
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,190
Look, why don't you go home, relax,
take some time off, you know?

315
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,942
You shouldn't be here right now, anyway.

316
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,195
I know that. That's why
you should've had gave me the week off.

317
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,488
With some pay.

318
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,616
Hell, Leticia, I already got a new girl.

319
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,805
Hank?

320
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,392
Let's just get this over with quick.

321
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,395
Is there a passage
you would like me to read?

322
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
No.

323
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,442
All I want to hear
is that dirt hitting that box.

324
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,325
He was weak.

325
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,500
You can say a little something, though,

326
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,086
if you want to, once we've covered him up.

327
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,002
- How you doing?
- All right.

328
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,755
- You want to see a menu?
- No, that's all right. I know what I want.

329
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,842
Okay, what you gonna have?

330
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:57,389
A bowl of chocolate ice cream
and a cup of coffee.

331
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,435
- Coffee. Black, sugar, cream?
- No, black.

332
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,273
- That's it. Yeah.
- That it?

333
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,664
Hey, Vera, it's Hank.

334
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,042
Is it too late?

335
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:32,257
Okay, chocolate ice cream. Here you go.

336
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:36,136
I'm gonna... I'm gonna need
a plastic spoon for the ice cream.

337
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,513
Oh! Goddamn!

338
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,099
I'm sorry about that.

339
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,978
- It's all right.
- Shit! I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

340
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,607
- Bring me some napkins or something.
- Okay. I'm sorry about that.

341
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,733
It's all right.

342
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,526
- And you said a what?
- Plastic spoon.

343
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:52,986
Okay, I'll get it.

344
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,325
- Where's Lucille?
- I'm trying to fill in for her.

345
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,177
- I'm ready to pay this.
- Yep.

346
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:33,026
- What's the deal there?
- I don't know. I just over-rang this thing.

347
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:37,781
If you can't get that thing open,

348
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,867
just tell me how much it is,
and I'll pay you for it.

349
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,869
$3.92.

350
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,874
There's $4.00. You keep the change.

351
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,003
Thanks.

352
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,881
Hey, cowboy.
Feel like some late-night pussy?

353
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,301
Guess so.

354
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,053
Haven't seen you in a while.

355
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,847
Yeah, well...

356
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,100
I ain't been feeling too good.

357
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,022
Busy, a lot of things.
This and that and the other, you know?

358
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,485
How you been?

359
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,029
- All right.
- Good.

360
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,496
So, how's Sonny?

361
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,590
I can't do this tonight, Vera.

362
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:41,678
- Are you sure, hon?
- No, not tonight. I'm sorry.

363
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,349
No need to be sorry.
Let's just do it some other time.

364
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,851
All right.

365
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,275
- You can keep that money.
- I'm going to.

366
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,489
Adios.

367
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,814
- Have a seat, Hank.
- Thank you, sir.

368
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,525
I appreciate you seeing me.

369
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,278
What brings you here, Hank?

370
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,031
Sir, I'm resigning.

371
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,160
And, I wanted to come by
and tell you personally, you know?

372
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,500
I appreciate that, Hank.

373
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:24,257
Why don't we wait a few weeks
before we submit the paperwork?

374
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,344
That wouldn't do anybody any good
to wait on that, though.

375
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,137
I've got my mind made up.

376
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,599
All right.

377
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,061
We're gonna miss you.

378
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,070
I brought my badge in and...

379
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,574
Why don't you keep it?

380
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,118
I ain't got no use for it.

381
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,148
There you are, Pop.

382
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,992
We got each other, Son.

383
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,663
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,091
I quit the team.

385
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,273
That was a mistake.

386
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,782
I can't do it anymore.

387
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,496
You're reminding me of your mother.

388
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,961
I guess that's bad, right?

389
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,424
Your mother wasn't shit.

390
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,053
That woman failed me.

391
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,811
I got more pussy after she killed herself

392
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,066
than I did when she was living as my wife.

393
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,409
The point is... she quit on me.

394
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,705
You're doing the same.

395
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,961
God damn it!

396
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,841
Let's go. Hand me my purse.

397
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,386
Come on. Get out.

398
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,680
- Mama, what's wrong?
- We got to walk.

399
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,456
Boy, get out that street!

400
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,751
Get yourself killed. Get over here.

401
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,796
Don't do that. Don't do that.

402
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,968
Oh, this?
I'm telling you, this is a jim-dandy.

403
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,469
This is just what I'm looking for.

404
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,595
And at the same time,

405
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,390
it's the most expensive one
I've come across, you know?

406
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,226
But if you're willing to talk on price under...

407
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,562
- We put quite a bit of work in it.
- I bet you did.

408
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,188
We can talk about it.

409
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,691
You know what?
Let me think it over. You got my number.

410
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,526
- Sure, I got yours.
- All right.

411
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,069
- It was a pleasure.
- Sure.

412
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,571
- Nice seeing you.
- I'll be talking to you.

413
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,406
- You, too.
- Okay, see you.

414
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,045
Come on, T. Let's go.

415
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,217
That's what you think your mama look like?

416
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,719
Yeah, sort of.

417
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,554
- See you tomorrow morning?
- Yeah, see you.

418
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,722
You, too, young man.

419
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,056
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

420
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,591
Come on, T! Come on! Get up!

421
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,470
Come on, T! Get up!

422
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,726
Help me! Wait!

423
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,728
Wait!

424
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,607
Come back here!

425
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,859
Help us!

426
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,239
Come help us!

427
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,783
Help us!

428
00:52:56,507 --> 00:53:00,134
T, wake up, baby. Wake up.

429
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,720
He was hit... He was hit by a car.

430
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,013
Calm down. Calm down.

431
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,391
We gotta get him to a hospital right now!

432
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,642
Right now!

433
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,217
Hey, y'all,
we're gonna need a gurney out here.

434
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,845
- There's a kid. I think it's pretty bad.
- Gurney!

435
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,306
We're gonna, we're gonna need some help.

436
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,900
Are you the boy's mother?

437
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,359
Please, follow me.

438
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,488
Is that your boy?

439
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,575
- No.
- No?

440
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,201
What happened to him?

441
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,455
I think he got hit by a car.

442
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,248
That was his mother, went through there.

443
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,834
- She said he was hit by a car.
- Hit and run?

444
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,295
Like I said, I don't know. I picked them up...

445
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,840
Listen, I need to file a police report
if it was a hit and run.

446
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,467
Well, shit, I don't even know the people.

447
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:23,593
I wouldn't know what to write.

448
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,094
I wouldn't know the first thing about it.

449
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,889
Just stay, tell the police what you did,
what you saw.

450
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,849
It'll take you 5 minutes. I promise.

451
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,829
Wait! Wait! Wait!

452
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,465
That's my baby!

453
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,844
That's my baby!

454
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,015
I know you're not supposed
to move people and everything,

455
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,601
but, shit, I didn't know what else to do.

456
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:18,815
I mean, the boy was laying there,
and the woman was hysterical.

457
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,150
I just did the best I could do.

458
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,902
I just thought I'd better lug him in the car

459
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,655
and get on to here as quick as I could,
so that's what I did.

460
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,241
All right. Well, you did a good job.

461
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:33,162
- So you were just passing by?
- Yeah, I was just passing by.

462
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,123
I don't know that lady at all.

463
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,002
I'm gonna give you my card.

464
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,295
We're gonna do a follow-up...

465
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,089
If we get anything, okay?

466
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,508
And we might call you as well
if we need to.

467
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,218
- That's all right.
- That'd be all right?

468
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,054
- Whatever you need me to do.
- I got your number right there.

469
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,264
All right.

470
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,227
Is that it? Can I go?

471
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,106
Yeah. Thanks.

472
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,030
That boy make it all right?

473
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,991
No. He died.

474
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,355
Mrs. Musgrove,
I'm gonna give you my card,

475
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,815
and you feel free to call me

476
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,027
anytime that you can remember
anything about this, okay?

477
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,196
And I am so sorry.

478
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,407
Ma'am, could you get me something
to clean that off?

479
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,619
That's my... That's my bag.

480
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,333
Let me go.

481
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,963
- Here's your purse.
- He gone. My baby.

482
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,173
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:12,678
He gone. He gone.

484
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,517
You gonna take her home, ain't you?

485
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,062
I don't really know her.

486
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,067
- I'll take her home.
- I think that's a good idea.

487
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,693
Yeah, I'll take her.

488
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,122
Could you do me a favor
and throw that away for me?

489
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,748
- Yes, sir.
- I'd appreciate that.

490
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,208
Take care, ma'am.

491
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,017
Now, where do you live, hon?

492
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,815
Ma'am, you're gonna have to tell me
where you live.

493
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,195
Now, I'm gonna go in your purse.
I'm just letting you know.

494
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,991
I'm going in your purse
to try to find an address on you, all right?

495
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,406
You probably ought to call
some of your kin people

496
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,700
or one of your friends or something.

497
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,293
I'm gonna have to go.

498
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,379
You gonna be all right?

499
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:15,009
Police told me to call the coroner's office
in the morning.

500
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:18,721
I'm sorry?

501
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,308
They told me to call the coroner's office.

502
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,019
Said they gonna do an autopsy.

503
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,649
I don't know
why they gonna do an autopsy.

504
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,985
He was hit by a car.

505
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,328
Well, I imagine it'll help them find out
who did it.

506
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,998
You really believe they gonna do that?

507
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,627
I believe they'll try their best, I do.

508
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:54,840
He's a black kid.
You think they gonna do that?

509
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,603
Here's your bag.
I'm just gonna leave it on the floor here.

510
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,362
I'm real sorry.

511
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,537
Mr. Grotowski?

512
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:10,750
Just wanted to say sorry about Sonny.
We liked him a lot.

513
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,918
We feel bad, sir.

514
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,343
Which one of y'all is Willie,
and which one of you's Harry?

515
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,679
This is Willie. That's Darryl.

516
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,601
I'll see you. I appreciate that.

517
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:47,453
I'm going over to the cafe.
Do you want me to give you a ride?

518
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,457
Sure you don't mind?

519
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,001
I'm going that way, anyway.

520
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,559
Is this music all right with you?

521
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,064
- 'Cause I can change it.
- No, it's cool.

522
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,443
You ain't got a car?

523
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:21,821
It's broke.

524
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,907
I'm saving to get me another one.

525
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,171
$8.64. Thank you.

526
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,340
Thank you.

527
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,468
You have a good shift, okay?

528
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,429
Thanks.

529
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,308
Thank you.

530
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:23,883
Hey, Pop.

531
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,636
- Lookie here.
- What are those for?

532
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,598
I bought a gas station.

533
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,684
That right?

534
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,649
It's all bought and paid for. We own it.

535
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,113
Don't say "we."

536
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,032
You own it.

537
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:50,993
I didn't buy it.

538
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,246
Yeah, well...

539
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,999
I wouldn't have bought no gas station.

540
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,627
Is that right?

541
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,217
I would've stuck to what I knew best.

542
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,762
- What's that?
- Corrections Officer.

543
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,015
Right.

544
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,937
Well, I ain't a Corrections Officer no more.
I'm a gas station owner.

545
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,566
I already made the deal. It's too late, Pop.

546
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,903
- You want me to fix you something?
- No.

547
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,696
Suit yourself.

548
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,619
Hey.

549
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,974
There you go.

550
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,561
How you doing?

551
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,146
I'm all right.

552
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,065
Tired.

553
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,819
- You gonna eat something?
- Chocolate ice cream.

554
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,238
Plastic spoon.

555
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,908
You got it.

556
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:18,497
Thank you.

557
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,335
Are you set?

558
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,257
About time for you to get off, isn't it?

559
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,761
Did you want me to give you a ride?

560
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,725
No. I...
I wouldn't think to ask you to do that.

561
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,019
It's right on the way home.

562
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,694
- Sure you don't mind?
- No, I'd be happy to.

563
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,155
Okay.

564
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,702
- The one on Prospect Street.
- Clement's?

565
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,747
- Yeah, Clement's.
- You bought Clement's?

566
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:00,831
Yeah.

567
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,835
I know Clement. Can't stand that man.

568
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,463
Well, he ain't gonna be running it. I am.

569
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,964
Well, that's good.

570
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,383
Thanks for the ride.

571
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,386
Can I ask you a question?

572
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,559
Why did you help me?

573
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,229
What do you mean?

574
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,649
When you took me and my baby
to the hospital,

575
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,150
why'd you do that?

576
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,700
I don't know. I guess...

577
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,203
I just...

578
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,416
You know, doing the right thing, I guess.

579
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,426
My son died.

580
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,556
And...

581
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,103
Well, he...

582
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,980
He died, and then...

583
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:12,486
I never was a very good father.

584
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,828
He was a good kid.

585
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,001
I guess that somehow I just...

586
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,090
When I seen
what you're going through there,

587
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,384
it made me think about something,

588
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,053
or it reminded me of something,
I don't know.

589
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,308
You know when you feel
like you can't breathe?

590
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,864
And, you can't get out to...

591
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,660
From inside yourself, you know?

592
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,828
Really.

593
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,589
Do you want to come inside?

594
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,387
I like these curtains.

595
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,518
I got these here curtains on credit.

596
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:31,690
I never heard of anybody getting curtains
on credit before, that I know of.

597
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,779
What you think? They cute. Ain't they cute?

598
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:39,239
I love these curtains.

599
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,409
They're good and red, all right.

600
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,036
I got...

601
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,791
I got these curtains right here on credit,

602
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,376
and the man told me

603
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,380
that I really
wasn't supposed to get this deal.

604
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,049
But I think he kind of liked me,

605
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,093
and he told me I could have these curtains
on credit.

606
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,471
I said, "Hey, what the hell?

607
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,765
"Some red curtains
would be great for my place."

608
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:08,602
So I said, "Hey, I'll take it."
So I got me some red curtains.

609
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,355
Damn straight, huh? Just...

610
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,068
Boy, you sure suck that whiskey down,
don't you?

611
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,237
I mean... Lord have mercy.

612
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,827
My husband used to love him

613
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,120
some Jack Daniels.

614
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,708
Well, like I said, it's...
Yeah, it's a good drink.

615
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:37,923
You wait right here.
I'm gonna show you something.

616
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,216
Okay.

617
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,928
Sit right here.

618
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,689
What you got there, some kind of a,

619
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,191
some kind of an annual,
a school annual or something?

620
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:57,442
No. These...

621
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,736
These pictures right here.

622
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,617
These are my husband's drawings
right here.

623
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,872
Lawrence.

624
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,624
My husband, he drew those.

625
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,633
He got himself electrocuted
over there in Jackson.

626
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,846
He got himself...

627
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:33,353
These right here, these are my son Tyrell's.

628
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,984
He drew these.

629
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,613
- He drew all of these right here.
- Yeah.

630
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,952
Got his talent from the old man, then,
I guess.

631
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,913
Didn't he?

632
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,582
That's the only thing
that Negro ever gave that boy,

633
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,542
was some drawing.

634
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:57,252
Taught him how to draw.

635
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,797
- It runs in families, things like that.
- Yeah.

636
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,674
You know, he's...

637
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:09,514
He was a good kid, you know?
He was a really good kid.

638
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,683
He was so good.

639
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:15,020
He was... He really loved me.

640
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,942
- He really loved me.
- I understand.

641
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,697
He was so fat.

642
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,368
He was so fat, he wouldn't...

643
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,624
I don't care what I brought in this house,
he'd just eat it up.

644
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,793
I don't care what it was I brought in here.

645
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,628
I bring some Popeyes Chicken,

646
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,047
that boy eat the whole thing
before I even get a chance

647
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,340
to get me a bite of the chicken...

648
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:47,386
He'd just eat it up! He would eat his ass off!

649
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:51,056
You ain't never seen nobody eat like...

650
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,979
He would eat candy and gumballs.

651
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,398
He made me take him over up there
to the super Kmart...

652
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,482
Yeah?

653
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,776
...and he put them quarters
in that gumball machine.

654
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,860
Yeah.

655
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:07,447
He had to wait till he get the red gumball.
He had...

656
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,283
He always had to get the red gumball.

657
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,414
He sounds like a character, I guess.

658
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:22,462
He'd get that red gumball,
and he'd just eat on that red gumball.

659
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,433
I was a good mother.

660
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:39,354
I did every single thing I can think to do.

661
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,859
I was really good. I was really good.
I was a good mother.

662
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,028
I was a really good mom.

663
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,364
I didn't want him to be fat like that.

664
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,616
I did not want my baby to be fat like that,

665
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,077
'cause I know, a black man in America,

666
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,621
you can't be like that, and I tried to...

667
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,210
I was just trying to tell him
you can't be like that.

668
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:05,380
You can't be like that in America
and a black man.

669
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:06,715
I was just...

670
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,430
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure what you want me to do.

671
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,808
I want... You know what I want.

672
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,229
I want you to make me feel better.
I want you to make me feel better.

673
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,523
I want you to make me feel better.

674
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:27,319
I want you to make me feel good.
Just make me feel good.

675
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,406
I just want you to make me feel good.

676
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:35,494
Can you make me feel good?
Can you make me feel good?

677
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,954
Can you make me feel good?

678
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,625
Can you make me feel good?

679
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,296
- Feel good! Make me feel good!
- I'll help you feel good.

680
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,590
Just make me feel good.

681
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:53,345
Just make me feel good.
I want... I want to feel good. I want to feel...

682
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,412
Fill me up. Fill me up. Fill me up.

683
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,072
Oh, my God.

684
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,334
Fill me. Fill me.

685
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,295
I felt you.

686
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:19,259
I needed you. I needed you so much.

687
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,556
I needed you so much.

688
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,560
I haven't felt anything in so long.

689
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,859
Thank you. Thank you.

690
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,582
You okay?

691
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:38,713
Me getting sick back there

692
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,925
doesn't have anything
to do with you, all right?

693
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,479
Pop?

694
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,901
Hey, Pop?

695
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,988
I'm in the damn bathroom!

696
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,702
What the hell happened to you?

697
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,372
Twisted my ankle trying to take a bath.

698
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,793
Dadgummit, I told you to be careful.

699
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,382
- Shit.
- Oh, goddamn.

700
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,218
Wiggle your toes.

701
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:33,184
- You feel that? Yeah.
- Yeah?

702
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,857
I'm sinking.

703
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,610
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't worth shit.

704
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,199
- You stop that.
- I can't clean myself.

705
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,619
Can't walk to the kitchen without falling.

706
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,457
Can't get to the phone
before it stops ringing.

707
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,836
I don't feel like a man anymore.

708
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,882
You're a man, Pop.

709
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,595
Can't even remember
what a woman smells like.

710
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,914
- What, baby?
- There's a man.

711
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,166
Where?

712
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,376
All right.

713
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:42,670
Thank you.

714
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,591
How you doing?

715
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,093
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right.

716
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,264
What can I do for you?

717
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:58,144
I got this '89 Comanche out there,

718
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,523
and it needs a lube job
and points and plugs,

719
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:04,901
and I was kind of wondering
if you could work on it for me.

720
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,196
Yeah. Well, when...
When do you need it by?

721
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,573
Just quick as you can, really.

722
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,117
Maggie.

723
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,037
Leave that alone, baby. Put that down.

724
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,832
Yeah.

725
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:23,670
I can get that to you
about tomorrow afternoon,

726
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,255
late tomorrow night.

727
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,132
I'd appreciate it.

728
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,011
Maybe those boys of yours can...

729
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,972
If they're not doing anything,
if they're not busy,

730
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:37,016
you know, they could wash it
and wax it and everything.

731
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,227
- I'm selling it.
- All right.

732
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,523
Yeah, I'll ask them.
You know, tell them about it.

733
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,441
I'm sure they won't mind.

734
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,654
I can't take this.

735
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,577
It was my son's. It'd mean a lot to him.

736
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:56,911
I'm sure he'd want it that way,

737
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,913
want somebody to have it
to get some use out of it.

738
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:01,291
Well, I ain't saying I don't want it.

739
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:04,127
I just can't take it.

740
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:09,048
Well, I want you to have it. I really do.
It'd mean a lot to me.

741
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,265
Let's just take it for a little spin.

742
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:21,728
Come on.

743
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,274
I ain't even got my shoes on.

744
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:29,485
That's all right. We won't go far.
Let's go. Come on.

745
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,282
Let's see how it drives.

746
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:47,587
- What the hell is this?
- Stick shift.

747
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,241
All right, then.

748
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:19,744
Here's the insurance and title,

749
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,663
all that kind of thing,
and all the papers you'll need.

750
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,081
- It's all set.
- Okay.

751
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:26,209
Listen, I'd sure like to see you tonight, so...

752
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:30,171
- Well, we should do it.
- Yeah? Is that all right?

753
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,507
Okay.

754
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,598
- I'll see you later.
- Okay. See you.

755
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,664
Hank?

756
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,751
That's good. Right there.

757
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:14,836
Hello?

758
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,922
Hank!

759
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,134
It's Leticia.

760
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,351
I'm coming on in, Hank.

761
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,401
Hank?

762
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,279
Who are you?

763
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,326
You just walked in my house?

764
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,161
My bad.

765
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,122
I thought...

766
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,833
Hank? You looking for Hank?

767
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,169
Yes. Is he here?

768
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,797
Who are you?

769
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:05,303
My name is Leticia Musgrove, and...

770
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:11,350
Me and Hank is... friends.

771
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,645
Musgrove?

772
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,360
Please, little darling,

773
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,989
have you got a cigarette?

774
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:27,325
Yeah.

775
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,913
But it look to me
like you don't really need to be smoking.

776
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:39,587
Come on. Have you got one?

777
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:57,438
Match?

778
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,870
So, is Hank here?

779
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,041
Yeah, yeah. He'll be back shortly.

780
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,835
I'm Buck, his father.

781
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:23,881
That for Hank?

782
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,385
Yeah. It's a gift.

783
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,598
I'll see he gets it.

784
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,116
Damn.

785
01:28:56,081 --> 01:29:00,084
Hank must've done something right
to deserve a fine hat like this.

786
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,588
Guess he did.

787
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:09,051
In my prime,
I had a thing for nigger juice myself.

788
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,472
Hank just like his daddy.

789
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,601
He ain't a man till he split dark oak.

790
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,749
Hey, Leticia. Hang on. Where you going?

791
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:44,170
Hey, where you going? What happened?

792
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,671
- I met your daddy.
- Listen, listen...

793
01:29:45,756 --> 01:29:48,257
- Just get out and talk to me...
- Get off me. Get your hands off me, Hank.

794
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,384
You at least gotta give me a chance,
whatever he did.

795
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:52,261
It don't matter a whole lot, do it, Hank?

796
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,971
Please, give me a chance to prove to you...

797
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:56,390
- Get off me!
- You're just gonna...

798
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,577
We're family.

799
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:19,663
I'm your father. Remember that.

800
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,086
Hank?

801
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,548
What's your problem?

802
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,639
I believe that's it. There you go.

803
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:37,848
Thank you.

804
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,976
I didn't date that thing there
at the bottom line.

805
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,104
- I didn't know if...
- No problem.

806
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,148
Anything below that line, I didn't do.

807
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:53,030
Now, you will take good care of him,
won't you?

808
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:54,198
Oh, yes.

809
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,201
Because...

810
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,913
Well, I want him to go out in peace.

811
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,041
You must love him very much.

812
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:08,838
No, I don't.

813
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,592
But he's my father, so there it is.

814
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:37,825
They said they were going to get you
a television set tomorrow.

815
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,536
Finally getting rid of me, huh?

816
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,831
They're gonna take care of you.

817
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:46,041
There's a telephone
down at the end of the hall.

818
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,501
You can call me.

819
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:49,003
This is it.

820
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:51,547
I guess so.

821
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,426
I'm stuck.

822
01:31:57,929 --> 01:31:59,138
Me, too.

823
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,560
I don't want to go out like this.

824
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:08,147
Me, neither.

825
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,904
Goodbye, Pop.

826
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:13,837
What?

827
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,302
- Do you want your car back?
- No, I don't want the car back.

828
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,514
I meant for you to keep that.

829
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:24,974
What?

830
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:28,352
I just wanted you to know
that I sent him away.

831
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,565
Well, I ain't got time to talk.

832
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,610
Well, I wish you would talk to me.

833
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,823
Y'all ready to order?

834
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:17,234
- How you doing, Ryrus?
- Hey. How are you?

835
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:19,403
- I'm all right.
- Who Leticia?

836
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,532
My girlfriend.

837
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:29,997
Sheriff's Department.

838
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:31,373
Hello?

839
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:47,973
- Who's knocking on my door?
- It's the Sheriff's Department.

840
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:49,433
Time to go, lady.

841
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,852
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- It's time to go.

842
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,980
- No. Here, here, here.
- No, no. I don't take anything.

843
01:34:55,065 --> 01:34:56,982
You have to settle up with your landlord,
then I go away.

844
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:58,359
I got the money. Here's the money.

845
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,736
Ma'am, I suggest you get fully dressed.

846
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,613
- Just give me a day.
- I'm going to put you out.

847
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,074
- Nah, you ain't putting me out.
- No, no.

848
01:35:05,784 --> 01:35:08,619
I about got the money.
I'm just still saving it...

849
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,063
I painted the ceiling and the wall
and just fixed it up a little bit.

850
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:19,857
I figured that I ought to.

851
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:25,404
I'll move your stuff in,
so you don't have to worry with it.

852
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,031
So...

853
01:36:28,575 --> 01:36:31,452
You know, I'm going to go into the kitchen
and get a thing or two,

854
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,619
so if you just want to...

855
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:36,123
Really, just, you know, relax,
make yourself comfortable,

856
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,250
whatever you want to do with it.

857
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,799
This Tyrell's.

858
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,470
I thought I'd put it up there.
That's my boy's room.

859
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:35,724
- So...
- All right. Here.

860
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,145
You can go up if you want to.

861
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:48,195
Can I look at these?

862
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,072
Yeah. Go ahead.

863
01:37:57,956 --> 01:37:59,581
That's him right there.

864
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:05,212
He don't look like you.

865
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:08,423
He got his mother in him.

866
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:25,566
I don't mind sleeping across the hall there
if you want me to.

867
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,943
I mean,
maybe you should sleep by yourself.

868
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:32,114
No. I wouldn't feel good
if you left me in here all by myself.

869
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:36,368
I just want you to be comfortable in here.

870
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,373
I want you to be comfortable, too.

871
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:09,484
I want to take care of you.

872
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,487
Good.

873
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,491
Because I really need to be taken care of.

874
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,781
Can I touch you?

875
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,079
You sure?

876
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:05,934
Did you feel that?

877
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:09,980
Oh, yeah.

878
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:21,616
It felt good?

879
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:27,998
Yeah.

880
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:35,213
I didn't hurt you or anything?

881
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,342
Not in no bad way.

882
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:57,819
What?

883
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:02,657
Nothing. I just...

884
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:09,080
I'm gonna go out and buy some ice cream.

885
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,337
- Now?
- Yeah.

886
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,549
It just feels right.

887
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,099
- Okay.
- Well...

888
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:34,481
- Can you buy me some?
- Yeah.

889
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,651
What kind you want?

890
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:41,655
Chocolate.

891
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:51,052
Hey.

892
01:45:52,138 --> 01:45:54,264
I bought some chocolate ice cream.

893
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,935
Are you okay?

894
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:03,982
You sure?

895
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:12,532
You look real pretty.

896
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,704
Let's go down to the steps. You want to?

897
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:20,540
Let's go.

898
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:52,715
I went by our station on the way home.

899
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,135
I like the sign.

900
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:14,988
I think we're gonna be all right.
