1
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,129
East Hill bus.

2
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,091
- All right, lady, on or off, please.
- Oh, yes.

3
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,385
That's all. Next bus!
Fares, please.

4
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,220
Beverly Crescent?
Who?

5
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,723
Beverly Crescent.
Get off next stop, take 19.

6
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,600
- Fares, please.
- I'm sorry, conductor.

7
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,562
- Would you mind stopping?
- Leaving us already?

8
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,730
Yes, you see,
it's in the opposite direction.

9
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,818
That's about the only place
we don't go, lady. Fares, please.

10
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,976
Why, Mrs. Miniver.
- You know, I...

11
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,980
Oh, don't tell me it's gone.

12
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,357
Just a minute.

13
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,170
Oh, I was so afraid you'd sold it.

14
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,881
No. We knew you'd come back.

15
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,675
I know it's foolish and extravagant...

16
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,719
...but I've simply got to have it.

17
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,389
Yes, pack it up quickly,
don't give me time to think.

18
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,892
Oh, careful, careful.

19
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,732
Why, vicar. This is nice.

20
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,070
- For me. Let me put those on the rack.
- Thank you.

21
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,950
Oh, no, not this one. I might leave
it behind, and it's rather precious.

22
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,619
- Yes, I know the feeling.
- You do?

23
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,621
Guess what this is.

24
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,706
- Port.
- Worse than that.

25
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,668
- Cigars.
- Well, why not? My husband does.

26
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,836
- He can afford it.
- I'm not so sure.

27
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,006
- He has a very extravagant wife.
- Oh, nonsense.

28
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,677
It's quite true. I can't help it.
I'm afraid I do like nice things.

29
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,639
Things far beyond my means sometimes.
Oh, pretty clothes...

30
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,977
...and good schools for the children,
the car, the garden, you know.

31
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,355
- Yes, I know.
- Does it give you a lovely guilty feeling?

32
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,399
- Lovely.
- Oh, vicar!

33
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,901
Fellow sinners.
What will the village say?

34
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,488
Oh, I think the village knows
you're a very understanding person.

35
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,742
- That's why you do so much good.
- Well, I hope I do.

36
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,619
I hope I can when they need me.

37
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,872
You mean, you think
there is trouble coming?

38
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,042
I think it's here.

39
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,713
- Good evening, Lady Beldon.
- Good evening, vicar.

40
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,506
Good evening.

41
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,219
Oh, shopping's impossible nowadays.
You can't get near the counter...

42
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,390
...and when you do, they haven't got it
and you pay twice as much for it.

43
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,686
What a wonderful description.
- Sit down, Simpson. And don't sniff!

44
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,024
I spent the whole afternoon being
pushed around by middle-class females...

45
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,444
...buying things they can't afford.
- Oh, dear, that means me.

46
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,572
Oh, no, much worse.
You're Mrs. Mannering, aren't you?

47
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,741
- Miniver.
- Oh, yes. The lawyer's wife.

48
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,578
- No, my husband's an architect.
- I knew he was something of that sort.

49
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,039
I don't know what
the country's coming to.

50
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,250
Everyone trying to be better than their betters.
Mink coats and no manners.

51
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,253
No wonder Germany's arming.

52
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,728
- Good evening, your ladyship.
- Good evening, Ballard.

53
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,566
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Mr. Ballard.

54
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,069
Dear, this bag.
Vicar, do go on, please.

55
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,779
- Well, goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

56
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,280
Thank you.

57
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,909
- I was looking for you on the 5:00.
- I missed it by two minutes.

58
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,829
- Isn't that shameful?
- Well, time and tide waits for no man.

59
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,539
And trains neither.

60
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,584
Are you too late, ma'am,
to spare me a moment?

61
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,003
- I got something to show you.
- Well, I...

62
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,923
It's something very special.

63
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,342
Well, of course, Mr. Ballard.
Do show me.

64
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,552
This way, ma'am.

65
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,265
Thank you.

66
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,372
Oh, Mr. Ballard.

67
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,999
It's my masterpiece.

68
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,293
How lovely.

69
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,712
You like it, ma'am?

70
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,383
I think it's the most beautiful rose
I've ever seen.

71
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,469
- The shape.
- And the scent.

72
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,308
Divine. And the color...

73
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,978
I adore red roses.

74
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,984
'Tis said, as Cupid danced among
the gods, he down the nectar flung...

75
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:29,739
...which on the white rose being shed,
made it forever after red.

76
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,243
- Wherever did you find that?
- Hutter's seed catalog, ma'am.

77
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,496
It's pretty, but it ain't true.

78
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,084
What goes to make a rose, ma'am,
is breeding...

79
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:46,006
...and budding and horse manure,
if you'll pardon the expression.

80
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,593
- And that's where you come in, ma'am.
- I?

81
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,056
I gotta have a name for it.

82
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,186
- Oh, you want me to name it for you.
- No, ma'am, I got a name for it...

83
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,273
...if you'll give me your permission.
- Why, of course. But I don't see...

84
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,402
I want to call it the "Mrs. Miniver. "

85
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,698
If you'll pardon me, ma'am...

86
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,535
...I've watched you go in and out
of town for years now...

87
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,748
...and you've always had time
to stop and have a word with me...

88
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,376
...and I've always waited
for you to come home...

89
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,004
...and you remind me of the flower.

90
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,341
And I figured it'd be a very good name
for my rose.

91
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,971
It's a lovely compliment, Mr. Ballard.

92
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,892
I'd be very happy indeed
to have you name your rose after me.

93
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,357
Well...

94
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,903
I really must go now. I'm terribly
late already. Goodbye, Mr. Ballard...

95
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,657
...and thank you. Thank you very much.
- No, no, no, thank you.

96
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,410
I think it's lovely
having flowers named after you.

97
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,372
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

98
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,590
Thank you!

99
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,188
- That's my wife.
- Oh.

100
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,786
- Good as new?
- Well, almost, sir.

101
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,769
It's a nice car, but afraid
it's a little more than I can afford.

102
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,938
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,067
We have some nice cars
in a cheaper bracket.

104
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,529
But I like this one.

105
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,953
Well, I'm going to take it.

106
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,459
- Perhaps you'd better think it over.
- No, I'm going to take it.

107
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,003
- Will you bring it around tonight?
- Very good, sir.

108
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,089
And don't let my wife know
how much it cost.

109
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,951
Hello, Judy!
- Daddy!

110
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,453
Good evening.

111
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,831
Mr. Miniver, you're just in time
to hear Judy play her piece.

112
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,668
- But I'm afraid...
- It'd encourage her so much.

113
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,296
- Encourage both of us, in fact.
- I'm a little late. Next time.

114
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,465
- See you later, Judy.
- Bye, Daddy.

115
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,387
- What's the hurry, Toby?
- I can't stop, Daddy.

116
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,140
- Napoleon wants to throw up.
- Oh, does he?

117
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,656
I wouldn't dare tell you the price,
though. I feel terribly guilty about it.

118
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,576
I was already on my way home and
something seemed to come over me...

119
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,746
...a sort of trance. I got off the bus...
- Hello, darling.

120
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,416
- Oh, Clem.
- How are you?

121
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,712
That's Clem, dear.
As I was saying, I got off the bus...

122
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,466
...and I suddenly remembered that Vin
was due down from Oxford tomorrow.

123
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,929
Yes, Vin, dear, tomorrow.
Isn't that exciting?

124
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,932
And so we're all going down
to the station to see him.

125
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,434
Isn't that wonderful?

126
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,438
Sophie, you idiot,
Clem was standing right here beside me.

127
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,273
Of course I haven't told him.

128
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,152
You don't just throw things
like that at a man.

129
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,905
Well, there wasn't any connection,
I just had to say something.

130
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,412
Well, I'll probably tell him
after dinner tonight.

131
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,081
He's usually most docile
when having his coffee.

132
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,667
May we go to the station
and meet Vin tomorrow?

133
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,878
Of course, darling, if you're good.

134
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,506
Is Vin still a vege...?
"Vegetenarian," Mother?

135
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,217
I doubt it, darling.
He'll have some new idea.

136
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,762
That was just a phase
he was going through.

137
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,016
- What's a phase?
- Oh, it's just a thing people go through.

138
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,478
- Do I go through it?
- Yes, you're going through one now.

139
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:57,150
Am I? I'm going through a phase!
I'm going through a phase!

140
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,444
Stop waving your arms
and finish supper.

141
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,072
- What phase will he be going through?
- We'll have to wait and see.

142
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,325
Darling, I mustn't keep Daddy waiting.

143
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,786
Good night, sweetheart.
Be a good girl.

144
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,711
Could I run down to the post, ma'am?
Cook says she'll clear.

145
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,507
Well, of course, Gladys, but
don't let Horace keep you out too late.

146
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,760
Rather a dashing fellow,
young Horace Perkins, eh, Gladys?

147
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,428
Sir!

148
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,025
You know, Kay, I...
You know, Clem, I...

149
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,320
- I'm sorry. Go ahead, dear.
- No, what were you going to say?

150
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:47,116
Nothing important. I just wondered if you
had a nice time in town, that was all.

151
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,829
Oh, wonderful.
I shopped and shopped.

152
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,832
Just little things, you know.

153
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,422
Oh, I had a puncture in the car today.

154
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,383
Oh, no, what a shame.

155
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,845
Tires are getting pretty worn
on that old bus.

156
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,889
- Clem, you know what I think?
- What?

157
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,892
I think you ought to buy yourself
a new tire.

158
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,477
A new tire?

159
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,230
Yes, it might not be a bad idea, at that.

160
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,858
They aren't so frightfully expensive,
are they?

161
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:24,904
- Oh, I guess we can swing it all right.
- A new tire shouldn't cost more...

162
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,366
...than a new hat, should it?
- A hat?

163
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,912
Well, I just said hat. I might have said
shoes or trousers or anything.

164
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,624
- Some more coffee, dear?
- I have some, thank you, darling.

165
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,752
Yeah.

166
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,006
That old bus. Pretty sad.

167
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,842
Been giving a lot of trouble lately.

168
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,678
- Has it? I hadn't noticed it.
- Of course you hadn't.

169
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,722
That's the danger with an old car.

170
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,017
You don't notice anything,
then when you're doing 70 miles...

171
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,937
- Not with our car, dear.
- And that's another thing. It's too slow.

172
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,442
- That car is dangerously slow.
- Clem, what have you been up to?

173
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,947
Come on. Get your coat and hat on.
I've got something to show you.

174
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,790
Smooth, isn't she?

175
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,376
- You all right, darling?
- Yes.

176
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,464
I was afraid you'd think
I'd been a bit too extravagant.

177
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,302
Oh, all of us are extravagant
now and then, don't you think?

178
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,764
Of course. It's fun. What's the use
of having a little money...

179
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,350
...if once in a while
you can't be reckless with it?

180
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,936
Throw is away on something
you really want.

181
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,233
Where are you going?

182
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,279
After all, what is money?

183
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,326
It's a token. It's the power to buy ourselves
something that'll make us happier.

184
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,912
You shouldn't be a slave to it, though.

185
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,417
Say, what are you doing, anyway?

186
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,475
- What on earth is that?
- Do you like it?

187
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,310
Do you?

188
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,397
I bought it today.

189
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,649
Isn't it lovely?

190
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,150
Not bad.

191
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,695
I do think it does something for me,
don't you?

192
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,531
- Yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.
- Clem.

193
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,117
Maybe it's this gown.
Doesn't quite go with it.

194
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,870
Yes, but just look at the hat itself.
And if I've had my hair done...

195
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,582
...it'd look different.
- Yeah, it would be a difference.

196
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,675
Yes, it's very pretty.

197
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,386
Good! Then I think
it was worth the money.

198
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:58,599
- Oh, much?
- Not for people with a car like ours.

199
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,353
- You're pretty clever, aren't you?
- I hope you think so, darling.

200
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,023
Kay, sit down here a minute.

201
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,316
Let me look at you.

202
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:12,196
- You're really quite beautiful, aren't you?
- If you think so, darling.

203
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,992
I think you're even more beautiful
than when I married you.

204
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,662
- Could that be?
- I don't see why not.

205
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,040
I've had more reason to be.

206
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,588
Put that silly thing away
and get into bed, now.

207
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,926
Come on, don't stand
looking at it all night.

208
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,973
- In you go, there.
- It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?

209
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,641
Yes.

210
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,858
Clem, I think we're very lucky people.

211
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,319
Because we've got a new car
and a new hat?

212
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,696
Oh, much more than that.

213
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,492
Because of Vin and Toby and Judy...

214
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,787
...and each other.
Yeah.

215
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,250
Clem.

216
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,004
Guess what.

217
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,636
I had a rose named after me today.

218
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,808
You left the light on
in the dressing room tonight.

219
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,369
Good night, Clem.

220
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,454
Good night, dear.

221
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,307
- There he is!
- There he is!

222
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,228
Hello!
Hello, Vin!

223
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,855
Vin, darling!

224
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,898
Hello, Dad!
- Fine to have you back.

225
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,901
Judy! Hello, Toby! Toby!

226
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,195
Vin! Vin's got a pipe!

227
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,990
- What of it, young fellow?
- Heavens, you've grown!

228
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,951
- Only about half an inch, Mother.
- I've grown a yard!

229
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,578
Have you, Toby?

230
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,039
- Where's the mustache, son?
- You used to be so proud of it.

231
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,876
- I don't remember being so very proud.
- I liked it.

232
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,461
Sorry. I found it took up
too much of my time.

233
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,423
- Oh, it did?
- Keeping it trim and all that.

234
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,093
After all, one can't waste too much time
over the vanities of life.

235
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,471
I see. Well, come along, children.
We better get along.

236
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,433
Let's go. Here we go.

237
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,563
Oh, good heavens.

238
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,901
So your interest
doesn't center on cars anymore, Vin?

239
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,905
Well, this last year at Oxford, I've rather
changed my outlook on things.

240
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,158
- You don't say.
- Yes. I think I've grown a little.

241
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,660
Matured in my conception
as to what life's about.

242
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,581
- Do you know what Oxford taught me?
- What, dear?

243
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:13,252
- That I know nothing about anything.
- Rather a waste of time and money.

244
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,756
Not at all, because it's shown me
just what I want out of life.

245
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,633
- And what's that, Vin?
- To learn.

246
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,261
I want to encompass all the knowledge
I can in my brief span.

247
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,847
What's "span," Vin?
- It's a bridge.

248
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,767
A bridge?
- When I think of the amount of knowledge...

249
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,437
...in the world: Scientific knowledge,
philosophical, sociological...

250
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:36,442
...and when I realize the infinitesimal part
of this I possess, it makes me shudder.

251
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,113
And apart from all that, Mother, I think
I've developed a social consciousness.

252
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,284
- What's that, Vin?
- It's the recognition of my fellow man.

253
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,955
Where are there free men today any
more than in the 9th to 15th centuries?

254
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,457
Front door, Gladys.

255
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,294
Look, the 9th to 15th centuries,
when the lords held all the land...

256
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,297
...and parceled out what they wished
to their vassals.

257
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,799
Look about. What have we?

258
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,178
As pure a feudalistic state as there ever
was in the 9th through 15th centuries.

259
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,598
When I think about it, I'm appalled,
genuinely appalled.

260
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,225
I tell you, Father...

261
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,979
...when I think of the class
system that exists in this country to...

262
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,483
- What is it, Gladys?
- Oh, it's Miss Beldon to see you, ma'am.

263
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,819
Well, show her in, Gladys.

264
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,238
Miss Beldon.
I wonder what that means.

265
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,450
Probably brought the latest ultimatum
from her illustrious grandmother.

266
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,411
I scarcely know Lady Beldon.

267
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,913
The perfect example
of what I've been saying.

268
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,835
Lady Beldon is the living proof of the
survival of the feudal system today.

269
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:41,090
You can't escape the Beldon influence.
It contaminates the entire village society.

270
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,011
- Just as in the 9th to the 15th centuries.
- Exactly.

271
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,682
How do you do, Mrs. Miniver?
I'm Carol Beldon.

272
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,435
How do you do, Miss Beldon?
This is my husband.

273
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,562
- How do you do?
- And my son Vincent.

274
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,398
- How do you do?
- Just in time for tea, Miss Beldon.

275
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,192
- Thanks, but I've just had some.
- Sit down anyway.

276
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,196
I can only stay a moment.
Please, do sit down.

277
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,409
You really must excuse me
for invading your house like this...

278
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,037
...but frankly,
I've come to make a request.

279
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,957
- A personal request, and a great favor.
- Well, please, sit down.

280
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,459
Thank you.

281
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,295
You see, my grandmother
doesn't know I've come.

282
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,841
I'm afraid I'm not very good
at breaking things gently...

283
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,428
...so I'll get straight to the point.
It's about the rose.

284
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,306
The rose?
- Yes. The one Mr. Ballard grew.

285
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,058
The Mrs. Miniver.

286
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,061
I hear he's going to enter it
in the flower show.

287
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,647
- For the Beldon Challenge Cup?
- Yes.

288
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,068
- But no one ever has entered... That is...
- No...

289
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,821
...no one has ever entered a rose
in competition with my grandmother.

290
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,448
And that's just the point.

291
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,201
It's become a tradition for her
to win the cup...

292
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,079
...and her roses mean so much to her.

293
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,998
I know it seems
an awful thing to ask...

294
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,959
...but I thought you might,
perhaps, as a favor...

295
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,963
...persuade Mr. Ballard to withdraw
his rose from the competition.

296
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:07,968
To be frank, it's such a beautiful rose
it might easily win, and, well...

297
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,637
Miss Beldon...

298
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,765
...may I ask whether
this is an open competition?

299
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,894
- Yes, technically...
- Technically, yes, but actually, no.

300
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,357
Yes, I suppose that's it. You see...
- I see only too well, Miss Beldon.

301
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,068
Because Mr. Ballard
is not of the ruling class...

302
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,989
...is a mere vassal, as it were...
- Vin, please. Let Miss Beldon explain.

303
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,284
But, Mother, Miss Beldon
doesn't have to explain, not to me.

304
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,788
I'm aware of the influence
of the feudal system in this village.

305
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,875
These are orders from the manor.
Her ladyship must have no competition.

306
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,711
You must excuse my son.
He's just down from Oxford.

307
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,340
Don't apologize for me.
I mean everything I say.

308
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,511
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
but do you do anything about it?

309
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,973
Do? Why, what do you mean?

310
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,977
If you feel something is wrong,
what are you doing about it?

311
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,940
I've spent holidays the last few years
doing settlement work in London slums.

312
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,901
- You wallow in luxury all the year...
- I don't wallow!

313
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,612
...and think a few weeks playing
Lady Bountiful...

314
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,823
- Come, Vin.
- It's not much, perhaps...

315
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,242
...but it's the only thing I know.

316
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,370
- What have you been doing?
- I?

317
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,832
- Well...
- I see. Just talk.

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,835
- That's all right. It's easier.
- Listen, I didn't say...

319
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,670
Oh, don't apologize.

320
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,674
I know how comfortable it is to curl up
with a book full of big words...

321
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,178
...and think you're going to solve
the problems of the universe.

322
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,681
But you're not.
A bit of action is required now and then.

323
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,934
Action? If that's what you
and your class are asking for...

324
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:43,272
...maybe you'll get it one of these days.
- Maybe. But not from the talkers.

325
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,193
Vin! Remember, Miss Beldon is a guest.
If you have any manners at all...

326
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,946
Manners? A humble working man
is denied the reward of his artistry...

327
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:55,159
...to gratify the vanity of an aristocrat...
- Quiet. This isn't your concern.

328
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,370
I beg to differ. I'm concerned
for a fellow man's dignity.

329
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,207
And the indignity
that's heaped upon him.

330
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:05,419
- You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Miss Beldon.
- Certainly.

331
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,758
- I must apologize for Vin.
- Oh, no, please, it's all right.

332
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,928
And besides, he's rather nice, isn't he?

333
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,554
- What?
- Well...

334
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,806
Really, you know, he's perfectly right.

335
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,726
I have not a leg to stand on
in this business.

336
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,394
I shouldn't have asked you.

337
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,356
I realized that before the words
were out of my mouth.

338
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,817
It's just that my grandmother's over 80
and takes such pride...

339
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,237
...in winning year after year.
Of course.

340
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,614
But please forget
I said anything about it.

341
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,533
Anyhow, I'm glad we met at last.

342
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,744
- I hope we see more of each other.
- I hope so too.

343
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,789
- You'll be at the sailing club dance tonight?
- Oh, yes.

344
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,291
- Good. I'll see you there, then.
- Goodbye.

345
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,503
To hear people talk, you'd think
Mr. Ballard committed a crime.

346
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,756
I don't hold with people getting
ideas above their station.

347
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,801
Who's he to think he can
enter his rose in the show?

348
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,096
- And who's to say he can't?
- Nobody's ever entered a rose...

349
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:02,226
...against Lady Beldon since she started
30 years ago. Keep a civil tongue...

350
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,354
...or I'll be doing my shopping
in Meekham after this!

351
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,233
My opinion has got nothing to do
with the quality of my merchandise.

352
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,154
If you'd called your rose a "Lady
Beldon," I'd have said right and proper.

353
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,658
- But who's Mrs. Miniver?
- The nicest lady in the neighborhood...

354
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,161
...Mr. Huggins, that's who.
- Yeah, maybe, but a newcomer.

355
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:26,292
No, Mr. Ballard, you stick to the railway
and leave roses alone.

356
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,379
Why should I? Why should I?
They're my hobby, the roses are.

357
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,132
And the railway can go to...

358
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,357
- Doesn't she look lovely?
- And a sense of humor too.

359
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,402
I loved the way she handled Vin
this afternoon.

360
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,739
I think she's coming over.

361
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,074
- Hello.
- Good evening, Miss Beldon.

362
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,952
- Please, sit down.
- Sit down, won't you?

363
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,454
Thank you.

364
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,332
- Enjoying it?
- Yes, such a wonderful band.

365
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,500
- How about a cordial?
- No, thanks.

366
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,003
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

367
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,506
- I was rather looking for your son.
- I'm sorry, Vin's not here.

368
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:18,010
No, he's suffering
from an acute case of maturity.

369
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,848
Yes. But it'll pass.
We give it a week or two, at the outside.

370
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,726
I wanted to tell him I was sorry
about this afternoon.

371
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:31,482
Oh, I rather think he wanted to say
the same thing himself. It's a pity...

372
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,026
I beg your pardon.
For you, Miss Beldon.

373
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,694
Thank you.

374
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,404
- May I?
- Of course.

375
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,708
Secret?
- Well, I suppose it is.

376
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,379
- Do I scent romance?
- Well, it is intriguing.

377
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,965
Will you excuse me?
Please don't get up.

378
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,011
- I'll see you later.
Is it that Navy lad from Dartmouth?

379
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,972
You'd be surprised.

380
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,700
Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,082
- You got my note?
- As you see.

382
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,251
Yes, of course.

383
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,922
Miss Beldon, I don't want you to think
I'm going back on anything I said.

384
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,924
Of course not.

385
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,928
But I did express myself
a bit emphatically.

386
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,349
I hope you'll excuse me.
My mode of expression, I mean.

387
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,852
There's really nothing to excuse.

388
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,564
Everyone's entitled to his
mode of expression.

389
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,775
Still, I had no right to lose my temper.

390
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:01,447
- I'm usually quite detached.
- I was pretty snippy myself, wasn't I?

391
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,533
And quite in the wrong, anyway.
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,953
It's nice of you to say so.

393
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,290
Well...

394
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,628
I'd better be getting back.
I promised this tango.

395
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,965
Oh, you couldn't.
Well, I mean, just for a moment.

396
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,970
You see, I've got so much I want to say,
to explain about myself.

397
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,849
- Of course, you want to dance.
- You don't dance?

398
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,477
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

399
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,938
Matter of fact,
I'm considered a pretty good dancer.

400
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,025
But I've rather given up
that sort of thing.

401
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,320
Well...

402
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,573
I mean, frankly...

403
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,451
...is this a time for frivolity?

404
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,748
Is this a time
to lose one's sense of humor?

405
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,874
- Did you say give him a week or two?
- Maybe an hour or two will be enough.

406
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,800
And I used to see you go by...

407
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,637
...and you used to ride in a little
tub cart, then you had a pony.

408
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,516
- Oh, yes. He was a dear.
- He was very, very fat, and so were you.

409
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,143
- I was not fat.
- You were, very fat.

410
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,980
Why, you had legs
like overstuffed sausages.

411
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,525
You see, I've really known you
for years and years.

412
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,528
I used to think about you a lot.

413
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,822
Well, don't you believe me?

414
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,992
- Well, you know, you are a good talker.
- I wish I were.

415
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,454
- I'd like to tell you just how I feel.
- You've told me a lot for one day.

416
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,999
One day. Why, one day's ridiculous.

417
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,127
What's one day out of all the vast?

418
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,630
Do you have any conception?

419
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,927
Can't we arrange to meet again
sometime soon?

420
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,804
Tomorrow.

421
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,640
Tomorrow I'm leaving for Scotland.

422
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,769
- Oh. For long?
- Until the middle of September.

423
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:42,024
- We always go, every year.
- But that's months.

424
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,360
- May I write to you?
- Yes, Vin.

425
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,113
This has been a wonderful evening,
hasn't it?

426
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,823
Yes, Vin.

427
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,205
It's been a wonderful evening,
hasn't it?

428
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,542
- Have I said that before?
- It's been a wonderful evening.

429
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,879
- For you too?
- For me too, Vin.

430
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,633
Well, looks as though we've had
all that quarreling for nothing.

431
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,844
Don't look as if there'll be
a flower show after all.

432
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,429
What makes you say that?

433
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:58,600
Her ladyship's talking of postponing
the show on account of conditions.

434
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,852
Very right and proper.

435
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,313
They've marched into Poland,
haven't they?

436
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,941
That means war, if you ask me.

437
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,443
And if war comes...

438
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,364
...it's "Goodbye, roses. "
- Don't talk silly.

439
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,784
You might as well say,
"Goodbye, England. "

440
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,662
There will always be roses.

441
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:13,300
Children of the heavenly king
As ye journey, sweetly sing

442
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:22,184
Sing your savior's worthy praise,
Glorious in his works and ways

443
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:33,862
We are traveling home to God,
In the way the fathers trod

444
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:41,661
They are happy now, and we
Soon their happiness shall see

445
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,207
She's come back. She wasn't
to have returned for another week.

446
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:52,964
Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
On the borders of your land

447
00:34:53,132 --> 00:35:01,640
Jesus Christ, your father's son,
Bids you undismayed go on

448
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:08,647
Amen

449
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,568
Dearly beloved brethren, the
scripture moveth us in sundry places...

450
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,572
...to acknowledge and confess
our manifold sins and wickedness.

451
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,744
And not dissemble nor cloak them
before almighty God, our heavenly father.

452
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,164
But confess them
with a humble, lowly...

453
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,017
Will everyone please be seated.

454
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,069
It has just been announced over the air
by the prime minister...

455
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,614
...that our country is at war.

456
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,704
In the circumstances...

457
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,331
...I don't think you'll wish me
to continue...

458
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,836
...as you will probably, most of you,
have some other duty to perform.

459
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,423
I will say simply this:

460
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:21,178
That the prayer for peace
still lives in our hearts...

461
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,348
...coupled now with the prayer
for our beloved country.

462
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,185
We in this village...

463
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,395
...have not failed in the past.

464
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,609
Our forefathers, for 1000 years, have
fought for the freedom we now enjoy.

465
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,820
And that we must now defend again.

466
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,907
With God's help...

467
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,117
...and their example...

468
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,869
...we cannot...

469
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,163
...and shall not fail.

470
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:12,187
Amen

471
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,740
- Are we going to be bombed, Daddy?
- Shh. Toby, don't shout, darling.

472
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,534
- Are we going to be bombed?
- Come on.

473
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,623
- Carol.
- I'll be right along, Granny.

474
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,583
Beg your pardon. Carol!
- Hello.

475
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,168
- You came back early.
- Yes.

476
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,422
Oh, I'm so glad. How are you fixed,
in case of anything?

477
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,426
Quite all right, I think.
I must go, Vin. Goodbye.

478
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,220
Yes?

479
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,448
Ma'am, I'm so glad you've come.
Gladys is carrying on... Pardon me.

480
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,286
Carrying on something awful.
I've had her on me hands all morning.

481
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,080
- What's the matter?
- It's on account of Horace.

482
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,416
Called up and asked to join
his regiment tonight.

483
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,625
- No.
- Yes, ma'am.

484
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,669
- And Gladys in floods of tears.
- Oh, dear.

485
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,170
And that stove...

486
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,341
...the man only come Friday to look at it,
and what he done, I don't know.

487
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,927
But she's not fit to work.
She's not, really.

488
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,804
Well, never mind, Ada.

489
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,098
I daresay we'll manage somehow.

490
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,599
Napoleon!

491
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,268
Toby, take him away.

492
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:37,480
- I suppose they broadcast the news.
- Yes, ma'am, what a dreadful thing.

493
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,608
And that laundry.
Lost another of me best aprons.

494
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,446
- But we've always got the navy.
That's right, Ada.

495
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,922
Oh, come on, now.
Cheer up, Gladys.

496
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,717
Horace won't be anywhere
near the frontline.

497
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,054
Oh, yes, he will.
He's one to push himself forward.

498
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,308
He says, "You let me get me hands
on Hitler. I'll give him sweatsticker. "

499
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,809
Give him what?

500
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,480
Sweatsticker. You know, sir,
the sign they have on their flags.

501
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,982
Oh. Well, that's the proper spirit, Gladys.

502
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,277
He's got too much spirit.
He gives way to it.

503
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,656
I beg pardon, but would you tell Gladys
Horace has got to catch his train...

504
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,659
...and could he come in a minute
and say goodbye?

505
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,162
- Oh, of course he can.
- Come in, Horace.

506
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,373
Thank you, sir.
Morning, everybody.

507
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,957
Good morning, Horace.

508
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,251
- Will you have a sherry?
- Don't mind if I do.

509
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,503
Help yourself right there.

510
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,839
- And jolly good luck to you, Horace.
- Yes, indeed.

511
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,134
Jolly good luck, Horace.
- Thanks, Master Toby.

512
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,762
To your very good health.
My best respects, ma'am.

513
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,971
Thank you, Horace.

514
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,183
The children are going to miss you
terribly. And poor Gladys.

515
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,478
Oh, she'll be all right,
won't you, Glad?

516
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,278
Here, here.
That's not the way to behave.

517
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:11,157
How do you expect me to
behave when you go off and get killed?

518
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,284
Well, cheer up. I ain't killed yet.

519
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,495
Here, have a drop of this.

520
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,540
- You don't mind, sir?
Oh, certainly not.

521
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,548
There. That's better.

522
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,716
- Have one for yourself now.
- Thank you.

523
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,511
You'll want Gladys to see you
to the station, won't you?

524
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,930
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
- Go get your hat.

525
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,768
Very nice drop of stuff, this.
Last I shall get for a bit, I expect.

526
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,230
Make a lot of difference
to a lot of people, this war will.

527
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,649
Yes, a lot of difference.

528
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,235
We may all meet on the frontline yet.

529
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,821
Not me, Horace.
The RAF for me.

530
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,364
Oh, boy!

531
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,701
- I've always been keen on flying.
- That's all right too.

532
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,079
Well, I got to get to me train.
I'll say goodbye, ma'am.

533
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,458
Yes, of course, Horace.
Goodbye, and the best of luck.

534
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,959
Goodbye, Horace.

535
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,629
- Let us know how it's going.
- I will. You'll excuse the spelling.

536
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,591
I'm better with a bayonet
than with a pencil.

537
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,469
You can write it in blood.

538
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,638
Nice child you have.

539
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,682
- Keep your chin up.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,102
Hello! Well, she's done
you proud, Horace.

541
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,439
Not half, she ain't.
Full dress inspection kit.

542
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,775
- And very nice too, Gladys.
- Thank you, ma'am.

543
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,112
- Say goodbye to Napoleon.
- Goodbye, all. And cat.

544
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,990
- And many thanks, I'm sure.
- Goodbye, Horace.

545
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,078
Bye, Horace.

546
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,665
Mind if I get on with the blackout?

547
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,334
All right, dear.

548
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,794
Thought I'd run up to
the Beldon place later on.

549
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,133
Two women alone, you know,
might be a good idea to look things over.

550
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,802
Yes, I think you should, dear.

551
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,766
- Times like these, one ought to be neighborly.
- Oh, yes, indeed one should.

552
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,519
- May I go with him, Mother?
- If he'll have you.

553
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,604
No!

554
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,001
Isn't he very young,
even for the air force?

555
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,880
Yes, he's young.

556
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,695
- May I see Miss Carol?
Is she expecting you, sir?

557
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,905
No, but I think she would see me.

558
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,782
- Vin!
Hello, Carol.

559
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,827
It's all right, Chandler.
It's nice of you to come.

560
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,289
Well, I wanted to find out
if everything's all right.

561
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,083
Do come in.
Everything's fine.

562
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,377
After a terrific row
with Mr. Foley...

563
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,089
...my grandmother's agreed
to obey the blackout regulations.

564
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,676
- I was worried about you.
- That's sweet of you, Vin.

565
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,515
It was sweet to write me letters
while I was in Scotland.

566
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,059
- So you did get them.
- Yes, of course.

567
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,729
I wondered if you did
when you didn't answer.

568
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,691
Vin, I didn't know how to answer.

569
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,943
You're such a crazy boy...

570
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,529
...and I didn't think
the craze would last.

571
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:41,075
- Craze?
- Well, it is rather sudden, isn't it?

572
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,870
This is only the third time we've met.

573
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,913
Does that matter?

574
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,375
No, but I'd like to be sure.

575
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,129
I don't really know you
very well, do I?

576
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,133
We could do something about that.
We could see a lot of each other.

577
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,636
Every day while I'm around.

578
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:04,474
- Would that be all right?
- Why, yes. Why not?

579
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,437
- Gosh, I'm glad to see you again.
- I'm glad too, Vin.

580
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,107
I say, is it an awful nerve?

581
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,528
Well, I mean, we have
a sort of agreement, haven't we?

582
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:22,158
- Would it be going too far?
- It's all right, Vin.

583
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,292
I heard voices.
May I ask whom you're entertaining?

584
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,711
This is Vincent Miniver.
My grandmother.

585
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,631
- How do you do, Lady Beldon?
- Miniver, eh?

586
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,134
Miniver. I know that name.

587
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,137
A rose with that name
has been entered in the show.

588
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,473
- Now Granny...
- The Miniver rose. Hmph.

589
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,016
That's something new.

590
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,478
The Marshall Neil,
the flower called Drushke...

591
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:54,899
...the Duchess of Argyle
and now the Mrs. Miniver.

592
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,401
Please, Granny.

593
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,820
A tramp rose grown
in a station yard.

594
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,988
It's nothing to do with Vin.

595
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,783
Then what's he doing here,
if one may ask?

596
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,412
- I came to offer my services.
I see.

597
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,622
You're in league with
wretched Foley.

598
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,208
- Oh, no, Lady Beldon.
- Oh, Granny.

599
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,001
Never heard such rot.

600
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,672
We can take care of ourselves.
We have for the last 800 years.

601
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,091
- But...
- We don't take orders, we give them.

602
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,385
Worst thing about this war
is the chance...

603
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,887
...it gives little persons
to become important.

604
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,806
Air raids, indeed.

605
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,767
Those wretched Germans.
They wouldn't dare...

606
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,490
- What should we do?
- Do? Nothing.

607
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,202
- It's Foley giving a false alarm.
You can't take that attitude.

608
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,037
I beg your pardon, young man!

609
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,206
You must take precautions.

610
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,543
Ring for the butler and gather
the servants in the cellar.

611
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,336
Then go down there yourself.

612
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,423
- I must call my parents. The telephone?
- In the hall.

613
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,091
Upon my word!

614
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,637
- Sirens, milady.
- I'm not deaf.

615
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:11,058
- Get all the servants quickly to the cellar.
You too, Granny. He said so.

616
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,313
The cellar!

617
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,233
Hello? That you, Dad?

618
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,235
All right with you?

619
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,572
Yes, everything under control.

620
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,824
Right. I'll expect you
when I see you, then.

621
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,745
Who is it?
Air raid warden.

622
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,164
Hello, Foley. What's up?

623
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,501
- You're showing a light.
- We are?

624
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,545
Bright horizontal beam
plainly visible from the air.

625
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,840
- Every window in the house is...
- Ground level.

626
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,802
Oh, gosh. This way, Foley.

627
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,764
Thank you.

628
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,062
- Good evening, Mrs. Miniver.
- Good evening, Mr. Foley.

629
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,732
Ah, yes.

630
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:06,072
- How about this blanket, Mr. Foley?
I think I can use it, all right.

631
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,745
There. That fixes that.

632
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,623
It's those tiny cracks
that do the damage.

633
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,708
One man lighting a cigarette...

634
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,545
...stands out like a beacon
from 5000 feet up.

635
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,049
One little crack of light might lead
the whole German air force straight here.

636
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,969
- Well, it was lucky it was just you.
- Yes, indeed.

637
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,638
Strictly speaking,
you're liable to a fine...

638
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,225
...but as senior warden,
you'll hear no more about it.

639
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,979
- That's awfully nice.
- You got a nice place here for storage.

640
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,523
Hear the Minister of Food
the other day...

641
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,692
...recommended stocking up a bit?

642
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,153
You want to put in some tin foods
in case of emergency.

643
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,739
Sugar, now, sure to go up.

644
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,493
I've got some wonderful demerara.
Will 50 pounds be enough?

645
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,873
- Well, really, I...
- Make it 20 pounds, best demerara.

646
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,833
- Bismarck herring?
- I hate them.

647
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,712
Kipper snacks? Salmon? Sardines?
I've got lovely Italian sardines.

648
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,465
Might not be able to get them later.
You never know what Mussolini will do.

649
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,643
There you are. All clear.

650
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,021
They didn't get further than the coast.

651
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:24,525
- Is the war over, Mommy?
- No, darling.

652
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,320
- This is just the first day.
- Oh, good.

653
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,905
Oh, come on.

654
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,365
Attention, England.

655
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,660
This is your English friend
in Germany again.

656
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,330
Now, listen carefully
while there's yet time.

657
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,541
Time to avoid
further useless bloodshed.

658
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,254
It's now eight months
since your government declared war...

659
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:50,092
...eight months of progressive disaster
for the enemies of the German Reich.

660
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,680
France has been defeated as I told
you she would be, if you remember...

661
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:59,226
...and her invincible armies
completely crushed.

662
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,898
I need hardly tell you
that England comes next on the list.

663
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:08,402
Already the boasted British coolness
has given place to blind panic.

664
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,990
Already there have been serious riots
in your key industries...

665
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,576
...and they didn't tell you that,
did they?

666
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,996
Already the British lion
is howling with terror.

667
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,755
- Turn it off, George.
Had enough?

668
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,633
He's all wind and whitewash,
like a blinking rook.

669
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,260
- Can't we get some news?
Not till 9.

670
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,889
You work at the airfield.
You see that German plane come down?

671
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,266
I heard it.
I wonder where the pilot is.

672
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,937
With all that cover in them woods,
he could lay there for days.

673
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,272
But he's got to get food,
don't forget.

674
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,275
Be funny if he walked in here,
wouldn't it?

675
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,113
- He'd never do that.
- I don't know so much.

676
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,242
They're clever. Some goes to Oxford
and learns to speak English...

677
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,869
...just as good as what you and me do.
- No.

678
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,413
Well, almost.

679
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,082
- Hey.

680
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,465
- Did you get that Fritz?
- Not yet. We will.

681
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,678
- Whiskey. What are you having?
- I'll have a beer, sir.

682
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,430
Pretty smart, these Jerries.

683
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,850
- This chap was an ace too.
- Got six of our fellows.

684
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,978
Cheerio!

685
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,063
- Vin!
- Hello, Dad.

686
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,607
- Where did you spring from?
- Belham Airfield.

687
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,694
- You're practically on the doorstep.
- Isn't it grand?

688
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,613
- I was buzzing home when I saw you.
- This is good news.

689
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,451
You don't know the half of it.
See that? Pilot Officer Miniver.

690
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,996
- So soon? I thought...
- Things are moving pretty fast.

691
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,622
They cut short the course.

692
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,835
I got 85% on the test
and a week's leave on the strength of it.

693
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,173
Great stuff. Congratulations.
That calls for a drink.

694
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,592
- What'll you have?
- I don't think I will.

695
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,595
I phoned Mother I was coming.
I called Carol too.

696
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,431
- I'll bet you did.
- I'll run up there later on.

697
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,350
- How much do I owe you, George?
- Five and sixpence.

698
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,645
- There you are. Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

699
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,564
Bye, George.

700
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,409
Where is everybody? Kay!

701
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,249
- Well, what is this?
- Vin!

702
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,293
Mother. Carol.

703
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,129
Oh, Vin. Vin, darling.

704
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,925
Carol, both of you,
it's wonderful.

705
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,054
I didn't want to miss a minute.
How are you?

706
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,306
- Fine. Don't I look it?
- He's brown.

707
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,016
Open-air life, Mother.

708
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,935
It's good to see you all again.

709
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,896
I sort of don't know
which way to turn!

710
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,235
- Seen these?
Makes a good-looking pilot?

711
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:58,322
- Vin, already?
- Two months before my regular time.

712
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,409
And what a bit of luck
being transferred to an airfield so near.

713
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,538
A fellow I knew
had his people living round about.

714
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:09,416
When he flew over, he'd cut his engine
so they'd know who it was. Like this:

715
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,256
Well, I suppose now you're ready
for real flying.

716
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,925
Not only for real flying
but real...

717
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,846
- Well, whatever they send me into.
- Fighting.

718
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,643
- Where are the kids?
- Upstairs.

719
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,771
- You wouldn't let them dine with us?
- I might.

720
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,274
- I'll run up and tell them.
- No. I'm going.

721
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,777
- Clem, coming?
- Yeah. I've got to change.

722
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,085
- Hello.
- Hello.

723
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,429
- Have you heard we're losing Gladys?
- Is Horace on leave?

724
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,972
Oh, no, sir.

725
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,892
Gladys joined the WAAFs.
She's off to Aldershot.

726
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,312
- What's a WAAF?
- Women's Auxiliary Air Force.

727
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,940
It's just a coincidence that Horace
is stationed at Aldershot too.

728
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,652
Oh, sir! You are a marvel.

729
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,821
- Mother?
Yes, darling.

730
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,867
Is Vin going to marry Carol?

731
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,912
Now, Toby, just finish
your dumpling, darling.

732
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,748
I only said, "Is Vin
going to marry Carol?"

733
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,585
Isn't it nice having Vin at home
and staying down here for dinner?

734
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,214
Yes. Are you going
to marry Carol, Vin?

735
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:43,594
Well, since you bring it up, Toby,
I haven't had the nerve to ask her.

736
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,180
Why not? You're brave, aren't you?

737
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,723
Don't be so silly, Toby.

738
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,351
Gentlemen don't propose
when they're eating.

739
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:54,146
Why not?
- Well, it's not romantic.

740
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,442
Of course it isn't.

741
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,615
- Toby.
- What?

742
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,534
Why don't you ask me
if I'm going to marry Vin?

743
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,703
Are you?

744
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:14,166
- If he asks me.
- He's afraid.

745
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,336
Why, say, I'm not
going to stand for that.

746
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,465
Carol, I meant to wait for Judy's
romantic moments and all that...

747
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,218
...but will you marry me, Carol?
Soon?

748
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,596
Oh, egads.
This is the darnedest proposal I've...

749
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,890
Is it yes, Carol?

750
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,643
It's yes, Vin.

751
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,940
Hooray! Hooray!

752
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,193
Oh, my dear, I'm so happy.

753
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,788
- May I?
- Go ahead, Dad.

754
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:02,256
It's the telephone, ma'am. He wants
to speak to Pilot Officer Vincent Miniver.

755
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,682
Hello. Yes. Yes, speaking.

756
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,934
Yes.

757
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,812
Why, of course, sir.

758
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,356
Oh, I see.

759
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,193
About half an hour.

760
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,112
Yes, sir.

761
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,364
Immediately, sir.

762
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,283
Goodbye.

763
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,958
- That was the airfield. I have to report.
- Oh, no, Vin.

764
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,128
- It's a blow, isn't it?
- Oh, but why?

765
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,465
Some job or other.
You don't ask why in the air force.

766
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,426
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- I can't believe it, Vin.

767
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,471
- They promised you a week.
- You know how things are.

768
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,349
Good job I hadn't unpacked.
I'll go get my bag.

769
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,310
I promised to be at the airport
in half an hour.

770
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,021
- I'll get the car and drive you over, Vin.
- Thanks, Dad.

771
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:09,698
Well, it's a disappointment.
No use pretending it isn't.

772
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,867
But now that we've
got him so near...

773
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,536
Does that mean that
he's going into action?

774
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,122
Not necessarily, Carol.

775
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:26,507
Well, I better get the car.

776
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,995
It certainly hasn't been
much of a leave.

777
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,206
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, darling.

778
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,418
- Do take care of yourself.
- Oh, I will.

779
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,754
Goodbye, you.

780
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,389
Be good.
Remember, you're engaged.

781
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,642
Better not tell the old lady.
Not until I get back.

782
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,272
Then we'll go hand in hand and beard
the old lion in her own rose garden.

783
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,775
Goodbye, Judy.

784
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,862
Get me some souvenirs.
- What do you want?

785
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,071
Messerschmitt.

786
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,117
- Goodbye, Toby.
- Bye, Vin.

787
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,994
- Vin! Vin.
- Yes?

788
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,622
Make me a dive bomber.
- All right.

789
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,922
- Bye.
So long.

790
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,967
Shoot down Jerries and Fritzes.
I will.

791
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,137
Goodbye, and don't worry about me.
85% on the test, you know.

792
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,264
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Vin.

793
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,358
Hey.

794
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,451
What a beautiful night.

795
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,787
Clear as day.

796
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,753
- Happy about the engagement, Clem?
Oh, very.

797
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,839
- Sweet child, young Carol.
- Isn't she?

798
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,675
Wonder how the old lady's
going to take it.

799
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,469
She'll be proud.

800
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:39,056
- You couldn't be prejudiced, could you?
- Certainly not.

801
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:43,393
- Vin's a very unusual boy.
- Yes.

802
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,508
Listen, Clem.

803
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,885
Engine trouble.

804
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,142
- No, it's Vin.
- Vin?

805
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,187
Yes. Don't you remember
what he told us about signaling?

806
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,940
About the boy who used to signal
to his mother?

807
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,402
- That was Vin.
- By Jove, I believe you're right.

808
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,369
Good old Vin.

809
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,289
Good luck, Vin.

810
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,353
Hello?
- Clem!

811
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,944
Yes?

812
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,405
Who?

813
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,742
- Oh, emergency. I see.
- What is it, Clem?

814
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,785
It's all right, dear.
- Is it Vin?

815
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,954
Oh, no. It's only the river patrol.

816
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,751
All right, old man,
I'll come right over.

817
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:35,714
- You're not going out on the river?
- I've got to. I'm on patrol.

818
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:40,052
- I wonder what's up. 2:30.
- What on earth can they want?

819
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,553
I can't imagine.

820
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,641
You've been out after that German flyer
all day, and I'll not let you go.

821
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,684
Now I am confused.

822
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,895
Are those orders?

823
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,607
Where are you off to?

824
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,610
Sandwiches and a Thermos.

825
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,863
If you're going on duty,
you'll need them.

826
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,255
- Thank you.
Hello, Miniver.

827
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,757
Hello, Halliday.

828
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,842
- Nobby, what's on?
- I don't know.

829
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,345
He's your crew. How much
petrol have you got?

830
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,474
- About half full. Why? What's up?
- Fill her up, Dixon.

831
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,816
Hi, Mr. Miniver.

832
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,359
What's up?
Wish I knew.

833
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,985
- What do you think?
Don't know.

834
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,487
- Do you know?
- All I know is...

835
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,323
...I've been dragged out of bed
to open up the bar.

836
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,742
Awfully glad you were.

837
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,829
A couple of points to starboard there.

838
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,668
Scots, wae hae wi' Wallace bled.

839
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,088
- Hello, chaps.
- Why the glad rags?

840
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,842
Well, I was in London at the Savoy
and I got old Halliday's call...

841
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,970
...and I come straight down.
- Any idea what we're up to?

842
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:11,518
Who cares? "Theirs is not to reason why.
Theirs is but to do or die. "

843
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,729
Gallant 600.

844
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,398
- Give me a drink.
- Miniver, what you make of it?

845
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,610
I'll do anything for our country, but
digging us out at 2 in the morning...

846
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,404
That carries the war too far.

847
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,366
Where are we going?
- Orders are to collect all petrol boats...

848
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,119
...of 30 feet and over
I can lay my hands on...

849
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,205
...shove crews in, fill them
and send them to Ramsgate.

850
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,166
- Ramsgate?
- Why Ramsgate?

851
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,877
I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.

852
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,714
- The sooner we get off the better.
- Hooray for Ramsgate!

853
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,469
- Sign that for me, will you, Joe?
Sure thing.

854
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,804
- Come on, Mac.
- Sign that for me.

855
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,527
What on earth?

856
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,405
There must be close to 1000.

857
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,991
Look. Look, sir.

858
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,916
Attention, please.

859
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,836
Attention, everyone.

860
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,714
Attention, please.

861
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,342
Switch off your engines.

862
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,226
As you know,
the British Expeditionary Force...

863
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,896
...is trapped between the enemy
and the sea.

864
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,149
Four hundred thousand men
are crowded on the beaches...

865
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,860
...under bombardment from artillery
and planes.

866
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,697
Their only chance to escape annihilation
rests with you.

867
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,159
Your destination is Dunkirk.

868
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,954
It's my duty to tell you
that the effort is not without risk.

869
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,874
You are asked to cross 40 miles
of open sea...

870
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,502
...many of you in small boats
that are far from seaworthy.

871
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,173
Shore guns and enemy aircraft
are going to make it tough for you.

872
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:32,344
Any of you who wish to withdraw
may do so now.

873
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,224
Very good.

874
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,101
We'll put to sea at once.

875
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,687
Smaller boats without compasses
will follow...

876
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,732
...in the wake of larger ships
at the head of the line.

877
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,901
Every moment counts.

878
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,612
Good luck to you.

879
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,623
- All right with you?
- Aye, sir.

880
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,208
Turn her over.

881
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,879
Good morning, ma'am.

882
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,798
Good morning, Mr. Ballard.
- You're up early.

883
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,468
Yes. I haven't been sleeping very well.

884
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,138
Listen.

885
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,223
Guns.

886
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,899
Ah, funny how the sound carries
with this east wind.

887
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,943
Mr. Miniver's not back from Dunkirk,
I suppose?

888
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,157
No, he's not back.
Neither is my son.

889
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,201
They've been gone five days now.

890
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,537
- Oh, they'll be back, ma'am. You'll see.
- Yes.

891
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,582
- I'll be very glad to see.
- You will.

892
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:12,212
Them that goes down to the sea in ships
and has business in the great waters...

893
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:16,925
...these men see the works of the Lord
and his wonders in the great deep.

894
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,553
You can't beat the Bible, can you,
when it comes to deep feelings?

895
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,306
- No.
- And no one that's thrown that over...

896
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:28,228
...for a set of Goebbels and Grings
is going to win this war.

897
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,064
- That's my comfort, ma'am.
- Mine too, Mr. Ballard.

898
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,984
There's to be a flower show this year,
you know, up at Beldon Hall.

899
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:38,196
It takes more than a war
to stop her old ladyship.

900
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,492
Oh, I am so sorry.
What were you saying?

901
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:47,747
I was telling you about my rose, ma'am.
I've entered it for the show and I...

902
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,667
Well, I should know better
than to be bothering you.

903
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,169
Oh, but you're not.
I'm so glad.

904
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,630
It's a beautiful rose.
It deserves a prize.

905
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:59,342
Thank you, ma'am. Well...

906
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:03,096
- I'll be getting along.
Good day, Mr. Ballard.

907
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,767
Move or make noise, I shoot.

908
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,445
Alone?

909
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,825
My children are upstairs, and the maid.

910
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,036
All asleep.

911
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,595
Food. Drink.

912
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,472
All right.

913
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,357
- Food, quick.
- I'm getting it.

914
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,318
Stop pointing that gun at me!
You're frightening me!

915
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,043
Milk. Milk.

916
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,087
Hurry.

917
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,595
Give me.

918
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:03,109
- You got meat?
- Yes, I think so.

919
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,783
- Hurry.
I am hurrying.

920
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,705
Go back.

921
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,803
It's the milkman.

922
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:18,059
Coat. Give me coat.

923
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,856
Wait.

924
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,984
I'll get you the coat.

925
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,664
Keep door open.

926
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,375
Go.

927
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,431
The police. Urgent, please.

928
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,733
Police? This is Mrs. Miniver.

929
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,568
Miniver.

930
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,323
Starlings. I've got that German flyer,
the one who escaped.

931
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,325
In the kitchen.

932
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,495
Yes, I'm all right.
Will you come to the back door?

933
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,748
He's wounded. Bring a doctor.

934
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,668
Thank you.

935
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,512
I took your gun.

936
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:47,852
- You call police?
Yes. It's much better.

937
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,605
Let me help you.

938
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,767
There, now. It's much better this way.
Really, it is.

939
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,478
You'll be wonderfully looked after
in a hospital.

940
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,064
You'll be safe there.

941
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:37,151
The war won't last forever.

942
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,654
No.

943
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,365
Soon we finish it.

944
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,203
I'm finish...

945
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,705
...but others come...

946
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,791
...like me.

947
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,710
Thousands, many thousands.

948
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,837
Better.

949
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,465
All of this...

950
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,759
...you will see.

951
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,594
You will see.

952
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,849
We will come.
We will bomb your cities...

953
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:12,061
...like Barcelona...

954
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,813
...Warsaw...

955
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:17,274
...Narvik, Rotterdam.

956
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,236
Rotterdam we destroy in two hours.

957
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:24,240
- And thousands killed. Innocent people.
- Not innocent!

958
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,742
- They were against us!
- Women and children!

959
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:33,082
Thirty thousand in two hours.

960
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,878
And we will do the same thing here!

961
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,107
It's his arm, doctor.

962
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,659
All right, sir.
Come along, young fellow.

963
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:19,628
Thank you, ma'am.
Move along now.

964
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:26,135
- You all right, Mrs. Miniver?
- Yes, thank you, doctor.

965
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:55,164
Mommy?

966
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,625
Who was that, Mommy?

967
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,677
Who was here, Mommy?
Who was here?

968
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:30,741
Clem! It's Daddy, darling!
It's Daddy!

969
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,952
Run and tell Judy.

970
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,704
Judy! Judy!

971
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,472
Clem, darling!
Darling, are you all right?

972
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,724
Hello, darling.

973
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:07,111
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Daddy! Daddy!

974
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,071
- Hello, darling.
Daddy! Daddy!

975
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,907
- How are you?
You're awful dirty.

976
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:16,704
- And I'm awful tired. Gosh, I'm tired.
Come. You're going straight to bed.

977
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:21,083
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Just the boat.

978
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,422
Come on, children.

979
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,799
Go on, Toby.

980
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,261
Any word of Vin?

981
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:36,307
No, but he'll be back soon.
I'm sure of it.

982
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:39,852
Darling, it's so lovely to have you home.
Come on, Toby.

983
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,573
I want to sleep for a week.

984
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,491
There, darling.

985
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,994
Oh, that's good.

986
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,377
Can I get you some breakfast, darling?

987
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,909
It's Vin, Clem! It's Vin!

988
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,252
He's back.

989
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:22,681
Did I hear you offer me breakfast?
- Ten hours ago.

990
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,976
- Ten hours?
- But Vin ate it.

991
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:30,272
- Vin, home?
- Home.

992
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,774
Both of you.

993
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,238
Where is he now?

994
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,366
He went up to Beldon Hall
to break the news of the engagement.

995
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:44,495
Oh, I don't envy him that trip.

996
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:48,082
Serves him right, though,
for eating my breakfast. Anything left?

997
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,002
- What do you want?
- Well, I should...

998
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,463
- What have you got?
- I'll find out.

999
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,926
Ada!

1000
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:03,055
I didn't know when you'd wake up,
so I couldn't order anything for dinner.

1001
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,558
Breakfast. No matter what time it is
when I wake up, it's breakfast.

1002
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,311
Come in.

1003
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:12,940
- Hello, Ada.
- Well, I am glad to see you, sir!

1004
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,443
After what it said in the papers,
I was quite worried about you.

1005
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,154
- I was.
- That's nice of you, but I'm all right.

1006
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:22,157
All I need now is a good large plate
of ham and eggs.

1007
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:23,909
All right, sir.

1008
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:27,162
- Then it is in the papers?
- About Dunkirk?

1009
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,540
- Yes.
- Yes, dear.

1010
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:33,252
Thank heavens.
I shan't have to tell you about it.

1011
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,295
Clem, I'm so proud of you.

1012
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,756
Are you, darling?
Well, that's nice.

1013
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,759
And come to think of it,
I'm a bit proud of myself.

1014
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:44,680
What you might call
a real bit of navigation.

1015
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,975
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1016
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:53,897
Oh, darling, I'm almost sorry for you,
having a nice, quiet, peaceful time...

1017
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,860
...when things were happening.
But that's what men are for, isn't it?

1018
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,987
To do things while women
look after the house.

1019
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,282
Yes, dear. Come in.

1020
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,244
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I just remembered
we ain't got any ham.

1021
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,205
- What?
- You gave it all to that German pilot.

1022
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,790
Oh, well, never mind.

1023
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:15,002
We've got some bacon.
Mr. Miniver likes that just as well.

1024
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,005
All right, ma'am.
- What's that about a German pilot?

1025
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,924
- Nothing at all.
- What do you mean, "nothing at all"?

1026
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:25,137
Well, I just had a German pilot in
for ham and eggs this morning.

1027
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,515
Wait! What's going on here?
- Now, Clem, don't get excited.

1028
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:32,060
- I'm going to draw your bath.
I've had a bath. I'm not excited!

1029
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:34,062
- A cigarette?
- No, I don't want one.

1030
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,565
Was it the fellow we were looking for?

1031
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,567
- Yes.
- But what did you do?

1032
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:41,570
Woman, you're driving me crazy.
Didn't he have a gun?

1033
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,114
Well, yeah, he had a gun.

1034
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,158
Well?

1035
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,621
I took it from him and called the police.

1036
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:55,083
Oh, you just took it to the police...
Just like that.

1037
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:59,963
And then I suppose you gave him tea.

1038
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,090
Milk.

1039
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,022
- Milk.
- Clem!

1040
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,193
- Come in.
What is it, Ada?

1041
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:24,780
It's the old lady, ma'am.
And me with the eggs on the stove.

1042
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:27,449
- It's Lady Beldon.
Beldon, here?

1043
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,285
No, ma'am. Downstairs.

1044
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,788
All right.
Tell her I'll be down in a minute.

1045
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,123
Very well, ma'am.

1046
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,293
Lady Beldon.

1047
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:42,923
If I hadn't known you'd taken that pilot
single-handed, I'd say you were scared.

1048
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,969
I am scared, just as I was when
I took that German pilot single-handed.

1049
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:51,640
- Know why she's come in such haste?
To object, I suppose.

1050
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,642
It's really insufferable snobbery.

1051
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,311
A boy like Vin,
she ought to be proud and happy.

1052
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:59,273
And honored.
- I wish I had a better dress on.

1053
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,191
Oh, well.

1054
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:05,988
Clement Miniver, don't you dare smile.

1055
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:25,048
Why, Lady Beldon, this is nice.

1056
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,468
Won't you sit down here?

1057
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,558
I think I can guess why you came.

1058
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:37,686
- Vin's told you his news, hasn't he?
- Yes, Mrs. Miniver.

1059
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:42,024
- I do hope you're as pleased as we are.
- I'm afraid not. Why, they're infants.

1060
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:45,110
- Carol's 18 and that boy's not 20.
- Yes, they are young.

1061
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:49,031
I think I should tell you frankly,
I hope to persuade Carol to wait.

1062
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,075
- You think she may change her mind?
- Frankly, yes.

1063
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:56,330
- Perhaps make a better match.
- There's always that possibility.

1064
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,874
Of course,
it may be just maternal vanity...

1065
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,627
...but I don't think Carol will find
anyone nicer than Vin.

1066
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:06,298
- I don't believe she'll change her mind.
- It's a matter of opinion.

1067
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,634
- Her age is a matter of fact.
- Isn't that Beldon tradition...

1068
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,136
...to marry young?

1069
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,972
- I don't know what you mean.
- My daughter Judy...

1070
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,893
You've not met Judy. She had to write
a composition on the Crusades.

1071
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,562
She brought a small book home
from the library...

1072
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,940
...called A Friend
of King Richard the Lion-Hearted.

1073
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:27,861
- It was a life of an ancestor of yours.
- Really, I fail to see...

1074
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,323
It was a fascinating book.
I got quite interested in it myself.

1075
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,909
It was full of stories
of the Beldon family.

1076
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:37,496
I trust you satisfied yourself
we were worthy of the alliance.

1077
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:40,916
Well, there were one or two things
that rather surprised me.

1078
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,086
Did you know that the
12th Lord Beldon was hanged?

1079
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:45,587
He was beheaded.

1080
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:48,006
Such things happen in the best families.

1081
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:52,094
- Usually in the best families.
- In fact, what interested me most...

1082
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:56,014
...was the extreme youth of the
Beldon brides. This Gilbert Beldon...

1083
01:29:56,182 --> 01:30:00,602
...who went on the Crusades, married an
Isabelle Du Something-or-other, age 12.

1084
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:05,357
I did not come here to chatter pedigrees.
I'm old-fashioned. I believe in breeding.

1085
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,860
- That's neither here nor there.
- Your point is, they're too young.

1086
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:11,196
I've said so, haven't I?

1087
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:14,658
We're at war, Lady Beldon.
And Vin's a flyer.

1088
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,911
It's no excuse for rushing into
an ill-considered marriage.

1089
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:22,124
But in war, time is so precious
to the young people.

1090
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,668
- How old were you when you married?
- I?

1091
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,129
It's no use telling fibs...

1092
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:31,633
...because I looked you up.
- Oh, well, if you've looked me up...

1093
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:35,387
...I suppose you know that I was 16.

1094
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,975
- Sixteen. And did your parents approve?
- That's beside the point.

1095
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:42,185
Oh, forgive me. Is it?

1096
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:45,313
You married very young,
without your parents' consent...

1097
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:47,566
...and yet when Carol...

1098
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:52,279
- Oh, but perhaps you regretted it.
- I did nothing of the kind.

1099
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,906
- Then why...?
- My marriage lasted a few weeks.

1100
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:58,827
My husband was in the army.
He was killed in action.

1101
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:01,830
Oh, I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
I didn't know.

1102
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:04,708
I never regretted it.
Not for one moment.

1103
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,627
We married because
we knew that might happen.

1104
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:11,631
But I don't want Carol to suffer
as I suffered.

1105
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:15,177
Don't you want her to be happy,
even for a little while...

1106
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:17,345
...the way you were?

1107
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:19,556
I was afraid you'd say that.

1108
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:22,684
Not that it matters what you say.
Or what I say, either.

1109
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,603
You know that, don't you?

1110
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,314
You mean, Carol will go her own way?

1111
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,816
She's my granddaughter.

1112
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,944
Well, then why?

1113
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,238
Goodness knows.

1114
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:37,657
I was beaten before I started.

1115
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:41,036
You don't mind terribly, do you?

1116
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,788
He is a nice boy.

1117
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,208
Yes.

1118
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,251
I see now where he gets it.

1119
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:49,753
You're pretty too.

1120
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,881
No wonder that wretched Ballard
named his rose after you.

1121
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:56,176
Not that he's got a chance
of getting the cup from me.

1122
01:31:56,344 --> 01:32:00,347
Well, so long as we're going
to be relatives...

1123
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,475
...the least you can do
is to offer me some tea.

1124
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:09,147
- Well?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1125
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,572
"So Alice sat on with closed eyes...

1126
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:20,408
...and half believed herself again
in Wonderland.

1127
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:22,744
With the grass rustling in the wind...

1128
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,789
...and the pool rippling
to the waving of the reeds...

1129
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:30,168
...the tinkling sheep bells,
the voice of the shepherd boy...

1130
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,255
...and the lowing of the cattle
in the distance.

1131
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:37,884
She pictured to herself how she would
keep through all her riper years...

1132
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:42,055
...the simple and loving heart
of her childhood...

1133
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,475
...and how she would gather
about her other little children...

1134
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:50,355
...and make their eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale.

1135
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:53,984
Perhaps even with a dream
of Wonderland. "

1136
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,073
- They're asleep.
Good.

1137
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,329
- What time is it, darling?
Ten to 10.

1138
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,460
Going to have your coffee now?

1139
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:16,923
No. I think I'll have a little smoke first.

1140
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,385
Anything you want from the house?

1141
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,178
No, I don't think so.

1142
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:25,807
I'm not going to risk my life
for your knitting needles again.

1143
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,268
No. I've got them with me.

1144
01:34:15,107 --> 01:34:17,525
Fine barrage tonight, isn't it?

1145
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,819
It gets better each time.

1146
01:34:24,867 --> 01:34:27,494
I can't hear any bombs, can you?

1147
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,329
No.

1148
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,582
I suppose they're saving them
for the aerodrome again.

1149
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:35,543
Yes.

1150
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:38,797
And the county hospital.

1151
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,677
Well.

1152
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,726
- My laundry come back?
Tomorrow.

1153
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,479
Tomorrow.

1154
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:57,941
Oh, no, you don't.

1155
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,996
You ought to patent that, Clem.

1156
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:14,582
It saves us from suffocating.

1157
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,335
- See this new idea?
- No. What is it?

1158
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:21,256
The latest in gas detectors.
If there's any gas, the gauze turns green.

1159
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,967
Does it stop the gas from coming in?

1160
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:26,428
If you see this gauze change color...

1161
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:29,139
...grab this, shut it with a bang
like that, see?

1162
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,600
- Then what happens?
- Then we suffocate.

1163
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:39,607
- Biscuit?
Ah, thank you.

1164
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:41,985
Mrs. Miniver's best.

1165
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:46,322
- Ada wasn't much good at coffee.
- She was awful.

1166
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:49,534
Still, she was a good cook,
as good cooks go.

1167
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:53,288
And as good cooks go,
she went.

1168
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:58,168
Still, Ada will be a tower of strength
in the tank corps canteen.

1169
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,511
Closer.

1170
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,975
I wonder what Toby would do
if he lost that cat.

1171
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:15,477
I daren't think.

1172
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,521
I suppose that's the way
to be really happy.

1173
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:20,815
Be with something
that you just can't live without.

1174
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:23,485
- Yeah.
- Or someone.

1175
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,962
Isn't that getting a little long?

1176
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,090
Vin says they like them long
in the air force.

1177
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:49,177
Isn't it nice they're getting back
for the flower show?

1178
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,678
Yes, isn't it?

1179
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:54,432
- Find out when their train arrives?
- 11:45, I think they said.

1180
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,351
Good.

1181
01:36:56,519 --> 01:37:00,271
I am glad they went to Scotland for
the honeymoon. It's so beautiful.

1182
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:02,023
Yeah.

1183
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:18,498
That's a bomb.

1184
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:22,126
They are going for the aerodrome again.

1185
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:28,466
- Have you finished with this, darling?
- Yes.

1186
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:31,344
It's a lovely story.

1187
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:35,348
I wonder if Lewis Carroll ever dreamed
it would live forever.

1188
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:38,935
- You know, it's the first story I read.
- Mine too.

1189
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:40,687
Really?

1190
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,609
"How she would keep
through all her riper years...

1191
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:49,946
...the simple and loving heart
of her childhood...

1192
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:59,163
...and how she would gather
about her little children...

1193
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:03,668
...and make their eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale. "

1194
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:12,594
"Perhaps even with the dream
of Wonderland of long ago.

1195
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:16,598
And how she would feel
with all her simple sorrows...

1196
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:20,518
...and find a pleasure
in all her simple joys...

1197
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:26,733
...remembering her own child life
and the happy summer days. "

1198
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,612
The happy summer days.

1199
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:03,705
Napoleon's all right, darling.
He's gone under there.

1200
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:45,371
Mommy?
- Yes, dear?

1201
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,833
They nearly killed us this time,
didn't they?

1202
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:52,086
It's all over, darling. It's all over now.

1203
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:19,739
Hello, Mother. Hello, Dad.
Hello, darling.

1204
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,616
How have you been?

1205
01:41:22,701 --> 01:41:24,118
We had a wonderful time.

1206
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,871
Good-looking bride you've got, boy.

1207
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,292
Hello, Mother!
Oh, my God.

1208
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,753
- Good to see you again.
- Wonderful.

1209
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,713
Carol, sweet.

1210
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:38,633
- Don't I get a kiss?
- Certainly do.

1211
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,302
- Did you enjoy yourselves?
- We had a lovely time.

1212
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,429
We fished and rowed and sailed.

1213
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:47,141
We had a lovely little cottage
and a Mrs. McLorry to cook for us.

1214
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:49,894
How she cooked, and how we ate.

1215
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:52,188
Can I help you, Dad?
No.

1216
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,691
Hello, Mr. Ballard.
How do you do?

1217
01:41:55,859 --> 01:41:59,529
Morning, Ballard. I see you've entered
your rose in the flower show.

1218
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:02,031
- It's a good rose.
- I haven't seen it yet.

1219
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,118
I wager the best thing about it
is its name.

1220
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:09,205
The Mrs. Miniver. That's you, my dear.

1221
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:13,501
- You're coming to the flower show?
- All except Clem.

1222
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,711
I'm afraid I can't. I'm on patrol duty.

1223
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:17,755
You're missing a lot. Local talent.

1224
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:20,174
Old Snope is playing his flute solo.

1225
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:22,718
- I'll be there early.
- All right. Goodbye, dear.

1226
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:24,220
Careful.

1227
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,020
How's it going, George?

1228
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:35,648
Fine, Mr. Miniver. Just fine.

1229
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,150
Let's go, Vin.

1230
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:45,700
- Well, here we are.
- Welcome home, such as it is.

1231
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:48,703
It's quite a mess.

1232
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:50,204
It must've been dreadful.

1233
01:42:50,372 --> 01:42:54,458
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. We just
didn't have time to clear it all up.

1234
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:57,420
The dining room there
got the worst of it.

1235
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,839
But I always did want
to do that room over.

1236
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,091
- The upstairs is quite all right.
- Yeah.

1237
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:06,512
Darling, we'll have to get some blankets
up there and black that place out.

1238
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:18,816
Toby, old boy.
- Vin!

1239
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:20,318
Vin.

1240
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:23,029
Hello, Toby.
- Carol.

1241
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:25,072
That was wonderful.

1242
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,074
Did you have a nice trip?
- It was fine.

1243
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:29,535
I've had the mumps.

1244
01:43:30,245 --> 01:43:32,288
Oh, this was a lovely surprise.

1245
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,416
All right, children, let Carol go now.
Come on, Vin.

1246
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,293
I'll take you up to your room.

1247
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:41,505
It's your old room, of course, Vin,
but we made a few changes.

1248
01:43:41,673 --> 01:43:44,300
Yeah, the Jerries made a few more.

1249
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,189
Thank your father too, darling.

1250
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:01,567
I'll do that right away
and bring up the rest of the luggage.

1251
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:07,615
Thanks for the lovely room.

1252
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:09,575
And thanks for Vin.

1253
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:11,285
He is nice, isn't he?

1254
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,579
I wonder if you know
how much I love him.

1255
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:17,208
I only have to look at you. And him.

1256
01:44:17,709 --> 01:44:19,835
Have you seen the view here?

1257
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:22,463
It's really beautiful.

1258
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:24,257
Oh, it is.

1259
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:27,551
- You're happy?
- Of course.

1260
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,681
I've had a lifetime of happiness
in these last two weeks.

1261
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:33,808
But, Carol, that's only the beginning.

1262
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:37,353
Kay, I'm not afraid to face the truth.

1263
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,273
- Are you?
- No.

1264
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,817
- I love him, but I know...
- Carol.

1265
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:44,986
I know that I may lose him.

1266
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:47,989
He's young and he loves life,
but he may die.

1267
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:49,532
Let me say it.

1268
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,619
He may be killed any day, any hour.

1269
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:56,872
You must have faced that in your mind.

1270
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,625
Yes, I've faced it.

1271
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:02,420
Then you know
that every moment is precious.

1272
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:05,631
We mustn't waste time in fear.

1273
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:08,259
You won't hate me
for saying this, will you?

1274
01:45:08,427 --> 01:45:10,136
No, Carol.

1275
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,555
I will be very happy.

1276
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:16,517
Every moment that I have him.
Every moment.

1277
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:23,024
If I must lose him,
there'll be time enough for tears.

1278
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:25,985
There'll be a lifetime for tears.

1279
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,070
That's right, isn't it?

1280
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:35,703
Well, that's the lot. All my wife's.

1281
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:39,790
Say, have you noticed her crested
dressing case? Swank, eh?

1282
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:43,002
- Have we time to unpack?
- Yes. We won't lunch till 1.

1283
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:47,006
I promised we'd be at the flower show
by 3. Can't miss the entertainment.

1284
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,383
The glee club has a new number.

1285
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:05,983
How glorious to sing on a midsummer's day
To fa la la la la la la la la lay

1286
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:09,779
With a down dilly dilly, down dilly dilly
Down dilly dilly down

1287
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:14,950
And a hey, nonny nonny, hey, nonny nonny
Hey, nonny nay

1288

And a fa la la la, hey, fa la la la

1289
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:23,834
Aah lay

1290
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:28,422
How glorious to sing
On a

1291
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:31,258
Midsummer's day

1292
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:41,560
How glorious it is on a midsummer's day
To fa la la la la la la la to lay

1293
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:45,022
A down dilly dilly, down dilly dilly
Down dilly dilly down

1294
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:50,569
And a hey, nonny nonny, hey, nonny nonny
Down in the hay

With a good fa la la la, hey, fa la la la lay

1296
01:46:56,410 --> 01:47:00,329
All day

1297
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:05,167
How glorious it is on a

1298
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:08,254
Midsummer's day

1299
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:21,016
A midsummer's day

1300
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:29,066
There will now be an interlude
by the Belham band.

1301
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:39,493
- Hello, Ballard. How are you?
- All right, thanks.

1302
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,246
- Good luck. The best of luck to you.
- Thank you.

1303
01:47:42,414 --> 01:47:45,541
- I hope you get it, Ballard.
- Thanks.

1304
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:56,719
- Bickles.
Yes, milady.

1305
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:01,682
Hurry that paper from the judges.
We want to get through with it.

1306
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:04,560
- The judges are still debating, milady.
- What?

1307
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,605
Whatever for?
Ridiculous creatures.

1308
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,191
Go and tell them
I want that decision at once.

1309
01:48:10,358 --> 01:48:12,276
Yes, milady.

1310
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:17,198
- Have you seen old Ballard's rose?
- No, I haven't.

1311
01:48:17,949 --> 01:48:19,283
That's a lie.

1312
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:21,702
I looked it over the moment it arrived.

1313
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,621
Well?

1314
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,831
It's a good rose.

1315
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:29,376
- Is it better than yours?
- That, young man, the judges will decide.

1316
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,253
You should worry. You'll get the cup.

1317
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:34,965
- You insinuating the judges are corrupt?
- They're scared of you.

1318
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:37,051
Oh, rubbish. Scared.

1319
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:44,350
The decision on the rose award, milady.

1320
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:01,825
Well, Mr. Vincent Miniver,
take a look at that.

1321
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,245
Congratulations. I'm not a bit surprised.

1322
01:49:04,412 --> 01:49:08,582
Set yourself up to know more than
the judges, eh? Misguided young man.

1323
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:10,960
Can't think what you see in him, Carol.

1324
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,338
- This is really important to you, isn't it?
- Yes.

1325
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:19,134
It's stupid of me, but there it is. I've won
that cup for as long as I can remember.

1326
01:49:19,302 --> 01:49:21,220
Mr. Ballard's terribly keen too.

1327
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,931
Well, he's had his chance. Hasn't he?

1328
01:49:29,437 --> 01:49:31,772
You have such a way
of looking at people.

1329
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:35,067
What do you expect me to do?
Reverse the judges' decision?

1330
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,319
I wouldn't put it past you.

1331
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:42,408
- If you happened to disagree with it.
- But I don't!

1332
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:47,121
Will your ladyship make the awards now?

1333
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:49,206
Certainly.

1334
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:05,931
This rose award,
it's your unprejudiced decision?

1335
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:08,183
Why, certainly, milady.

1336
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,102
Of course, milady.

1337
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,812
Won't you sit down?

1338
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,439
Sit down.

1339
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:19,653
My friends of Belham,
it is once again my pleasure...

1340
01:50:19,821 --> 01:50:24,408
...to present the annual awards for
the best flowers grown in our community.

1341
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:27,828
The first-prize chrysanthemums.

1342
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:31,624
First prize, Miss Alice Lovedean.

1343
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:41,342
Thank you.

1344
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:49,600
Second prize, Miss Sarah Pillbury.

1345
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:52,227
- Congratulations.
Thank you, milady.

1346
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:59,652
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I come to the final award.

1347
01:51:02,322 --> 01:51:06,659
The Challenge Cup,
given for the best rose...

1348
01:51:16,461 --> 01:51:19,380
The best rose grown in the village
during the past year.

1349
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:24,635
The first prize, the Silver Cup, goes to...

1350
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:36,271
Goes to Mr. James Ballard,
our popular stationmaster.

1351
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:07,761
The second prize,
the Certificate of Merit...

1352
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:09,430
...goes to me.

1353
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:31,869
All right. All right.

1354
01:52:34,038 --> 01:52:37,875
This is the first time a rose
other than the Beldon rose...

1355
01:52:38,042 --> 01:52:40,586
...has won the cup
since the show's began.

1356
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,796
I won't say I'm not disappointed.

1357
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:45,340
We Beldons are not used to competitors.

1358
01:52:45,508 --> 01:52:49,553
In the old days,
we just lopped off their heads.

1359
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:53,348
Can't do that nowadays,
more's the pity.

1360
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:56,059
But if I had to lose...

1361
01:52:56,227 --> 01:52:59,688
...there's no man I'd sooner lose to
than James Ballard...

1362
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:03,567
...because he's a man of spirit,
and I like a man of spirit.

1363
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:08,280
Where are you? Ballard!
Where's that man?

1364
01:53:12,577 --> 01:53:15,579
Here he is, milady! Here he is!

1365
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:32,763
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1366
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:36,642
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us

1367
01:53:37,268 --> 01:53:40,979
And so say all of us
And so say all of us

1368
01:53:41,147 --> 01:53:45,901
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1369
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:48,278
Oh, Mr. Ballard, I'm so happy for you.

1370
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:50,906
It's your rose, ma'am.

1371
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:07,089
- Excuse me, milady.
- Not now, Foley.

1372
01:54:08,299 --> 01:54:10,759
- Well, take it.
- Thank you, milady.

1373
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:14,596
- Congratulations.
- Pardon the liberty.

1374
01:54:16,808 --> 01:54:21,019
Milady, enemy planes over the coast,
hundreds of them.

1375
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,064
Like as not,
they'll go after the airfield again.

1376
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:33,907
Order. Order.
Silence!

1377
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:37,202
I'm sorry to disturb
the harmony of this occasion...

1378
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:40,956
...but our enemies are no respecters
of flower shows.

1379
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:45,043
Foley here says there's a chance
of air raiders passing this way.

1380
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:49,339
In the circumstances, it might be better
if you would return to your homes.

1381
01:54:49,507 --> 01:54:52,342
Those who prefer are welcome
to the use of my cellars.

1382
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:55,554
It'll be lively.
My young visitors will see to that.

1383
01:54:55,847 --> 01:54:58,891
And you won't starve.
Foley's seen to that.

1384
01:54:59,058 --> 01:55:03,979
I believe we have 300 tins
of Italian sardines.

1385
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,790
- Granny, you'll be all right?
- Of course.

1386
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:27,419
- You're not leaving me alone.
- You were wonderful. They loved you.

1387
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:30,964
- Vin needs to get back to the airfield.
- Yes, of course.

1388
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:36,845
- Give them a blast for me, will you?
- I shall certainly try.

1389
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,933
Wait. I still like to be kissed, you know.

1390
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,935
Of course.

1391
01:55:43,102 --> 01:55:46,521
- I say, you were wonderful.
- Yes, I was wonderful.

1392
01:55:46,689 --> 01:55:48,023
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1393
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:49,566
Goodbye, Carol.

1394
01:56:33,778 --> 01:56:36,029
Jerries over London in hundreds.

1395
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:38,740
I'll have to run. Goodbye, darling.

1396
01:56:38,908 --> 01:56:40,659
Goodbye, Mother.

1397
01:56:41,744 --> 01:56:43,328
Vin.

1398
01:56:46,749 --> 01:56:49,084
He'll be all right, Carol.

1399
01:57:15,653 --> 01:57:19,865
We must get on, Carol.
I'm anxious to get back to the children.

1400
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:49,186
Do you think the Foley girl
will take the children into the shelter?

1401
01:57:49,353 --> 01:57:51,855
Of course. Don't worry, Kay.

1402
01:58:04,368 --> 01:58:06,953
They seem to be fighting
right over our heads.

1403
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:10,373
I want so much to get home.

1404
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:15,420
I hate to stop,
but I suppose I'd better.

1405
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:19,276
It could be Vin. It could!

1406
01:59:19,443 --> 01:59:21,695
No, Carol, no. It's not possible.

1407
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,738
There hasn't been time.

1408
01:59:23,906 --> 01:59:25,615
Oh, no.

1409
01:59:25,783 --> 01:59:28,034
How horrible.

1410
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:43,341
Those were bullets.

1411
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:46,845
And I was sure they hit the car.
I really was frightened.

1412
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:48,346
Of all the...

1413
01:59:48,514 --> 01:59:50,432
Oh, Carol.

1414
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,601
The village.

1415
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:54,394
Oh, how awful.

1416
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,813
Oh, we must get back there.
They need help.

1417
01:59:56,981 --> 01:59:59,691
Carol. Carol, what is it?

1418
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,610
Carol.

1419
02:00:01,777 --> 02:00:03,862
Carol, are you hurt?

1420
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:08,992
Oh, darling.

1421
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:18,919
Carol.

1422
02:00:19,253 --> 02:00:22,797
God, I think I've been hit.

1423
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:25,675
Oh, no, darling.

1424
02:00:26,177 --> 02:00:30,680
- Where?
- I don't know. It doesn't hurt.

1425
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:33,266
I just can't move.

1426
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:41,775
Don't be frightened, we're nearly home.
I'll get you in and get help. Now, lie still.

1427
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:43,818
Yes, Kay.

1428
02:00:50,368 --> 02:00:52,202
Emergency.

1429
02:01:01,379 --> 02:01:03,046
Emergency?

1430
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:05,423
Ambulance, at once.

1431
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:07,425
All out?

1432
02:01:07,593 --> 02:01:09,135
But this is terribly urgent.

1433
02:01:10,137 --> 02:01:13,348
So is this, an air raid casualty
that's terribly...

1434
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:17,227
Well, the moment you get one in,
the first possible moment...

1435
02:01:17,395 --> 02:01:19,396
...send it to Starlings.

1436
02:01:19,563 --> 02:01:22,565
No, Starlings.

1437
02:01:22,858 --> 02:01:25,568
Yes, the last house in Norton Lane.

1438
02:01:26,445 --> 02:01:28,947
Yes, and hurry, please. Hurry.

1439
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:33,243
They're coming as soon as they can.

1440
02:01:33,411 --> 02:01:35,370
I'll get a coat, darling.

1441
02:01:49,719 --> 02:01:52,220
They'll be here any moment now.

1442
02:01:52,763 --> 02:01:55,932
- You won't tell Vin?
- Of course not, darling.

1443
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,518
Darling.

1444
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:05,984
You're going to be all right, Carol.
I know you are.

1445
02:02:06,444 --> 02:02:08,820
Don't be frightened, sweet.

1446
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:12,991
I'm going to be all right.

1447
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:17,579
I don't feel any pain.

1448
02:02:19,373 --> 02:02:22,709
What is it? Can I get you something?

1449
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:27,756
Glass of water.

1450
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:30,300
Of course, darling.

1451
02:02:30,885 --> 02:02:32,969
I'll be right back.

1452
02:02:55,326 --> 02:02:58,995
Carol.

1453
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:01,414
Carol!

1454
02:03:05,044 --> 02:03:06,920
Oh, God.

1455
02:03:07,088 --> 02:03:10,882
God.

1456
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,454
Vin, dear.

1457
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:13,296
It's all right, Mother. I know.

1458
02:05:15,216 --> 02:05:16,966
Where is she?

1459
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:21,095
Vin, dear, won't you try
and get a little rest?

1460
02:05:21,263 --> 02:05:23,056
Where is she?

1461
02:05:25,851 --> 02:05:27,894
In your room.

1462
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:43,636
Children of the heavenly king
As ye journey, sweetly sing

1463
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:52,562
Sing your savior's worthy praise,
Glorious in his works and ways

1464
02:06:55,316 --> 02:07:03,740
We are traveling home to God,
In the way the fathers trod

1465
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:12,999
They are happy now, and we
Soon their happiness shall see

1466
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:23,176
Fear not, brethren, joyful stand
On the borders of your land

1467
02:07:23,469 --> 02:07:32,310
Jesus Christ, your father's son,
Bids you undismayed go on

1468
02:07:33,103 --> 02:07:39,859
Amen

1469
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,921
I will read to you from Psalm 91.

1470
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:08,096
"I will say of the Lord,
He is my refuge and my fortress.

1471
02:08:08,263 --> 02:08:11,766
My God, in him will I trust.

1472
02:08:11,975 --> 02:08:14,977
Surely, he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...

1473
02:08:15,145 --> 02:08:17,605
...and from the noisome pestilence.

1474
02:08:18,065 --> 02:08:21,192
Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night.

1475
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,070
Nor for the arrow
that flieth by day.

1476
02:08:24,738 --> 02:08:27,824
Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.

1477
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:31,119
Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.

1478
02:08:32,329 --> 02:08:34,831
He shall cover thee
with his feathers...

1479
02:08:34,998 --> 02:08:38,251
...and under his wings
shalt thou trust.

1480
02:08:38,627 --> 02:08:43,506
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler. "

1481
02:08:52,808 --> 02:08:56,519
We in this quiet corner of England...

1482
02:08:57,354 --> 02:09:02,024
...have suffered the loss
of friends very dear to us.

1483
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,236
Some close to this church.

1484
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:11,367
George West, choirboy.

1485
02:09:13,412 --> 02:09:17,415
James Ballard,
stationmaster and bell-ringer...

1486
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:21,294
...and the proud winner,
only an hour before his death...

1487
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:26,507
...of the Beldon Cup
for his beautiful Miniver rose.

1488
02:09:28,635 --> 02:09:30,970
And our hearts go out in sympathy...

1489
02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:34,640
...for the two families who share
the cruel loss of a young girl...

1490
02:09:34,808 --> 02:09:38,895
...who was married at this altar
only two weeks ago.

1491
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:42,815
The homes of many of us
have been destroyed...

1492
02:09:42,983 --> 02:09:46,486
...and the lives of young
and old have been taken.

1493
02:09:46,653 --> 02:09:50,615
There's scarcely a household
that hasn't been struck to the heart.

1494
02:09:51,408 --> 02:09:53,242
And why?

1495
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:57,038
Surely you must have asked
yourselves this question.

1496
02:09:57,206 --> 02:10:00,082
Why, in all conscience...

1497
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:03,002
...should these be the ones to suffer?

1498
02:10:03,545 --> 02:10:07,423
Children, old people...

1499
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:11,427
...a young girl at the height
of her loveliness.

1500
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:14,514
Why these?
Are these our soldiers?

1501
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:16,307
Are these our fighters?

1502
02:10:17,434 --> 02:10:20,228
Why should they be sacrificed?

1503
02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:25,274
I shall tell you why.

1504
02:10:26,109 --> 02:10:31,072
Because this is not only a war
of soldiers in uniform...

1505
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,115
...it is a war of the people.

1506
02:10:33,283 --> 02:10:35,117
Of all the people.

1507
02:10:35,285 --> 02:10:38,955
And it must be fought
not only on the battlefield...

1508
02:10:39,122 --> 02:10:42,708
...but in the cities
and in the villages.

1509
02:10:42,876 --> 02:10:45,795
In the factories and on the farms.

1510
02:10:45,963 --> 02:10:49,257
In the home and in the heart...

1511
02:10:49,424 --> 02:10:53,511
...of every man, woman and child
who loves freedom.

1512
02:10:54,137 --> 02:10:58,057
Well, we have buried our dead...

1513
02:10:58,225 --> 02:11:00,059
...but we shall not forget them.

1514
02:11:00,227 --> 02:11:05,064
Instead, they will inspire us
with an unbreakable determination...

1515
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:08,317
...to free ourselves
and those who come after us...

1516
02:11:08,485 --> 02:11:12,822
...from the tyranny and terror
that threaten to strike us down.

1517
02:11:13,574 --> 02:11:16,033
This is the people's war.

1518
02:11:16,368 --> 02:11:18,828
It is our war.

1519
02:11:18,996 --> 02:11:21,372
We are the fighters.

1520
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:22,874
Fight it, then.

1521
02:11:23,041 --> 02:11:25,960
Fight it with all that is in us.

1522
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:28,921
And may God defend the right.

1523
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:55,364
Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war

1524
02:11:55,782 --> 02:12:05,166
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before

1525
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:14,425
Christ, the royal master
Leads against the foe

1526
02:12:15,218 --> 02:12:24,268
Forward into battle
See his banners go

1527
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:35,988
Onward, Christian soldiers
Marching as to war

1528
02:12:36,615 --> 02:12:46,791
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before
