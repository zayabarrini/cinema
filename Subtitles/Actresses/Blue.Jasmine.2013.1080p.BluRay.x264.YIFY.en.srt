1
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,341
There was no one like Hal.

2
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:34,147
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

3
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,845
"Blue Moon" was the song
that was playing.

4
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:37,547
- You know "Blue Moon?"
- Sure.

5
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,989
I still remember that.

6
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:45,228
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

7
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:49,266
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

8
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:53,030
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

9
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,065
Is that a joke?

10
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:59,609
The sex was always great. Well,
he was nine years older than me.

11
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:01,837
He'd already made
and lost a fortune.

12
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,075
But then he made it back, and more.
I mean, much more.

13
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:06,582
God, he was dynamic.

14
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,517
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking...

15
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,918
...not that I care
to get too graphic.

16
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,356
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

17
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,189
Cocktails, they call them.

18
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:19,991
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,428
I never trusted doctors.

20
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,263
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

21
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:26,301
I have never been
to San Francisco.

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,532
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

23
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:32,576
I'll be staying with my sister, Ginger.
She's divorced.

24
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:37,010
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. We're both adopted.

25
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:39,946
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

26
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:42,120
That's mine. The Vuitton.

27
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:45,222
My plan is to start
a new life out here.

28
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,052
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

29
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,459
Go West. Was it Horace Greeley
who said that? "Go West."

30
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:55,964
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

31
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,762
Oh, I'll call you, maybe for lunch.

32
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,303
I don't have your number.

33
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:06,340
- Who's that woman you were talking to?
- I was sitting next to her on the plane.

34
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:07,978
She was talking to herself.

35
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,842
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,075
But she couldn't stop babbling
about her life.

37
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,760
Where...?
Where am I exactly?

38
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:37,169
You said 305 South Van Ness.

39
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:46,379
- Can you wait, help me with my bags?
- Sure.

40
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:54,147
I don't know where she is.

41
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,587
She expected me.

42
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,722
The plane was on time.

43
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:07,702
- Yes, I'm...
- You all right?

44
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:11,864
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath...

45
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,978
...and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

46
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:18,842
Okay.

47
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:23,108
- Could I have some privacy?
- Sure, sure.

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,049
Hello, Ginger?

49
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,723
Yes, I'm here.
I'm right in front of the place.

50
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,052
It is 305?

51
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:34,924
Well, how long?

52
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:38,224
What?
Where is it?

53
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,927
No, no, I see it.
Okay. Oh, okay.

54
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:45,630
Just- Would you please hurry?
My sister left the keys in the bar.

55
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,776
- Can you wait?
- Sure!

56
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,060
Is that it?

57
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,368
Thank you.

58
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,272
Oh, thank you.

59
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:23,468
Have a great day, all right?
Bye-bye.

60
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:30,481
- So, what do you think?
- I love it.

61
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,620
The fireplaces work.
I don't like when they're for show.

62
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:36,620
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

63
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,692
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view...

64
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:42,455
- You wanted Fifth Avenue.
- Central Park. Superb.

65
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:44,392
Oh, this space is perfect.

66
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,294
We hardly have to do a thing.

67
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,833
- You shouldn't spoil me so.
- Well, why not?

68
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,630
Who else am I gonna spoil?
Did I tell you my news?

69
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,967
- What?
- Danny is gonna be living with us.

70
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,234
Oh, honey.
Oh, that's great news.

71
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,606
I worked it out with his mom,
her lawyers.

72
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:03,012
Oh, he'll be so much happier
when he's with us full-time.

73
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,215
Happy birthday, Danny.

74
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:11,623
Kids at school say we're really rich
and that you give money to charity.

75
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:14,659
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life...

76
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:17,592
...to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

77
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,494
Not everyone is as
lucky as we are.

78
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:21,826
- Domingo?
- Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,800
- Another bottle of the Margaux.
- Sure.

80
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,263
Excuse me.

81
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,840
- It would look perfect.
- Wouldn't wash me out?

82
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:30,772
No, not at all. Not the way he...

83
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:33,640
Oh, isn't he sweet?

84
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:37,249
This song was playing
when Hal and I first met.

85
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:41,513
- I fell in love with the name Jasmine.
- Oh, so romantic.

86
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,350
I changed it.

87
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:47,891
Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.

88
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,264
This song was playing
when we first met.

89
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:57,493
You know it? Yeah, we met
at a party at Martha's Vineyard.

90
00:06:58,004 --> 00:06:59,904
"Blue Moon."

91
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,865
Come on, boys.

92
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:07,170
Okay, let's go, Augie.
I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.

93
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,371
We helped Dad
move the furniture today.

94
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:12,278
Oh, really? That's your idea
of taking the boys?

95
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:15,386
Letting them help you lug
somebody's furniture upstairs?

96
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,556
- They loved it. Great exercise.
- Yeah?

97
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,520
- They-- We ate franks and beans.
- Yeah.

98
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:23,560
- Relax.
- Okay. Let's go, Johnny, come on.

99
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:26,560
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- What's the rush?

100
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,994
What's the rush, Ginger?
You got a date?

101
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,669
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,169
- It happens to be Jeanette, so...
- Jeanette?

103
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:36,239
Jasmine?
What is she doing in town?

104
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:39,172
She's living with me
till she gets back on her feet.

105
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,074
She's had a bad time. Yeah.

106
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:44,043
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

107
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,240
Now that she's broke,
she's moving in.

108
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:48,442
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

109
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:51,212
And it's none of your damn
business. She's family.

110
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:52,913
- She stole our money.
- Okay.

111
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:57,255
Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

112
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:01,558
For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

113
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,894
What the hell did she know
about finance?

114
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:07,902
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years...

115
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,939
...up to his ass in phony real
estate and bank fraud.

116
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:12,770
She knew nothing about it?

117
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:16,573
Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

118
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:19,774
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in...

119
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:23,113
- ... she just looked the other way.
- I don't think so, Augie.

120
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:28,621
You said it. You said to me,
"She's a phony and had to know."

121
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:32,056
Jasmine, your country house
is so beautiful.

122
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:32,789
See?

123
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,916
I'm sorry, but we need
an answer on this.

124
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,761
I told you, you change the
name of the corporation.

125
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,063
- Operate under Global Innovations.
- I don't know if we can.

126
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,603
I think we can, actually.

127
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,435
- Pay out of the accounts in Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam.

128
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:49,443
Whenever I hear them, they're one
step ahead of the Justice Department.

129
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:51,478
Just hope your
house is not bugged.

130
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:54,515
Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

131
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,743
I have no head for
that sort of thing.

132
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,321
- We transfer to the old corporation?
- We could. Perfectly legal.

133
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:04,790
- It would be a mistake under that name.
- Definitely get in trouble for that.

134
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,191
Just don't file a joint tax return.

135
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:11,093
Don't say that. I sign anything.
I'm very trusting.

136
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,632
Famous last words.

137
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,202
It's called looking the other way.

138
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,304
Jasmine.
Oh, my God.

139
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,478
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

140
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,113
Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.

141
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,510
- Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.
- It's okay.

142
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,015
- No, it's fine.
- Augie's day with the boys.

143
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,983
Well, no wonder you're late.

144
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,917
- Hello. Matthew, is it?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,684
Boys, say hello.
I told you about her, remember?

146
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,360
- Hi, I'm Jasmine.
- Shake hands. Okay, go play.

147
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:40,995
- They're big.
- I know.

148
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,324
- I'm getting it first.
- Quiet, you two.

149
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,161
- Well, they're loud.
- Stop running around.

150
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:49,133
Christ, this kid's got...
What the hell is it? ADD?

151
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,798
- Yeah. Your place is homey.
- Are you kidding me?

152
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,536
No, I mean, it"s got a very...
Well, it's casual charm.

153
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:00,442
God, knock it off, Jasmine.

154
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:05,149
I need to stay here
for a while. No, I do.

155
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,746
- I'm out of cash.
- Okay.

156
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,686
Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe...

157
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,885
...I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

158
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:17,190
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

159
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,060
And the lawyers.

160
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,895
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

161
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,697
I really get some bad thoughts
when I'm alone.

162
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:27,398
Well, you know, all I can say is,
you look great.

163
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,876
- Now who's lying?
- You do.

164
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,913
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious...

165
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,606
- ... about moving here.
- Yeah?

166
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:39,547
- I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
- Oh, well...

167
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:43,621
- Another drink? We're celebrating.
- Of course, yeah.

168
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,088
Oh, the flight was bumpy.

169
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:50,424
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

170
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:53,498
I mean, you'd think
first class, right?

171
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:55,559
You flew first class?

172
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,500
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

173
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:02,403
- Isn't first class a fortune?
- Yes, I was quite shocked.

174
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,546
- I thought you were tapped out.
- I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

175
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,943
I've run up some serious debts.

176
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,947
So how did you fly first class?

177
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:15,020
I don't know, Ginger.
I just did.

178
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,954
All I meant was, if you've got
no money, to go first class...

179
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,957
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

180
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:26,223
Would you stop staring
at my luggage?

181
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,594
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

182
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:32,471
- You told me you had to sell everything.
- Look, look, look.

183
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:36,472
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

184
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,043
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

185
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,078
God, I hate to tell
you about that.

186
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:46,548
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef...

187
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,745
...until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell...

188
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,550
...and then it seems
you can't give it away.

189
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,961
Kids, stop it, come on!

190
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:59,931
- Were you adopted?
- Yes.

191
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,964
We were both adopted.

192
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:05,831
Born to different moms and dads,
but raised by the same mom and dad.

193
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,665
Could you stop doing that
gun thing? Sorry.

194
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,934
- Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.
- Matthew.

195
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,271
Did you like the new mom and dad?

196
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,448
- Yes, of course...
- Aunt Jasmine did.

197
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,812
I ran away from home
as fast as my feet could carry me.

198
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,010
- How come?
- Well...

199
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,689
Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine
and not me.

200
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,983
- Oh, stop.
- How come?

201
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,525
- She had better genes.
- Don't tell them that.

202
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:33,186
- Well, am I lying?
- Dad said you're glad we lived far away.

203
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,167
What?

204
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:38,795
They're perfect for the dress
that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

205
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,537
What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

206
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:48,701
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I...
I just got a call from my sister, Ginger.

207
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:53,213
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

208
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:54,885
He is a piece of work.

209
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,679
I just... I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

210
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,255
- The one in San Francisco, the builder?
- Yeah.

211
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,154
Oh, no, he's a contractor.
I mean, he's... No, he's a handyman.

212
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,490
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

213
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,634
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

214
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:11,893
Okay, that happens.

215
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:15,128
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

216
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,776
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

217
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,678
- Hi.
- Oh, you made it.

218
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,906
- How lovely to see you.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

219
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,707
- Welcome.
- Hi. Thank you.

220
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:29,079
- Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
- Augie.

221
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,447
- This is Jeanette.
- Jasmine. I changed it.

222
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,248
- Jasmine.
- I'm finally getting to meet the sister.

223
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:38,360
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry
we couldn't make it to the wedding.

224
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,053
Just that Hal had some business
in Saint-Tropez.

225
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:43,256
- Couldn't get back in time.
- Know what?

226
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,903
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

227
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:49,595
- He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
- I know. Hey...

228
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:52,468
Hal! You remember Ginger.

229
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,074
- Oh, my gosh.
- How are you?

230
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:55,768
- How are you?
- This is Augie.

231
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:57,674
- Augie. How you doing?
- Awesome.

232
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,781
- Hell of a place you got.
- Thank you.

233
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,883
- Why don't you come through?
- Told you.

234
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,950
- Yvette, coffee?
- This is really...

235
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,313
Yeah, she's got taste.

236
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,489
It's like what you
see in the movies.

237
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:11,455
We have so much to catch up on.
Can't wait for you to show us New York.

238
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,686
Why don't you take
our car and driver?

239
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:17,127
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

240
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,080
No, no, I will definitely
make some time.

241
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,021
Oh, good.

242
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,299
Where are you staying?

243
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,999
Oh, well, we... We thought about
asking if we could stay with you...

244
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,645
...but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

245
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,712
- Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
- Yeah.

246
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,908
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

247
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,314
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, it's not necessary.

248
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,649
Please, you're our guests.
I insist.

249
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:45,293
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

250
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:48,830
- What? Tonight?
- Yeah.

251
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,623
We have dinner plans.

252
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,769
I don't think we can...
Something we can't get out of.

253
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,461
- I'm sorry.
- There'll be time.

254
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:59,970
We stashed the kids with Augie's
sister, we're here for a week.

255
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:02,006
- It's gonna be great.
- It is. Okay.

256
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,768
Well, we don't have
a lot of free time...

257
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,881
...but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

258
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,515
I mean, or Daniel. I mean...

259
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:12,515
- They'd get a kick out of that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

260
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:16,986
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

261
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,524
- I love how you're doing your hair.
- Oh, thanks.

262
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:26,996
You'll have to take me shopping.
You always could pick clothes.

263
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,364
And Augie's got
some exciting business news...

264
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,700
...he wants to talk to Hal about.

265
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:36,775
Don't worry, I don't need
to borrow money. We're flush.

266
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,173
- Yeah, - What kind of
work do you do, Augie?

267
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:42,713
Well, you know, I do, like,
repairs, furniture moving...

268
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,907
...but I got plans
to be my own boss.

269
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,814
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

270
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,421
Hey, could we have a tour?

271
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:53,888
Oh, yeah, of course.
Why don't you start in the kitchen?

272
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:57,188
- Is there a little girls' room?
- Just down the hall.

273
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,157
Five days.

274
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,063
I'll have to invite them
to my birthday party now.

275
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:07,069
- Where did she come up with him?
- I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

276
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:10,071
We've got to make sure
we make their stay extra nice.

277
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,302
My God, five days.

278
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,517
Look.

279
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,216
It's so beautiful.

280
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,413
Oh, but where would I wear
a Fendi bag?

281
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,819
Oh, go ahead.
It's my treat.

282
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,118
- No.
- Yeah.

283
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,056
Really?

284
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:33,357
Oh, my God.
I love it. Look.

285
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:34,760
Look.

286
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,765
- Take the other one off.
- No, I like this.

287
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:43,875
Boy, this is some
place you got here.

288
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:46,375
- I mean, this is unreal.
- It is.

289
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,342
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

290
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:49,947
I used to be a lifeguard.

291
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,777
Start your own construction company?
Great idea.

292
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,453
- We came into some money.
- Tell him how, Augie.

293
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,718
Well, the first 10, 12,000,
I really worked for.

294
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,555
Put away a little each week.

295
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,754
But he's not telling
you the big news.

296
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:08,058
- Why we're in New York.
- You tell them.

297
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,291
Okay, I will.

298
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:11,992
We always play the lottery...

299
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:15,434
...and we never even get two numbers.
Am I right?

300
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,130
But last week, we hit it.

301
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,240
We got 200,000 bucks.

302
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,810
Oh, that's fantastic.

303
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:24,072
- I thought I'd drop dead.
- That's great.

304
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:27,308
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

305
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,111
He was shaking when we won.

306
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:33,314
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell
her, this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

307
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,152
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:38,487
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

309
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:43,259
Well, if you like, I think Hal
could probably help you do better.

310
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:44,492
Yeah?

311
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,333
You know-- You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to-

312
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,637
Hey, come on. We don't know the first
thing about money, but he does.

313
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:57,211
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

314
00:17:57,448 --> 00:18:00,315
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

315
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,679
- There are ways.
- You see, Augie? You see?

316
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,549
Suppose I put you in a venture that
was low-risk, but very high-yield.

317
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,317
I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.
I'm talking about 20 percent.

318
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,189
- Profitable enough?
-20 percent?

319
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,193
He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

320
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,526
You mean,
not starting my own business.

321
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:21,034
No, we mean investing with Hal.

322
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:24,366
Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

323
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,009
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

324
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,302
Ginger.

325
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:31,379
Let them in on one of your-
The hotel deal or something.

326
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,812
It'd be great for them.
Make a killing.

327
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:37,054
- Pay attention, Augie.
- I'm paying attention.

328
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,146
You will make money for them,
won't you?

329
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,153
I make money, they make money.

330
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:44,155
God, they're hard work.

331
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,385
Tomorrow I'm taking the day off.

332
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:49,588
I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

333
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,561
I've got that luncheon to plan...

334
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,498
...the fundraiser
for the Central Park Conservancy.

335
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,865
I've rented them a
limo and a driver...

336
00:18:57,073 --> 00:19:00,600
...and I've suggested they go
to the South Street Seaport.

337
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:03,706
Can you imagine if they lived here?

338
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,073
Here, for doing your duty.

339
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,218
Happy birthday.

340
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:15,081
I'm giving it to you now so you can
wear it to your party tomorrow night.

341
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,085
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.

342
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:22,752
Not bad taste
for a philistine businessman, huh?

343
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,117
- I know, it's so extravagant.
- Oh, look at that.

344
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,850
He surprised me in the tub,
so to speak.

345
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,860
Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,
but it's nothing like Sardinia.

346
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,397
This year you are coming
to Palm Beach, no excuses.

347
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,198
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

348
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,839
- Who's that woman?
- Which?

349
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,531
- That one.
- Oh, Raylene.

350
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,836
She's a friend. I love Raylene.

351
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,706
We met in a yoga class.

352
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,677
- Isn't she pretty?
- Yeah.

353
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,645
She runs a modeling agency.

354
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,251
- How long have you known her?
- Few years. Why?

355
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,756
- And you trust her?
- Trust her?

356
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,425
Of course I trust her.
What kind of question is that?

357
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,322
She just seems so cozy all night
with your husband.

358
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,930
I wouldn't worry. Hal's not
the roving type, nor is Raylene.

359
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,657
- She's a very close friend.
- I don't know.

360
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,201
If it was my husband,
I'd keep an eye on him.

361
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,341
Goodness, you are a suspicious one.

362
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,237
- I'm just saying.
- Just relax.

363
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,435
I am relaxed.

364
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,742
You shouldn't drink so much, Augie.

365
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,386
Nobody wants to hear
those stupid Polish jokes, you know?

366
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,578
Oh, I had a drink?

367
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,847
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

368
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,960
Let me tell you, you were half in
the bag the entire night, okay?

369
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,288
Tell me about my drinking.

370
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,932
- Give me that.
- What's eating you?

371
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:20,694
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

372
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,702
- What?
- Would you tell your friend?

373
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,171
- I'm talking.
- Tell him what?

374
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:28,472
Are you listening to me?

375
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:33,173
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

376
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,749
- Would you tell him?
- Yeah.

377
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,046
- Bet your ass I'd tell him.
- But what if it causes trouble?

378
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,689
Or maybe a divorce?

379
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,985
If you don't say anything,
it could've been a passing thing.

380
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,889
He never knows and he lives on
happy with his wife.

381
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:49,794
You know, I would tell him,
because that's what a friend's for.

382
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,970
You gotta have his back.
That's why I'd tell him.

383
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,968
It's a tough call, Augie.
I don't know.

384
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:58,965
- Ginger?
- What?

385
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,643
What are we doing?
Are we playing charades?

386
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,312
I mean, come on.

387
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:05,981
- Did you see something?
- Yeah.

388
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:08,707
On the street, by accident.

389
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,912
I saw Hal kissing that brunette
who was at the party.

390
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:17,983
You saw Hal kiss Raylene? Raylene?

391
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:20,253
You know her name too?

392
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,292
My God, she gets around.

393
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:25,832
Oh, we were introduced. Come on,
you got nothing to worry about.

394
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:28,231
- Yeah.
- Nobody could ever take your place.

395
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:32,272
Yeah, believe me,
I wasn't thinking she'd look at you.

396
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,976
- Nobody would ever look at me, right?
- Right.

397
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:39,046
- You looked at me.
- Yeah, once. It was a mistake.

398
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,848
- All right, listen.
- What?

399
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:45,384
You think Hal's banging her?

400
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:48,149
When Jasmine don't wanna
know something...

401
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:51,326
...she's got a habit
of looking the other way.

402
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:54,758
Thank you for my present.
I got so many comments.

403
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:58,263
I think everyone enjoyed themselves
and that piano player was-

404
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,958
He was fantastic. I got his card.

405
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,197
What were you talking to Raylene
so intensely about?

406
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:09,309
Oh, her husband is thinking about
getting his own plane.

407
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:14,313
I was just weighing the pros and cons
for her of a Challenger versus a-

408
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:17,145
- Gulfstream?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,913
- She's so pretty.
- Yeah.

410
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:23,386
Bill's out of town for a couple weeks
and she'll be all alone.

411
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:27,789
I thought maybe we could take her out
to dinner or have her over here.

412
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:29,787
- Yeah.
- Great.

413
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:31,590
Sure.

414
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,736
- This is silly, Ginger.
- Why?

415
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,066
- It's Sunday.
- So?

416
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:43,436
It's his day off.
He wants to spend it alone with you.

417
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,441
He's alone with me plenty.

418
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,116
If I'm gonna marry Chili, you're
gonna meet him sooner than later.

419
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,181
I told him we'd show you the town.

420
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:55,447
- Well, he won't want your sister around.
- Will you stop it?

421
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:59,355
This city is so
beautifully European.

422
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,461
Have you ever been abroad?

423
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,186
- At all?
- No.

424
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:06,526
We used to sail
from Saint-Tropez to Cannes...

425
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:08,964
...and up the coast to Monaco.

426
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,597
- It reminds me of the Mediterranean.
- There's Chili.

427
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,636
- Which one?
- There.

428
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,740
- Who's that with him?
- I don't know.

429
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,904
- Chili.
- Hi.

430
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,943
- Hi, hey.
- You look beautiful.

431
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,082
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

432
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,113
- You smell good too.
- You're late.

433
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,344
- Eddie. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Ginger. Hi.

434
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:29,613
This is Jasmine.

435
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,915
- Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.
- This is Eddie.

436
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,286
- Nice to meet you. Eddie.
- I'm Jasmine.

437
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,155
- Hi.
- Ginger told me about you.

438
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:38,626
Oh, all good, I hope.

439
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:42,096
I gotta tell you, I was all set
to move in with your sister.

440
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:45,965
Then she tells me that we gotta
postpone because her sister's in town.

441
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:49,074
- He's joking.
- Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

442
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,470
It was an emergency.

443
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:52,741
- No.
- Things happen. Right, Eddie?

444
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:54,743
Could've happened to anybody.

445
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:57,507
Told me you never been here,
don't know anybody...

446
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,651
...so I brought along this
sad excuse for a blind date.

447
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:03,650
- Best he could do on short notice.
- He works with me.

448
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:05,151
I gotta get a beer.

449
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,655
- You want a beer?
- Can I buy you a drink?

450
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:11,021
- I have a drink, but thank you.
- I'm dropping dead of hunger.

451
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,322
This place has the best clams.

452
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,022
You like clams, Jasmine?

453
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:17,163
No, no, no. I'm not hungry.

454
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,662
What the hell are you drinking?
Let me see. What is this?

455
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:22,032
- Is it vodka?
- Martini.

456
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,432
This place has the best
clams in the city.

457
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,962
The best are at Manero's.

458
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:29,012
- You're nuts. They don't even compare.
- Who cares?

459
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:32,776
This place is good too. They're fresh.
That's the thing with clams.

460
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:35,977
You get a bad clam,
you'll wish you were never born.

461
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:39,520
- So, what do you do, Jasmine?
- I told you, she just got here.

462
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,555
- She's looking for a job.
- Yeah?

463
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:44,360
I know a dentist who's
looking for help.

464
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,621
- Oh, yeah?
- No, I'm actually thinking...

465
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,231
- ... of going back to school.
- School?

466
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,169
To study what?

467
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't know. I mean,
the biggest mistake I made...

468
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:01,039
...was leaving college in my last
year and not completing my education.

469
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,543
What would you be?

470
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,339
An anthropologist.

471
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,541
Really? Like digging up old fossils?

472
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,219
That's an archaeologist.

473
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:11,445
Ginger told me the whole story.

474
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,146
That must be terrible, right?

475
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,883
One minute you're on top
of the world, the next-

476
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,358
- Guy turns out to be a crook.
- Yeah.

477
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:20,963
Her husband, he owned racehorses.

478
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,757
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

479
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,992
Oh, yes, yes, for a year or two...

480
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,694
...Hal became quite obsessed
with thoroughbreds.

481
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:31,367
So, what are you gonna study
in college?

482
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:32,599
Let me guess.

483
00:27:33,343 --> 00:27:35,106
A nurse.

484
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,672
Is that how I impress you?

485
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:40,907
- A nurse?
- You got something against nurses?

486
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,485
- My sister's a nurse.
- Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.

487
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:47,851
They have extensive knowledge
of how the human body works.

488
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,119
- Careful what you accuse my sister of.
- Just saying, I know a few good nurses.

489
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,387
Chili, why don't you
change the subject?

490
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:57,431
You think you're being charming,
but you're not.

491
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,034
You always stare into
space like that?

492
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,906
I had a friend who
used to do that...

493
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:06,235
...but there was something wrong
with him. He was epileptic.

494
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,801
I'm not epileptic.

495
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:13,941
If you see the waitress,
I'd like another Stoli martini.

496
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,516
- What are you gonna study?
- Leave her alone.

497
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,950
- It's like the third time you asked.
- So? She hasn't answered.

498
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,284
I don't know, but I'll be sure
to keep you informed.

499
00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:27,895
- Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.

500
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:31,328
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

501
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,900
- What do you wanna do?
- Why don't we take her to see the sights?

502
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,938
Then back to my place. She likes vodka.
My buddy's just back from Russia.

503
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,610
- Brought me this incredible vodka.
- Great idea.

504
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:45,178
- You're gonna love my place.
- Yeah, let's go.

505
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,806
- Wait till you try this vodka.
- All right, man.

506
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,776
I wish my apartment had a garden.

507
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:22,609
- We didn't take her inside Alcatraz.
- Thank you.

508
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:26,811
- They got tours in there, Jasmine.
- Ginger said your ex-husband did time?

509
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:30,458
He'd still be doing time if he
didn't hang himself in his cell.

510
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:31,942
Really? Like with a belt?

511
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:34,380
Well, it had to be a belt.
Or a bedsheet.

512
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:36,028
- Could be a bedsheet.
- No.

513
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,599
He managed to get a piece of rope.

514
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:42,967
Plain rope.

515
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,161
You can get anything
if you got juice.

516
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,966
That's some way to go.
Strangle yourself to death?

517
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:50,643
No, it wasn't strangulation.

518
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:53,507
When you hang yourself,
your neck breaks.

519
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:56,615
I wouldn't feel sorry for him.
He hurt a lot of people.

520
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:59,843
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, including me and Augie and her.

521
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:03,217
A lot of people are under
the misapprehension you strangle...

522
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:06,257
- ... but your neck snaps.
- Okay, we got it.

523
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:08,761
He was a bad guy, you know?

524
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:11,521
He lived like a big shot
on other people's money.

525
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:15,131
- And he played around behind her back.
- No.

526
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,531
- Jasmine, go and start your cooldown.
- Oh, good.

527
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,940
- Hey, Jas.
- Yeah?

528
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:26,077
I know you don't wanna go
to the Yankee game tonight.

529
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,739
I'd go to any sporting event with you,
you know, but I just never got baseball.

530
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,216
- I thought I'd ask Melanie. She's a fan.
- Oh, sure. God, she'll be thrilled.

531
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,683
- Hey, Mel?
- Yeah?

532
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,518
- You like baseball, right?
- I love baseball. Why?

533
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:44,163
I got two season tickets behind
the Yankee dugout for tonight.

534
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:47,197
I don't have anybody else to go with me.
Are you free?

535
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,028
Absolutely, if you're sure
there's nobody else.

536
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:51,396
No.

537
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,732
- No, no, you'll do just fine.
- All right, thanks.

538
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,110
- This is where you live? Nice.
- Yeah.

539
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:02,542
- Hey, can you grab the groceries for me?
- Yeah.

540
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,788
- I can get this one.
- Get them.

541
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,287
- You got it? All right.
- I got it.

542
00:31:15,294 --> 00:31:17,387
- Oh, no.
- That's okay, don't worry.

543
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:20,121
- No more vodka for you.
- I didn't have any vodka.

544
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:22,596
- I didn't have no vodka.
- I know about you.

545
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,133
Hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

546
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:26,599
- Take it upstairs?
- Yes?

547
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:27,931
- Yeah.
- All right.

548
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,499
Eddie wants your phone number.

549
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:33,745
- Why?
- I think he wants to call you.

550
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:36,779
I think he wants to ask you out,
you know, for dinner.

551
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:40,577
- Look, I'm busy at the moment.
- He's a terrific guy. Look at him.

552
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,981
Well, why doesn't he ask me himself?

553
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:46,121
Because he's shy, you know?
He thinks he's short.

554
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:51,126
Look, I'm concentrating
on school, okay?

555
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,160
- And getting a job.
- That's perfect.

556
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:55,332
Right, he knows this dentist.

557
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,434
No, I have no interest
in being a receptionist.

558
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:00,968
What did you have in mind,
running a bank?

559
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:04,938
- Is this what you wanted to talk about?
- And how long you're planning...

560
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:06,479
...on staying with Ginger.

561
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:08,830
Oh, right. It's just
till I find my feet.

562
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,446
We have a lot of big plans.

563
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:13,481
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin
any of your big plans.

564
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,448
No one wants to get out of here
as fast as I do.

565
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:19,851
I'm sure this is a big comedown
from what you're used to.

566
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,618
It's fine.
It's- I'm grateful for her help.

567
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:25,762
So you don't want Eddie to call you?

568
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:29,398
No, I'm not ready to go out
at the moment.

569
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:33,363
Ginger said
you had a nervous breakdown.

570
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:38,167
She tends to be quite dramatic.

571
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,003
Said you were in the street,
talking to yourself.

572
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:47,713
You know, I don't think
that this is any of your business.

573
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:52,081
No, but since I'm marrying her,
we don't have any secrets between us.

574
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:00,087
- What did Chili want?
- Oh, nothing.

575
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,391
His retarded boyfriend wanted a date,
but he was too shy to ask.

576
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:08,332
- What do you think of Chili?
- He's very anxious to move in with you.

577
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:10,733
Yeah, I know.
He's got the hots for me.

578
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,430
Can I speak frankly?

579
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,403
- You hate him?
- Yeah.

580
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,101
I could tell you two
didn't hit it off.

581
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:20,747
He's another version of Augie.
He's a loser.

582
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,350
Hey, didn't I hear Eddie say he
knows a dentist looking for help?

583
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:28,182
Oh, forget it! Jesus,
it's too menial!

584
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,381
I'd go nuts.

585
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,894
I wanna go back to school.

586
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:39,966
I wanna get my degree and become,
you know, something substantial.

587
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:43,102
I can't just do some mindless job.

588
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:46,466
I was forced to take a job
selling shoes on Madison Avenue.

589
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,541
Oh, so humiliating.

590
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:53,442
Friends I'd had at dinner parties
at our apartment came in...

591
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:57,607
...and I waited on them. I mean,
do you have any idea what that's like?

592
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:01,481
You know, one minute,
you're hosting women...

593
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:05,749
...and the next, you're measuring
their shoe size and fitting them.

594
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,455
Erica Bishop came into the store.

595
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:12,622
She saw me
and was so embarrassed for me...

596
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:16,064
...she slipped out
thinking I didn't see her.

597
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,373
I saw you, Erica!

598
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,309
Are you okay?

599
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,972
Hey, you got great taste.

600
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:31,743
Maybe you could do something
in fashion.

601
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,386
Or designing. Yeah?

602
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,819
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

603
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:40,117
Everyone used to say
I'd make a good interior decorator.

604
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:44,120
There's courses,
but, you know, they cost money.

605
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:48,324
No, Eve Logan
got her decorator's license online.

606
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:50,526
On a computer?

607
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,135
I guess you could, but-

608
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,706
Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.

609
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,805
But I could take a
class in computers.

610
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:03,711
And then when I can handle a computer,
then I can study decorating online.

611
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,284
- That sounds too complicated.
- Why is your reaction always negative?

612
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:10,115
I'm just saying.

613
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,689
You know, first you gotta
learn computers...

614
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:15,520
...and then go for a decorator's
license online.

615
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:18,926
You're afraid I'll
stay here too long.

616
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:20,861
No, you know-

617
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:24,365
Just all those courses,
they cost money.

618
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:29,965
You'll work out here. It's mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight.

619
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,236
There's the follow-up cards,
which I explained...

620
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:36,175
...and the notices for cleanings.

621
00:35:36,682 --> 00:35:38,513
Any questions?

622
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:42,214
Tell Dr. Flicker it's an emergency.

623
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,753
- Come on, come on.
- Yes?

624
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:47,883
What?

625
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,061
Yes, a cancellation.

626
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:52,890
Oh, you want to cancel.

627
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:54,565
- When?
- Please.

628
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,498
Wait, wait, wait. You said the 24th.

629
00:35:58,704 --> 00:36:00,535
My husband has an abscess.

630
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:04,238
Can you just put someone on
who speaks better English?

631
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:09,037
The software interface
is what provides you, the user...

632
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:12,705
...the ability to control
the hardware, the computer.

633
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,578
Okay, that's the operating.

634
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:18,722
The operating system
gives you that ability.

635
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,891
I need an appointment in two weeks.

636
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:29,426
Is the 10th good for you?

637
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,603
The 10th. Yes, fine.

638
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:35,068
Oh, better make it the 12th.

639
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:38,436
- Oh, we're all booked on the 12th.
- Okay.

640
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:39,940
Make it the 14th.

641
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,442
- The 14th?
- Oh, no.

642
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,740
Is 3 good on the 9th?

643
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,917
Or noon on the 11 th?

644
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:51,145
Can you just settle on a time, please?
Just pick a time.

645
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,650
Remember the yoga class.

646
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,886
Deep breath.

647
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,822
Breathe deeply.

648
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,792
All right, deep breath.

649
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,934
If you take a deep breath,
you can smell the honeysuckle.

650
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:16,078
- Beautiful. Make a great perfume.
- It would.

651
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,805
- Your polo pony's in great shape.
- Thank you.

652
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,347
- No, I have never seen a polo match.
- Really?

653
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:25,954
My husband's a fanatic. Not to say
he's good at it, but it keeps him busy.

654
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,680
We got a flight to catch.

655
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:30,449
Hal's taking Danny to Augusta
for the Masters.

656
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:33,186
They're golf degenerates.
I'll be home alone.

657
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,091
- We'll be back in three days.
- Did we tell you?

658
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:38,665
- Danny was first in his class at Harvard.
- No.

659
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:40,062
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

660
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:41,759
- Thanks.
- He's a math genius.

661
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:45,429
He's the genius. Dad did a guest
lecture at the business school...

662
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,007
...and everyone said
it was the best lecture.

663
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,145
Naturally I became an instant
celebrity on campus.

664
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:54,145
Hey, I need your signature
on these, baby.

665
00:37:55,885 --> 00:38:00,515
Be careful. Don't get hit by a golf ball.
That's how Ray Becker died.

666
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:04,022
You know, a little blue bruise
on his temple.

667
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:17,536
What are you always studying
in your spare time?

668
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,333
Well, I'm trying to learn
to use a computer.

669
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,841
I wanna study interior
design online.

670
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,172
Oh, you wanna be a decorator?

671
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,508
Yeah, it's where my
strongest gifts are.

672
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,550
You know, I have a natural flair
for space and color...

673
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:34,551
...and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings.

674
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:38,988
It's very commendable, but I can't
really have you studying on work time...

675
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,560
...if it interferes
with the business at hand.

676
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:44,357
Yes. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

677
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:46,625
Please, see that it doesn't.

678
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:54,572
- I was gonna ask you a question.
- Yes?

679
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,271
Would you have a drink with me?

680
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,577
A drink?

681
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,015
I'd love it if you could.

682
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,282
Well, it would have
to be a quick one...

683
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:12,253
...because, you know,
I'm meeting my boyfriend for dinner.

684
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,223
I was just saying...

685
00:39:17,431 --> 00:39:21,060
...you can tell an awful lot about
people when you look in their mouths.

686
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:25,432
Are they conscientious?
Are they disciplined? Are they vain?

687
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:28,436
Or careless?
You have to know what to look for.

688
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:31,439
Do you have the time?
I have to keep an eye on it.

689
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:32,702
I've got homework.

690
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:37,907
This computer thing is proving a
little more difficult than I imagined.

691
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:42,714
It's funny, really, because I used to
be a straight-A student in college.

692
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:46,915
You know, but they say every year,
millions of brain cells just die off.

693
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,185
You have good teeth.

694
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,192
I'm sure you get
many compliments on them.

695
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,061
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

696
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:59,566
You know,
you're a very beautiful woman.

697
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,468
Are you serious with your boyfriend?

698
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:05,967
I don't mean to pry.

699
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:12,143
God, life is complicated.

700
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,646
Have you ever had any children?

701
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:17,948
How do you expect me to react
when my father is unmasked...

702
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:21,251
- ... as a common thief?
- You can't just drop out of Harvard.

703
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,624
No, it's too humiliating. I wanna
die when I see what he's done.

704
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:27,163
- How he lied, stole, ruined people.
- I know-

705
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:28,663
He is a sleazy criminal.

706
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:32,268
But if you drop out, you will be
throwing away your whole future.

707
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,031
You think I could ever face anybody
up at school?

708
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:37,537
My father, who I bragged
to everyone about?

709
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:40,745
The financial genius, generous,
the philanthropist?

710
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:43,176
He's such a phony.
He's a cheap crook.

711
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:45,849
His charitable contributions
with stolen money.

712
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:49,316
Well, just think how he feels.
He was arrested in the street.

713
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:52,115
- It's in all the papers.
- How can you look at him?

714
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,350
Did you not suspect anything
or did you not care?

715
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,757
- What does that mean?
- It didn't pay for you to ask questions.

716
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:02,491
Think I would have allowed him to
set up corporations under my name?

717
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,693
Sign accounts? This is no cake walk.
I could get indicted.

718
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:10,136
He's done nothing but lie over the years.
He is a con man and a hypocrite.

719
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,334
This is how you respond, by squandering
your life to get even with him?

720
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:17,047
Don't try to find me,
because you won't.

721
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:20,579
He's a fucking bum. Let's go.

722
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:23,184
Let's go, let's go.
Get out of the clinch.

723
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:25,218
- Hey. Hey.
- That's it, pop the jab.

724
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:28,220
Hey, guys, keep it down.
My sister's trying to study.

725
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:30,222
When can we stop tiptoeing around?

726
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:32,019
- Pop the jab.
- She'll hear you.

727
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:35,528
Well, I don't care.
I work hard all week. I wanna relax.

728
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:41,336
- Let's go, come on.
- Let's go. Work the body.

729
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,234
- The guy's just standing.
- Look.

730
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,807
And Bruno makes it easy, because
he just pushes himself forward.

731
00:41:47,011 --> 00:41:50,606
Her sister, she had millions.
Turned out she married a crook.

732
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,043
Look, where was she
when she was loaded...

733
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,741
...and you were tending bar,
waiting tables?

734
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:58,614
Now family's family?

735
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:01,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah, nice. You can see the money.

736
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,323
- I know.
- He's right.

737
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:06,427
Is it possible,
without ruining any of your fun...

738
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:08,597
...that you could
lower the TV a bit?

739
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:12,323
Hey, Jasmine, why don't you
stop working for a bit? Have a beer.

740
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,862
Believe me, I wish I could.

741
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:17,266
What kind of work are you doing?

742
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:21,773
I'm trying to work a computer...

743
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:24,242
...but it seems I have
no aptitude for it.

744
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:26,642
Hey, listen, I just-
I want you to know...

745
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:31,252
...it's great when a grown-up continues
with their education. Not for nothing.

746
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:37,120
Well, my goal is to
study interior decorating online.

747
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,356
Why don't you just go
to decorator school?

748
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:46,559
Well, I have to use my days to work
and pay my way.

749
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:49,896
As Hal said, "It's not the
money, it's the money."

750
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:53,871
Yeah, okay, but, you know, life
ain't all work and no play, right?

751
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:56,977
Ginger says between work and school,
you're cracking up.

752
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,272
- Hey, why don't you shut up?
- No, no.

753
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:02,644
I'll admit, it's been very trying...

754
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,444
...but I'm determined
to make something of myself.

755
00:43:05,654 --> 00:43:09,681
- You don't like working with the dentist?
- No, I do not.

756
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:12,826
Well, Ginger said
you're not used to working a job.

757
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:15,588
Well, in that respect,
I was very fortunate.

758
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:17,526
He was a handsome guy with money.

759
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:21,099
He was smooth talker and pampered her.
What's she gonna say, no?

760
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:23,995
I got it.

761
00:43:24,473 --> 00:43:28,704
Why does it have to be a decorator?
Why can't you pick something else?

762
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,767
What would you want me to do?

763
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,675
Do you want me to wait tables?
Bag groceries?

764
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,849
Hey, Ginger bags groceries.

765
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:41,112
Well, Ginger and I
are completely different people.

766
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:42,949
Yeah, she got the good genes.

767
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:46,854
It's not genetic. You can't always
blame everything on your genes.

768
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:49,689
If you're prepared to work hard
and not settle-

769
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,160
- What, you mean Augie?
- She means me.

770
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:57,493
Who do I have to sleep with around here to
get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?

771
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:05,038
That's what I...

772
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,537
What-? What-?
Oh, Christ, I can't remember.

773
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:13,947
So, Chili was telling me that you used
to have a really nice collection of cars.

774
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,644
Oh, yes, my husband did.

775
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:21,487
He used to collect vintage
Bentleys and Mercedes.

776
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:25,028
- Wow, those are expensive cars.
- Yes, they are.

777
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:28,826
You know, having wealth
is nothing to be ashamed of.

778
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:32,766
- We were very civic-minded.
- Yeah, with other people's money.

779
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,702
This guy lost every penny
of Ginger's money.

780
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:39,174
I tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing.

781
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:41,847
I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

782
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:45,575
You'll be very happy to know that I
lost every cent of my own money.

783
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,481
You know, every home,
every stick of furniture...

784
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:51,248
...every fur, every ring
and every bank account...

785
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:54,357
...and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

786
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,393
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week...

787
00:44:57,596 --> 00:45:00,471
...I knew he was hitting
on her girlfriend.

788
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,285
I really need to study.

789
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:04,935
- I need some peace, okay?
- Okay.

790
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,629
I'm not gonna make it if you turn
this place into a nightclub.

791
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,866
- I can't. I just can't.
- All right, all right, all right.

792
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:15,774
- Everybody out. The girl's got homework.
- What? Main event's not on yet.

793
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:17,504
- Out.
- I'm not leaving now.

794
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:20,150
You know,
she's right about you, Chili.

795
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,548
- You drink, you become a jerk.
- What about her? She's drink-

796
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:25,815
Jerk? Come here.

797
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,793
I'm sorry I don't drive a Bentley.

798
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:31,825
- Let's go to the bar.
- Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.

799
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,656
Good night.

800
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:36,298
- Jesus, it's a mess.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

801
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:41,301
Ginger, I'm really- I don't-
I don't know what came over me.

802
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:45,339
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

803
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,976
Yeah, I know these are not
your kind of guys.

804
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,841
I mean, God, don't you wanna meet
some decent man?

805
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,846
You know, someone
who can take you out of this-

806
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,553
What? This hole?

807
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,915
Yeah, I know what you
think of it here.

808
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,455
I mean, you've got two kids.

809
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,753
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

810
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,058
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

811
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,065
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

812
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:17,799
Okay, okay. Do you always have to
make those stupid sarcastic digs?

813
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,136
I'm scared, Hal.

814
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:24,711
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global Innovations...

815
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,941
...is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

816
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,211
- Howard Trask is such a pussy.
- No, no-

817
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:35,288
- What do you think I have lawyers for?
- He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

818
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:39,189
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

819
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,695
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

820
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:46,528
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

821
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:50,035
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

822
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,004
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

823
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,700
Is there?

824
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:56,305
No.

825
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,539
So stop worrying and
let me spoil you.

826
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:03,048
No, I agree. I mean, Howard
always was a prissy mama's boy.

827
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,689
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

828
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:11,819
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

829
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:14,723
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

830
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,422
All right, 2, 3?

831
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:22,228
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21 st?

832
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:25,271
- We have nothing open on the 21 st.
- Good night.

833
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,031
Well, he wants me in a week.

834
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:30,235
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

835
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:32,175
- Fine. Oh, wait, no.
- Go for 9?

836
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:34,645
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

837
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,408
That's always very special.

838
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:39,416
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

839
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:47,555
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback...

840
00:47:47,762 --> 00:47:50,697
...and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

841
00:47:50,899 --> 00:47:52,958
- Sure.
- No, no, no.

842
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:55,066
When you're done, when you're done.

843
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,262
When you're finished. Thank you.

844
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:04,602
Are you feeling more comfortable
in the job?

845
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:09,442
I hope you're pleased, because I
am determined to make it work.

846
00:48:09,684 --> 00:48:13,882
- It fits in perfectly with my class.
- Are you getting better on the computer?

847
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:19,048
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student
there, but another girl helps me, so...

848
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,128
I'm glad you're relaxing more
into this job.

849
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:27,893
- I'm trying.
- I must say, I like having you around.

850
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:30,468
- Thank you.
- Since you started working here...

851
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:33,832
...have you noticed I've been
wearing more colorful neckties?

852
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:38,141
- I-
- Since you- I'm just- Just joking.

853
00:48:38,345 --> 00:48:41,576
Can I-? Can I make a confession?

854
00:48:41,848 --> 00:48:46,148
I don't know that I should be the one
to hear a confession, doctor.

855
00:48:46,353 --> 00:48:47,843
Well...

856
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:52,986
The way you dress...

857
00:48:53,293 --> 00:48:56,854
...I sometimes find very...

858
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:59,031
...arousing.

859
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:03,464
Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

860
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,369
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I find you attractive?

861
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:11,222
Dr. Flicker, where is
all this talk leading?

862
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:13,269
Well, I'm not
the kind of person...

863
00:49:13,547 --> 00:49:17,846
...who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

864
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,542
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

865
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:25,450
A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

866
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:28,388
- I shouldn't be hearing this.
- No, don't be upset.

867
00:49:28,627 --> 00:49:31,755
- I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
- Don't be upset.

868
00:49:31,964 --> 00:49:36,162
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

869
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:37,393
I'm not in a shell.

870
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:39,763
- Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
- No.

871
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:43,135
- It would remove your inhibitions.
- I don't have inhibitions.

872
00:49:43,342 --> 00:49:44,400
- Stop.
- Dr. Flicker.

873
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:47,009
- Stop being standoffish.
- I'm not standoffish.

874
00:49:47,213 --> 00:49:49,773
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

875
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:51,506
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

876
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:54,345
This is so embarrassing.

877
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,285
I am never coming back here.

878
00:49:58,491 --> 00:50:02,221
I don't have to put myself
through this nonsense.

879
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:04,793
I gotta take a deep breath.

880
00:50:04,996 --> 00:50:07,829
Oh, now look what you've done.
I can't breathe.

881
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:10,194
Oh, God, I can't breathe.

882
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:18,065
I don't blame you for
being shaken up.

883
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:22,177
I'd have that dentist reported.
If I told my boyfriend that story...

884
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,043
...he would go to the guy's office
and break every bone in his body.

885
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:28,344
You can sue him. That's harassment.

886
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:31,078
No, I'm never going
into another courtroom.

887
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:32,550
I don't blame you.

888
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:36,352
My boyfriend's a lawyer.
He's got court stories.

889
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:39,962
- Sharon, do you know any men?
- Men?

890
00:50:41,232 --> 00:50:43,392
Men that would be good for me.

891
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,468
I just moved here,
so I don't really know anybody.

892
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:51,902
If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,
you can't fall in love anywhere.

893
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:53,940
Someone substantial.

894
00:50:54,144 --> 00:50:57,875
Well, what are you doing
Sunday afternoon?

895
00:50:58,082 --> 00:50:59,140
Not very much.

896
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:01,613
Tony and I are going to a party.
Come with.

897
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:05,549
Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready
for a big crowd of strangers.

898
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:07,451
Oh, come on.

899
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:11,719
It's a big bash someone's having.
There'll be all kinds of people.

900
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:14,090
Make an effort,
otherwise nothing happens.

901
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:16,140
Then you blame
everything but yourself.

902
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:19,817
No, I want to. It's
not that I don't want to.

903
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:22,904
- Can I bring my sister?
- For moral support? Absolutely.

904
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:24,734
And Tony and I will be there.

905
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:27,466
You'll have fun. It's a huge party.

906
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:29,645
Maybe you'll get lucky.

907
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,779
But you have to come,
otherwise I'm not going.

908
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:37,111
- What the hell would I wear?
- Oh, we'll find you something.

909
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,517
Oh, God, I haven't shown my face
socially in so long.

910
00:51:40,756 --> 00:51:43,691
Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

911
00:51:43,993 --> 00:51:47,429
I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

912
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:52,033
- Well, you know what I say to Chili.
- It's hard to meet a man you can trust.

913
00:51:52,702 --> 00:51:54,192
Hal.

914
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,838
Hey, Nat.
What are you doing out here?

915
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,668
I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

916
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,344
Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

917
00:52:03,546 --> 00:52:04,604
- Jasmine.
- Hello.

918
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:09,012
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.

919
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:11,811
She's brilliant.
We couldn't have done any better.

920
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,853
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

921
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:17,115
- Free on Tuesday?
- I'll make sure I am.

922
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,417
That's great.

923
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,420
Are you having an affair with Amy?

924
00:52:22,063 --> 00:52:26,363
- Amy, my lawyer?
- Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

925
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:28,798
Of course not.
What makes you think that?

926
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:31,700
- Someone made a remark.
- What remark?

927
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,307
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

928
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,035
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

929
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:40,976
- That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
- Were you?

930
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:43,947
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

931
00:52:44,152 --> 00:52:46,245
- Lydia was there.
- Did you take her hand?

932
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:50,549
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

933
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:53,319
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

934
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:54,755
Maybe you were high.

935
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:58,226
- It's obvious she's got crush on you.
- You're building a case.

936
00:52:58,465 --> 00:53:01,332
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

937
00:53:01,535 --> 00:53:04,060
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

938
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:07,468
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

939
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,973
You know, I understand
other women have a-

940
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:14,614
Find you attractive, but it's
their hard luck. I have you.

941
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:17,373
- Yes, you do.
- No.

942
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:19,719
So you're not?

943
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,582
No, I'm not.

944
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:26,750
Good.

945
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:29,090
Let's make love.

946
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:42,134
You know, if you were having an
affair, I'd be pretty upset.

947
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:46,205
Pretty darn angry. I don't wanna be
made a fool of, you know?

948
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:49,643
- You hear me, Hal?
- Excuse me. Are you talking to me?

949
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:51,406
- Hey, Jasmine.
- What?

950
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:53,279
Hi.

951
00:53:53,786 --> 00:53:56,619
- How are you? I'm so glad you came.
- You must be Tony.

952
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:59,121
- Yes, this is Tony.
- A pleasure to meet you.

953
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:01,953
- What do you think? Nice party, right?
- Beautiful.

954
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:04,061
It's kind of a mixed bag.

955
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,629
Did you bring your sister?

956
00:54:05,832 --> 00:54:08,266
Oh, yes, she's dancing.

957
00:54:10,136 --> 00:54:12,900
- Hey, my name's Al, incidentally.
- Ginger.

958
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:14,596
- Ginger?
- Yeah.

959
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:17,071
Ginger, you dance great.

960
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:19,745
- I never get a chance to, and I love it.
- Yeah?

961
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:21,742
I do, yeah.

962
00:54:21,947 --> 00:54:23,972
You know Sally, the host?

963
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:26,650
- No, my sister brought me.
- Yeah?

964
00:54:26,852 --> 00:54:31,312
Wherever the hell she is. I don't-
I don't know where she is.

965
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:33,786
But you're from San Francisco?

966
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:35,186
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

967
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:37,361
- What about you?
- Marin.

968
00:54:37,596 --> 00:54:39,120
- Okay.
- Yeah.

969
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,855
Great.

970
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:42,458
What do you do, Al?

971
00:54:42,668 --> 00:54:46,331
I'm a sound engineer.
I put in people's systems, you know?

972
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:48,436
- I did Mr. Lockman's.
- Okay.

973
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,666
He's the husband of the host,
in case you were wondering.

974
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:54,607
I do concerts and private...

975
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:57,681
- Great.
- I like slow dancing better, don't you?

976
00:54:57,883 --> 00:54:59,680
- Yeah.
- It's more romantic, right?

977
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:01,716
- It is, yeah.
- Yeah.

978
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:03,580
It is.

979
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:06,579
Hey, you're really pretty.

980
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:11,183
- Yeah, you are. You are.
- Really? Really?

981
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,604
I'd rather be someplace else too.

982
00:55:27,044 --> 00:55:29,535
- Do I look that uncomfortable?
- Almost.

983
00:55:30,915 --> 00:55:33,850
- I'm Dwight Westlake.
- Jasmine French.

984
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,611
Jasmine French,
that's a very exotic name.

985
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:40,917
Well, my parents named me
after my mother's favorite flower.

986
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:43,418
Night-blooming jasmine.

987
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:46,255
Come to life after it gets dark.

988
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,862
That's the best offer
I've had today.

989
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:51,556
I didn't say it was an offer.

990
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:55,932
I saw you in the other room before,
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

991
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:58,737
Well, hope I don't
shatter your illusion.

992
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:01,410
- You have great style.
- Do I?

993
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:04,943
Chanel belt, Hermès bag
and Vivier shoes.

994
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:08,412
Vivier- Oh, my goodness.
Do you work in the fashion industry?

995
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:12,052
No, but my former wife was.
She worked at a fashion magazine.

996
00:56:12,255 --> 00:56:14,382
- Right.
- She passed away last year.

997
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:16,886
Oh, I'm sorry.

998
00:56:17,093 --> 00:56:21,052
- I'm so- And what do you do?
- Nothing as glamorous as fashion.

999
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:24,722
- I work in the State Department.
- Well, no, that's glamorous.

1000
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,231
In the diplomatic corps.

1001
00:56:26,436 --> 00:56:29,030
- Don't tell me you're an ambassador.
- No, hardly.

1002
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:31,104
But I wouldn't turn it down.

1003
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,103
We knew the ambassador to Mexico.

1004
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:34,798
My husband did.

1005
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,244
Your husband? You have a husband?

1006
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,877
No, no. Sadly, like your wife,
he passed away.

1007
00:56:42,084 --> 00:56:46,783
But, you know, we stayed overnight
in the embassy in Mexico once.

1008
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:48,786
- I work in Europe. Vienna.
- Really?

1009
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:50,788
- Oh, I love Vienna.
- Oh, yeah?

1010
00:56:50,993 --> 00:56:52,620
We were there once, Hal and I.

1011
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:56,286
I remember it as being two weeks
of young wine and chocolate cake.

1012
00:56:56,498 --> 00:57:00,457
Lovely. My ambition is to come back
after a few years and enter politics.

1013
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:02,800
I'd like to run for
office in California.

1014
00:57:02,826 --> 00:57:03,924
Oh, how exciting.

1015
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:08,941
Yeah, it might just be an inflated ego,
but I think I'd make a good congressman.

1016
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:13,080
I grew up in San Francisco.
I know California. I like challenges.

1017
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:14,306
You from out here?

1018
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:17,582
New York. Park Avenue.

1019
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:19,810
You know, when my husband
passed away...

1020
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,148
...I mean, naturally
I was very upset...

1021
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:27,020
...so I decided to come out here
and start a new life for myself.

1022
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:29,494
What did he do?

1023
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,465
He was a surgeon.

1024
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:39,835
God, that must be
incredibly stressful.

1025
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:44,634
No, I mean, he had a heart attack.
I'm sure that's what gave it to him.

1026
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:46,745
You have children?

1027
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:52,445
No, no.
No, there really wasn't time.

1028
00:57:52,653 --> 00:57:56,521
And what about you? What do you do?
I guessed you were in the arts.

1029
00:57:56,757 --> 00:57:59,351
- Am I right?
- Well, you're close.

1030
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,857
I am an interior designer.

1031
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:04,020
I really have hit the jackpot.

1032
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:06,357
- Really?
- I meet this exotic creature...

1033
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,330
...not only is she charming
and elegant and single...

1034
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:11,697
- ... but I just bought a new house.
- Really?

1035
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,032
One I've been looking at.
It's in Marin.

1036
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:16,834
- Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.
- Beautiful.

1037
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:20,376
I meet this woman, and she turns
out to be an interior designer.

1038
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,912
Written in the stars.
You have to look at it.

1039
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:25,709
- I would love to.
- Maybe you can help me with it.

1040
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,409
Absolutely.

1041
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,549
I never slept with anyone
the first night before, you know?

1042
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,419
- Yeah, that-
- But dancing with you...

1043
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:37,357
...got me all hot and bothered,
so, you know...

1044
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:38,861
Well, you were so sexy.

1045
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:42,557
I mean, I knew right away
that you were gonna be good in bed.

1046
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:43,893
- I knew it.
- Did you?

1047
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,900
I said to myself, you know...

1048
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,097
You know, I thought for sure
we were gonna get caught.

1049
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:51,241
I didn't care. I mean, I-

1050
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:55,607
I couldn't wait. There's no way I was-
I had to have you right then and there.

1051
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:57,338
You know...

1052
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,711
- You know what clinched it for me?
- What?

1053
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,716
Because you were so smooth.

1054
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:04,822
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1055
00:59:05,424 --> 00:59:08,757
- Well, that's- I just-
- But, you know, I-

1056
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:12,419
I don't want you to think I'm
just easy, because I'm not.

1057
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:15,623
No, I- You know what I think?
You're a fun-loving person.

1058
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:17,096
- I am.
- That's- Yeah.

1059
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:18,826
- Yeah.
- And that's what I am.

1060
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,471
- I can see that.
- That's-

1061
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:22,435
- I'm easygoing by nature.
- Yeah.

1062
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:25,371
That's what I-
I bring music to people's lives.

1063
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:27,636
You're very sweet, you know?

1064
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:30,780
I never had a sweet guy before.

1065
00:59:31,249 --> 00:59:32,273
- I hope I-
- Never.

1066
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:35,577
I hope I didn't get you in trouble
with your boyfriend.

1067
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:39,120
No. You know, it's not like
we're engaged, so...

1068
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:43,157
- You know, I'm free. I'm free.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1069
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:45,990
Oh, God, I'd better get back.

1070
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,720
My lunch hour's almost over.

1071
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:50,298
But we- You know what?
We have time, though.

1072
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:52,799
- For what?
- Let's go in the back seat.

1073
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,437
- Again?
- Yeah, come on.

1074
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,504
- Jesus, what are you?
- It's just...

1075
00:59:56,741 --> 01:00:00,074
- Are you one of those sex addicts?
- I am for you. Come on.

1076
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:02,007
- Are you? I thought so.
- One more.

1077
01:00:02,246 --> 01:00:03,975
Nobody's around. Not many people.

1078
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:08,152
- We gotta make this quick.
- I got tinted windows. It's perfect.

1079
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:20,656
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty.

1080
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:24,464
- My turn. It's my turn!
- God, he told me he'd call me yesterday.

1081
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:25,828
I wanna play with it!

1082
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:29,164
Can't you two stop fighting
for a second?

1083
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:32,398
- I've got a throbbing headache.
- You gave him both here...

1084
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:35,772
- ... and your cell number?
- Of course I gave him both numbers.

1085
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:38,345
Unless he's been delayed
in Washington.

1086
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:42,314
- Still, he could have phoned.
- Don't think he figured you were lying...

1087
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:45,818
- ... and bailed out?
- Look, could you stop saying I was lying?

1088
01:00:46,023 --> 01:00:50,289
God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few
facts, omitted a few unpleasant details...

1089
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:53,657
...but in the main, I mean,
my feelings, my ideas, my humor-

1090
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,991
I mean, isn't that who I am? Christ.

1091
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,726
People reinvent themselves, don't they?
Do I have your permission?

1092
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:03,495
You better take more of those pills.
You're shot.

1093
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,697
Oh, Jesus. Would you please-?

1094
01:01:05,941 --> 01:01:11,504
Matthew, turn off that pounding.
Please, Matthew.

1095
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,148
Can't stand it.

1096
01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:17,209
- Hey.
- Hey.

1097
01:01:17,453 --> 01:01:19,978
- Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?
- Who says?

1098
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:23,181
I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.

1099
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:25,724
- So?
- So you were dancing with a guy.

1100
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:29,362
- So what?
- I asked her to come with me, okay?

1101
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:32,898
I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1102
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:35,764
Is that so? So the two of you
were in the corner...

1103
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:38,098
- ... playing kissy-face.
- Give me a break.

1104
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,672
We couldn't go to the ballpark
because you weren't feeling good.

1105
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:45,277
Hey, don't treat me like property.
I had a headache when you called.

1106
01:01:45,513 --> 01:01:48,414
And then I decided to keep my
sister company at a party.

1107
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:49,742
I don't buy that.

1108
01:01:49,984 --> 01:01:52,077
Since when am I taking orders
from you?

1109
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,221
Can you please not fight in here?

1110
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:58,188
I don't think I can take it. For some
reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.

1111
01:01:58,393 --> 01:02:00,554
Who's this guy
you're fooling around with?

1112
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:04,027
I told you, I didn't like you
rushing me into anything, okay?

1113
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:06,792
- Is seeing other guys her idea?
- No, it's my idea.

1114
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:10,869
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a
bum like your first husband, right?

1115
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:12,937
- You told me.
- Guys, give me a break.

1116
01:02:13,141 --> 01:02:16,235
- By all rights, I should be living here.
- What do you mean?

1117
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:18,503
Didn't you want a guy here
for the kids?

1118
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:21,614
- So they grow up with a father?
- I need to clear my head.

1119
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:25,581
We're talking about getting married.
Now she's taking you to parties...

1120
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:28,254
...and telling you
I'm not good enough for you.

1121
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:30,580
- If I catch you...
- Give her some space.

1122
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,452
- ... with somebody else-
- Get out!

1123
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:35,924
You keep out of this, okay?
It's got nothing to do with you.

1124
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,759
You beat it, Chili. You've been drinking.
Hey, maybe that's for you.

1125
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:43,801
Ginger, she's not somebody
you can count on. I am.

1126
01:02:44,037 --> 01:02:47,837
Don't pick it up. I don't want him to
think I'm waiting for him to call.

1127
01:02:48,075 --> 01:02:49,906
- What the hell's going on?
- It's Al.

1128
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,476
- Hey, give me that.
- That's the guy, Al.

1129
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:54,899
Hi. Yeah, but you're
calling at a- Get off!

1130
01:02:54,925 --> 01:02:55,832
Give me that.

1131
01:02:56,049 --> 01:02:59,541
You call here again, I'm gonna
bust you in your fat fucking face!

1132
01:02:59,753 --> 01:03:03,746
- Hello. No! No!
- Give me that. Give me that.

1133
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,619
Look what you did,
you drunken asshole!

1134
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:12,297
You were right,
he's no better than Augie!

1135
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:15,058
- Don't drag her to parties to meet men.
- Get out!

1136
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:18,362
I didn't drag her out to meet men,
but if she has a brain...

1137
01:03:18,604 --> 01:03:22,438
...she'll dump you in the garbage and
find someone she deserves for once.

1138
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:24,439
- When are you moving out?
- Get out!

1139
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:28,512
I'm sorry I don't come from Park Avenue,
but I don't steal people's money.

1140
01:03:28,714 --> 01:03:32,946
- I am not some lying jailbird.
- Get out or I'll call the cops, okay?

1141
01:03:33,152 --> 01:03:35,518
She doesn't care about you.
She's a phony.

1142
01:03:35,721 --> 01:03:37,712
- She didn't care about you...
- Get out!

1143
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:40,187
- ... until she fucking needed you!
- Get out!

1144
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:55,238
- That's my cell phone.
- Okay.

1145
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:02,107
Where is it?
Oh, God, the kids were playing with it.

1146
01:04:02,314 --> 01:04:05,647
Oh, where is my goddamned
cell phone?

1147
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:09,753
Hello? Dwight?

1148
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:14,152
Yes, can you just hang on a moment?
I'm just in the middle of something.

1149
01:04:18,697 --> 01:04:21,165
Hello, how are you?

1150
01:04:21,366 --> 01:04:24,631
No, no, no, it's just some business
I had to attend to.

1151
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:29,934
Oh, no, no. No, that's fine.

1152
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:33,904
I know how hectic things can get
in the nation's capital.

1153
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:39,138
When?

1154
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:46,710
Well, I'm actually
meeting a client...

1155
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,635
for a drink in the Fairmont...

1156
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,887
...so why don't you pick me up
in the lounge?

1157
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:54,695
Great.

1158
01:04:54,899 --> 01:04:57,197
No, no, no, 3 is perfect.

1159
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:59,301
Okay, bye-bye.

1160
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,729
I'd like to make this
wall a little higher.

1161
01:05:11,755 --> 01:05:13,134
Oh, well, it's lovely.

1162
01:05:13,317 --> 01:05:14,807
I knew you'd like it.

1163
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,815
Oh, and the garden
is so established.

1164
01:05:18,054 --> 01:05:20,045
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's all right.

1165
01:05:20,256 --> 01:05:22,952
The porch is so charming.
I can see why you love it.

1166
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:25,945
I have to get someone
to take care of it.

1167
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:27,347
The orchids, oh.

1168
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:31,597
Oh, this...

1169
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:33,291
- This is spectacular.
- Right?

1170
01:05:33,503 --> 01:05:37,303
- I think it's incredibly cheerful.
- Oh, look at the flow, and the light.

1171
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:39,975
- I mean, it-
- It goes a ways that way as well.

1172
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,643
- I have a million ideas immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1173
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:45,973
Oh, the fireplace. Reminds me
of those places in the Hamptons.

1174
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:48,775
- So delightful.
- You've done work in the Hamptons?

1175
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:50,646
- We have friends out there.
- Yes.

1176
01:05:50,853 --> 01:05:54,254
- All right.
- Yes, I've done a number of...

1177
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:55,481
...beach houses.

1178
01:05:55,725 --> 01:05:57,454
Let me show you the view.

1179
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:00,288
Well, I can see-

1180
01:06:00,496 --> 01:06:03,089
- Oh, my God, it's enormous.
- Right?

1181
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:06,734
I had no i- You could have
3- or 400 people out here.

1182
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:09,173
- I don't have that
many friends, but sure.

1183
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:09,758
- Look at-

1184
01:06:09,938 --> 01:06:12,372
The view, it's just breathtaking.

1185
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,973
Andrea and I used to do
a lot of entertaining.

1186
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:16,974
I bet you did, living in New York.

1187
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:20,171
Well, now you're talking
about my specialty.

1188
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:23,442
You know, I gave the best
dinner parties in the city.

1189
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:28,889
Come here.

1190
01:06:34,062 --> 01:06:35,893
I'm shocked.

1191
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:37,758
Oh, yeah?

1192
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,294
What's your reaction, really?

1193
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,964
Well, my reaction is...

1194
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:45,638
- ... you can do it again if you like.
- Oh, yeah?

1195
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:38,388
I've always wanted a canopy bed.
Look at this.

1196
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:40,957
- Yeah, that looks interesting.
- It is, right?

1197
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:43,321
Is that mid-19th century?

1198
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:47,125
- I have no idea.
- Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

1199
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:51,098
I do- I love the posts,
but these beds, they're just-

1200
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:53,066
Well, they're not very wide.

1201
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:57,334
- Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.
- Oh, Dwight.

1202
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,907
We could do the top
in a muslin or linen-

1203
01:08:02,115 --> 01:08:05,050
- Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.
- Well, it's not-

1204
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,742
You know, last night
when we were making love...

1205
01:08:07,954 --> 01:08:10,149
...I realized how removed
from the world...

1206
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,052
- ... I've been since Andrea died.
- I know, I know. I...

1207
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:17,626
I think when something's right,
you just...

1208
01:08:17,863 --> 01:08:21,094
- You know it immediately.
- Oh, yeah?

1209
01:08:42,654 --> 01:08:44,087
Do you-? Do you hear that?

1210
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:46,257
- Can you hear the bass, though?
- Yeah.

1211
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:49,586
Like, the bass
and then the high-end definition.

1212
01:08:49,795 --> 01:08:51,956
I'm definitely gonna get one. Yup.

1213
01:08:52,164 --> 01:08:54,325
- I'm giving you this one.
- No, you're not.

1214
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:56,693
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh, my God.

1215
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:58,697
- Come here.
- You're so sweet.

1216
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:01,166
- You're sweet.
- You're sweet.

1217
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:04,704
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1218
01:09:04,942 --> 01:09:05,966
Isn't this dancing?

1219
01:09:06,177 --> 01:09:08,645
Yeah, this is slow dancing,
which is really...

1220
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:12,145
- What?
- Well, it's the key, I always say...

1221
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,510
...to good lovemaking.

1222
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:15,413
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1223
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:20,013
- Where do you think Mom is tonight?
- Oh, she's got a date tonight.

1224
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:22,351
- Oh, that's cool.
- I wonder where she is.

1225
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,324
Well, I don't think
she's at Chuck E. Cheese.

1226
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,490
I'm gonna babysit you.
I'm a good babysitter.

1227
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:30,064
- Yeah.
- You know?

1228
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:33,429
You should babysit. I used to
babysit when I was a teenager.

1229
01:09:33,638 --> 01:09:35,196
It's how you make extra money.

1230
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,431
Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

1231
01:09:39,076 --> 01:09:43,068
Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

1232
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:47,511
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

1233
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:51,651
"Blue Moon" was the song that was
playing. You know the song "Blue Moon."

1234
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:55,086
Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

1235
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,854
You know, I had energy.

1236
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:01,262
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

1237
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:03,762
You know, I ran charities
for poor people...

1238
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,197
...and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

1239
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:10,498
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

1240
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:15,406
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

1241
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:19,070
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

1242
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:21,375
Tip big, boys.

1243
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:26,715
Tip big, because you get good
service and they count on tips.

1244
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:30,119
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth...

1245
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,350
...you must remember to be generous.

1246
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,758
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

1247
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,989
Yeah, and then you
talked to yourself.

1248
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,026
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand...

1249
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,606
...until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

1250
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:52,277
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself...

1251
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:55,278
...and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

1252
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,246
Why Edison?

1253
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:01,446
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

1254
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:05,391
See, everything
unraveled so quickly.

1255
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:09,256
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia...

1256
01:11:09,464 --> 01:11:11,455
...and this acute fear of death.

1257
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:15,659
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

1258
01:11:15,903 --> 01:11:18,963
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

1259
01:11:19,173 --> 01:11:22,336
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

1260
01:11:23,044 --> 01:11:27,310
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect...

1261
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:31,541
...that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

1262
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:34,117
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot...

1263
01:11:34,322 --> 01:11:38,053
...not to think his phenomenal
success was too good to be true.

1264
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,124
But a cheat is a cheat.

1265
01:11:42,163 --> 01:11:45,655
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

1266
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:49,064
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

1267
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:52,461
But that's all history, boys.

1268
01:11:52,673 --> 01:11:55,938
I met someone. I'm a new person.

1269
01:11:59,713 --> 01:12:02,011
- Get everything?
- Yes. These in the kitchen?

1270
01:12:02,215 --> 01:12:02,907
Sure.

1271
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:05,698
I can't believe how
much you paid for it.

1272
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:08,150
I know it's ridiculous and it's old.

1273
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:10,289
God knows if it even works.

1274
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:15,359
- We have the terrace for a telescope.
- Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.

1275
01:12:15,696 --> 01:12:18,028
And the moon will look incredible
through it.

1276
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:20,995
- Ever seen the moon through that?
- Oh, I can imagine.

1277
01:12:21,201 --> 01:12:24,728
Hey, can I ask you something?

1278
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:27,231
- Sure.
- You ever think...

1279
01:12:27,474 --> 01:12:29,738
...you could see yourself
married to me?

1280
01:12:31,211 --> 01:12:32,701
Married?

1281
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:37,975
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

1282
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:41,551
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

1283
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:44,689
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

1284
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,882
And you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want.

1285
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,032
And then we come back and I get
serious about my political dream.

1286
01:12:54,233 --> 01:12:56,827
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house...

1287
01:12:57,036 --> 01:13:00,528
...that you're gonna do such a
fantastic job making beautiful.

1288
01:13:02,274 --> 01:13:05,937
What do you think? Downside for you
is you have to stand next to me...

1289
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:09,204
...and smile at photo ops when
I throw my hat in the ring.

1290
01:13:09,415 --> 01:13:13,010
- So you're saying you love me.
- Can't you tell?

1291
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:17,155
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

1292
01:13:17,356 --> 01:13:20,347
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

1293
01:13:20,558 --> 01:13:22,924
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

1294
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:25,875
I'll admit, my heart's
beating a little fast.

1295
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,277
Yeah, your hands are shaking.

1296
01:13:28,312 --> 01:13:30,663
I wanted you to want me
and now you do.

1297
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:35,764
Thank you so much.

1298
01:13:35,974 --> 01:13:39,774
Have a nice day. You got it?
Okay, I'll take that.

1299
01:13:39,978 --> 01:13:43,038
- What are you doing here?
- You know why I'm here.

1300
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:46,250
- I told you not to bother me.
- You're sleeping with Al.

1301
01:13:46,451 --> 01:13:48,442
You're not gonna make a fool
out of me.

1302
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:51,587
Chili, this is not the place
to discuss this, okay?

1303
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,451
- Sir, is there a problem?
- Sorry.

1304
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:54,885
No, there's no problem.

1305
01:13:55,093 --> 01:13:58,460
- Ginger, Ginger, I love you.
- Ginger, what's going on?

1306
01:13:58,696 --> 01:13:59,958
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1307
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:03,633
No, I just need a- Just need a break
from everything to think.

1308
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,975
All right, look, I
blame this on Jasmine.

1309
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:07,989
No, she's just
looking out for me.

1310
01:14:08,205 --> 01:14:11,003
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?
I don't like her.

1311
01:14:11,241 --> 01:14:13,607
You meant nothing to her
until she needed you.

1312
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:16,780
- I'm working, Chili.
- I'm nuts about you, Ging.

1313
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:20,848
I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do
all these things together, big things.

1314
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:23,518
What great things, huh?
You're a grease monkey.

1315
01:14:23,754 --> 01:14:25,942
And I'll be bagging
groceries all my life.

1316
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:28,307
She"s cuckoo, baby.
She talks to herself.

1317
01:14:28,492 --> 01:14:30,653
- You told me that yourself.
- I need space.

1318
01:14:30,861 --> 01:14:33,125
Just give me some space, okay?

1319
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,423
I can't sleep.

1320
01:14:36,233 --> 01:14:39,259
- I'm a nervous wreck.
- Oh, for chrissake.

1321
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:41,802
I can't get you off of my head.

1322
01:14:42,005 --> 01:14:45,304
Stop it. Will you stop crying?
There's people around.

1323
01:14:45,509 --> 01:14:47,738
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

1324
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:49,036
- Oh, my God.
- I don't.

1325
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:51,644
- Stop it. Stop it, please.
- I got this, okay?

1326
01:14:51,848 --> 01:14:55,113
- Would you like to sit in my office?
- No. But I appreciate it.

1327
01:14:55,318 --> 01:14:57,786
Look, who's this guy, Al?

1328
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:00,455
- What does he do?
- You know what he doesn't do?

1329
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:03,682
He doesn't make scenes
where I work in public.

1330
01:15:03,893 --> 01:15:06,885
Come on, brother.
Would you like a Kleenex?

1331
01:15:07,763 --> 01:15:10,994
- I love her so much.
- It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?

1332
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,565
Great.

1333
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:21,767
Hello.

1334
01:15:26,716 --> 01:15:29,378
- Hello.
- Hi.

1335
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,014
Hi.

1336
01:15:32,787 --> 01:15:34,379
You seem up.

1337
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:38,650
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

1338
01:15:39,294 --> 01:15:40,852
- How great.
- What's that smell?

1339
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:43,792
Did you break a bottle of perfume?

1340
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:46,795
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

1341
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:48,731
That's sweet. But if I may say...

1342
01:15:48,937 --> 01:15:52,338
...you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

1343
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,669
God, I'm always nervous
it will wear off.

1344
01:15:55,877 --> 01:15:58,402
He's taking me to his
favorite jeweler.

1345
01:15:58,613 --> 01:16:00,740
You think Al is a
step up from Chili?

1346
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:03,713
Anybody is a step up from Chili.

1347
01:16:03,919 --> 01:16:05,443
He's such a gentleman.

1348
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:08,588
Well, then he's
definitely a step up.

1349
01:16:08,823 --> 01:16:11,553
But in bed, he's no gentleman.

1350
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,626
Wait till he takes a whiff
of my new fragrance.

1351
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,557
It's French.

1352
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:26,062
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Yeah, I'm on my way over right now.

1353
01:16:26,273 --> 01:16:29,071
- You're late.
- Oh, God.

1354
01:16:29,276 --> 01:16:33,269
- I'm still shaking.
- What's the matter?

1355
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,979
I think Hal is having an affair.

1356
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,945
With Lisette Boudreau?

1357
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:45,722
Who is she?

1358
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,493
That French girl.
The Jordans' au pair.

1359
01:16:50,764 --> 01:16:52,664
What do you know about this?

1360
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:55,567
You're the only one
who doesn't know.

1361
01:16:55,769 --> 01:16:59,864
I've known about Hal's affairs for
years, but it's not my business.

1362
01:17:00,373 --> 01:17:01,772
How did you find out?

1363
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:06,467
The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

1364
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:08,909
Hal left his Rolex there.

1365
01:17:09,115 --> 01:17:12,881
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

1366
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:15,384
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along...

1367
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:19,820
...and I didn't know what they were talking
about, so I did some checking and...

1368
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:22,324
I knew this day would come.

1369
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:25,462
I'm surprised it took so long.

1370
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:28,662
Who else?

1371
01:17:30,903 --> 01:17:33,030
Victoria Alter.

1372
01:17:33,973 --> 01:17:35,804
Raylene.

1373
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:37,408
This au pair.

1374
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,344
That trainer he used to take
to baseball games.

1375
01:17:40,546 --> 01:17:42,672
- Oh, my God.
- You know how many people...

1376
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:46,509
...have said to me he's doing his lawyer,
the Chinese dragon lady?

1377
01:17:46,718 --> 01:17:49,551
- Can we get the waiter? I need a drink.
- Yes. Waiter.

1378
01:17:49,788 --> 01:17:51,016
- Yes, ma'am?
- This again.

1379
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:53,191
- Right away. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

1380
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:17,437
Hello?

1381
01:18:18,016 --> 01:18:20,041
Yeah, is Al there?

1382
01:18:20,519 --> 01:18:23,079
Al Munsinger, yeah.

1383
01:18:25,322 --> 01:18:28,883
I know he works
in the Audio Department, yeah.

1384
01:18:29,493 --> 01:18:31,222
Yeah, I'll hold.

1385
01:18:34,265 --> 01:18:35,892
Hello?

1386
01:18:36,467 --> 01:18:39,265
Al Munsinger, yes.

1387
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:42,737
Al, where the hell are you?

1388
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:44,839
What?

1389
01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:48,669
What? I don't get it.
Why couldn't you come?

1390
01:18:54,051 --> 01:18:56,076
Who found out what?

1391
01:18:58,122 --> 01:18:59,919
Who's Ellen?

1392
01:19:09,032 --> 01:19:10,431
Yeah, I-

1393
01:19:10,633 --> 01:19:13,227
I didn't understand you had a wife.

1394
01:19:15,638 --> 01:19:17,105
No.

1395
01:19:17,807 --> 01:19:19,934
No, you never said.

1396
01:19:35,325 --> 01:19:37,316
My mother was very impressed
with you.

1397
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,755
- Really?
- Yeah. You two had a discussion...

1398
01:19:39,963 --> 01:19:42,898
- ... about her collection of pewter.
- Yes. I love pewter.

1399
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:46,068
Hal used to have his beer
out of a pewter mug.

1400
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:47,628
And your dad?

1401
01:19:47,837 --> 01:19:51,830
My dad can be very critical sometimes,
but he was very taken with you.

1402
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,600
Well, don't worry,
I won't pick out too big a stone.

1403
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:58,245
Yeah, nothing larger
than the Hope diamond.

1404
01:19:58,447 --> 01:20:00,677
Hey, Jasmine.

1405
01:20:01,984 --> 01:20:04,851
What? You don't remember me?

1406
01:20:05,654 --> 01:20:08,623
Of course I remember you.
What a surprise.

1407
01:20:09,558 --> 01:20:11,788
Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?

1408
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:14,756
This is Augie. Dwight.

1409
01:20:14,963 --> 01:20:16,794
- Dwight, hi.
- How you doing?

1410
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:18,660
I was married to her sister.

1411
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:21,098
- Okay.
- Years ago. Years.

1412
01:20:21,303 --> 01:20:24,329
Wasn't that many years.
She makes it sound ancient.

1413
01:20:24,573 --> 01:20:28,168
Congratulations. Ginger said
you got a new job up in Alaska.

1414
01:20:29,678 --> 01:20:32,511
I could've had my own company
if it wasn't for you...

1415
01:20:32,714 --> 01:20:36,774
- ... and that crook you married.
- I don't think it's the time and place.

1416
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:41,683
Oh, really? You think I wanna lay oil
pipe way the hell up there in Alaska?

1417
01:20:41,889 --> 01:20:43,288
I got no money.

1418
01:20:43,491 --> 01:20:46,858
Christ, can't you put this behind you
and move on? I've moved on.

1419
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:51,224
- Take it easy. I don't know who you are-
- Right, you don't, so stay out of it.

1420
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,095
I saw your son.

1421
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:56,669
Yeah, that's right, Danny.
Remember him?

1422
01:20:57,205 --> 01:21:01,539
Lives across the bridge in Oakland,
works at a music store. Antonio's.

1423
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:05,101
He's doing pretty good.
He's married.

1424
01:21:05,646 --> 01:21:08,171
I think he's finally
over Hal's suicide.

1425
01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:11,047
Danny's in Oakland?

1426
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:15,052
Let me tell you something,
Jeanette, Jasmine...

1427
01:21:15,256 --> 01:21:18,225
...whatever it is
you call yourself these days.

1428
01:21:18,426 --> 01:21:20,393
Some people...

1429
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:24,119
...they don't put things behind
so easily.

1430
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:33,867
You have a son?

1431
01:21:34,774 --> 01:21:39,143
Yes, I have a son. He's not- Biologically
he's not my son. He's my step-

1432
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:41,644
- Hal's suicide?
- I can explain it all later.

1433
01:21:41,848 --> 01:21:44,681
- Can we just-?
- Not until you tell me what's going on.

1434
01:21:44,885 --> 01:21:46,716
- Not in the street.
- I want to know.

1435
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,582
- I know. We'll go somewhere quiet.
- Get in the car.

1436
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:52,758
- Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
- Okay.

1437
01:21:57,797 --> 01:22:01,358
Of course we can't get married!
You lied to me up and down the line!

1438
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:04,195
- No, I wanted to tell you.
- Are you delusional?

1439
01:22:04,403 --> 01:22:06,303
Didn't you think I'd find out?

1440
01:22:06,538 --> 01:22:09,598
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know what I was thinking.

1441
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:12,936
Everything happened in the past.
You and I loved each other.

1442
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,805
What? That it would just vanish?

1443
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:18,778
Didn't you think I would find out,
if not today, eventually?

1444
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:23,546
Like after we were married? Is that what
you wanted, to wait until it was too late?

1445
01:22:23,756 --> 01:22:26,884
For your future plans where you
needed the appropriate wife?

1446
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:30,584
I won't say it wouldn't be an issue,
but that you could stand by...

1447
01:22:30,796 --> 01:22:34,323
- ... deceive me until I married you-
- No, you mean till I trapped you.

1448
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:36,732
Your ethical behavior
is equal to your ex.

1449
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:38,823
I wasn't deceiving you.
I loved you.

1450
01:22:39,004 --> 01:22:42,770
- I found out by chance, by sheer chance.
- Okay, if it's over, it's over.

1451
01:22:42,975 --> 01:22:46,411
I get it. You're not marrying me.
I brought everything on myself.

1452
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:50,809
I've only got myself to blame.
I did it to myself again, as usual.

1453
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:53,643
You and your stupid
little French whore.

1454
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:56,164
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1455
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,676
Let me out of the car.

1456
01:22:57,855 --> 01:23:00,585
- Let me out of the car.
- How are you gonna get home?

1457
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:03,727
I'm not going home. Let me out.
Let me out of the car!

1458
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:28,850
Hey, remember to tell her
when she gets here, okay?

1459
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:30,884
Believe me, she won't care.

1460
01:23:31,122 --> 01:23:33,851
- She is half out the door.
- Yeah, well...

1461
01:23:34,057 --> 01:23:36,025
I didn't start out not liking her.

1462
01:23:36,259 --> 01:23:39,251
I think she had it in for me
from the moment she met me.

1463
01:23:40,063 --> 01:23:41,291
Well, I like you.

1464
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:44,399
Now, that's what counts,
not how she feels about you.

1465
01:23:44,634 --> 01:23:47,296
You know, I'm sick of her
calling you a loser...

1466
01:23:47,504 --> 01:23:50,837
...or always pushing me
to find a better man.

1467
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:54,169
You know, in my book,
you're no loser.

1468
01:23:54,378 --> 01:23:57,370
You're twice the guy I met at
the party she dragged me to.

1469
01:23:57,581 --> 01:23:59,378
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1470
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,141
- Well, I love you.
- I know.

1471
01:24:01,351 --> 01:24:04,059
I love the boys. I
think they love me too.

1472
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:04,903
They do.

1473
01:24:05,088 --> 01:24:09,491
- When I thought I lost you-
- You didn't lose me, baby.

1474
01:24:09,693 --> 01:24:11,888
I almost lost you.

1475
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:42,347
Is this what you gave up
everything for?

1476
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:46,255
To sell secondhand
musical instruments?

1477
01:24:47,696 --> 01:24:51,132
I asked Augie not to tell you
where I was.

1478
01:24:53,102 --> 01:24:54,831
Why?

1479
01:24:56,338 --> 01:24:58,329
What happened?

1480
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,770
Why did you disappear like that
and never contact me?

1481
01:25:01,976 --> 01:25:05,468
I couldn't find you
when I needed you.

1482
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:10,950
I know the whole story, I found it out,
so don't act so surprised.

1483
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:21,853
Are you having an affair
with Lisette Boudreau?

1484
01:25:22,363 --> 01:25:24,661
Oh, Jasmine,
I can't do this without a drink.

1485
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:27,800
No, don't tap dance.
You never went to Chicago.

1486
01:25:28,002 --> 01:25:30,368
You took the Jordans' au pair
to Paris.

1487
01:25:30,572 --> 01:25:32,802
I know what's been going on.

1488
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:36,769
- Can we talk about this, please?
- You bet we can talk about it.

1489
01:25:36,978 --> 01:25:38,468
Can you do it calmly?

1490
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,309
I wanna talk to you about what's
going on, but you're always so-

1491
01:25:42,517 --> 01:25:44,108
How do you expect me to react?

1492
01:25:44,318 --> 01:25:46,809
You've been sleeping
with other women for years.

1493
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:51,081
I mean, Raylene,
your secretary, our trainer.

1494
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:53,816
- Amy.
- This is different.

1495
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:55,927
This is serious.

1496
01:25:56,163 --> 01:25:58,290
Lisette and I are in love.

1497
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,134
Wha-? What?

1498
01:26:01,435 --> 01:26:02,766
Are you crazy?

1499
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:07,031
I'm sorry, but I need you to hear what
I'm saying. Lisette and I are in love.

1500
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:10,802
What does that mean?
What does that stupidity even mean?

1501
01:26:11,011 --> 01:26:14,947
It means that we are making plans
for the future together.

1502
01:26:15,149 --> 01:26:17,447
I'm sorry.
I'm having trouble understanding.

1503
01:26:17,651 --> 01:26:21,018
I know this comes as a shock,
but I have to be honest with you.

1504
01:26:21,221 --> 01:26:24,622
You wanna be honest.
That's the biggest joke of all.

1505
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:26,951
I've had casual
flirtations in the past.

1506
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,993
They didn't mean anything until now.
This is different.

1507
01:26:30,196 --> 01:26:34,496
Are you out of your mind?
She is a teenager, for chrissake.

1508
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,362
She's an au pair.
I mean, are you crazy?

1509
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,885
Christ, this is hard
for me to tell you!

1510
01:26:39,911 --> 01:26:42,055
It's hard for you?
What about me?

1511
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:44,141
This is so humiliating for me.

1512
01:26:44,343 --> 01:26:47,870
I mean, it is bad enough that everyone
knows you've been unfaithful.

1513
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,481
But to throw me away for this
stupid-looking little French-

1514
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:54,517
- I will take very good care of you.
- I'm sorry.

1515
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,156
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1516
01:26:58,357 --> 01:27:01,053
I don't know what I'm-
What am I doing here?

1517
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,253
Oh, God, this is unacceptable.
This is not gonna happen.

1518
01:27:05,498 --> 01:27:07,989
You're not going anywhere.
This is unacceptable.

1519
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:11,966
- Jasmine, you're having a tantrum.
- Don't you touch me!

1520
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:15,071
- Don't you touch me!
- You are having a tantrum.

1521
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,764
Stop, stop.

1522
01:27:18,009 --> 01:27:20,705
- What am I doing here?
- Pull yourself together.

1523
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:23,247
- I can't-
- Jasmine.

1524
01:27:26,484 --> 01:27:30,079
When you calm down, we can talk
like two civilized adults...

1525
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:32,882
...about the arrangements
we have to make.

1526
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,532
Until then I'm gonna
check into a hotel.

1527
01:27:55,946 --> 01:28:00,815
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

1528
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:17,132
Hello.
Yes, I want the number of the FBI.

1529
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:19,766
Can you connect me?

1530
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,329
The FBI.

1531
01:28:23,807 --> 01:28:25,968
- Mr. Francis?
- Yes?

1532
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,803
- Hal Francis?
- Yes.

1533
01:28:28,045 --> 01:28:31,105
I'm sorry, sir,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

1534
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:33,780
- What?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1535
01:28:33,984 --> 01:28:36,452
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- No, sir.

1536
01:28:36,654 --> 01:28:39,816
- It's best if you come with us now.
- Under arrest for what?

1537
01:28:40,056 --> 01:28:42,616
Sir, come with us now.
We'll settle this downtown.

1538
01:28:42,825 --> 01:28:45,055
- Do you have a warrant?
- I do.

1539
01:28:46,162 --> 01:28:47,595
- Gonna handcuff me?
- We are.

1540
01:28:47,797 --> 01:28:51,130
- I wanna talk to my lawyer.
- You'll be able to call your lawyer.

1541
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:54,269
But we'll warn you,
you have the right to remain silent.

1542
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:57,268
Anything you say can be held
against you in court.

1543
01:28:57,473 --> 01:28:59,338
- Okay, okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

1544
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:03,102
Jesus Christ Almighty.

1545
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,649
- What am I being arrested for?
- We can discuss this downtown, sir.

1546
01:29:11,354 --> 01:29:16,018
As disillusioned as I was with him,
I hated you more.

1547
01:29:19,095 --> 01:29:22,689
The moment I did what I did,
I regretted it.

1548
01:29:23,398 --> 01:29:26,526
I don't wanna discuss it.
It's past. It's over.

1549
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:29,329
You can't take back that phone call.

1550
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:33,403
I need you, Danny.

1551
01:29:34,676 --> 01:29:38,544
I don't wanna see you, Jasmine.
I want the past past.

1552
01:29:38,747 --> 01:29:42,706
I've become a different person,
thanks to my wife. I'm off drugs.

1553
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:46,615
Just, please, don't
spoil everything.

1554
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:49,655
Just get out of my life
so I can move on.

1555
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:53,622
Definitely.

1556
01:29:55,664 --> 01:29:56,722
- Hey.
- Hey.

1557
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:59,924
Hey, have some champagne.

1558
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:03,399
Chili brought some
over to celebrate.

1559
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:05,662
We're back together.

1560
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:09,908
I'm sorry,
I'm not in a celebratory mood.

1561
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:13,341
I don't think I'd find that news
anything to celebrate about.

1562
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:16,539
Hey, come on, Jasmine,
let's not dig at each other, okay?

1563
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:19,652
I'm moving in, and she tells me
you found a rich husband.

1564
01:30:19,854 --> 01:30:22,345
- Gonna be a big shot in Washington.
- We made up.

1565
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:26,754
- Yeah, she begged for my forgiveness.
- And he cried like a baby and apologized.

1566
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:31,898
- I didn't cry.
- Bullshit. You cry all the time.

1567
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:34,260
But we're moving in.

1568
01:30:34,468 --> 01:30:38,370
It's something we planned for a long time
and maybe if we'd just done it-

1569
01:30:38,572 --> 01:30:41,063
Oh, for chrissake.

1570
01:30:41,275 --> 01:30:43,743
What's wrong with your self-esteem?

1571
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:47,937
There's men who'd never think about
ripping the phone out of the wall.

1572
01:30:48,182 --> 01:30:51,708
Hey, leave him alone.
You're always picking on him.

1573
01:30:51,918 --> 01:30:53,818
No, you choose losers, okay?

1574
01:30:54,053 --> 01:30:56,317
Because that's what you think
you deserve.

1575
01:30:56,556 --> 01:31:00,925
That's why you're living like this and
that's why you'll never have a better life.

1576
01:31:01,428 --> 01:31:03,328
I'm- I'm living-

1577
01:31:03,563 --> 01:31:09,297
I'm living like this because you
married the biggest loser of all...

1578
01:31:09,502 --> 01:31:11,800
...and went your own sweet way...

1579
01:31:12,005 --> 01:31:17,568
...while he pissed away my one big
chance to make a better life.

1580
01:31:17,777 --> 01:31:20,268
Come on, let's not ruin
our celebration, okay?

1581
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,143
Come on, she's happy, we're happy.
Let's let sleeping dogs lie.

1582
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,808
He's right. I'm not gonna be drawn
into defending myself...

1583
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:31,855
...when all I wanted to do
was bring you in on a good deal.

1584
01:31:34,026 --> 01:31:36,995
I'm moving out of this place today.

1585
01:31:37,496 --> 01:31:39,657
I just gotta get myself together.

1586
01:31:39,865 --> 01:31:44,359
Dwight asked me to move in with
him, as I expected he would.

1587
01:31:44,603 --> 01:31:46,764
He wants me to finish
decorating his home.

1588
01:31:46,972 --> 01:31:49,497
Then we'll marry
and we'll move in together.

1589
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:52,642
He's one of these men
who's lost without a woman.

1590
01:31:52,845 --> 01:31:55,837
It has to be the right woman,
who's a plus for his career.

1591
01:31:56,048 --> 01:32:00,485
And I have the social skills
required for his future in politics.

1592
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:04,846
For the next few years,
we'll be living in Vienna.

1593
01:32:05,324 --> 01:32:08,521
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a shower.

1594
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,557
I'll send for my luggage.

1595
01:32:13,899 --> 01:32:18,528
I was pretty angry at some of the things
she said, but I kept it on the inside.

1596
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:24,573
I'm tired of her knocking you.
You know?

1597
01:32:32,984 --> 01:32:35,817
Don't even think about taking
that last slice of pizza.

1598
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:39,581
- What? Why?
- That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.

1599
01:32:39,824 --> 01:32:42,190
- Is it really?
- Last slice belongs to the man.

1600
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:45,692
- You're putting too much on the hips.
- Is that so?

1601
01:32:45,897 --> 01:32:48,889
- Yeah, if you wanna keep me around-
- This slice is yours?

1602
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:54,834
- Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.
- Is this yours? Is this yours?

1603
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,303
That slice of pizza is mine.

1604
01:32:58,509 --> 01:33:00,203
- That's mine.
- Yeah.

1605
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:02,537
That's mine. That's mine.

1606
01:33:02,746 --> 01:33:05,544
Oh, that's mine.
Those are definitely mine.

1607
01:33:05,749 --> 01:33:09,344
Is that yours? Yeah?

1608
01:33:10,921 --> 01:33:13,446
Yeah, that's yours, okay.

1609
01:33:31,975 --> 01:33:34,637
It's fraught with peril.

1610
01:33:35,412 --> 01:33:38,540
They gossip, you know, they talk.

1611
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:42,484
I saw Danny.

1612
01:33:42,852 --> 01:33:45,081
Yes, did I tell you?

1613
01:33:46,355 --> 01:33:48,550
He's getting married.

1614
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:54,118
A weekend in Palm Beach
means I can wear...

1615
01:33:54,363 --> 01:33:59,300
What could I wear? I can wear
the Dior dress I bought in Paris.

1616
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:03,361
Yes, my black dress.

1617
01:34:03,572 --> 01:34:06,666
Well, Hal always used to surprise me
with jewelry.

1618
01:34:07,509 --> 01:34:09,739
Extravagant pieces.

1619
01:34:10,179 --> 01:34:13,114
I think he used to
buy them at auction.

1620
01:34:15,517 --> 01:34:18,247
It's so obvious what you're doing.

1621
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,145
You think I don't know.

1622
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:24,022
French au pair.

1623
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:31,925
This was playing on the Vineyard.

1624
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:36,827
"Blue Moon."

1625
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,935
I used to know the words.

1626
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:47,278
I knew the words.

1627
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:52,018
Now they're all a jumble.

1628
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:05,857
Sync, fix: titler
