1
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,150
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

2
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,240
I want to, but I have
a million things to do first.

3
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,210
Mom, what's this?

4
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,750
- Peanut butter.
- Peanut butter and what?

5
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,550
Peanut butter and jelly.

6
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,050
What kind of jelly?

7
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,720
Zucchini jelly.

8
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,330
Five, six, seven!

9
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,270
How we doing?

10
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,780
We're doing fine, Walter.

11
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,320
I wish we could afford
to keep you full time.

12
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,820
So do I, especially now.

13
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,290
Hmm. Ls the divorce final yet?

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,830
- Yes, today. Thank you.
- Hmm.

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,710
Let's put our heads together and
maybe we can work something out.

16
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,640
All right.

17
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,850
Uh, horns up.

18
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,230
One, two, three, four...

19
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,650
five, six, seven.

20
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,320
<i>O beautiful for spacious skies{\i}.</i>

21
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,490
<i>For amber waves of grain{\i}.</i>

22
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,670
<i>For purple mountain majesties{\i}.</i>

23
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,340
<i>Above the fruited plain!{\i}.</i>

24
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,600
<i>America! America!{\i}.</i>

25
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,850
<i>God shed his grace on thee{\i}.</i>

26
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,320
<i>And crown thy good with brotherhood{\i}.</i>

27
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,200
<i>From sea to shining sea!{\i}.</i>

28
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, wonderful.
Thank you very much, Felicia.

29
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,210
We appreciate your taking the time
to be here with us today.

30
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,050
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand
for our most prominent selectman...

31
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,550
or select woman or select person,
Felicia Alden.

32
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,560
Thank you, children and Mrs. Spofford.

33
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,850
I can see we have our work
cut out for us.

34
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,450
In these days of
disintegrating values...

35
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,950
and lost mores...

36
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,040
when our children
are exposed daily...

37
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,250
to the hazards of divorce, separation
and families torn asunder...

38
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,840
it's comforting to think back
to the days...

39
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,210
when a family like the Lenoxes
strove together.

40
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,220
Those values, embodied
in a man like Major Lenox...

41
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,310
They were men who labored
all their lives...

42
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,930
so their children would be
well-fed and clothed and educated.

43
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,980
The families endured great hardship...

44
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,150
yet kept their honor...

45
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,320
their dignity and their faith in God.

46
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,620
We are the same people;
The same body, the soul...

47
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,660
the hands and the feet
of our fathers...

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,170
fighting the wars of modern vice.

49
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,670
What was it that tied
these people together?

50
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,170
What was it that made them...

51
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,390
not a loose gathering of individuals,
but a single bond?

52
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,060
That bond that held them together,
as it holds us together today.

53
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,150
That bond that has stood every test...

54
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,190
is found deep in our consciousness.

55
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,030
An abiding love of liberty.

56
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,410
For love of liberty, our forbearers...

57
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,200
colonies few in number and
with little to defend themselves...

58
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,410
fought the war for independence...

59
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,330
what was then the world's
most powerful empire.

60
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,920
For love of liberty...

61
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,170
those who came before us
tamed a vast wilderness...

62
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,170
and braved hardships...

63
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,350
Tamed a vast wilderness
and braved hardships...

64
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,390
which at times were
beyond the limit...

65
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Braved hardships, which at times were
beyond the limit of human endurance.

66
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,790
Come on. Go with your mom. Go on.

67
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,760
Liberty must not be taken for granted.
We thank God for our blessings...

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,620
Oh, hi, come on in.
Janey, come on!

69
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,340
Do you believe it's raining?

70
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,630
Duh, no.

71
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,420
I mean, since this morning.

72
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,920
At least it shut Walter up.

73
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,800
The same boring, sanctimonious speech.

74
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,270
I thought he'd go on forever.
I was praying for something to happen.

75
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,440
- I was thinking the same thing.
- You were?

76
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
I was thinking we're all wet and
how nice it would be to just leave.

77
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,110
- Were you really?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,280
And then it rained.

79
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,780
He's a liar and a lech
and he deserved it.

80
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,570
No, I'm not talking about Walter.

81
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,700
Don't you think it's strange
that we were...

82
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,960
We were thinking the same thing
at the same time? So what?

83
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,170
It won't get us on David Letterman.

84
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,130
- I know, I...
- Let's just have a drink.

85
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,170
Good idea, Janey, party-baby!

86
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,850
You know, he made
a pass at me last week too.

87
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,520
- Walter? Oh, please.
- I can't even stand to think about it.

88
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,820
Be prepared.
He does not give up easily.

89
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,320
It was broad daylight and his wife
was standing ten feet away!

90
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,570
Poor woman.

91
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,160
Poor woman, my ass. Why does she
put up with it? The man is a Nazi.

92
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Do you think they still... you know?

93
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,830
Yes.

94
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,340
I hope his
dick is bigger than his I .Q.

95
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,220
Once a week. He told me.
He told you.

96
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,180
Otherwise she starts throwing things.

97
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,890
At least someone's getting
something once a week.

98
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,430
Yes, heartburn.

99
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,850
Mm. I keep forgetting how many calories
are in these.

100
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,190
Two minutes on the lips,

101
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,020
Forever on the love handles.

102
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,360
Ooh. And congratulations.

103
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,200
Oh, God, I forgot. Your divorce.

104
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,750
As of today, I'm a free woman.

105
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,660
- Join the club.
- Thanks.

106
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,380
Heh. Here I go again.

107
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,550
It's over, honey. You'll be okay.

108
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,590
It's a beginning, not an ending.
Right, Alex?

109
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,510
Besides, we still have each other.

110
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
Have some more martooni.

111
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,310
- Did you bring the cards?
- Was I supposed to?

112
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,770
- I have them.
- Okay, come on ladies, let's do it! Whoo!

113
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,980
I feel like I'm being unfaithful...

114
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,610
even if I just think about it.

115
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,580
Sukie, Monty deserted you
and left you with five kids.

116
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,490
- Six.
- Don't start, Alex.

117
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,870
Her husband left because
she had too many kids.

118
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,330
- That's his problem.
- You're oversimplifying.

119
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,380
- Yours left because you can't have any.
- You are definitely oversimplifying.

120
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,130
That's not the point.

121
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,510
What I'm saying is
that it's not your fault.

122
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,970
That doesn't matter.
It's just not that easy.

123
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,890
We're too young to lock it up
and throw away the key.

124
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,520
It's not natural.

125
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,310
What are we doing with ourselves?

126
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,480
Look, Ozzie's dead. I loved him.
He's dead.

127
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,690
So I spend Thursday nights
with you two the rest of my life?

128
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,530
I like our Thursdays.
It's the only time I can relax.

129
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,490
Quilting, macramé.
What did we do last Thursday night?

130
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,290
Chinese aphrodisiac cooking.

131
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,710
Fabulous. Stimulating.
We're not relaxing, we're hiding.

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,790
- What from?
- Walter Neff.

133
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,130
Fuck Walter Neff.
I'm not talking about him.

134
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,840
All right, who should we be looking for?

135
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,640
Somebody nice. Somebody you could like.

136
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,140
Somebody with a brain.
Somebody you could talk to.

137
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,560
Somebody you could be yourself with.

138
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,980
<i>Someone to watch over me{\i}.</i>

139
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,780
All right, I've had it with you two.

140
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,160
He would have to be from out of town.

141
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,830
Especially considering what's in town.

142
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,870
A stranger. That would be interesting.

143
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,880
A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse.

144
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,750
In Eastwick?

145
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,760
Romantic.

146
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,050
A foreign prince on a big, black horse.

147
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,270
All right, no, no, no.
If we're going to have it...

148
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,850
let's have it all.

149
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,160
He should be really handsome.

150
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,870
Not too handsome.

151
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,370
Nice eyes.

152
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,000
Nice ass.

153
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,430
Huge.

154
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,350
I prefer small.

155
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,220
Aesthetically, I prefer small.

156
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,310
Sam was huge and there were times
when I could not face it.

157
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm in the middle myself.

158
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,690
But who cares?
As long as it works, it's in.

159
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,570
- It's in.
- Okay.

160
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,930
It's a nice thought, but wishing
for it won't make it happen.

161
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,350
Men are not the answer to everything.

162
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,650
So why do we always end up
talking about them?

163
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,180
I said, some man bought
the Lenox mansion.

164
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,190
Did you hear me?

165
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,190
<i>Yeah. Who is he?{\i}.</i>

166
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,400
He's from New York, no wife, no family.

167
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,530
He told the realtors he needed room
for his pianos.

168
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,120
Apparently, he has a lot of pianos.

169
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,910
How many pianos can one guy have?

170
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,870
Don't you think it's kind of
strange and funny?

171
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,830
<i>What's his name?{\i}.</i>

172
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,050
You know, that's strange too.

173
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,630
<i>What's strange about his name?{\i}.</i>

174
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,180
They told me his name
for the column and I forgot it.

175
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,260
So I called back and it's gone again.

176
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,060
It's not like me to forget a name.

177
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,100
<i>It's the big news of the day...{\i}</i>

178
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,320
<i>considering the history of the
place.{\i} I wonder if he knows.{\i}.</i>

179
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,730
<i>I don't know.{\i}.</i>

180
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,070
Is that Clyde and Felicia?

181
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah. Clyde?
I'll call you back, okay?

182
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,580
I have this culinary piece.
Hi, Felicia.

183
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,960
"Cheeseburger pie"?
Is your column finished?

184
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,090
Here's the track meet, births and
deaths, the senior citizens' news.

185
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,970
The toxic waste article
should be done this afternoon.

186
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,550
This pie looks good.

187
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,350
Did you hear someone bought
the Lenox mansion?

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,080
That house is landmark building.
They have no right to sell it.

189
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,790
I can't do anything about that.

190
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,120
No.

191
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,920
You're too busy...

192
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,090
reporting on the horse trough and
Herbie Prescott's trip to Bermuda.

193
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,800
What's going to happen
to those birds now? Tell me that.

194
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,140
What birds?

195
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,010
The snowy egrets.

196
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,760
Where will they nest?

197
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,470
I don't know.

198
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,270
Exactly.

199
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,650
Felicia, what's the matter?

200
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,900
Honey. It's only a house.
Why are you so upset?

201
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,650
I have a feeling.

202
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,030
The most terrible feeling.

203
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Something is happening.
Something evil.

204
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,460
I'm just glad they're selling.
I was afraid that...

205
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,590
They're not selling, they sold.
Just like that.

206
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,970
I don't understand.

207
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,640
You know I adore the little creatures.
So unreal, and yet the detail.

208
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,810
Little fingers and toes, little pudenda
making a bump. So sweet.

209
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,650
But nobody's even looked
at them sideways in months.

210
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,570
Then this morning...

211
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,610
this man appeared
out of absolutely nowhere.

212
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,240
So charming. Not really handsome,
but... riveting.

213
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,950
That's it. I was riveted.
I looked into his eyes...

214
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,960
and had thoughts I hadn't
entertained since World War I I.

215
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,420
I think I actually blushed.
Can you imagine?

216
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,210
No, I mean, yeah. So he bought one?

217
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,010
He bought all of them.
Every single one.

218
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,800
So who was he? A tourist?

219
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,510
No, he just bought the Lenox house.
He's moving in.

220
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,140
Do you remember his name?

221
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,520
Of course. His name is...

222
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,020
He told me.

223
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,530
I wrote it down, even.

224
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,700
It was...

225
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,610
foreign.

226
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,530
It sounded...

227
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,370
It's right on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't...

228
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,710
Oh.

229
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,710
Isn't that diabolical?

230
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,770
What is that noise?

231
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,770
I don't know.

232
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,710
Outrageous!

233
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,410
Brava!

234
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,250
Bravis!

235
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,350
He bought all of them?

236
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,350
- And now he's here.
- Making goo-goo eyes at Jane.

237
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,930
And the interview too. How weird.

238
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,060
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, it was after we talked.

239
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,530
The paper called him
and asked to interview him...

240
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,950
About the house renovation and all.

241
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,200
He said he'd love to be interviewed
and asked for me.

242
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,410
Why?

243
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,330
I don't know, I mean he wants me
to do the interview.

244
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,080
- Who is he?
- He must have a name.

245
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,870
I just can't remember it.

246
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,920
Why would he ask for you?

247
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,630
Because I'm good at it.
You act like I'm so stupid.

248
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,050
He was in my shop.

249
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,590
You're not stupid. But how does
he know who Sukie Ridgemont is?

250
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,930
I don't know.

251
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,770
He bought the Lenox estate
just like that.

252
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,310
- From New York.
- He has some kind of a foreign name.

253
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,520
Van something or other.

254
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,900
Oh, there you are. How sweet.

255
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,070
They're from him. With a personal note.

256
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,120
- Just the initial "D."
- Yeah, it starts with "D."

257
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,080
- David?
- No. It has an "R" in it.

258
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,580
Doberman?

259
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,080
- Drake?
- Darren.

260
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,840
It's "D" something, "R" something, "L."
Daryl!

261
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,550
- Van Horne.
- Yes!

262
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,430
- Daryl Van Horne.
- Daryl Van Horne?

263
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,260
What kind of name is that?

264
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,230
Felicia!

265
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,740
Sweetheart?

266
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,370
Oh, Clyde, honey.

267
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,790
I think I broke my leg.

268
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,180
Looking for me?

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,190
Are you looking for me?
Or is this just a happy coincidence?

270
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,020
- Actually, I was...
- Just looking.

271
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,530
Well, too bad.

272
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,240
Have you seen any snowy egrets out here?

273
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,870
- No.
- Neither have I.

274
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,200
Not that I'd know a snowy egret if I was
pissing on one. You want some lunch?

275
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,710
I think it's a little late
in the season.

276
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,630
For lunch?

277
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,250
No, pissing on birds.

278
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,550
Daryl Van Horne.

279
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,050
Alexandra Medford.

280
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,220
The local sculptress.
The one who makes...

281
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,230
the little booby dolls.

282
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,100
They're just little...

283
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,060
Little, yes, but potent. Full of juice.

284
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,570
Potent. You can feel it
when you pick them up.

285
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
I sent a couple to New York.

286
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,490
I have a friend down there.
Terrific fellow.

287
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,080
He has a gallery.
I wanted to hear his opinion.

288
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,370
Of course the scale is wrong.
Get bigger.

289
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,170
Let yourself go.
Get some size into it.

290
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,670
Do you like fish?
We're having fish for lunch.

291
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,950
Interesting, huh?

292
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,660
Oh, yes.

293
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,620
Fidel, that's his name.

294
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,790
Women love him.
They're crazy about him.

295
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,790
He has a big schlong.

296
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,370
Huge.

297
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,130
Well, there you are.
Scale again. Size.

298
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,880
Who knows, maybe it's a masculine thing.

299
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:59,680
They say women don't care. I'm in
the middle myself. How about you?

300
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,640
How about me, what?

301
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,140
See, women are in touch
with different things.

302
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,230
That's my opinion. It's not a
fashionable one right now, but fuck it!

303
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,230
I see men running around,
putting their dicks...

304
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,200
into everything,
trying to make something happen.

305
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,370
But it's women who are the source,
the only power.

306
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,490
Nature. Birth. Rebirth.

307
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,960
Cliché. Cliché.

308
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Sure. But true.

309
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,840
Why are you telling me this?

310
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,210
You're an honest woman.
I'm being honest with you.

311
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,720
I like women. I admire them.

312
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,350
But if you want me to treat you
like a dumb twit, I will.

313
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,810
But what for? You have brains, Alex.

314
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,440
More than brains. But you don't
know it. Most women don't.

315
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,980
Are you married?

316
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,360
Good question!

317
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,110
You see? Brains.

318
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,360
The answer is no.
I don't believe in it.

319
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,200
Good for the man.
Lousy for the woman.

320
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,000
She dies. She suffocates.
I've seen it. Then the husband...

321
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,040
complains to everyone that
he's fucking a dead person.

322
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,590
And he's the one who killed her.

323
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
- Where is your husband?
- Dead.

324
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,390
Sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones.

325
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,890
When a woman unloads a husband
or a husband unloads a woman...

326
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,560
however it happens...
the three Ds.

327
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,230
When that happens, a woman blooms.
She blossoms.

328
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,070
Like flowers. Like fruit.

329
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,570
She is ripe.

330
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,910
That's the woman for me.

331
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,090
Would you like to see my house?

332
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,800
Yes.

333
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,260
In case anybody ever...

334
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,590
needed any exercise...

335
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,850
the pool is right over there,
past the piano...

336
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,430
where the ballroom used to be.

337
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,270
Interesting word, "ballroom."

338
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,940
It's one of my favorites.

339
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,110
Over there is...

340
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,360
my study.

341
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,120
Oh.

342
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,620
- This is my bedroom.
- Yes, it is.

343
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,370
The Borgias once owned the bed.

344
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,960
Of course, you have to pay for it
with your soul, but...

345
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,300
what the hell,
I deserve a little luxury.

346
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,880
You have to take care of yourself.

347
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,760
No one will do that for you, will they?

348
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,640
Hmm?

349
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,730
Ha. Ha-ha.
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,820
Being as direct with you as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

351
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,740
I always like a little pussy
after lunch. What do you say?

352
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,830
- Hmm?
- Are you trying to seduce me?

353
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,830
I wouldn't dream of seducing you,
Alexandra.

354
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,330
I wouldn't insult your intelligence...

355
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,670
with anything as trivial
as seduction.

356
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,380
But, I would love to fuck you.

357
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,390
I have to admit that I appreciate
your directness, Daryl.

358
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,020
I will try to be as direct...

359
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,560
and honest with you
as I possibly can be.

360
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,770
I think...

361
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,950
No, I am positive that you are the most
unattractive man I have ever met...

362
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,910
in my entire life.

363
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,990
This afternoon, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic...

364
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,080
of the male personality
and even added some new ones.

365
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,500
You are physically repulsive,
intellectually retarded...

366
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,630
morally reprehensible, vulgar,
insensitive, selfish, stupid.

367
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,090
You have no taste, no sense of humor
and you smell.

368
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,100
You're not even interesting enough
to make me sick.

369
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,390
Um... Would you like to be
on top or the bottom?

370
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,570
Goodbye, Daryl, and thank you
for a lovely lunch.

371
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,740
If that's the way you feel about it...

372
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,450
that's the way you feel about it.

373
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,820
Is that the way you feel about it?

374
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,620
Who are you?

375
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,840
Just your...

376
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,920
average horny little devil.

377
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,630
I have to get home.

378
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,720
What have you got to go home to?

379
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,350
There isn't anybody there, is there?

380
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,930
The kid will take care of herself.

381
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
She'll eat and fall asleep
on the bed doing homework.

382
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,610
I promise.

383
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,280
And housecleaning?

384
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,280
You clean up the dirt,
there's just more dirt tomorrow.

385
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,910
Make the beds, they just
have to be made tomorrow.

386
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,490
Wash the dishes.
There's more to wash tomorrow.

387
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,660
- I have to make...
- Make dinner?

388
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,620
It just gets eaten.

389
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,790
You've done your best, Alex.

390
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,880
You've done the wife bit,
the motherhood bit.

391
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,470
The car pools, the vegetable garden...

392
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,800
the needlepoint,
the macramé potholders...

393
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,970
a cup of coffee with
a neighbor in the morning...

394
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,480
a couple of drinks,
a couple of pills...

395
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,400
a little psychoanalysis...

396
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,320
Where are you now, Alex?

397
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,280
Exactly where I want to be
and I'm doing fine.

398
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,660
Pretending to be somebody else?
To be half of what you are?

399
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,330
How long can you last like that?

400
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,540
The world keeps growing,
and you feed it.

401
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,830
But it doesn't feed you, does it?

402
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,840
It washes through you,
down the drain, wasted.

403
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,720
A woman is a hole,
isn't that what they say?

404
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,510
All the futility of the world
pouring into her.

405
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,510
Hmm?

406
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,850
How much can you take, Alex?
How much can you take...

407
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,020
before you snap?

408
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,530
Lying on your bed,
looking at the ceiling...

409
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,700
waiting for something to happen.

410
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,450
And knowing all the time that you
were meant for something better.

411
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,660
Feeling it.

412
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,450
Wanting it.

413
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,460
Use me, Alex.

414
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,880
Use me.

415
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,710
Fill me up. I can take it.

416
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,010
Make it happen. Don't wait.

417
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,390
Time is the killer.

418
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,720
Make it happen.

419
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,560
Do it, Alex.

420
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,560
Do it now.

421
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,530
You know...

422
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
You sit there in that...

423
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,710
pathetic excuse of an office...

424
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,290
reporting gossip...

425
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,420
while under your very nose...

426
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,630
evil...

427
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
is doing its worst.

428
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,140
You have no spine, Clyde.

429
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,230
Not one ounce...

430
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,150
of morality.

431
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,650
Christ!

432
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,160
Even common sense.

433
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,200
Nuclear holocaust.

434
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,830
Murder.

435
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,290
Rape. Apartheid!

436
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,330
Why, these words mean nothing to you.

437
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
It's just a local newspaper.

438
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,470
It is local turpitude.

439
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,680
You are a failure, Clyde!
You should be strung up...

440
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,100
along with that son of a bitch
who bought that house!

441
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,850
Call the nurse!

442
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,030
I am in pain!

443
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,370
- Then take the pill.
- I don't want to.

444
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,040
I'm not going to force it on you.

445
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,250
Is it Alzheimer's?

446
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,880
No. It's the bone marrow.
When a bone breaks...

447
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,710
bits of fat get in the bloodstream
and the blood vessels of the brain.

448
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,630
It affects the behavior.

449
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,140
She's hysterical. She says things that
I don't know where they're coming from.

450
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,680
It's bone marrow?

451
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,230
Yes. She'll be very upset.
She'll say terrible things.

452
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,560
She may even be paranoid.

453
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,110
It is perfectly normal. It will pass.

454
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,250
What's happening to me, Clyde?

455
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,210
It's all right, sweetheart.

456
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,760
I open my mouth and
the strangest things come out.

457
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,730
You've had a hard time
and you're tired. Try to sleep.

458
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,450
Something is inside me, Clyde.

459
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,500
Something is crawling inside me.

460
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,250
I can feel it.

461
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,790
Something evil.

462
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,800
It's almost here.

463
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,090
Hi.

464
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,720
You!

465
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,640
In there!

466
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,950
Jane.

467
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,860
At last we meet.

468
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,370
Daryl Van Horne.

469
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,170
Cream and sugar?

470
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,670
Sugar.

471
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,720
- One lump or two?
- Four.

472
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,890
- Sweet tooth.
- Sweet everything.

473
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,230
I'm a sugar junkie.
Sugar, chocolate, Coca-Cola...

474
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,730
Uncontrollable appetite.
In every department.

475
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,860
That's not good for you.

476
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,240
It doesn't bother me.

477
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,080
I have a supernatural constitution.
It's genetic.

478
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,540
I don't hold on
this health consciousness shit.

479
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,380
Pardon the language.

480
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,340
I see guys, 60...

481
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,920
70, breaking their balls...

482
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,920
to stay fit. What for?

483
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,220
When I die, I want to be sick,
not healthy.

484
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,930
I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

485
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,430
Oh.

486
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,390
Do I make you nervous?

487
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,810
Yes, you do.

488
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,770
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

489
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Truth is best.

490
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,450
Yes, that's so true.

491
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,630
So what brings you to Eastwick?

492
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,880
Ah.

493
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,800
We're going to have
a polite conversation.

494
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,260
I'm sorry.

495
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,090
No, I don't mind.

496
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,930
I came to Eastwick
because I was drawn here.

497
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,640
I needed a place to settle down and...

498
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,600
I liked the house.

499
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,110
It has a history.

500
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,480
Rubbish.

501
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,320
No, it's true.

502
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,160
They say they used
to burn witches there.

503
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,330
Hocus-pocus.

504
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,160
The entire witchcraft scare...

505
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:26,130
as far back as the 14th century,
was started by the medical profession.

506
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,920
That's right.

507
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,760
They were trying to get midwives
out of the child-birthing business.

508
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,680
That's what most of the women
they burned were. Midwives.

509
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,470
Is that true?

510
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,180
You better believe it.

511
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,690
Just another example of
male-dominated professional society...

512
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,190
exploiting females
for their own selfish purposes.

513
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,650
Men are such cocksuckers, aren't they?

514
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,700
You don't have to answer that.
It's true.

515
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,580
Their dicks get limp...

516
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,790
when confronted by a powerful woman,
so what do they do?

517
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,880
Call them witches.
Burn them, torture them...

518
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,710
until every woman is afraid.
Afraid of herself...

519
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,720
afraid of men.

520
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,890
And all for what?

521
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,560
Fear of losing their hard-on.

522
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,810
Let's play some music.

523
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,370
Mm.

524
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,270
You play beautifully.

525
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,270
Nothing compared to you.

526
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,440
You're an artist.

527
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,940
Intonation.

528
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,610
Vibrato. Stretch.

529
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,110
You think I'm crazy, but I know music.

530
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,410
It's the one thing that makes me humble.

531
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,080
Not prissy? Our leader says
my intonation is prissy.

532
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,210
You have precision.

533
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:35,130
Precision is not prissy.
Precision is the foundation of passion.

534
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,970
Passion without precision? Chaos.

535
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,100
Look at your thumb.
Your sublime thumb position.

536
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,640
You really keep the pressure on.

537
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,140
Most men can't, but you...

538
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,560
You have the most beautiful callus.

539
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,320
This hand.

540
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,490
This is your failure.
Your bowing sucks.

541
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,990
My bowing? Why?

542
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,960
Your spiccato sounds like marcato.
Your legato like détaché.

543
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,670
You kill the passion. Let it go.
Why are you holding back?

544
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,460
These aren't just notes
you're playing...

545
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,510
they're phrases. Human outcries.

546
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,510
I understand that! And I practice!

547
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,140
I practice until my fingers bleed!

548
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,810
I know.

549
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,190
It's the sixteenth notes in the allegro.
I can't do it!

550
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,020
Yes, you can.

551
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,820
It's no good.

552
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,030
I don't have it.

553
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,530
I can't do it.

554
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,700
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't, I can't.

555
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,370
Trust me.

556
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,670
Trust me.

557
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:08,390
Try.

558
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,690
Let it go. Don't be afraid.

559
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,820
You have great passion in you.
Let it out.

560
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,230
I can take it.

561
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,070
I want it.

562
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,620
Yes.

563
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,590
Yes, that's it.

564
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,090
Relax. Just breathe into it.

565
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,430
Don't tighten up. That's it.

566
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,390
Feel it. Hold it. Love it.

567
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,270
That's it, yes.

568
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,060
Yes, that's right. Now!

569
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,070
That's right. Do you feel that?

570
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,990
Let it wash over you.
Let it tickle you.

571
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,950
Did you miss me?

572
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,110
- Yes.
- Good. I missed you too.

573
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,870
- Like my new top?
- Yeah, it's cute.

574
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,990
Do you want to listen to some tapes?

575
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,870
Alex! Yoo-hoo.

576
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,880
I'm out here!

577
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,750
- Let's go.
- What is that?

578
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,050
We're going to be late.
Carol, the number is on the fridge!

579
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,890
- But you're not dressed.
- I'm not naked.

580
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,350
- I don't believe it!
- Neither do I!

581
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,730
But I swear to God,
I couldn't walk for two days.

582
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,190
His penis is amazing.
It bends the wrong way.

583
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,440
The wrong...? Wait a minute!

584
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,570
It bends like that!

585
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,200
- You're terrible.
- No, I'm fabulous.

586
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,620
But just because you went
to bed with him...

587
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,910
No, it's not just that!
It's like he knows me.

588
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,210
He knows everything!
I can't wait for you to meet him.

589
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,260
And I can't wait for Jane to meet him!
Jane will love him!

590
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,640
Jane?

591
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,060
Is that you?

592
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,060
Sukie. Alexandra.

593
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,940
Did you come to fix the plumbing?

594
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,480
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

595
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,650
I don't need any. I was invited.

596
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,940
So was I.

597
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,450
Hello!

598
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,610
Mm. Darling!

599
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,910
There you are.

600
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,620
- Are we late?
- Not at all.

601
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,290
Weren't we playing singles?

602
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,540
- You don't play tennis.
- I do now.

603
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,790
Sukie. At last we meet.

604
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,540
Hi. Hello. How are you?

605
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,460
Let me...

606
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,800
look at those eyes of yours.

607
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,800
You are a fertile creature, aren't you?

608
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,310
Thank you, I think.

609
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,140
I'm reading that rag of a newspaper.
You are a genius.

610
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,650
Wasted. Pearls before swine.

611
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,480
When are we going to do our interview?
I love interviews.

612
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,110
- They're so intimate.
- Anytime you say.

613
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,280
Just the two of us,
banging away, head to head.

614
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,990
Yes, yes.

615
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,410
But not today.

616
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,500
Today is for tennis.
Are you ready, ladies?

617
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:54,340
What a day!

618
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,850
Is that your perfume?

619
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,490
Double fault!

620
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,530
I'm not blind or deaf!
You don't have to shout!

621
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,490
We're all good friends.
Let's play fair.

622
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,330
I always play fair, okay?
Love-forty, Jane.

623
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,380
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

624
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,090
- What do you mean?
- Don't let them rattle you.

625
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,880
They're just trying to get you.
Let's go.

626
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,890
- Uhn!
- Ah.

627
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,060
Sorry, darling. Lost my head.

628
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,730
Fault.

629
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,830
Ow!

630
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,760
I've got it! I've got it!

631
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,890
It's not coming down.

632
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,790
Come on.

633
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,290
Our game. Sukie serves.

634
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,290
Stop!

635
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,530
Good going, Daryl.

636
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,050
Jane!

637
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,170
Strong drink. What is it?

638
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,210
Rum... vodka...

639
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,090
brandy...

640
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,590
acid.

641
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm only kidding.

642
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,140
I don't mind.
Drugs have no effect on me.

643
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,430
- Really?
- Neither does alcohol.

644
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,600
It's true. It's boring, but it's true.

645
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,230
Are you going to seduce me too?

646
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,110
Yes.

647
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,410
How?

648
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,410
I don't know.

649
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,290
I should warn you. I get pregnant.

650
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,630
I get pregnant all the time.
At the drop of a hat.

651
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,090
I could borrow your toothbrush
and get pregnant.

652
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,970
I'll keep that in mind.

653
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,720
That doesn't bother you?

654
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,260
No.

655
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,810
You're not like other men.

656
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,270
- I'm not.
- Uhn-uhn.

657
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,980
Most men, well, my husband,
try to keep everything under control...

658
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,650
pretend everything is normal.

659
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,990
Always rational,
always an explanation for everything.

660
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,000
Men need that, don't they?
To feel everything is solid.

661
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,960
And the world just isn't like that.

662
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,340
Certainly not with you three around.

663
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,090
I don't think...

664
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,980
We're not so different from other women.

665
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,360
Women are more natural, right?

666
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,200
And nature is crazy,
no matter what science says.

667
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,370
So I don't mind.

668
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:58,710
I don't mind when peculiar things
happen. It's natural...

669
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,580
because the world
is a peculiar place.

670
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,380
And you're a very peculiar person.

671
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,800
Thank you.

672
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,510
I would love to be a woman.

673
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,180
You would? Really? Why?

674
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,060
Just look what you can do
with your bodies.

675
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,730
Make babies and...

676
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,400
make milk to feed the babies.

677
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
If I could do that...

678
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Who are you, really?

679
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,250
Anybody you want me to be.

680
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,070
Look at what they can do.

681
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,570
These are human beings.

682
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,920
When you're a kid
and don't understand anything...

683
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,420
you think when you grow up
it will all make sense.

684
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,890
Then when you grow up,
you keep waiting for the day.

685
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,850
You think it ever happens?

686
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,520
It starts when you open your eyes and realize
what the future has in store for you.

687
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,110
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

688
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,450
Well...

689
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,320
It's a short life, isn't it?

690
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,870
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I see everything...

691
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,000
disintegrating faster and faster.

692
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,670
I always see snakes.

693
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,010
Hundreds of them.

694
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,010
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

695
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,680
Then I'm just not there anymore.

696
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,360
Well, I don't mind that it's a short life
or growing old or disappearing.

697
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:39,030
It's the pain that scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

698
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,530
so much pain.

699
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah, well...

700
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,040
We don't deal the deck
down here, we just...

701
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,540
play the percentages.

702
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,860
Whores.

703
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:49,680
What?

704
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,560
- Whores!
- Shh, shh, shh.

705
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,400
- Whores.
- Sit down, sit down.

706
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,440
Look around you.

707
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,110
Look around you.
Do you see what's happening?

708
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,450
In our town.

709
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,200
In our very homes!

710
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,790
You know who I'm talking about.
You know!

711
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,960
You know what's going on in that house!
Vice!

712
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,460
Perversions!

713
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,630
Shamelessness!

714
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,720
Cavorting...

715
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:27,090
with that devil!

716
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,260
She's fine. She's sick.

717
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,980
No! Drugs! Drugs are next.

718
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,640
Murder!

719
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,480
Rape!

720
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,230
Incest!

721
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,320
Spanish flies!

722
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,150
Dildos! Anal intercourse!

723
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,330
Listen to me!

724
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,120
- Please.
- Sorry!

725
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,180
Let's go home, Felicia.

726
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,680
You employ one of them, Clyde.

727
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,770
That's nobody's business.

728
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,650
Oh-ho. It is everybody's business!

729
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,950
You know, once there was a paradise.

730
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,530
Then a serpent came into that garden.

731
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,700
For Christ's sake, Felicia,
would you stop?

732
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,210
Oh, Clyde.

733
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,710
I have nothing against a good fuck.

734
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,630
But there is danger here.

735
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,720
Somebody has to do something about it.

736
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,420
Okay, stop.

737
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,590
Stop! Stop.

738
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,050
Um...

739
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,430
Let's get rid of the music.

740
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,270
Throw it away! Get rid of it.
Let's get rid of the music.

741
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,600
That's it! Right. Okay, now...

742
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:42,440
I want you all to close your eyes.

743
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,940
Take a deep breath.

744
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,280
Let it all out.

745
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,780
Now pick up your instrument...

746
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,540
and when I count to four...

747
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,750
we'll play the shit
out of this thing.

748
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:08,840
One, two, three, four.

749
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,140
That's it, just relax.

750
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,810
Take it easy. Good.

751
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,480
Nice!

752
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,810
Smile.

753
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,480
Come on, smile, Martha.

754
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:32,570
That's it, this is fun.
Come on, this is easy.

755
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:36,320
Easy-peasy. That's it, that's it. Good.

756
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,580
Just let it flow over you. Good.

757
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,840
Let it tickle you now.

758
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:51,460
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

759
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:54,180
Good! You've got it now. Come on!

760
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,550
Go with it, it's yours! Come on!

761
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,140
Good! Yes!

762
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,980
See? You can do it. That's it.
You're doing great. Flow with it.

763
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,320
That's it, yes!

764
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:13,030
These aren't phrases,
these are human outcries!

765
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,970
Oh.

766
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,390
Double-double chocolate.
These are fabulous.

767
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,020
Mm-mm.

768
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,700
Excuse me.

769
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,680
Are you buying the paper or not?

770
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,760
- Um...
- Slut.

771
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,180
What did you say?

772
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,770
You heard her.

773
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,620
Did you see her socks?

774
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,790
She's not wearing a bra.

775
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,830
How could you do this?

776
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,580
We didn't use any names
except for Van Horne.

777
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,710
You don't know what goes on there.

778
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,670
The whole town is talking
about you and your friends.

779
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,130
This is so unfair. It's also untrue.

780
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,180
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

781
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,890
He filled in the wetlands
and ruined it for the birds.

782
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:08,350
He altered the landmark building...

783
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,100
and the town is suing him
for $2 million.

784
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,400
How can you do this to me?

785
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,990
I work very hard and you know
I'm a good writer.

786
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:18,820
All right, Sukie, all right.

787
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,450
- What?
- Look, look.

788
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,490
I don't own the newspaper, you know.

789
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
It's Felicia, isn't it?

790
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,250
She's a...

791
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,710
very sick woman.

792
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,340
She's having a very bad time.
And I don't know what to do.

793
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,340
I want her to see a doctor.

794
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,350
Well, not a doctor, you know,
but a... doctor.

795
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:54,900
Clyde.

796
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,360
We went to high school together.

797
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,780
She was a catch.

798
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:10,460
Ever since the accident, she just
hasn't been the same. And now...

799
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,550
I'm so sorry, Clyde.

800
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,140
What am I doing?

801
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,980
Firing me.

802
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,390
Oh.

803
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,230
All these terrible things she says...

804
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,320
they're not true, are they?

805
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,120
We should stop seeing each other.

806
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:52,250
- Oh, let's not overreact.
- Yes, let's not overreact.

807
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,000
- I think we should.
- It's a small town, Daryl.

808
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,210
We haven't done anything.
Why stop seeing each other?

809
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,010
Clyde says that Felicia has visions.

810
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,930
Why is it always women
who have visions?

811
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,010
She sees the devil here in Eastwick.

812
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,430
If you were the devil,
would you come to Eastwick?

813
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,010
Oh, I don't know.

814
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,220
Poor Felicia.

815
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:15,060
Poor Felicia? She talked
to all of my students' mothers.

816
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,980
I had 12 cancellations this week.

817
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,650
People tell Carol her mother is a dyke.

818
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,530
You're being sued for millions.

819
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,440
That is inconvenient.

820
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,030
She's not kidding about
her medieval morality.

821
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,780
I think Sukie is right.
Maybe we should stop.

822
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,330
Maybe she should stop.

823
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,870
You can't be serious.
We're a family.

824
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,960
Just for a while
until things settle down.

825
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,670
Don't let her get to you.

826
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,460
Have a cherry.

827
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,150
They are selling pornography
at Schyler's News Shop.

828
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,820
In the open. On the shelves.

829
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,490
Children are looking at this...

830
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,320
It's in broad daylight.

831
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,990
I can't understand one word
you're saying. Not one!

832
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,500
They're standing in line...

833
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,630
Filth in broad daylight.

834
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,380
Right.

835
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,390
She made a scene at Schyler's.

836
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,860
Grabbing magazines from kids
and chasing them.

837
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,280
She's in pain. Clyde too.
He started drinking again.

838
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,570
She's twisted. Getting to me
through my kid is sick.

839
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,740
- We could help.
- By putting her out of her misery.

840
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,490
Please.
They're lucky to have each other.

841
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,040
If they don't appreciate that,
I have no sympathy.

842
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,290
Easy for you to say.
You don't have kids or a family.

843
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:05,880
You're my family.
I don't want to lose it.

844
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,880
I just can't stand to see you upset.

845
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,550
You don't know what it does to me.

846
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,890
I wish she would just go away.

847
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,900
Have another cherry.

848
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,580
He's trying to get inside me.

849
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,340
He's trying to use me.

850
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,090
And he's using these women too.

851
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,260
He wants to take our goodness.

852
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,690
He wants to get inside me.

853
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,440
Just like a man.

854
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,030
Tickle, tickle, diddle, diddle.

855
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:16,780
God made us in the image of goodness.
Look what we've become.

856
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,620
Animals gone mad...

857
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,380
devouring the earth and each other.

858
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,550
Eat, eat, eat, eat!

859
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,550
Felicia, calm down.

860
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,980
I know who he is, Clyde.

861
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,150
Have another cherry.

862
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,670
What have you been eating?

863
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,340
Those poor women.

864
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,510
I have to warn them.

865
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,350
He'll propagate, Clyde.

866
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,520
He will increase his number.

867
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:30,360
Those women are going to bear him sons.

868
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:35,780
He's going to take their love
and destroy the earth with it.

869
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,390
Let's call it a day.

870
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,090
- I don't believe it.
- I know.

871
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,310
I know him. He couldn't do this.

872
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,560
Alex, don't you get it? God!

873
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,850
Get what?

874
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,150
Us!

875
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,320
Last night, all that talk.

876
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,400
Those were just words.

877
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,660
They make things happen.
We make things happen.

878
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:43,280
- We had nothing to do with this.
- Yes, we do!

879
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,910
We should talk to Daryl.

880
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,910
Why? Why do we have to do
everything Daryl says?

881
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,370
She's right.

882
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,330
Some man comes along
and nothing else matters!

883
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,500
You are so dumb, Jane.

884
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,090
- This is about us, not Daryl.
- Let's call him.

885
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,970
Can't you stop thinking
from between your legs?

886
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,430
You bitch!

887
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,930
Alex, don't.

888
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,970
- Shut up, Sukie!
- Will you get off of her?

889
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,730
Anybody call?

890
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,860
- Hello?
- Hi.

891
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:42,610
<i>- Daryl?{\i}
- Yeah. Remember me?</i>

892
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:44,860
How are you?

893
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:49,780
I'm hanging in there.
What do you want?

894
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:55,210
Nothing. I just called
to see how you are, you know?

895
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,290
<i>See how things were going.{\i}</i>

896
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,460
I'm fine.

897
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:08,840
I wanted to see how you were,
you know?

898
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,810
Make sure you were okay.

899
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:16,480
Make sure you didn't have any
uncontrollable desire to see me.

900
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:22,360
<i>In case you were missing me and{\i}
you were too embarrassed to call...{\i}</i>

901
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:24,110
I called first.

902
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,950
Then you could feel superior
and see me at the same time.

903
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,240
<i>What do you say?{\i}</i>

904
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,580
I don't feel superior. I feel terrible.

905
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,290
I feel terrible too.

906
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,920
If we both feel terrible,
can't we do something about it?

907
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,590
What's going on here?

908
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,760
Nobody's calling me.
Nobody's coming to see me.

909
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,800
- No...
- I just think we need some time.

910
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,470
We need a little time, okay?

911
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,140
No, it's not okay, Alex.
I don't understand.

912
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,230
Somebody died, Daryl.
Felicia is dead.

913
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,110
Yeah, well...

914
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,480
People die all the time.
She was in a bad way.

915
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,320
It has nothing to do with us.

916
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:12,580
I can't talk to you.
Don't call me, because I...

917
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,080
<i>Don't hang up!{\i}</i>

918
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,750
Alex, don't do this! This is not fair!

919
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,210
Happy birthday!

920
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,040
It's not my birthday.

921
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,090
It isn't?

922
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,090
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

923
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,890
Well, what the hell.

924
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:15,890
Happy whatever day.

925
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,390
These are my favorite fruit.

926
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,980
I can't accept those, Daryl.

927
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,240
I'm freezing my nuts off out here.

928
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,070
I can't ask you in, I'm sorry.

929
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:38,660
Not even for a little while?
Just to dry off.

930
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,000
Talk to the kids maybe.

931
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,250
No. You have to go away.

932
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,590
You have to go away now.
I can't see you or talk to you.

933
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,260
I'm sorry, Daryl, but I can't!

934
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:32,300
Jane?

935
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,440
Hello.

936
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,980
Give me that.

937
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,760
Mrs. Spofford?
What's wrong with me?

938
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,010
Nothing. You're pregnant.

939
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,850
Three or four weeks.

940
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,020
Are you sure?

941
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:33,650
I thought something was really wrong.
Are you sure?

942
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,900
Do you need a doctor?
We could recommend...

943
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:37,660
No, no, no, I... No.

944
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,530
Thank you so much.

945
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,700
Mrs. Spofford, your clothes.

946
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,300
<i>Do you think it ever happens?{\i}.</i>

947
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,050
<i>It starts when you open your eyes...{\i}</i>

948
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,720
<i>and realize what the future{\i}
has in store for you.{\i}.</i>

949
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:06,770
<i>And what do you see{\i}
when you open your eyes?{\i}.</i>

950
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,060
<i>Well, short life.{\i}</i>

951
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,230
I want to surprise him.

952
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,250
<i>It's a short life, isn't it?{\i}.</i>

953
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,420
<i>I look in the mirror{\i}
and see everything...{\i}</i>

954
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:35,590
<i>disintegrating faster and faster.{\i}</i>

955
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,090
<i>it's a short life, isn't it?{\i}.</i>

956
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,430
<i>I look in the mirror{\i}
and see everything...{\i}</i>

957
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,930
<i>disintegrating faster and faster.{\i}.</i>

958
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:26,140
<i>They crawl all over me and I disappear.{\i}.</i>

959
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,470
<i>Then I'm just not there anymore.{\i}</i>

960
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,980
Alex!

961
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,850
<i>I always see snakes.{\i}.</i>

962
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,150
<i>Hundreds of them.{\i}.</i>

963
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:41,900
<i>They crawl all over me and I disappear.{\i}
Then I'm just not there.{\i}</i>

964
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,030
Alex, it's me.

965
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:33,710
It's me. Just let it go. Let it go!
Look at me!

966
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,630
Let it go. That's it. Just let it go.

967
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,550
<i>Pain scares me.{\i}
I don't know why there has to be...{\i}</i>

968
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,220
<i>so much pain.{\i}.</i>

969
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,900
<i>I don't know why there has to be...{\i}</i>

970
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,980
<i>so much pain.{\i}.</i>

971
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,640
Can we talk?

972
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:21,230
She's still hemorrhaging.
We slowed it down, but...

973
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,610
Will she be all right?

974
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,900
If we knew what was wrong,
we'd have a chance.

975
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,400
Can we see her?

976
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:31,160
She's in a lot of pain.
I can't give her anything...

977
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,830
until we know what
we're dealing with.

978
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,500
Okay. Go ahead.

979
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,840
Sweetheart,
the doctor says you'll be fine.

980
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,840
He doesn't know what's going on.

981
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,600
Easy.

982
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:59,430
I'm pregnant.

983
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,360
So am I.

984
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,780
Alex?

985
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,700
That son of a bitch.

986
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,710
Make him stop, please.
Make him stop.

987
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,920
I will, honey. I will.

988
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,560
Back off, Fidel!

989
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:44,940
Daryl? Daryl!

990
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,400
<i>Tara Flavor, come on down!{\i}.</i>

991
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:57,410
Daryl?

992
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,080
Alex?

993
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,460
- Don't "Alex" me.
- What a nice surprise.

994
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:04,540
What the hell do you think you're doing?

995
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:07,340
I said, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

996
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,340
A little housework.

997
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:14,760
I've been sending these shirts out,
but Jesus, they come back in pieces.

998
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,760
Small town.

999
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,100
Not enough Orientals.

1000
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:22,430
Fidel's all thumbs
with this kind of thing.

1001
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,600
That just leaves me.

1002
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:28,070
I'm not talking about your damn laundry,
I'm talking about...

1003
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,280
Sukie and Jane and me.

1004
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:36,450
Golly. You girls sure are having
a hard time, aren't you?

1005
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,700
Sukie is very ill.

1006
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,540
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

1007
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,540
Then do something about it!

1008
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,130
Me? What can I do about it?

1009
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:52,840
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

1010
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,840
It does, and you know it does!

1011
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,930
No, I don't.

1012
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:02,180
All I know is we were friends
and the next day I was shut out.

1013
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,060
That's all I know.

1014
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,440
One minute I was the answer
to your prayers.

1015
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:11,150
Five minutes later, you wouldn't
give me the time of the day.

1016
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:14,490
Sukie could die!
Don't you understand that?

1017
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:18,490
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can. Don't lie to me.

1018
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,990
You deserted me.

1019
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,540
We had a deal.

1020
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,670
- That's no reason...
- Yes, it is.

1021
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,710
You pissed me off!

1022
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,000
Was I supposed to take it like a man?

1023
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:32,460
I gave you everything I got!

1024
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:35,840
I gave you more than anybody ever has,
and what do I get in exchange?

1025
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,260
A little thank you?
A little gratitude?

1026
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:40,550
I get screwed!

1027
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,850
Oh, cut the crap!
What do you want from us?

1028
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:47,020
I want somebody to do these shirts!

1029
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:51,690
I want somebody to pay attention to me!
I want some respect!

1030
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:55,490
I want somebody to take care
of me for a change!

1031
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,900
Huh? How about that?

1032
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,370
What do I want? Christ!

1033
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,040
What does any man want?

1034
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,710
A little affection.

1035
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,370
A little trust.

1036
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,460
Goddamn it.

1037
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,380
Everything I did, I did for you.

1038
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,430
I was wrong.

1039
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,310
Go ahead.

1040
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,060
Go back to your miserable little life.
Fuck me if I care!

1041
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,320
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

1042
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,490
You are not the only three women
in the world.

1043
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:41,910
You're hurting people, Daryl.

1044
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:45,240
What you did for us was great.

1045
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,000
But you can't use your power
to hurt people.

1046
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,420
Don't you understand that?

1047
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,960
No.

1048
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:57,920
I want my family back together,
that's all.

1049
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,260
You...

1050
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,260
and Sukie...

1051
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:04,100
and Jane.

1052
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,770
I couldn't hurt Sukie.

1053
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:10,190
I couldn't hurt any of you.
How could I?

1054
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,100
I love you.

1055
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,060
You don't know what love is.

1056
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,860
I can learn.
You could teach me.

1057
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,860
How hard can it be?

1058
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,950
Oh, Alex, let's not fight.

1059
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,450
You can't win.
There's no way you can win.

1060
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:30,080
There's nothing to go back to,
even if you could win.

1061
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,870
Can't we just...

1062
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:34,960
put this behind us and be friends?

1063
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,640
There.

1064
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,560
See?

1065
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:49,640
Isn't that nice?

1066
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,520
Tell the truth.

1067
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,320
You missed me a little bit, didn't you?

1068
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,190
Huh?

1069
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,820
Yeah, I have.

1070
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:06,320
So let's kiss and make it better.

1071
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,250
Huh? What do you say?

1072
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:15,000
What are we going to do with you?

1073
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,590
It stopped.

1074
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,070
Darling, you look perfect.

1075
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,030
Mm.

1076
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,750
Hi.

1077
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,130
You look gorgeous.

1078
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:40,670
Thank you.

1079
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,090
Feeling better?

1080
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:45,920
Much better now.
Everything's going to be much better now.

1081
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:33,470
Fidel.

1082
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,390
We're going to town.

1083
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:40,940
The ladies have a craving
for bagels and ice cream.

1084
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,020
Three pinches.

1085
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:14,570
I'd like...

1086
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:19,160
a dozen bagels, a pound of gravlax and
what kind of ice cream do you have?

1087
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:21,830
No ice cream. The freezer's broken.

1088
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,080
Ice cream.

1089
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:28,210
Um... Well, ahem,
I'll just take the bread and the fish.

1090
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,010
It doesn't look like him.

1091
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:39,970
It doesn't have to. We know who it is.

1092
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:43,350
He looks funny with no hair.

1093
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,770
It won't hurt him, will it?

1094
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,110
- No. We just want to send him away.
- Jane, come on.

1095
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,530
No ice cream. Imagine that.

1096
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,780
I'll go see if I can't get some.
You go shopping.

1097
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:08,290
I said, "A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse."

1098
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:10,300
"Somebody nice."

1099
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:12,460
"Somebody you could talk to."

1100
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:18,800
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1101
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:21,970
I'd like some pistachio.
That is pistachio?

1102
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,520
And some chocolate-chocolate chip.

1103
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,030
- Are you okay?
- No, my leg!

1104
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,950
Jesus Christ!

1105
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,700
What is it?

1106
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:46,160
What's the matter?

1107
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,380
Are you having a heart attack?

1108
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:22,030
Girls!

1109
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:25,200
Girls? What are you doing?

1110
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:31,960
Girls! Girls! Please, don't!

1111
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,450
Elijah fled to the mount of God.

1112
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:12,250
The Lord passed by and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains...

1113
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:14,590
and breaked in pieces
the rocks before the Lord...

1114
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,450
Sorry.

1115
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,290
Just having a little trouble.

1116
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
A little... trouble at home.

1117
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,630
A little domestic problem.

1118
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:08,310
Nothing to be alarmed at.

1119
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:15,020
Just a little female problem.

1120
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,000
Don't pay any attention.

1121
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,540
It's a cheap trick.

1122
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,170
Anybody can do it.
I taught it to them myself.

1123
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:41,670
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they?

1124
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:45,680
I want to ask you something.
You all go to church.

1125
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:52,430
Do you think God knew what he
was doing when he created woman? Huh?

1126
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,890
No shit! I really want to know.

1127
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:58,360
Or do you think it was
one of his minor mistakes?

1128
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,030
Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods!

1129
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:05,910
Do you think women are like that?

1130
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,840
What's the matter?

1131
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:30,220
You don't think God makes mistakes?

1132
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:34,230
Of course he does.

1133
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,890
We all make mistakes.

1134
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,730
Of course, we make mistakes,
they call it evil.

1135
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,410
When God makes mistakes,
they call it nature.

1136
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,910
So what do you think?

1137
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,960
Women. A mistake?

1138
01:42:56,790 --> 01:43:01,090
Or did he do it to us on purpose?

1139
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:03,250
I really want to know!

1140
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,970
If it's a mistake, maybe we can
do something about it!

1141
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,090
Find a cure!

1142
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:12,260
Invent a vaccine.

1143
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:17,390
Build up our immune systems.

1144
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:25,190
Get a little exercise.

1145
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,780
You know. Twenty pushups a day...

1146
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,790
and you never have to be afflicted
with women, ever again!

1147
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,690
All right, that's it.

1148
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,990
How do we know it worked?

1149
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,660
I guess we just wait and see.

1150
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,500
My God, look at this place.

1151
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:21,420
- Just in case.
- Okay.

1152
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,200
No!

1153
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,280
Here, here. Quick. Okay.

1154
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,220
The doll.

1155
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,460
- Jane! Jane.
- Aah!

1156
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:34,080
Jane, laugh!

1157
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,980
Come here, you.

1158
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:47,780
Come on, sweet pea, come on. Oh.

1159
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:51,530
Come on, little mookie boy, come on.

1160
01:51:57,790 --> 01:52:00,540
What a big guy! Sweetheart.

1161
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:05,460
Look at Fidel.
What does he have for you?

1162
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,150
Janey, stop it.

1163
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:30,150
What?

1164
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:31,950
Just stop it.

1165
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,700
I can think about him if I want to.

1166
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:36,660
Not when we're all together.

1167
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:38,790
I miss him. I can't help it.

1168
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,910
I do, and so do you. Admit it.

1169
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,670
Okay, we admit it.

1170
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,540
Do you want him back?

1171
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,230
<i>Take it easy.{\i}.</i>

1172
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,900
<i>We don't want the whole household{\i}
in here, do we?{\i}.</i>

1173
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:47,400
<i>That's it. Good boys.{\i}.</i>

1174
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:49,940
<i>We're going to do just fine.{\i}.</i>

1175
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:55,110
<i>Come to Daddy and give me a big kiss.{\i}.</i>

1176
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,530
<i>Come on. Good boys. Come on.{\i}.</i>

1177
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:00,790
<i>Come to Daddy.{\i}.</i>

1178
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:05,500
<i>Coochie-coochie-coo.{\i}
That's it. Come on.{\i}.</i>

1179
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:07,920
<i>Come on. Come on.{\i}.</i>

1180
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:17,430
<i>Oh, ladies, come on.{\i}</i>

1071
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:29,520
