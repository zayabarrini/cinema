1
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,823
Soubirous.

2
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,660
Soubirous.

3
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:47,248
- If you go early, maybe you'll find work.
- Hmm.

4
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,574
Bonjour, Monsieur Maisongrosse.

5
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:28,826
No work for you today.

6
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:32,287
How can I hire anybody when
there isn't enough to keep me busy?

7
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,371
People don't go to bakers anymore.

8
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,499
No, they go to pastry cooks,
because it's stylish.

9
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,126
Why don't you try the hospital?

10
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,504
The man doing odd jobs
moved to Tarbes yesterday.

11
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,704
Take that stuff clear out to the dump at
Massabielle and burn every bit of it.

12
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,081
It's full of infection and disease.

13
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,825
Why did Christ found the Church?

14
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:23,619
Christ founded the Church to teach,
govern, sanctify and save all men.

15
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,287
How long did he live on Earth?

16
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:29,790
Christ lived on Earth about 33 years
and led a most holy life in poverty.

17
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:33,751
That is correct, except you've omitted
the last and most important word:

18
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,794
"In poverty and suffering."

19
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:37,713
Never forget that, my child.

20
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:41,632
For only through suffering can we hope
to gain the kingdom of God.

21
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,592
What is the Holy Trinity?

22
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,638
I said, what is the Holy Trinity?
Didn't you hear me?

23
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:53,975
Yes, Sister, I heard you,
but I know nothing about it.

24
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,976
Have you ever heard of it?

25
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,895
Maybe I've heard of it.

26
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,356
You puzzle me, my child.
Are you pert, indifferent or only stupid?

27
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:09,194
I'm stupid, Sister.
I have a poor head for study.

28
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,029
You're also pert.

29
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,865
You're a grown girl, Bernadette,
the oldest in the class.

30
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:17,367
Ignorance of the Holy Trinity
is inexcusable.

31
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,536
Go to the foot of the class.

32
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,205
What is it, Marie?

33
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:27,541
I just wanted to say that
my sister Bernadette was sick...

34
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,501
the day the class learned
about the Holy Trinity.

35
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:32,629
She misses school a lot.

36
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,547
- She's always ailing.
- What ails her?

37
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,299
They call it "atma" or some such name.

38
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,009
You're trying to say "asthma"?

39
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,470
Yes, Sister.
That's what Dr. Dozous calls it.

40
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:47,765
She can't breathe.
Sometimes she sounds just like this:

41
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:54,061
Laughter wastes valuable time.
Return to your studies.

42
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:58,105
Toinette, perhaps you can tell Bernadette
what the Holy Trinity is.

43
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:01,650
The Holy Trinity is one God
in three divine persons.

44
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,652
God the Father, God the Son
and God the Holy Ghost.

45
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,154
Sister Marie Therese, <i>bonjour.</i>

46
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,989
<i>Bonjour</i>, Father Peyramale.

47
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,074
<i>Bonjour</i>, children.

48
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,742
<i>Bonjour</i>, Your Reverence.

49
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,160
I was passing, I thought I'd stop in...

50
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:18,995
to see how many you were preparing
for First Communion.

51
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,706
Six. We were just having a review
of our catechism.

52
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,250
You all know your catechism?

53
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,918
Yes, Your Reverence.

54
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,504
To learn your catechism
requires great diligence.

55
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,048
I believe such diligence
should be rewarded.

56
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,591
I have some holy pictures.
Would you like one?

57
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,426
Yes, Your Reverence.

58
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,344
Very well.

59
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:44,598
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Your Reverence.

60
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,516
- As you grow older...
- Thank you.

61
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,394
...you will realize
that in learning your catechism...

62
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:53,105
you have given yourselves not only
a foundation of religious teachings...

63
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:54,605
but also a doctrine...

64
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:56,857
- Thank you.
- to guide you...

65
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,608
throughout your lives.

66
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,443
I'm sorry, Father...

67
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,696
this girl is not deserving.
It is unfair to the others.

68
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,572
They have studied their catechism.
She has not.

69
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,032
Well, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.

70
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,452
This should be an incentive to you, then.
Study hard.

71
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,210
You found work?

72
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,717
Twenty sous.

73
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,759
From the baker?

74
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,803
Where, then?

75
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,680
Don't ask me.

76
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,599
- You didn't beg?
- Worse.

77
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,978
The stinking filth from the hospital
had to be carted away and burned.

78
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,855
That's the kind of job
they give to Soubirous.

79
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,189
This is where they let him live.

80
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:56,985
Soubirous the miller,
who made the finest flour in Escoubes...

81
00:10:57,152 --> 00:11:01,780
lives in a jail
that is too cold and damp for prisoners.

82
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,198
Not good enough
for thieves and murderers...

83
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,576
but for Soubirous and his family,
sure, let them live here.

84
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,953
Let them freeze in the winter
and roast in the summer.

85
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,997
Let them get sick and die.
Who cares?

86
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,624
Come in, Jeanne.

87
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,125
Maman, Jeanne came along.

88
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,461
She's going to help me with my studies.

89
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:23,880
All right, there's always enough
for one more.

90
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,589
- Sit down.
- Oh, please don't.

91
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm not a bit hungry.
I'll just watch the others.

92
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,511
Father, Son, Holy Ghost,
he who eats the fastest gets the most.

93
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:33,720
Justin!

94
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:37,014
- Where did you learn that?
- You'll go to hell for saying that.

95
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:41,392
All I said, the one that eats the fastest
gets the most, and it's true.

96
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,061
Now you've said it again.

97
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:46,021
I've seen pigs with better manners
and cleaner faces.

98
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:49,065
Get up from the table
and wash yourselves, both of you.

99
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:52,400
Oh, a mass meeting, eh? How can
anybody sleep with such racket?

100
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:55,528
- We're sorry, Papa.
- It's cold in here. Fix the fire.

101
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,029
There's no wood.

102
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:00,740
So I'm to get the wood too.
I work hard all day long.

103
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:05,911
All I ask is a little peace and warmth.
What do I get? Cold and chills.

104
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,912
Must I do everything around here?

105
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:10,372
I'll go hunt for wood, Papa.

106
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:13,124
- May I go with Marie?
- No, you'll do no such thing.

107
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,293
- You know how easily you catch cold.
- But if I dress warm?

108
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,961
- Please?
- Maman! Maman!

109
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,338
All right, all right.
Only, wrap up good.

110
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,465
Maman! Can I go too?

111
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,299
- No!
- Oh, but please, Maman!

112
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:27,301
You'll stay and spend the day
asking God for forgiveness...

113
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,803
Louise!

114
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:30,387
- Louise!
- What's wrong?

115
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,931
The baby! The convulsions again.
What do I do?

116
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,807
- Help me!
- Be calm, Croisine.

117
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,643
- Go back. I'll be over.
- Please come with me now.

118
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,644
- Can I go with you and look?
- No!

119
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:43,647
You stay here with your brother.
You can ask for a little forgiveness too.

120
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,607
I want you girls back before dark.

121
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,776
Come on, Bernadette.

122
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,694
Hurry up!

123
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:54,446
The last one over the bridge is a goose!

124
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,837
<i>Hola</i>, Bernadette.

125
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,671
Good day, Madame Nicolau.

126
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,924
- Are your parents well?
- Yes, very well, thank you.

127
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,634
And how is your son, Monsieur Antoine?

128
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,260
Splendid, thank you...

129
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,804
and Mademoiselle Bernadette?

130
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,514
I'm well, thank you, monsieur.

131
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:34,351
Well, I'd better hurry on.
My sister will wonder about me.

132
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:36,102
May I use your bridge?

133
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:40,397
- As often as you like, and no toll charge.
- Thank you, monsieur.

134
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,526
You better let me help you.
That bridge is not so dependable.

135
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:13,422
Thank you, monsieur.
You're very kind.

136
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,214
Goodbye.

137
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:16,883
Goodbye.

138
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,469
She's growing into a fine young woman,
isn't she?

139
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,143
Marie!

140
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,234
Marie!

141
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,320
Jeanne!

142
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,780
I thought it was the devil himself.

143
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:52,241
- You should've seen your face.
- Nothing but eyes and mouth.

144
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,285
- You'd be scared too.
- There's the wood.

145
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,620
Come on, follow me.

146
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:13,799
We'll wade across.

147
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:16,301
- That's private property.
- What if it is?

148
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,595
If we take wood, we'll be stealing.

149
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,263
Wood is wood.
Don't be such a fraidy cat.

150
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,140
- I'm not a fraidy cat.
- Yes, you are too.

151
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,517
Come on, Marie. Let's go.

152
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,645
It's cold!

153
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,234
It's freezing!

154
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:38,776
Hurry up.

155
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,201
Bernadette, don't you come in that water.

156
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,994
Remember what Maman told you.

157
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,995
- I won't catch cold.
- Won't you?

158
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,665
You'll get a cough and your asthma
will keep me awake all night long.

159
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,501
Maybe I can jump
across the rocks or something.

160
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,335
Yes, and tumble in.

161
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,504
If you fall in and get your bottom wet...

162
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,338
don't ask me to wring you out.

163
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:09,674
But if I dry my feet real well,
I won't catch cold.

164
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:13,343
We don't need you anyway.
Come on, Marie, let's go.

165
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,095
Stay there till we get back.

166
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,347
But three can carry more than two can.

167
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:20,940
But what if she's not there?

168
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:25,110
I can't carry this heavy bundle
all the way back into town.

169
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:31,115
Bernadette! Yoo-hoo!

170
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,536
You see, I told you she'd sneak off.

171
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:42,415
No, no, she wouldn't do that.
She's here somewhere.

172
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:55,424
There she is. Bernadette!

173
00:19:56,675 --> 00:20:00,136
Bernadette, come on.
We've got to go home.

174
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:01,762
Bernadette, come on, now.

175
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:04,764
- What are you doing?
- Bernadette!

176
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,021
Maybe she's dead. Holy Mother,
maybe her asthma's killed her.

177
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:16,648
Nonsense.
If she were dead, she'd be lying flat.

178
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,274
A dead person doesn't kneel.

179
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,775
Why doesn't she speak?

180
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,444
She's trying to be funny.

181
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,778
I'll show her.

182
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,201
Bernadette!

183
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,123
What's the matter?

184
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,916
What's the matter?
That's what we're asking you!

185
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,127
I thought your asthma had killed you.

186
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:52,008
Don't just stand there.

187
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:55,343
Come on, you know we've got
to get home before dark.

188
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:58,971
I'm coming.

189
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,056
We're not gonna wade through
that cold water again.

190
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:05,642
You go down that side of the river,
and we'll meet you at the bridge.

191
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,523
What cheats you two are.
This water is as warm as dishwater.

192
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,860
- Bernadette!
- You've got bats in your belfry.

193
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,360
That water's freezing.

194
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:23,363
Well, it isn't now.
Look, my toes are not even white.

195
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,950
What were you doing over there
kneeling in the rocks?

196
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,037
Didn't you see anyone?

197
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,705
Who?

198
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:36,957
Was somebody with you in that cave?

199
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:44,046
Somebody was,
and you were praying for forgiveness.

200
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:45,547
Jeanne!

201
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:47,715
Come on, tell us who it was.

202
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:52,469
Well, if I tell you,
you must swear not to give me away.

203
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:55,804
If Maman should hear of it,
she might take a stick to me.

204
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,389
I swear.

205
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:00,850
I give you my word, but I won't swear.
Swearing is a mortal sin.

206
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:05,186
You don't want me to sin like that
just before my First Communion, do you?

207
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,563
Come on, tell us.

208
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,400
Well, I saw a lady.

209
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,237
- And she was all in white.
- A lady?

210
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:21,448
And she wore a blue girdle
and had a golden rose on each foot.

211
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,701
I've never seen anything in my life
so beautiful.

212
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,537
Oh, piff!

213
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:32,039
What would a beautiful lady be doing
in a filthy place like that?

214
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,418
I don't know, but she was there.
Truly she was.

215
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:44,507
Come on, let's get away from here.
You take that bundle.

216
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:49,010
No, I'll take this one.
It's bigger, and you must be tired.

217
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:14,487
The girls are not home yet?

218
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:17,115
No.

219
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,410
Madame Millet's coachman was here.

220
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,620
Said there wouldn't be
any more washing for you to do.

221
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:32,960
Where, then, is the food
going to come from?

222
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:38,380
Don't ask me. I've been laying here
worrying about that all afternoon.

223
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:42,508
Bernadette, where have you been?
I've been worried to death.

224
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:46,052
But we got wood, Maman.
Three bundles. Enough for days.

225
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,596
There are other things to be done
besides that.

226
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,015
Sweeping, cleaning, water to be fetched.

227
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,559
- I'll fetch the water.
- I'm at the end of my rope.

228
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,353
Bernadette.

229
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,646
Bernadette!

230
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:03,316
- Don't run!
- See you at school tomorrow.

231
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:06,109
Maman, please take this.

232
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:08,736
She has no business running like that.

233
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:11,363
She ran all the way home.

234
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:16,450
We couldn't even catch up to her.

235
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,702
She'll be coughing all night.

236
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,620
Bernadette's all excited...

237
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:23,663
because she says she saw a lady
at Massabielle...

238
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,374
all dressed in white,
with golden roses on her feet.

239
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,544
- What on earth are you talking about?
- That's what she told us.

240
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,880
Golden roses on her feet!

241
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:37,883
She said this lady was standing
on a rock and smiled at her.

242
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,218
She had a rosary of pearls
and a golden crucifix...

243
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:42,886
Marie!

244
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:48,474
You told on me, and you said you wouldn't.

245
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:51,059
Maman asked me.

246
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:55,604
- What's this foolishness Marie tells me?
- It's true, Maman.

247
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:59,565
In the cave at Massabielle,
I saw a most beautiful lady.

248
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,983
A lady? What lady?

249
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:03,610
I don't know.

250
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:07,029
Suddenly, she was there,
and then, suddenly, she disappeared.

251
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:11,199
- Nonsense.
- Oh, no, Maman, she was there.

252
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,575
Her face was so beautiful.

253
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:16,078
Just to look at her made me feel..

254
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,120
Soubirous!
You hear what she says?

255
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:22,415
I heard, and I know why she says it too.

256
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,833
She's showing off.

257
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,294
Makes up a story to feel important.

258
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:30,213
It always starts the same way,
with fairy tales.

259
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:34,216
Golden roses on her feet. Indeed!

260
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:39,345
No, Papa, I really and truly saw the lady.

261
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,638
Truly, I did.

262
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,267
Come in!

263
00:25:56,315 --> 00:26:00,026
It's for you, dear friend,
for saving my baby today.

264
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:04,738
Compared to a child's life, it's not much,
but we want you to have it.

265
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:15,746
Oh, no. No, I can't possibly...

266
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:19,916
It's the only way we have
of repaying you. Please.

267
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,001
Yes, Louise.

268
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:25,421
If our friends are good enough to offer...

269
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:28,005
then the least we can do is accept.

270
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,090
But you need the food as much as we do.

271
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,009
No, my aunt came today
with much more than this.

272
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,762
We are merely sharing
our good fortune with you.

273
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,348
May God bless you both.

274
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:44,351
Why, this is food enough for days.

275
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,811
- Sausages!
- Just like in the butcher's window.

276
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,271
What a great omelet the eggs will make.

277
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:52,232
- Ah, Louis!
- Mesdames, monsieur.

278
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,066
Louis, it's good to see you.

279
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:56,443
What brings you here, besides a cold rump?

280
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:59,654
- You heard about Doutreloux?
- The stableman for Cazenave?

281
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:02,614
- A horse kicked him, broke his leg.
- The horse broke his leg?

282
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:05,491
No. Doutreloux broke his leg,
three places.

283
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,951
- Mercy, that is bad.
- Mercy, that is good.

284
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,703
Shame on you, Louis!

285
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:13,706
I mean, it is bad for Doutreloux,
but it's good for your husband.

286
00:27:13,914 --> 00:27:17,417
Cazenave offers you the job.
That's why I'm here.

287
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,668
It pays two francs a day and your lunch.

288
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,837
- Soubirous!
- Two francs a day!

289
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,337
The lunches are hot.

290
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,506
Can I ride on the coach with you?

291
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:27,424
Me first. I'm older.

292
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,634
Why, you seem surprised.

293
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:33,846
It was agreed between Cazenave and
myself that I should fill the first vacancy.

294
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,597
But stableman...

295
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:39,308
Well, I suppose even a miller
can't be too choosy these days.

296
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,894
You may tell Cazenave that I accept.

297
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,229
He knows it. He wants you to be there
at 5:00 in the morning.

298
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,191
Tears, Maman?

299
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:51,066
Only because I'm so happy.

300
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,735
I'm happy too.

301
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,694
We must celebrate.

302
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:56,446
- You'll all stay to dinner.
- No.

303
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:58,113
Nonsense. Dine with us.

304
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,657
- But tonight? I hadn't planned.
- So we change our plan.

305
00:28:01,824 --> 00:28:03,951
We have food, I have a position...

306
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:06,787
We accepted your eggs.
You must accept our omelet.

307
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:09,330
I will not hear another word.

308
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:12,041
Children, help your mother.

309
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,127
A succulent omelet, with sausages, Maman.

310
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:32,096
Maman! Maman! Maman!

311
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:37,726
What is it?

312
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:41,395
Bernadette...

313
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,814
Speak. Speak!

314
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,150
- She's dead or something.
- What?

315
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:49,318
She's all white and sick-looking.

316
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:50,986
Where is she?

317
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:56,198
They're taking her to Madame Nicolau.

318
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,965
Oh, please, please,
wait outside. Outside, all of you.

319
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,133
Please leave her at peace.

320
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,177
It's all right, Maman.
She's opening her eyes.

321
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:28,556
- Do you feel better now?
- Yes, thank you, madame.

322
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:30,139
I'll fix you some warm milk.

323
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,767
Thank you very much,
but I don't need anything.

324
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:35,894
What was the matter? What happened?

325
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,440
The lady was there a long time,
and she spoke to me.

326
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:45,442
She spoke to you?

327
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:47,236
What did she say?

328
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:51,656
She said, "Will you render me the grace...

329
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,367
of coming here each day
for 15 days?"

330
00:29:56,285 --> 00:30:02,330
And then she added, "I cannot promise
to make you happy in this world.

331
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,373
Only in the next."

332
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:17,091
So after church we asked Bernadette
to come with us...

333
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:21,970
- Well, did you see her?
- No, none of us saw her.

334
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,971
Bernadette said...

335
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,348
Please.

336
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:29,934
Bernadette!

337
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:33,186
Are you all right?

338
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:37,273
Yes, Maman.
There's nothing to worry about.

339
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:40,025
Nothing to worry about?

340
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:54,785
Scare me half to death, and you say
there's nothing to worry about.

341
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:01,582
I left your father's dinner to burn.

342
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,460
I ran through the streets like
a madwoman, and what do I find?

343
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:09,755
You, sitting there like a...
Like a princess on a throne.

344
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:11,256
You good-for...!

345
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:14,884
Don't strike the child.
She's an angel of God.

346
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:16,801
Angel?

347
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,846
She's the laughingstock of Lourdes.

348
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,350
Come, Maman. Maybe we can get home
before Papa does.

349
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,852
No. I won't budge from this place...

350
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,854
until you promise me
never again to go to Massabielle.

351
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:34,231
- Never!
- But, Maman, I can't promise that.

352
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,817
The lady has asked me to return
every day for 15 days.

353
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,236
Promise your mother, Bernadette.
Such excitement's bad for you.

354
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:43,405
You're sure to be sick from it.

355
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:45,281
Very well.

356
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:50,035
I promise you, Maman,
never to go to Massabielle again...

357
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,871
unless you yourself give me permission.

358
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,539
And that, I can promise you,
you'll never get.

359
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,708
I'm gonna send you
to your Aunt Bernarde's...

360
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,709
where you'll forget this foolishness.

361
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,586
Home with you. And you too.

362
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:07,214
Thank you for
your kindness, Madame Nicolau.

363
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:10,008
And thank you too, monsieur.

364
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:15,053
What do you think of it all, Maman?

365
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,389
Things like that bode no good.

366
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,228
As long as I live,
I'll never see anything more beautiful...

367
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,854
than the face of that girl...

368
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:30,314
as she lay there at Massabielle.

369
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:36,277
One ought not even touch a being like that.

370
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:50,538
Maman? Maman?

371
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,915
- Huh? What is it?
- Bernadette's crying.

372
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:11,761
What's the matter, my lamb?

373
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,725
Come to Mother. We'll sit by the fire.

374
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,296
Oh, Maman.

375
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:00,423
The lady was so beautiful.

376
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:04,760
- Just to think of her makes me feel...
- There, there, there.

377
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:10,263
Girls of your age often see things
that don't exist.

378
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,557
But it passes.

379
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:15,851
You must just put it out of your mind.

380
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,437
You're a big girl now.

381
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:23,440
Soon you'll be a woman.

382
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:30,528
You'll marry a man
and you'll have children...

383
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,613
just as I did.

384
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,784
Life goes fast...

385
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:41,620
my child.

386
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,874
It's hard to believe how fast.

387
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,839
If she stays here, I fear for her health.

388
00:34:57,006 --> 00:34:59,424
She speaks to no one.
She doesn't sleep.

389
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:02,344
She doesn't eat enough
to keep a bird alive.

390
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:04,220
Bernarde, could she live with you?

391
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:05,846
You don't know what it is...

392
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:09,808
to have everybody point you out
as the father of "that idiot."

393
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,226
You are also the girl's father.

394
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:15,394
And you seem to overlook
the fact that you are her mother.

395
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,438
Two people in the world
who should be understanding.

396
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:20,982
You want to ship her off
like a sack of flour.

397
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:24,068
- I'm thinking only of...
- Only of yourself.

398
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:27,070
Bernadette is a simple, honest child.

399
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:29,947
She hasn't the cunning
to invent anything like this.

400
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:33,616
She sees this lady. Nobody else does.

401
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:37,869
Who are you to say that she is wrong
and you are right?

402
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:41,081
This lady may well be a heavenly creature.

403
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,250
Heavenly creatures don't appear
in a filthy place like a city dump.

404
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,919
Christ was born in a stable.

405
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:51,547
This is a wild story Bernadette tells.

406
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:56,758
But since the lady has asked her to go
to the grotto for 15 days, she must go.

407
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,095
- Oh, I won't allow her to go again.
- You will go with her.

408
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:02,179
You can't hide your head in the sand...

409
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:04,556
as if she were up to
some harmless mischief...

410
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:06,099
that doesn't concern you.

411
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:09,810
This is no joke.
Consider what this means to Bernadette.

412
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:11,645
- But what'll people say?
- Nothing...

413
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:14,063
if you take your place by her side.

414
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,982
All the women of the family
must stand by her.

415
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,317
I'll come.

416
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:24,320
And when I walk with her,
let anyone dare to laugh.

417
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:01,764
"The matter has been put
before the council and approved.

418
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:05,018
Therefore, fully convinced
that your request is justified...

419
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:08,228
I am forwarding your plan,
as well as my recommendation...

420
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,729
Commissioner.

421
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,606
To the minister of the interior.

422
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:14,733
Signed, Baron Massey, prefect."

423
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,359
So you see, gentlemen...

424
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,196
the ceaseless protestations
of your mayor have borne fruit.

425
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:24,948
The highest authorities are contemplating
bringing the railroad to Lourdes.

426
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,825
- Splendid!
- Magnificent.

427
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,327
- Commissioner.
- What?

428
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:32,205
That Soubirous girl. She just went
to Massabielle again. What should I do?

429
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,039
I thought her mother forbade it.

430
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:36,373
But today her mother went with her.

431
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:40,335
To think that such a thing could happen
in the middle of the 19th century.

432
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:42,795
Why, the girl's insane.

433
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:44,630
Or suffering from hallucinations.

434
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:47,507
Your Honour, may I suggest
you act without delay?

435
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:50,426
But, monsieur, for the mayor
even to acknowledge...

436
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:52,969
the existence of such a situation...

437
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:55,346
would only give it importance...

438
00:37:55,512 --> 00:37:58,599
an importance which
the newspapers would not ignore.

439
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:00,892
It's a matter for the imperial prosecutor.

440
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,145
No. Unfortunately, the state
has no charges to prefer.

441
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
It's up to the police commissioner.

442
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:11,775
But no one has broken any law.
It's the duty of the district officer.

443
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:14,818
- Massabielle's in your district, isn't it?
- Yes.

444
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:16,570
Then take care of it.

445
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,811
Hi.

446
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:06,607
I ran ahead to tell you
I'm not alone today.

447
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,233
I hope you won't mind.

448
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,611
Maman, Aunt Bernarde and my sister
are with me...

449
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:14,154
and some other people followed us.

450
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:17,156
I'm sorry, but Maman wouldn't let me
come by myself.

451
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,741
I desire that people should come here.

452
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,706
Where is she?

453
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,250
- Is she here?
- Oh, yes.

454
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,961
She's standing there in the niche.

455
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:37,839
She's greeting you now. See?

456
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,078
Clear out down there, all of you.
Return to your homes immediately.

457
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:26,082
Did you hear me? I said, clear out.

458
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,503
This is hopeless.

459
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:35,923
It's more than one policeman can handle.

460
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,518
It's a scandal! It cries to heaven.

461
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:56,938
Imagine these penny-a-liners
having the audacity to print such a thing.

462
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:58,982
All France will be laughing at us...

463
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:02,777
and Lourdes was going to have
a railroad connection.

464
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:06,488
I'd even gone so far as to have the plans
drawn up for the depot.

465
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:08,947
Do you think they'll be granted to us now?

466
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:10,948
Never.

467
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,618
Who's going to run a railroad
into a hole...

468
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:18,371
where spooks perform their
medieval antics in dirty caverns?

469
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:20,706
We're dealing with a whole lot more...

470
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:24,459
than the mere babbling
of a little swindler or an imbecile.

471
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:28,128
The entire future of this town is at stake.

472
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:31,464
Something must be done
to stop this nonsense, immediately.

473
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,549
- How?
- How?

474
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:36,093
That's up to you and the prosecutor.

475
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:39,637
As much as I'd like to put an end
to this stupidity, I'm helpless.

476
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:42,263
She goes peacefully
to the outskirts of the city.

477
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,265
There she kneels, says her rosary
and goes home again.

478
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:47,267
Is there anything unlawful in that?

479
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:52,480
Yes, on the ground that it's
insulting to religious sensibilities.

480
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:53,688
Really?

481
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:58,192
You can hardly call seeing the
Blessed Virgin in a veritable cesspool...

482
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,194
complimentary to the Holy Family.

483
00:42:00,361 --> 00:42:02,612
She hasn't claimed to see
the Blessed Virgin.

484
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:06,615
- The crowd claims that.
- She says she sees a beautiful lady...

485
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,367
and the visioning of a beautiful lady...

486
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:12,285
can hardly be construed
as a criminal violation.

487
00:42:12,452 --> 00:42:15,288
It better not be,
or else the entire male population...

488
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,540
would be spending time behind bars.

489
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:19,624
This is hardly the moment for levity.

490
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,126
Yes, what is it?

491
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:29,048
Pardon me, sir,
but Dr. Dozous is here to see you.

492
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,967
- Ask the doctor to wait.
- Just a moment.

493
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,469
Dr. Dozous might be very helpful to us.

494
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,973
Let's not overlook the vast possibilities
offered by a diagnosis of insanity.

495
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:42,267
Yes.

496
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:45,519
- Ask the doctor to come in.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:51,731
- Will you please come in, doctor?
- Thank you.

498
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:53,233
Doctor.

499
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,568
Bonjour, Messieurs, bonjour.

500
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,069
Hello, doctor.

501
00:42:57,236 --> 00:42:59,404
I'm sorry to interrupt, gentlemen...

502
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:01,864
but I've made several visits
to Massabielle...

503
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,574
for the purpose of observation.

504
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,243
Today I examined the girl.
You might be interested in my report.

505
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,162
Yes, of course.
Won't you sit down?

506
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:10,787
Splendid. What did you find?

507
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:15,416
Well, I arrived at the grotto
simultaneously with the crowd.

508
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:19,669
Immediately, the Soubirous girl
knelt before a niche in the cliff...

509
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:25,798
and made a series of courteous,
graceful, reverential gestures.

510
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,758
Did you see anything in this niche?

511
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:29,759
- No.
- Did anybody else?

512
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:31,261
No.

513
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:34,430
Well, then, didn't the crowd laugh at her?

514
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:37,265
No.

515
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:42,519
There was something about her
that precluded laughter.

516
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:48,023
Her exaltation was so genuine...

517
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,109
that the observer
almost had the impression...

518
00:43:51,276 --> 00:43:53,444
that he saw what the child saw.

519
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:59,990
Then, as we continued to gaze at her,
her face turned as pale as marble...

520
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,326
and her skin grew so taut...

521
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:07,913
that the structure of the skull
appeared clearly marked at the temples.

522
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:12,625
Considering the possibility
that this was due to cerebral anemia...

523
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:15,335
I took her pulse.
It was practically average.

524
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:19,129
Also, there was no affection
of the nervous system, as in catalepsy...

525
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,089
or hysteria.

526
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:23,299
Even her eye reflexes were normal.

527
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:27,344
Did she speak to this thing in the niche?

528
00:44:28,094 --> 00:44:30,471
Standing close beside her...

529
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:33,474
I heard twice in succession...

530
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:36,726
a long, drawn-out:

531
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:38,852
"Yes."

532
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,897
"Yes..."

533
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,483
Wrung from her very depths.

534
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:51,362
Evidently, she'd been asked
to convey a message...

535
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:54,739
because shortly after,
she turned to the crowd and said:

536
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:56,782
"Pray for all sinners."

537
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:01,494
Anyone who talks to something
that isn't there is feeble-minded.

538
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:05,372
Another medical possibility
which I took into consideration.

539
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:09,166
Wanting to test her mental abilities,
I put this question to her:

540
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,710
"Do you know what a sinner is?"

541
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,004
Without hesitation,
she answered, "Certainly, monsieur.

542
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,132
A sinner is one who loves evil."

543
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,677
That's quite a good answer.

544
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:27,138
What pleased me was that
she said "loves" and not "does."

545
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,014
Well, after this...

546
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:32,475
any diagnosis of feeble-mindedness
was out of the question.

547
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:33,977
Then she's a swindler.

548
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:36,895
There's no justification
for such an assumption.

549
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:43,024
I must presume that you have joined
the ranks of the believers in this vision.

550
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,151
I am a doctor.

551
00:45:45,694 --> 00:45:47,903
I contribute to the Medical Courier.

552
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,281
I'm a member of several
scientific societies.

553
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:53,199
I trust that is answer enough.

554
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:57,077
If I have correctly understood
your report, doctor, it is this:

555
00:45:57,244 --> 00:45:59,078
Science excludes fraud.

556
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:03,206
It excludes mental disease
and a miraculous occurrence.

557
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:07,042
I venture, then,
to ask science, what is left?

558
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:12,505
Yes, what is left?

559
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:20,094
If the Church stops it,
the people cannot blame us.

560
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:23,680
Precisely. We can sit back
and sympathise with both sides.

561
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,223
A very wise attitude for any government.

562
00:46:26,432 --> 00:46:27,766
Is the dean at home?

563
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:30,435
- Yes. Come in.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

564
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,936
- Good morning, Father.
- Come in.

565
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,856
Take off your coats.

566
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:39,567
I presume the Soubirous girl
is what brings you here.

567
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,234
Yes.

568
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:45,571
The Church attributes
no religious significance whatsoever...

569
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:48,323
to the so-called visions of Massabielle.

570
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:51,159
- Sit down.
- I'm very glad to hear that, Father.

571
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:56,746
- Then you will talk with this girl and...
- No, it does not concern me.

572
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:00,915
That is a matter for you city officials.

573
00:47:01,082 --> 00:47:03,667
We had hoped you would cooperate with us.

574
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:06,670
That I am doing. Sit down.

575
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:12,007
I have instructed the cantonal clergy
not to set foot in the grotto...

576
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:14,092
and to ignore the whole matter.

577
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:17,303
But Your Reverence has enormous power
over the people here.

578
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,721
It would be appropriate
to raise your voice.

579
00:47:19,888 --> 00:47:23,182
I have no intention of adding further
importance to this turmoil.

580
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,684
Then you force the state
to invoke the law...

581
00:47:25,851 --> 00:47:29,520
which prohibits the Church from
opening any new place of worship...

582
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:32,481
without the consent
of the minister of worship.

583
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:35,316
The Church has not opened
any new place of worship.

584
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:39,152
The Church neither sponsors
nor recognises...

585
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:42,112
these heathen gymnastics
taking place at Massabielle.

586
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,657
Then how can you stand by...

587
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:49,534
and see your parishioners
carry on these pagan ceremonies?

588
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:53,496
I understand that they use
a kitchen table as an altar...

589
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,206
and there they pray.

590
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:59,709
Yes, on a spot littered with filth,
they pray to God.

591
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:03,170
Prayer, gentlemen,
is good no matter where it is offered.

592
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:06,047
Yes, yes.

593
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:12,718
Well, shall we be going?

594
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:28,188
Thank you, Father.

595
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:31,565
- I wish you a pleasant good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

596
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:33,484
Good morning, Father.

597
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:38,946
That sly old fox.

598
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:41,407
By agreeing with us,
he's dumped the problem...

599
00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:43,449
right back in our laps.

600
00:48:44,242 --> 00:48:49,204
Unfortunately, the followers of the girl
are citizens of this community...

601
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:52,289
and the thought of offending them
is not pleasant...

602
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:53,958
with the election coming.

603
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,458
Then why offend them?

604
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,210
Why not refer the matter
to higher authorities?

605
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:03,673
A very good suggestion, monsieur.
I'll write to the prefect immediately.

606
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:13,555
"I consider it purely a local problem,
to be solved by local authorities...

607
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,434
and I do not wish to be involved
in any way whatsoever.

608
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,811
Settle it without delay.

609
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:24,772
The method I leave entirely
in the capable hands...

610
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:27,149
of you and your associates.

611
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:30,443
Signed, Baron Massey, prefect."

612
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:35,864
There he sits, like a general,
safely out of the range of fire...

613
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,199
and orders a handful of men,
without any weapons...

614
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:41,492
to wipe out an impregnable fortress.

615
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:43,870
Our "capable hands."

616
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:46,913
They're only capable
when there's a ticklish job to be done.

617
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,958
To think that one stupid girl
could cause all this trouble.

618
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:54,836
Only because there are millions of others
just as stupid as she is.

619
00:49:55,003 --> 00:49:58,714
What can you expect from a peasantry
fed on religious dogmas...

620
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:01,466
and nurtured on superstitious nonsense?

621
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:04,843
I firmly believe that this girl
and what she stands for...

622
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,011
is a menace to civilisation.

623
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:09,680
She is dangerous, I admit, but...

624
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:12,098
She's a religious fanatic...

625
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:16,518
and every time religious fanaticism
steps forward, man moves backward...

626
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:19,270
and that is why
I will fight this vigorously...

627
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:22,148
and I'll resort to any measures
to defeat it.

628
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:25,442
I don't know much about higher politics...

629
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:28,360
but I do know a lot
about burglars and thieves...

630
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:30,570
and scamps of all kinds.

631
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:34,364
I know how to scare them
and apply pressure.

632
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,951
I promise you that if you give me
five minutes with this girl...

633
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:41,329
she'll never go near the grotto again.

634
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:44,039
Try it, by all means. Try anything.

635
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:47,124
I was thinking of somewhat
the same procedure...

636
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,417
however, not quite so crude.

637
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:52,712
There's something about the title
"imperial prosecutor"...

638
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:54,463
that makes people quake.

639
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,839
Without raising my voice, I'm confident...

640
00:50:57,006 --> 00:51:00,759
You can't handle people like this
with silk gloves and fancy words.

641
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:04,012
We shall see.
Send for two of your policemen.

642
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,431
Just the one.

643
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:11,559
- Bernadette!
- You stay here and wait for Maman.

644
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:15,687
Don't worry her. Tell her I've gone
to the city hall with these gentlemen.

645
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:24,944
- What are you arresting her for?
- Don't interfere with the law.

646
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,780
- The law! Death for the law!
- Death for you too!

647
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:30,490
Madame Davan! Madame Davan!

648
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:33,158
They're arresting Bernadette.

649
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:35,785
Madame Probert! Madame Probert!

650
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:37,620
Look what those pigs are doing!

651
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:55,967
Do you know who I am?

652
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:59,594
Oh, yes, monsieur.
You are the imperial prosecutor.

653
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:01,179
And that title means...

654
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:04,557
that I have been appointed
by His Majesty, the emperor.

655
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:09,018
He has vested in me the power
to punish anyone...

656
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:12,688
who perpetrates a fraud
against this community.

657
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:15,064
Now do you understand my position?

658
00:52:15,273 --> 00:52:19,276
Oh, yes, you're much the same
as Monsieur Jacomet.

659
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:22,820
A good deal more.
I am his superior officer.

660
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:26,531
He hunts down the criminals and
swindlers. I send them to prison.

661
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:29,533
- Oh.
- Now, bearing in mind my title...

662
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,202
and realising the extent of my authority...

663
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:36,371
I ask you never again to go to Massabielle.

664
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:41,125
Oh, but I must, monsieur.
The lady has asked me.

665
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,669
Now, there you go again with this lady.

666
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:46,504
Bernadette, you'll admit
you are very ignorant...

667
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,547
the worst pupil in the school.

668
00:52:48,755 --> 00:52:52,300
That is true, monsieur, I am very stupid.

669
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:55,469
Then take heed
when intelligent people assure you...

670
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:58,847
that this lady is only
a childish bit of imagination...

671
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:00,347
an absurd dream.

672
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:04,809
The first time I saw the lady,
I thought it was a dream too.

673
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:07,895
There, now.
Now, that wasn't so stupid.

674
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:13,482
Once you can mistake a dream
for something real, but not six times.

675
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:17,402
Isn't it strange that
until your first visit to Massabielle...

676
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,278
your family was destitute?

677
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:22,488
Now your mother is employed
by a wealthy family...

678
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:24,574
and your father has a steady job...

679
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:27,701
and your followers have
showered your household...

680
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:30,036
with clothing and foodstuffs.

681
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:32,663
Now, if the court were to decide...

682
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,666
that your lady represents
a profitable business scheme...

683
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,751
it would go very hard with you.

684
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:41,753
I have not accepted one thing, monsieur...

685
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:44,380
because I knew the lady would not like it.

686
00:53:46,715 --> 00:53:49,759
Look, my child, I am trying to help you.

687
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:54,095
He's using the wrong technique.
He'll get nowhere.

688
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:56,598
I am not asking you to retract anything.

689
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:59,934
I merely want you to promise me
that you will accept my counsel.

690
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:02,101
If I can, monsieur, I will.

691
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,270
Good. Now...

692
00:54:05,187 --> 00:54:06,980
put your hand in mine...

693
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:11,984
and promise me that you will not go
to the grotto again.

694
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:15,362
That I cannot promise, monsieur.

695
00:54:15,654 --> 00:54:18,656
Let me remind you
that I am the imperial prosecutor.

696
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,199
I know, monsieur.
You told me that before.

697
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:23,576
Now, listen carefully, Bernadette.

698
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:26,161
In the next room is Jacomet.

699
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:28,412
He is cruel and mean.

700
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:32,290
Furthermore, he believes that everyone
should be treated like a criminal.

701
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:36,168
If you refuse me,
I will be forced to turn you over to him.

702
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:38,420
I can promise you it will be horrible.

703
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:41,506
He will have you cringing and crying
in no time...

704
00:54:41,673 --> 00:54:45,258
but I can spare you all this
if you will only be reasonable.

705
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:48,678
Well, what is your answer?

706
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,430
It is the same, monsieur.

707
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:55,307
I must keep my promise to the lady.

708
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:56,850
Very well!

709
00:54:58,518 --> 00:55:00,436
I am finished with you.

710
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:03,855
If you're intent
upon your own destruction...

711
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:05,607
go.

712
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:07,274
Yes, monsieur.

713
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:19,033
What's your name?

714
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:21,535
But you know my name, monsieur.

715
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,203
What's your name?

716
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:25,329
Soubirous, Bernadette.

717
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:29,666
Before I go further...

718
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,793
I want you to know I will write down
everything you say.

719
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:35,212
Such a paper is known as a deposition...

720
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:38,047
to be sent to the imperial prefect
at Tarbes.

721
00:55:38,214 --> 00:55:41,383
Besides, we also have Monsieur Estrade
for a witness.

722
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,885
Be very careful what you say.

723
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:46,220
Now...

724
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:49,639
about this lady you claim to see.

725
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:51,224
Do you know who she is?

726
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:53,475
No, monsieur, I don't.

727
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,477
What does she wear?

728
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,772
A white veil with a blue girdle...

729
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:02,983
and there's a rose on each foot.

730
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,112
She stands quite still,
like a statue in church?

731
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,780
No, she's ever so natural.

732
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:14,408
She moves about and talks to me.

733
00:56:14,616 --> 00:56:17,368
She greets the people, and even laughs.

734
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:18,910
Hmm.

735
00:56:19,745 --> 00:56:21,955
Do your parents believe
this story of yours?

736
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:26,125
No, monsieur, I don't think they do.

737
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,711
And yet you expect me to believe
when your own parents don't?

738
00:56:30,127 --> 00:56:33,464
If your lady were real,
wouldn't other people see her too?

739
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:37,383
I don't see why they can't.
She's there.

740
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:41,761
Now, pay attention.

741
00:56:42,636 --> 00:56:44,972
I'm going to read your answers
back to you...

742
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:47,640
so you can confirm their correctness.

743
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:53,978
"Bernadette Soubirous declares the lady
wears a blue veil and white girdle."

744
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:56,731
No, a white veil and a blue girdle.

745
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:59,733
You're contradicting yourself,
you said a white girdle.

746
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:02,818
You must have made a mistake
in writing it down.

747
00:57:06,196 --> 00:57:07,864
"Bernadette Soubirous declares...

748
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:11,909
the lady resembles the statue of the
Blessed Virgin in the parish church."

749
00:57:12,076 --> 00:57:14,035
No, that's not true.

750
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:17,537
The lady has nothing to do
with the Blessed Virgin in the church.

751
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:19,039
That's enough.

752
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:22,208
Nothing but a complete confession
could save you now.

753
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:24,793
Tell me the names of those
in league with you...

754
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:27,669
and don't lie,
because I know every one of them.

755
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:30,297
I don't understand
what you're saying, monsieur.

756
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:31,881
Well, I'll tell you.

757
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:35,842
Certain persons have put you up
to circulating this disgusting story.

758
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:38,136
They've trained you, stupid as you are...

759
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,013
to reel off by rote
exactly what they taught you.

760
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,515
Now, tell me. Who are these people?

761
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:47,017
But you said a moment ago, monsieur,
you knew them.

762
00:57:51,395 --> 00:57:55,607
The police are outside,
awaiting my orders to take you to jail.

763
00:57:55,774 --> 00:57:59,652
But if you promise before this witness
never to go to Massabielle again...

764
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:03,029
No! I must keep my promise
to the lady.

765
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:05,698
You want me to call the police?

766
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:08,575
If the police take me, I can't help it.

767
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,076
And that's not all.

768
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:12,787
I'll have your parents
thrown into jail too.

769
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:14,621
The rest of your family will starve.

770
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:17,040
Come in!

771
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,875
What the devil do you want?

772
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,878
My child, that's all I want.
My child.

773
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:27,256
Listen, Soubirous, this business
at the grotto has got to stop.

774
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:30,174
- I won't stand it any longer.
- So help me God...

775
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:33,093
that's all I want too.
It's destroying my family.

776
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,929
The girl's a minor.
You're responsible for her.

777
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:39,431
Forbid her to go out except to school.
Lock her up at home...

778
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,767
because if you don't,
I'll lock up the whole bunch of you.

779
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,893
Now, get out.

780
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:48,938
God help you if I have to summon you again.

781
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:59,363
Well, monsieur, what do you think of it?

782
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:03,615
I think you were extremely
fortunate in having the father break in...

783
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:05,242
just when he did.

784
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:09,829
The authorities preventing
her going to Massabielle...

785
00:59:09,996 --> 00:59:12,873
has made her seem more important
to her schoolmates.

786
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:14,374
That is most unfortunate.

787
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:16,500
The children whisper about nothing else.

788
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,127
I'd hoped, with your permission,
to talk to them...

789
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:23,630
No. The bishop of Tarbes has
forbidden us to recognise the situation...

790
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:25,841
and he's right in doing so.

791
00:59:26,008 --> 00:59:29,802
Do you remember that girl in Avignon,
Rose Tamisier?

792
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:33,138
She claimed to have seen
the Most Blessed Virgin also.

793
00:59:33,305 --> 00:59:36,891
The vicar general of that diocese
was patient and understanding.

794
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:40,518
Consequently, the people
mistook his attitude for approbation.

795
00:59:40,685 --> 00:59:43,520
Then, later, when the child
was exposed as a fraud...

796
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,689
the Church was looked upon
as her partner in crime.

797
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:51,443
Immediately, atheism flared up,
and the anticlerical forces triumphed.

798
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,819
That is not going to happen here.

799
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:57,697
What I had in mind, Father, could
hardly be construed as approbation.

800
00:59:57,864 --> 01:00:00,741
I plan to make an example of her
in front of the class.

801
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:03,160
- Ridicule?
- Yes, Father.

802
01:00:03,327 --> 01:00:05,995
You have my permission to try it.
Good day, Sister.

803
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:08,496
Good day, Father. Thank you.

804
01:00:49,903 --> 01:00:52,446
She can't go on like this.

805
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:56,366
Night after night.

806
01:01:04,872 --> 01:01:08,917
My poor little one,
what have they done to you?

807
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,919
Speak to me.

808
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:18,423
If I can't go and see her anymore,
I shall die.

809
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:25,345
You shall see her.

810
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:28,014
I don't care what Sister Vauzous says.

811
01:01:28,181 --> 01:01:32,725
You will go again to Massabielle,
and no one will prevent you...

812
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:37,187
and if they lock me up, well, let them.

813
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:39,773
But you shall see her.

814
01:01:51,282 --> 01:01:54,784
I hope Baron Massey
subscribes to this paper.

815
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:58,078
Sounds a little different
from the last editorial, doesn't it?

816
01:01:58,245 --> 01:01:59,996
Listen to this.

817
01:02:00,162 --> 01:02:02,957
"The officials at Lourdes
are to be highly commended...

818
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:05,959
for stamping out
these disgusting spectacles."

819
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:09,795
But I have a feeling they will return
to criticism again tomorrow.

820
01:02:09,962 --> 01:02:11,337
What makes you think that?

821
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:15,507
Because I am a man
of greater vision than you, monsieur.

822
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:19,802
Especially when I sit
in this particular chair.

823
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:36,523
I told them, if they did
this again, I'd put all of them in jail.

824
01:02:36,732 --> 01:02:38,024
Careful, commissioner.

825
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:41,068
If you do that,
I'll have to release them in 10 minutes...

826
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:43,153
and then we would look foolish.

827
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:45,405
There must be some law to stop them.

828
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:50,783
- Commissioner...
- I know, they're going to Massabielle.

829
01:02:50,992 --> 01:02:54,828
- You don't have to tell me. I've got eyes.
- They're not going to Massabielle.

830
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,371
They've already been.

831
01:02:56,538 --> 01:03:00,041
They were there at 5 this morning.
They're on their way to the dean.

832
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:01,833
- The dean?
- Yes.

833
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,044
The girl said the lady gave her
a message for him.

834
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,380
Well, it seems the gods
have finally sided with us.

835
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:11,966
Gentlemen, maybe now the Church
will be forced to take a stand...

836
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,217
whether it wants to or not.

837
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:47,408
Excuse me, Your Reverence.

838
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:49,494
What do you want? Who are you?

839
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,162
- Bernadette Soubirous.
- Oh.

840
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,873
So you're the urchin
every idiot in France is talking about.

841
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:58,958
Do your courtiers and servants
always follow you?

842
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,586
If any of that crowd
dare to enter my garden...

843
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:03,337
I'll have them arrested.

844
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:05,756
Well, speak. What do you want of me?

845
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:08,841
- The lady told me...
- What lady?

846
01:04:09,008 --> 01:04:11,843
- The lady in Massabielle.
- Don't know her.

847
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,011
She's a beautiful lady who comes to me...

848
01:04:14,178 --> 01:04:15,513
Is she from Lourdes?

849
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:17,597
Have you asked her name?

850
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:20,016
Yes, but she gives no answer.

851
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:21,892
Perhaps she is deaf and dumb.

852
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:24,103
Oh, no, she speaks to me.

853
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:25,853
What does she say?

854
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,939
Just now the lady said,
"Please go to the priests...

855
01:04:29,106 --> 01:04:31,775
and tell them
a chapel is to be built here."

856
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:34,276
Priests? What does that mean?

857
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:36,736
It appears your lady
is a confirmed heathen.

858
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:38,822
The very cannibals have priests.

859
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:41,907
We Catholics have religious,
each with a specific title.

860
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:45,076
But the lady did say "priests."

861
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:50,664
Well, you've come to the wrong place,
anyhow.

862
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:54,083
Have you any money to build a chapel?

863
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,917
No, I have no money at all.

864
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:57,877
Then you go tell your lady...

865
01:04:58,044 --> 01:05:00,379
if she wants a chapel, she'll need money.

866
01:05:00,587 --> 01:05:02,798
Yes, I'll...

867
01:05:03,006 --> 01:05:05,758
the dean of Lourdes considers it
unfitting for a lady...

868
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:07,384
to climb barefoot on rocks...

869
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:10,095
and to send gibbering adolescents
with messages.

870
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:14,056
And, what's more, once and for all,
he demands she leave him in peace.

871
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:16,349
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Reverence.

872
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:19,393
- I'll tell her everything...
- Just one moment.

873
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,813
Do you see this broom?

874
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:27,065
- Yes, Your Reverence.
- Then listen carefully.

875
01:05:27,232 --> 01:05:30,152
If you dare to annoy me ever again...

876
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:33,404
I'll take this broom,
and, with my own hands, I'll...

877
01:05:53,002 --> 01:05:54,544
Come in.

878
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,466
I forgot something, Your Reverence.

879
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:06,386
The lady also said,
"Let processions come hither."

880
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,180
Processions, eh?

881
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:17,728
And do you think tomorrow
would be soon enough for your lady?

882
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:21,230
Yes, I'm sure she would be delighted.

883
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,068
Now that I've given you
the messages, I'll...

884
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,737
One moment.

885
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,905
I'll decide when you're to go.

886
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,033
Close the door.

887
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:49,084
I want you to convey
a message to your lady for me.

888
01:06:54,796 --> 01:06:56,965
You find her quite extraordinary,
don't you?

889
01:06:57,174 --> 01:06:59,634
Oh, yes, Your Reverence.

890
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:11,309
Good.

891
01:07:12,435 --> 01:07:14,978
We shall find how extraordinary she is.

892
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:21,441
I have heard that there's a wild rosebush
growing in the grotto. Is that true?

893
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:26,070
Oh, yes. Right under the niche
where the lady always stands.

894
01:07:26,237 --> 01:07:30,657
Splendid. I want you to tell the lady this:

895
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:35,285
The dean of Lourdes would like her
to perform a little miracle.

896
01:07:35,869 --> 01:07:39,830
He would like her to make
the wild rosebush bloom now...

897
01:07:39,997 --> 01:07:41,831
this last week in February.

898
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:45,584
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Reverence.

899
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:47,169
Then repeat what I said.

900
01:07:49,128 --> 01:07:53,757
"The dean of Lourdes would like the lady
to perform a little miracle...

901
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:59,970
to make the wild rosebush bloom now,
this last week in February."

902
01:08:01,012 --> 01:08:02,430
Is that correct?

903
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,516
Yes.

904
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:09,852
I'll tell the lady.
Good day, Your Reverence.

905
01:08:36,038 --> 01:08:38,248
Squad, halt!

906
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,375
Well, gentlemen...

907
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,835
I'm off to see the miracle.

908
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,670
Bring me back a dozen roses,
will you, please?

909
01:08:46,629 --> 01:08:49,881
I rather think I'll bring you back
a hundred dozen disillusioned people.

910
01:08:51,383 --> 01:08:53,801
The dean set no definite time.

911
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:56,554
Why do you assume that today's the day?

912
01:08:56,762 --> 01:09:01,348
We don't. Her followers did that.
"It shall be on Thursday," they said.

913
01:09:01,557 --> 01:09:02,933
Why Thursday?

914
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:08,062
Because someone figured out that she
first saw the lady on a Thursday...

915
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:10,439
the lady returned to her on a Thursday...

916
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:13,816
so naturally,
the buds shall burst on a Thursday.

917
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,862
Buds or no buds,
you'll never destroy that girl's faith.

918
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,030
Can you say the same of the crowd?

919
01:09:21,196 --> 01:09:24,198
Wouldn't we be surprised
if the bush did bloom today.

920
01:09:24,365 --> 01:09:26,743
Don't underestimate the dean of Lourdes.

921
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:30,245
Who is the best authority on roses
in this district?

922
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:33,456
Peyramale.
The weather too, for that matter.

923
01:09:33,581 --> 01:09:35,166
You mean you think the dean...?

924
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:39,293
I merely think it is singularly strange
that Peyramale, of all people...

925
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:43,046
picks a rosebush, of all things,
to demonstrate a miracle.

926
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,923
Why didn't he ask the lady
to make the rock into a white horse...

927
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:49,426
or change the river water into wine?

928
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:10,316
- Anything yet?
- No.

929
01:10:10,483 --> 01:10:12,610
- Then nothing will happen.
- Shh!

930
01:10:12,818 --> 01:10:14,611
Quiet! Keep still.

931
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,752
It's no use, I tell you.
The bush will not bloom.

932
01:10:36,919 --> 01:10:38,295
Shh. Will you keep quiet?

933
01:10:38,462 --> 01:10:43,091
All right, but you will see.
Life is not like that.

934
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:35,045
I don't see something. Do you?

935
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:10,113
Go to the spring.
Drink of the water and wash there.

936
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:23,165
No, not the river.

937
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,917
Not the river?

938
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:36,174
The spring, yonder. Eat of the plants.

939
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,676
Eat of the plants.

940
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:49,851
- What's she doing now?
- Shh.

941
01:12:50,809 --> 01:12:54,604
Drink of the spring and wash there.

942
01:12:55,313 --> 01:13:00,317
To the spring?
Drink of the water and wash myself?

943
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,246
What is she looking for?

944
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:36,718
She uses her nose like a pig.

945
01:13:36,927 --> 01:13:40,430
Yes, and she roots up the ground.

946
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,444
Come, darling.

947
01:14:00,611 --> 01:14:02,738
No, no, I must wash myself in the spring.

948
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,906
There's no spring here, Bernadette.

949
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,366
There is. There is.
The lady said so.

950
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,909
Come.

951
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:31,092
- Citizens!
- Shh!

952
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:36,346
At last, you've seen with your own eyes
what we officials have known all along...

953
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:41,600
that this story of the Blessed Virgin
was born in a sick and warped mind.

954
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:43,935
You've been duped by an idiot.

955
01:14:44,102 --> 01:14:46,645
I beg of you, go back to your homes...

956
01:14:46,812 --> 01:14:49,106
and never return here again.

957
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,035
Fall in!

958
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,396
Don't be sad, Antoine.

959
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:46,815
I told you not to hope too much.

960
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:48,691
I knew it would not bloom.

961
01:15:52,986 --> 01:15:55,237
You must learn to expect nothing
from God...

962
01:15:55,404 --> 01:15:58,198
and when you get nothing,
you won't be disappointed.

963
01:15:58,365 --> 01:16:00,366
Keep still.

964
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:04,328
Go away and let me alone.

965
01:16:12,626 --> 01:16:14,293
From the time we are knee-high...

966
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,171
they tell us the Blessed Virgin
is loving and good.

967
01:16:17,338 --> 01:16:19,464
Was she good to that girl just now?

968
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:23,717
Was she good to me? Me, Bouriette,
the finest stone-carver in Lourdes.

969
01:16:29,429 --> 01:16:31,681
I'll never forget that day.

970
01:16:32,265 --> 01:16:34,892
I was carving a statue for the church.

971
01:16:35,059 --> 01:16:38,561
A chip of marble flew off my chisel
and hit me in the eye...

972
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:42,397
and, as quick as that,
I was no longer a stonecutter...

973
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:45,191
and that's how the Blessed Virgin
Repaid me...

974
01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:47,860
by throwing a stone in my eye.

975
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:51,905
Ever since, it's been
like looking through a bowl of milk.

976
01:17:38,772 --> 01:17:40,941
Bouriette. Bouriette!

977
01:17:41,149 --> 01:17:43,275
- What is it, Antoine?
- Come here!

978
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:46,861
Look!

979
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:50,614
Bernadette said there was a spring,
and they called her insane.

980
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:52,741
Look at it, Bouriette!
Look at it!

981
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:56,953
Tell the others. Hurry.

982
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,620
Bouhouhorts! La Grange!

983
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:03,624
Come back! Look!

984
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:33,062
Dr. Dozous!

985
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:36,606
Where is the doctor?

986
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:41,360
Dr. Dozous.
Dr. Dozous, my eye. I can see!

987
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:46,114
I put mud on them from the grotto
and now I can see. It's a miracle!

988
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:48,824
Don't be in such a hurry
with miracles, Bouriette.

989
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,617
Tomorrow at 2, Madame Blanc.

990
01:18:50,784 --> 01:18:52,118
Come here.

991
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:56,705
- Sit down.
- Yes, doctor.

992
01:18:57,372 --> 01:19:00,374
Fix your eye on the ceiling
and look straight ahead.

993
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:01,876
Yes.

994
01:19:04,544 --> 01:19:06,879
All I did was put mud on them
from the grotto.

995
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:08,380
Be quiet.

996
01:19:08,547 --> 01:19:10,381
Then I said a prayer and now I can see.

997
01:19:10,548 --> 01:19:11,883
Quiet.

998
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:15,177
It's a miracle, doctor.
It's a miracle!

999
01:19:15,343 --> 01:19:16,928
Be still.

1000
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:22,557
There's no improvement
in this eye, Bouriette.

1001
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,392
Four scars on the cornea.

1002
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:29,228
- Same as it was six months ago.
- But I can see!

1003
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:33,482
It's like sheet lightning.

1004
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:35,400
Excuse me.

1005
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:38,277
Doctor, everything is bright.

1006
01:19:39,528 --> 01:19:43,990
What you've done
is pressed against the eyeball so hard...

1007
01:19:44,365 --> 01:19:47,117
you've irritated the optic nerve.

1008
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:51,788
For a time, things will seem bright,
but that will pass.

1009
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,539
- Take a look at that chart.
- Yes.

1010
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:59,168
- Can you read it with your left eye?
- No, doctor, I can't.

1011
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:02,754
- How about the right?
- No, no, I can't.

1012
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:05,005
- How about both eyes?
- No good, doctor.

1013
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:06,507
There you are.

1014
01:20:06,673 --> 01:20:08,591
But, doctor, I never knew how to read.

1015
01:20:08,758 --> 01:20:11,510
But I can see!
I can see you, doctor.

1016
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:13,970
I can see everything. It's a miracle.

1017
01:20:14,137 --> 01:20:16,555
Come back tomorrow
when you're calmer, Bouriette.

1018
01:20:16,722 --> 01:20:19,599
All right, but it's a miracle.

1019
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:22,727
It's a miracle! It's a miracle!

1020
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:29,816
I understand it all now.

1021
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:32,484
Ever since that piece of marble
flew in my eye...

1022
01:20:32,651 --> 01:20:35,486
she's been trying to find a way
to make it up to me.

1023
01:20:35,653 --> 01:20:37,822
And at last, she did.

1024
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:40,323
Mortar!
You can see better now, Bouriette?

1025
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:42,533
I see everything.

1026
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:19,727
- There's no hope.
- No. No.

1027
01:21:19,978 --> 01:21:23,355
Charles, get Louise Soubirous.
She has always saved him before.

1028
01:21:23,522 --> 01:21:25,356
She's not at home. I can't find her.

1029
01:21:25,523 --> 01:21:27,400
It's too late.

1030
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:30,360
It's better so.

1031
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:32,194
You don't want your child...

1032
01:21:32,361 --> 01:21:36,447
to drag himself through life
a hopeless cripple, do you?

1033
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:39,325
I want my child to live!

1034
01:21:43,536 --> 01:21:46,831
No. No!

1035
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:52,585
Croisine!

1036
01:21:55,253 --> 01:21:58,089
Croisine!
Croisine, come back!

1037
01:22:00,799 --> 01:22:03,176
- Somebody's coming.
- Who is it?

1038
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:07,262
- I don't see anything.
- Croisine! Croisine!

1039
01:22:09,514 --> 01:22:11,891
Croisine, please.

1040
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,520
- Croisine, be sensible.
- Let me be.

1041
01:22:17,562 --> 01:22:19,188
Are you mad?

1042
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:27,235
Take him, O Lord, or give him back to me.

1043
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:04,721
Well, doctor?

1044
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,807
There can be no question of innervation...

1045
01:23:09,016 --> 01:23:13,978
and I can find no reason to doubt
the presence of muscular substance.

1046
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:16,772
What does that mean, doctor?

1047
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:21,776
That means that yesterday, the baby's
legs were completely paralysed...

1048
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:24,861
and today, they're as sound as yours.

1049
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:32,116
I'm sure you can understand now my
anxiety for confirmation of my findings.

1050
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:34,826
You're positive there's not a possibility...

1051
01:23:34,993 --> 01:23:38,038
of error in your previous diagnosis?

1052
01:23:39,288 --> 01:23:40,623
August 25th...

1053
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:48,629
high temperature, violent convulsions,
complete paralysis of the legs.

1054
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:52,382
Couldn't we assume a mere atrophy,
due to rickets?

1055
01:23:52,548 --> 01:23:53,882
I couldn't.

1056
01:23:54,049 --> 01:23:55,968
Then the water at Massabielle...

1057
01:23:56,134 --> 01:24:00,012
must contain an unknown
and powerful therapeutic substance.

1058
01:24:00,429 --> 01:24:04,099
At any rate, I must report on this case
to the medical journals.

1059
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,142
Mmm. I'd hesitate to do that.

1060
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:10,144
It might make you an object of ridicule.

1061
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,854
It won't be an easy thing to write.

1062
01:24:13,021 --> 01:24:17,233
I'm not accustomed
to believing things I can't see.

1063
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:20,777
What about you, Father?
You've been very silent.

1064
01:24:20,944 --> 01:24:22,654
What do you make of all this?

1065
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:26,031
Well, unlike a doctor...

1066
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:30,743
a religious must believe
a great many things he cannot see.

1067
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,080
Sometimes, I confess,
it's extremely difficult.

1068
01:24:35,997 --> 01:24:39,916
Last night, when I came here,
it was very dark.

1069
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:43,794
It's much lighter now.
Good morning, gentlemen.

1070
01:24:57,638 --> 01:25:00,682
And no longer are his legs like dishrags.

1071
01:25:00,849 --> 01:25:03,183
Now they're firm and strong.

1072
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:06,936
And without Bernadette,
it couldn't have been.

1073
01:25:07,687 --> 01:25:09,856
Let me say a prayer by her bedside.

1074
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:13,358
Heavenly Father, no!
Save your prayers for Mass.

1075
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,026
Go home to your wife, Charles.

1076
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:20,822
Tonight you will all have dinner with us.
We will have an omelet 10 feet wide.

1077
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:35,750
Good morning, Maman.
Good morning, Papa.

1078
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:39,544
Good morning, Bernadette.

1079
01:25:40,253 --> 01:25:41,837
Good morning, Bernadette.

1080
01:26:14,278 --> 01:26:16,946
And then she held him
in that ice-cold water...

1081
01:26:17,113 --> 01:26:20,074
and all of a sudden, the baby began to cry.

1082
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,951
Not a weak, sickly cry, but a healthy one.

1083
01:26:24,118 --> 01:26:27,329
And both doctors agree
a great change took place.

1084
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:30,332
They confess they can't understand it.

1085
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,792
It's left them wondering.

1086
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,627
What do you think of it, Father?

1087
01:26:36,211 --> 01:26:39,713
I, too, am wondering.

1088
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,591
And you know the baby
was never strong enough to cry before.

1089
01:26:43,758 --> 01:26:47,052
Then, on the way home,
the child slept in his mother's arms.

1090
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:49,554
When he woke up, he was smiling and hungry.

1091
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,847
The baby began to stir.
He was moving his legs.

1092
01:26:52,014 --> 01:26:54,974
Since he was born,
his legs were as if they had no muscles.

1093
01:26:55,141 --> 01:26:56,976
The doctors couldn't do anything.

1094
01:27:41,175 --> 01:27:43,969
- This is awful.
- Yes, commissioner.

1095
01:27:44,136 --> 01:27:48,139
By sunrise, that whole hillside will look
like a sugar loaf crawling with ants.

1096
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,766
It won't be so bad after tomorrow.

1097
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:55,519
She said the lady only asked her to come
for 15 times. Tomorrow makes 15.

1098
01:27:55,686 --> 01:27:57,938
This is no longer a curiosity.
It's a disease.

1099
01:27:58,105 --> 01:28:00,148
The crowd will come if she's here or not.

1100
01:28:00,314 --> 01:28:02,400
- Where are you going?
- No place, monsieur.

1101
01:28:02,566 --> 01:28:05,735
- What's in that basket?
- Commissioner, my wife is very sick.

1102
01:28:05,902 --> 01:28:07,319
Is your wife in the basket?

1103
01:28:07,486 --> 01:28:09,405
- No, monsieur...
- Let's see.

1104
01:28:09,613 --> 01:28:12,782
Monsieur, I thought I could sell
some hot chestnuts and wine.

1105
01:28:12,949 --> 01:28:14,658
There we are. Now it's started.

1106
01:28:14,825 --> 01:28:16,910
Pretty soon, they'll be selling sausages.

1107
01:28:17,077 --> 01:28:21,038
You want sausage?
I've got sausage too.

1108
01:28:21,205 --> 01:28:23,373
Go on. Move.

1109
01:29:52,856 --> 01:29:56,859
Well, who is this lady?
She must have a name.

1110
01:29:57,026 --> 01:29:59,319
Didn't you ask her her name?

1111
01:29:59,486 --> 01:30:01,487
I've told you to, time and time again.

1112
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:02,988
Now it's too late.

1113
01:30:03,155 --> 01:30:05,365
I did ask her, today.

1114
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,033
Well?

1115
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,868
What she said I didn't understand.

1116
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:13,454
- Well, speak. What was it?
- You haven't forgotten?

1117
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:17,374
No, I repeated it many times
so I wouldn't forget.

1118
01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:21,502
She said,
"I am the Immaculate Conception."

1119
01:30:27,048 --> 01:30:28,924
Immaculate Conception?

1120
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:31,051
Immaculate Conception.

1121
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:33,803
Immaculate Conception.

1122
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:38,807
Do you know what it means,
"I am the Immaculate Conception"?

1123
01:30:39,598 --> 01:30:45,353
Don't be afraid, my child. I sent
for you to help you, not to scold you.

1124
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:47,771
Well?

1125
01:30:49,398 --> 01:30:54,151
No, Your Reverence,
I do not know what it means.

1126
01:30:54,318 --> 01:30:56,736
Do you know the meaning
of the word "immaculate"?

1127
01:30:56,945 --> 01:31:01,490
Yes, I know that.
An immaculate thing is clean.

1128
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,575
Good, and "conception"?

1129
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:07,244
Well, we'll leave that for the moment.

1130
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:11,247
Do you know what we mean
when we speak of the original sin?

1131
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:14,416
Yes.

1132
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,711
The original sin
was committed by Adam and Eve...

1133
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:22,672
when they did not remain faithful
to God but broke his command.

1134
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:25,757
Father Pomian taught you that, didn't he?

1135
01:31:25,924 --> 01:31:28,093
Now, think hard.

1136
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:31,178
Didn't he also speak
of the Immaculate Conception?

1137
01:31:31,345 --> 01:31:33,847
No, Father, I never mentioned that dogma.

1138
01:31:34,014 --> 01:31:37,850
It doesn't belong to the pedagogic
material of the elementary class.

1139
01:31:38,058 --> 01:31:39,935
Perhaps Sister Vauzous discussed it.

1140
01:31:40,144 --> 01:31:42,437
I'm sure she didn't.

1141
01:31:43,438 --> 01:31:45,939
Well, you must have heard
the expression somewhere.

1142
01:31:46,148 --> 01:31:48,275
Now, try to remember.

1143
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,821
Maybe I've heard about it...

1144
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:57,740
but I don't remember.

1145
01:31:58,032 --> 01:32:02,285
Very well. I'll try to explain it.

1146
01:32:04,578 --> 01:32:08,581
The Most Blessed Virgin Mary
was preserved free...

1147
01:32:08,748 --> 01:32:11,375
from all stain of original sin...

1148
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:16,587
even from the first instant
of her presence in her mother's womb.

1149
01:32:16,962 --> 01:32:18,380
God did this for her...

1150
01:32:18,547 --> 01:32:21,507
because she was to be
the mother of Jesus Christ...

1151
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:25,218
a most singular privilege of grace.

1152
01:32:26,803 --> 01:32:29,221
Do you understand that, Bernadette?

1153
01:32:30,348 --> 01:32:32,182
No, Your Reverence.

1154
01:32:32,974 --> 01:32:35,434
Why should you?

1155
01:32:35,601 --> 01:32:39,395
Great scholars have racked their brains
about it for centuries.

1156
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,441
But perhaps you can grasp this one thing.

1157
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:47,360
If the Most Blessed Virgin were to speak...

1158
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:52,322
she could not say of herself,
"I am the Immaculate Conception."

1159
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:54,198
All she could say would be:

1160
01:32:54,365 --> 01:32:57,617
"I am the fruit
of the Immaculate Conception."

1161
01:32:57,825 --> 01:33:03,246
Birth and conception are events,
but a person is not an event.

1162
01:33:03,413 --> 01:33:08,417
You can't say,
"I am conception. I am birth."

1163
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:13,045
Consequently, your lady is guilty
of an inexcusable blunder.

1164
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:15,506
You must admit that.

1165
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:19,717
The next time I see her,
I will tell her, Your Reverence.

1166
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:25,054
Excuse me, Father.
I promised to look in on Madame Cenac.

1167
01:33:25,221 --> 01:33:27,098
- Certainly.
- Goodbye, Bernadette.

1168
01:33:27,264 --> 01:33:29,349
Goodbye, Father Pomian.

1169
01:33:36,104 --> 01:33:39,273
What am I to do with you, Bernadette?

1170
01:33:40,941 --> 01:33:45,069
Your eyes seem honest,
your words sincere...

1171
01:33:45,528 --> 01:33:47,821
yet I cannot believe you.

1172
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:50,407
Today, less than ever.

1173
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:54,410
As your confessor, I beseech you,
renounce this falsehood...

1174
01:33:54,618 --> 01:33:57,704
confess that your mother
or your father or your aunt...

1175
01:33:57,912 --> 01:34:00,038
or someone suggested that phrase

1176
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:02,124
might become important in men's eyes.

1177
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:06,377
But I can't confess that. It isn't true.

1178
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:09,963
No one suggested anything to me.

1179
01:34:20,137 --> 01:34:24,974
Have you ever thought about your life,
what your future would be like?

1180
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:27,684
Like the future of all the girls hereabout.

1181
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:31,603
After First Communion,
girls may indulge in proper pleasures.

1182
01:34:31,770 --> 01:34:35,773
They go to dances at the festivals,
meet young men...

1183
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,693
and after a time, please God,
they marry and have children.

1184
01:34:40,861 --> 01:34:43,195
Wouldn't you like to be such a girl?

1185
01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:48,574
Oh, yes. I'd like to go to dances,
have a husband someday.

1186
01:34:48,741 --> 01:34:50,826
Then wake up!

1187
01:34:50,993 --> 01:34:52,994
Now!

1188
01:34:53,161 --> 01:34:56,329
Otherwise, life is at an end for you.

1189
01:34:57,664 --> 01:35:00,624
You are playing with fire, Bernadette.

1190
01:35:05,503 --> 01:35:07,422
- Commissioner?
- Yes?

1191
01:35:07,589 --> 01:35:09,173
That spring at the grotto...

1192
01:35:09,339 --> 01:35:12,675
the people are drinking quite a bit
of that water, aren't they?

1193
01:35:12,842 --> 01:35:14,677
By the bucketful.

1194
01:35:14,844 --> 01:35:18,847
What they don't drink, they carry away
in pots and pans and bottles.

1195
01:35:19,097 --> 01:35:20,890
That's good.

1196
01:35:21,056 --> 01:35:23,641
Well, they're still at it.

1197
01:35:23,808 --> 01:35:27,603
You thought it was bad before,
you ought to take a look at it now.

1198
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:32,857
The sick, lame, canes, crutches,
some of them even look like lepers.

1199
01:35:33,024 --> 01:35:37,027
Listen to this, commissioner.
December 22, 1789.

1200
01:35:37,194 --> 01:35:41,071
"All waters contained in springs,
wells, streams, rivers...

1201
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:43,031
or any other source whatsoever...

1202
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:45,408
shall not be consumed
by anyone whosoever...

1203
01:35:45,575 --> 01:35:48,952
until the aforementioned waters
have been thoroughly analysed...

1204
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,703
by a registered chemist."

1205
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:52,789
That's perfect.

1206
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:56,374
You know, I had a feeling
that somewhere in all these books...

1207
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,876
I'd find one old law
that'd suit our purpose.

1208
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:02,003
Now, shall I send my men out
to close the grotto now?

1209
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,839
Not so fast.
First, we'll take this to the mayor.

1210
01:36:05,048 --> 01:36:07,257
And he will issue a proclamation.

1211
01:36:41,282 --> 01:36:42,784
Come in.

1212
01:36:43,992 --> 01:36:45,410
Come in, gentlemen.

1213
01:36:45,577 --> 01:36:47,787
Thank you.
I have good news, monsieur.

1214
01:36:47,995 --> 01:36:50,998
The holocaust will spread no more.
I have a way to stop it.

1215
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:52,499
Our troubles are over.

1216
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:56,961
And, ironically enough, it's the waters
of Massabielle that will quench this fire.

1217
01:36:57,127 --> 01:37:01,798
It's an old law, 1789.
Look there. Read it.

1218
01:37:02,257 --> 01:37:04,341
"In the interest of public health..."

1219
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:07,301
Of course,
with such an important analysis...

1220
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:09,887
we'll need the opinions of many chemists...

1221
01:37:10,054 --> 01:37:13,890
and that might take
months and months and months.

1222
01:37:20,895 --> 01:37:23,021
I wonder...

1223
01:37:23,188 --> 01:37:26,774
I wonder if we're not being
a little too hasty in this.

1224
01:37:27,358 --> 01:37:29,484
Perhaps we are shortsighted...

1225
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:32,988
in dismissing the possibility
of divine power...

1226
01:37:33,154 --> 01:37:34,947
in regard to Massabielle.

1227
01:37:35,197 --> 01:37:38,867
For, after all, I'm sure
that you gentlemen as well as I...

1228
01:37:39,033 --> 01:37:41,285
do not want to oppose the will of God.

1229
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,998
Your sudden religious fervour
is most touching, Your Honour.

1230
01:37:47,164 --> 01:37:50,333
Could it be prompted by the fact
that the devout masses...

1231
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,586
have brought with them
a wave of prosperity to Lourdes?

1232
01:37:53,752 --> 01:37:55,170
Monsieur.

1233
01:37:55,796 --> 01:37:59,173
But, now that you mention it,
we shouldn't overlook that either.

1234
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,175
Our hotels are filled,
our cafés are crowded.

1235
01:38:02,384 --> 01:38:04,719
Our shopkeepers have never known
such business.

1236
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:08,388
The railroad will surely take advantage
of this influx of visitors...

1237
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:10,056
and extend its line here.

1238
01:38:10,223 --> 01:38:13,559
Yes, yes, and in that case,
we shall need more hotels.

1239
01:38:13,767 --> 01:38:15,643
But, aside from all that...

1240
01:38:15,852 --> 01:38:19,479
I'm thinking mainly
of the thousands of pilgrims...

1241
01:38:19,688 --> 01:38:22,858
who come here daily
with hope in their hearts.

1242
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,027
If they derive any benefit
from the water at Massabielle...

1243
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:30,238
who are we to deprive them of it?

1244
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:35,408
Then, too, think of the vast number
who cannot come to Lourdes.

1245
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:37,577
For them, we could...

1246
01:38:37,869 --> 01:38:40,871
bottle the miraculous water...

1247
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:44,457
and it could be sold at a nominal fee
all over the world.

1248
01:38:44,624 --> 01:38:45,958
Your Honour...

1249
01:38:46,249 --> 01:38:49,419
will you dictate the proclamation
to close the grotto...

1250
01:38:49,586 --> 01:38:52,880
or would you rather
that I contact Baron Massey...

1251
01:38:53,047 --> 01:38:56,215
and ask for permission to do it myself?

1252
01:38:59,885 --> 01:39:02,595
Very well, I'll do it.

1253
01:39:02,762 --> 01:39:05,680
But I think you gentlemen
are making a big mistake.

1254
01:39:06,264 --> 01:39:08,016
Now, why not think it over for a time?

1255
01:39:09,433 --> 01:39:11,268
Courreges, take a proclamation.

1256
01:39:50,339 --> 01:39:51,798
Come in, commissioner.

1257
01:39:51,965 --> 01:39:53,841
- Any trouble?
- Oh, no.

1258
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:55,926
We finally wiped out this epidemic.

1259
01:39:56,093 --> 01:39:59,720
No. To wipe out an epidemic,
you must eliminate the cause.

1260
01:39:59,887 --> 01:40:03,473
I'll have the grotto patrolled
night and day. Nothing can happen now.

1261
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,309
Perhaps nothing can happen at the grotto.

1262
01:40:06,476 --> 01:40:09,603
Since the lady is a figment
of Bernadette's imagination...

1263
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:11,312
she can see her anyplace.

1264
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:14,023
Beside the river,
in the hovel where she lives...

1265
01:40:14,231 --> 01:40:17,567
or, if she wishes,
on the very steps of the city hall.

1266
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:21,821
The next fence we build must be
around her imagination.

1267
01:40:22,153 --> 01:40:25,323
Have you ever heard of Dr. Deboe?

1268
01:40:25,864 --> 01:40:27,157
Yes.

1269
01:40:27,366 --> 01:40:31,828
I've just written him, asking him
to come to Lourdes for a few days.

1270
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,459
Just a moment.

1271
01:40:40,626 --> 01:40:43,253
Come along. The imperial prosecutor
wants to see you.

1272
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,713
- You can't take her. She's done nothing.
- Come on.

1273
01:40:45,879 --> 01:40:48,715
I'll go, Maman.
Don't worry. It won't be long.

1274
01:40:49,257 --> 01:40:53,593
Why must you keep plaguing her?
She's tired and ill.

1275
01:40:54,136 --> 01:40:55,470
Leave her alone!

1276
01:40:55,637 --> 01:40:57,346
Please...

1277
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:03,893
I never felt that Dr. Dozous' examination
of the girl was extensive enough.

1278
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:07,479
Well, after all,
Dr. Dozous is a general practitioner.

1279
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:09,939
Advances in psychiatry
have been so rapid...

1280
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:13,150
that only a specialist
could hope to keep up with them.

1281
01:41:13,358 --> 01:41:17,236
Do you think the girl is insane, monsieur?

1282
01:41:17,778 --> 01:41:21,573
My dear doctor, I am a great respecter
of medical science...

1283
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:25,576
therefore, I think that as a layman
I am not qualified to have an opinion.

1284
01:41:25,951 --> 01:41:28,244
However, I do think that the bare facts...

1285
01:41:28,411 --> 01:41:30,747
should be permitted
to speak for themselves.

1286
01:41:31,246 --> 01:41:34,332
Day after day,
she stood before a hole in a rock...

1287
01:41:34,499 --> 01:41:36,876
and conversed with the Blessed Virgin.

1288
01:41:37,043 --> 01:41:40,003
Such delusions
are a usual symptom of paranoia.

1289
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,963
I have many paranoiacs in my clinic
who claim visions...

1290
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,799
oftentimes followed by
a tendency towards violence.

1291
01:41:47,008 --> 01:41:49,719
Has she been allowed
to come and go as she pleases?

1292
01:41:49,886 --> 01:41:52,095
I had planned to put her under restraint...

1293
01:41:52,262 --> 01:41:55,723
but Dr. Dozous' favorable diagnosis
made that impossible.

1294
01:41:56,891 --> 01:42:01,269
I trust that your examination, doctor,
will not be a cursory one.

1295
01:42:01,436 --> 01:42:03,812
I can assure you,
it will be most extensive.

1296
01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:07,857
It may be necessary to place the child
in an institution under observation.

1297
01:42:08,024 --> 01:42:09,733
Unfortunately, with paranoiacs...

1298
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,194
observation sometimes takes a long time.

1299
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,780
After all, a psychiatrist
is not an orthopedic surgeon...

1300
01:42:15,946 --> 01:42:18,031
who can set a broken bone on the spot.

1301
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,033
Yes. Yes, I understand.

1302
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:22,826
Come in.

1303
01:42:33,626 --> 01:42:35,586
Eyes closed.

1304
01:42:38,755 --> 01:42:41,215
Now the other foot.

1305
01:42:50,305 --> 01:42:52,056
Why are you so unsteady?

1306
01:42:54,642 --> 01:42:57,852
Because I am very tired, monsieur.

1307
01:43:01,063 --> 01:43:04,315
All right, you may sit down now.

1308
01:43:08,276 --> 01:43:11,529
- How many hours in the day?
- Twenty-four.

1309
01:43:11,695 --> 01:43:14,864
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

1310
01:43:15,573 --> 01:43:17,700
How much is seven times five?

1311
01:43:19,535 --> 01:43:20,869
Thirty-five.

1312
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:24,372
How much is 17 times 18?

1313
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:29,292
I do not know, monsieur.

1314
01:43:31,794 --> 01:43:33,045
Well...

1315
01:43:35,171 --> 01:43:39,675
Would you know the answer, monsieur,
if you hadn't figured it out before?

1316
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,678
Hmm?

1317
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:47,597
Not so fast, young lady.

1318
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:51,725
Don't bother. She'll go directly home.
We can take her from there.

1319
01:43:56,354 --> 01:43:57,813
Here we are, doctor.

1320
01:44:01,357 --> 01:44:02,900
Father Peyramale.

1321
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:05,569
Have I the honour
of addressing the dean of Lourdes?

1322
01:44:05,735 --> 01:44:07,779
You have that honour.
How can I serve you?

1323
01:44:07,945 --> 01:44:10,823
Hadn't we better go elsewhere
and discuss this matter?

1324
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:14,117
It is you, gentlemen, who have chosen
this place of action, not I.

1325
01:44:14,284 --> 01:44:15,617
What do you want?

1326
01:44:15,784 --> 01:44:17,661
I'm from the medical department...

1327
01:44:17,828 --> 01:44:19,537
of the provincial administration.

1328
01:44:19,704 --> 01:44:23,790
There are evidences of definite
anomalies in this girl Bernadette.

1329
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:26,042
I wish to place her under observation.

1330
01:44:26,209 --> 01:44:29,670
I am a professor of psychiatry and
neurology at the clinic of Tarbes.

1331
01:44:29,879 --> 01:44:32,714
If she does not willingly
submit to this examination...

1332
01:44:32,881 --> 01:44:35,716
we will be placed
in the unfortunate position...

1333
01:44:35,924 --> 01:44:38,427
of being forced to invoke the law of 1838.

1334
01:44:39,135 --> 01:44:43,722
This is the most shameless piece
of hypocrisy I have ever encountered.

1335
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:46,932
I warn you, I shall expose this hypocrisy.

1336
01:44:47,141 --> 01:44:50,059
And I shall raise such a voice
throughout all France...

1337
01:44:50,268 --> 01:44:54,646
the reverberations will send petty
politicians toppling from their seats.

1338
01:44:55,814 --> 01:44:57,524
Come here, Bernadette.

1339
01:45:00,318 --> 01:45:04,654
I know this child.
So does the imperial prosecutor.

1340
01:45:04,821 --> 01:45:07,990
She is neither a maniac nor a menace
to her fellow men.

1341
01:45:08,157 --> 01:45:11,659
If you still intend to take her, gentlemen,
well and good.

1342
01:45:11,826 --> 01:45:15,454
But, rest assured, I shall not stir
from this girl's side.

1343
01:45:15,662 --> 01:45:17,622
Now, call the police.

1344
01:45:17,788 --> 01:45:19,999
And when the police do come, what then?

1345
01:45:20,166 --> 01:45:23,835
When they come, I shall say to them,
load well your guns...

1346
01:45:24,002 --> 01:45:26,962
for your path lies over my dead body.

1347
01:45:28,755 --> 01:45:30,089
Well?

1348
01:45:31,257 --> 01:45:33,884
- I'm sorry...
- Come, Bernadette.

1349
01:46:07,909 --> 01:46:10,286
Mother Superior
has asked me to watch over you.

1350
01:46:10,453 --> 01:46:13,205
I'm sorry to have caused you this trouble.

1351
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:17,291
I welcome the opportunity of talking
to you before I leave Lourdes.

1352
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:19,501
- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow.

1353
01:46:19,668 --> 01:46:23,003
I've been recalled to the motherhouse
of our order at Nevers.

1354
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:26,506
The dean of Lourdes is on his way
to speak to the bishop of Tarbes...

1355
01:46:26,673 --> 01:46:28,049
in your behalf.

1356
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:31,969
I want you to know that although
you've used your wiles successfully...

1357
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:33,844
on a great many people...

1358
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:37,305
there is one person remains
who does not believe you.

1359
01:46:38,682 --> 01:46:40,558
That person is myself.

1360
01:46:41,433 --> 01:46:43,978
I've never wanted you
to believe me, Sister.

1361
01:46:45,436 --> 01:46:48,022
If that's one of those
disarming answers of yours...

1362
01:46:48,231 --> 01:46:50,607
that is supposed to strike one silent...

1363
01:46:50,816 --> 01:46:53,025
you need not waste it on me.

1364
01:46:54,443 --> 01:46:59,322
You should be thankful, Bernadette,
you did not live in former times.

1365
01:47:00,156 --> 01:47:03,158
Creatures who boasted
of equivocal visions...

1366
01:47:03,325 --> 01:47:06,703
and produce springs as if by magic...

1367
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:08,787
were burned at the stake.

1368
01:47:09,579 --> 01:47:13,916
I have prayed for you, night after night,
and I shall continue...

1369
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:16,376
so that your soul may not be destroyed...

1370
01:47:16,543 --> 01:47:19,628
by the frightful danger
to which you are exposing it.

1371
01:47:22,464 --> 01:47:25,967
- And now, good night, Bernadette.
- Good night, Sister.

1372
01:47:51,068 --> 01:47:56,114
However, above all that,
I come in the cause of justice.

1373
01:47:56,281 --> 01:48:00,367
The authorities are scheming
and plotting this girl's destruction.

1374
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:05,829
It is not the practise of the Church
to interfere with the authorities...

1375
01:48:06,163 --> 01:48:09,999
and, particularly in the case
of Bernadette Soubirous...

1376
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:13,293
we will rigidly adhere to our policy
of remaining aloof.

1377
01:48:13,877 --> 01:48:17,254
In my opinion, a change
in our policy is now necessary.

1378
01:48:17,421 --> 01:48:21,799
That opinion is not shared by an amazing
number of equally worthy ecclesiastics.

1379
01:48:21,966 --> 01:48:23,384
I realise that.

1380
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:27,179
I also realise that none but myself
has talked to this child.

1381
01:48:27,471 --> 01:48:31,599
I've begun to wonder if she isn't a true
vessel of grace and a worker of miracles.

1382
01:48:31,766 --> 01:48:33,099
No, stop.

1383
01:48:33,808 --> 01:48:35,560
My dear dean...

1384
01:48:35,727 --> 01:48:39,396
only the Congregation of Rites
can determine if a given phenomenon...

1385
01:48:39,563 --> 01:48:41,606
is a genuine miracle or a deception.

1386
01:48:41,814 --> 01:48:43,107
True.

1387
01:48:44,524 --> 01:48:48,819
That's all I ask, that an Episcopal
Commission be set up to investigate.

1388
01:48:49,862 --> 01:48:53,656
Two or three questionable cures are not
sufficient to cause an investigation.

1389
01:48:53,865 --> 01:48:55,158
One questionable cure...

1390
01:48:55,324 --> 01:48:58,702
was sufficient to cause a multitude
to travel hundreds of miles.

1391
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:04,247
Very well.

1392
01:49:05,248 --> 01:49:07,792
- I will convoke such a commission.
- Thank you.

1393
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:11,628
Providing certain obstacles
can be surmounted.

1394
01:49:12,879 --> 01:49:16,507
You fully realise, of course,
just what this will mean?

1395
01:49:16,673 --> 01:49:20,259
The commission can render only
one of three decisions.

1396
01:49:20,968 --> 01:49:24,346
First, "You're an impostor,
little Soubirous.

1397
01:49:24,888 --> 01:49:29,141
Hence, away with you to a prison
for juvenile delinquents."

1398
01:49:29,308 --> 01:49:33,103
Second,
"You're a madwoman, little Soubirous.

1399
01:49:33,269 --> 01:49:35,312
Away with you to an asylum."

1400
01:49:35,896 --> 01:49:38,940
- Third...
- "You are the rarest of mortal beings...

1401
01:49:39,107 --> 01:49:40,650
little Soubirous."

1402
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:45,694
Just when do you think the commission
will begin its work?

1403
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:48,447
The scientists, the chemists,
the geologists...

1404
01:49:48,614 --> 01:49:51,282
can't conduct research
with the grotto boarded up.

1405
01:49:51,449 --> 01:49:54,368
- A letter will force them to open it.
- No.

1406
01:49:54,535 --> 01:49:57,578
The emperor must command
that the grotto be opened.

1407
01:49:57,745 --> 01:50:00,705
Then the commission may assemble.
Not the other way around.

1408
01:50:00,872 --> 01:50:03,667
- When will you ask the emperor?
- Never.

1409
01:50:03,834 --> 01:50:06,794
I've not the slightest intention
of mentioning it.

1410
01:50:06,961 --> 01:50:10,964
He will not know that I even contemplate
convoking a commission.

1411
01:50:14,675 --> 01:50:17,927
- My attitude puzzles you, doesn't it?
- Frankly, yes.

1412
01:50:19,095 --> 01:50:22,472
I am giving your lady a chance
to prove herself to me.

1413
01:50:23,472 --> 01:50:25,975
If she is the Blessed Virgin...

1414
01:50:26,142 --> 01:50:30,228
then nothing is impossible for her,
and she will overcome the emperor.

1415
01:50:30,395 --> 01:50:31,812
However...

1416
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:37,066
if she is overcome, then she's a fraud.

1417
01:50:37,233 --> 01:50:39,818
The grotto will remain boarded up.

1418
01:50:39,985 --> 01:50:44,947
And she and any thought of the
commission will vanish into thin air.

1419
01:50:48,825 --> 01:50:51,618
I wonder, my dear dean, who will win.

1420
01:50:52,661 --> 01:50:54,745
The emperor or the lady.

1421
01:51:07,881 --> 01:51:09,923
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

1422
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:11,758
You're under arrest.

1423
01:51:11,925 --> 01:51:14,552
Okay, go down.
I'll watch them from here.

1424
01:51:15,636 --> 01:51:17,179
Name, age, occupation.

1425
01:51:17,345 --> 01:51:19,556
Jacques Gozos, 46, carpenter.

1426
01:51:19,723 --> 01:51:22,349
- Charge?
- Stealing water from Massabielle.

1427
01:51:22,516 --> 01:51:25,810
- One franc and costs.
- But I haven't got it, monsieur.

1428
01:51:25,977 --> 01:51:28,354
Two days in jail, then. Take him away.

1429
01:51:28,687 --> 01:51:31,023
- Next case.
- Bruat, woman.

1430
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,648
Bruat, woman.

1431
01:51:38,028 --> 01:51:39,696
Name, age, and occupation.

1432
01:51:39,863 --> 01:51:42,907
Bruat, Leontine, 34, governess.

1433
01:51:43,073 --> 01:51:44,491
Commissioner?

1434
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:52,538
Bruat? Madame, are you by any chance
related to Admiral Bruat?

1435
01:51:52,705 --> 01:51:54,540
He is my husband.

1436
01:51:54,707 --> 01:51:57,959
- I am Vital Dutour, imperial prosecutor.
- How do you do?

1437
01:51:58,126 --> 01:52:00,878
Won't you come into my office
and sit down, please?

1438
01:52:01,045 --> 01:52:04,047
I was arrested and led through
the streets like the rest.

1439
01:52:04,214 --> 01:52:07,341
I do not wish to be treated differently
now that I am here.

1440
01:52:07,549 --> 01:52:11,802
Madame, this is most distressing.
You are the bearer of a great name.

1441
01:52:11,969 --> 01:52:17,265
When ladies of your station exhibit their
contempt for the law by breaking it...

1442
01:52:17,432 --> 01:52:20,059
what is the poor civil servant to do?

1443
01:52:20,226 --> 01:52:22,227
Punish them as you would the others.

1444
01:52:22,393 --> 01:52:26,480
Very well. I require you to pay a fine
of one franc and costs.

1445
01:52:27,064 --> 01:52:28,899
Delighted, monsieur.

1446
01:52:33,652 --> 01:52:35,362
And here are a hundred more...

1447
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:38,405
for my fellow criminals
who are without funds.

1448
01:52:39,114 --> 01:52:41,741
And, now, please, may I have the bottle?

1449
01:52:41,908 --> 01:52:43,618
The bottle is confiscated.

1450
01:52:44,327 --> 01:52:46,787
But I don't believe it will remain so,

1451
01:52:46,995 --> 01:52:49,789
for I filled it at the desire
of very high personage.

1452
01:52:49,956 --> 01:52:52,749
May I ask who this personage is, madame?

1453
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:54,918
Her Majesty, the Empress Eugénie.

1454
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:59,296
I have the honour to be the governess
of His Highness, the prince imperial.

1455
01:52:59,964 --> 01:53:01,506
Take it, madame.

1456
01:53:01,714 --> 01:53:05,050
I begin to see the folly
of being the only one to do one's duty...

1457
01:53:05,217 --> 01:53:07,678
in a feeble-minded world.

1458
01:53:25,816 --> 01:53:27,984
His temperature is quite normal now.

1459
01:53:28,150 --> 01:53:32,279
Thank God! I was right.
The water is miraculous.

1460
01:53:32,445 --> 01:53:34,030
I'm sure it is, madame.

1461
01:53:34,197 --> 01:53:37,408
Loulou, my darling,
you'll be well now, my sweet.

1462
01:53:42,328 --> 01:53:43,996
Louis...

1463
01:53:45,372 --> 01:53:48,332
Loulou is better!
The water from Lourdes made him well.

1464
01:53:48,499 --> 01:53:51,334
Let us say, sire,
the waters did the prince no harm.

1465
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:53,003
He had only a slight cold.

1466
01:53:53,253 --> 01:53:55,754
His forehead was on fire with fever!

1467
01:53:55,921 --> 01:53:57,631
Never more than two degrees.

1468
01:53:57,798 --> 01:54:00,717
It was diphtheria or scarlet fever.
I know it. I feel it.

1469
01:54:00,883 --> 01:54:04,970
Please, my dearest, don't excite
yourself. Come and sit down.

1470
01:54:05,928 --> 01:54:10,015
Loulou has had a number of attacks
like this, and he's always gotten well.

1471
01:54:10,807 --> 01:54:13,350
I tell you, Louis,
it was the water that saved him.

1472
01:54:13,517 --> 01:54:15,394
That's a very frivolous observation.

1473
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:18,187
You do an injustice
to the doctor's prescriptions.

1474
01:54:18,354 --> 01:54:20,148
You're an atheist, Louis!

1475
01:54:20,315 --> 01:54:22,858
That's the most stupid thing
a sovereign could be.

1476
01:54:23,025 --> 01:54:24,651
You're worse than an atheist.

1477
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:28,446
You haven't the humility to thank God
for the grace he's accorded us.

1478
01:54:35,868 --> 01:54:38,703
"By order of His Majesty, the emperor...

1479
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:42,789
the ordinance of May 10th
is hereby revoked and nullified.

1480
01:54:42,998 --> 01:54:46,459
As of this date,
the grotto shall be opened.

1481
01:54:46,667 --> 01:54:48,710
Signed, Louis Napoleon."

1482
01:54:57,008 --> 01:54:58,968
I must say, my dear dean...

1483
01:54:59,135 --> 01:55:02,721
your lady wastes no time
in accepting a challenge.

1484
01:55:06,182 --> 01:55:08,725
The lady has had sweet revenge.

1485
01:55:11,602 --> 01:55:14,687
I'm being transferred to Alais.

1486
01:55:15,313 --> 01:55:18,982
Perhaps I should say demoted to Alais.

1487
01:55:19,149 --> 01:55:21,902
Yes, I rather expected you would be.

1488
01:55:22,526 --> 01:55:25,279
I, too, received a letter this morning.

1489
01:55:25,446 --> 01:55:29,324
Yeah? What hole are you headed for?

1490
01:55:30,032 --> 01:55:33,993
In my case, the lady wanted
even sweeter revenge.

1491
01:55:34,702 --> 01:55:39,206
I am to stay here for a while, at least...

1492
01:55:39,373 --> 01:55:44,043
and watch the thing I fought against
blossom like a fruit tree.

1493
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:50,756
It's the influenza again. I can feel it.

1494
01:55:51,507 --> 01:55:56,260
Evidently, the lady intends to leave me
exactly as she found me.

1495
01:55:57,052 --> 01:56:00,305
- Some hot wine, Duran.
<i>- Oui</i>, monsieur.

1496
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,565
And then I ran to the other side...

1497
01:56:14,732 --> 01:56:18,110
and ate of the grass and the herbs
as the lady had asked me to.

1498
01:56:18,652 --> 01:56:23,364
I can't understand the lady demanding
anything so repulsive of you.

1499
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:27,408
It doesn't fit into the description
that you gave of her...

1500
01:56:27,574 --> 01:56:30,077
that she bade you act like an animal.

1501
01:56:30,577 --> 01:56:33,454
Do you act like an animal
when you eat salad?

1502
01:56:34,996 --> 01:56:36,373
Go on.

1503
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:38,999
Then I looked for the spring.

1504
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:40,835
Since I couldn't see it...

1505
01:56:41,001 --> 01:56:44,337
I supposed the lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1506
01:56:44,504 --> 01:56:47,047
So I began to scratch and dig
with my fingers.

1507
01:57:07,813 --> 01:57:09,314
To be considered a miracle...

1508
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,400
the healing must be as sudden
as a bolt of lightning.

1509
01:57:12,567 --> 01:57:15,569
It must be from one moment to the next.

1510
01:57:15,736 --> 01:57:17,611
Further proof is necessary...

1511
01:57:19,947 --> 01:57:22,824
to look for the spring.
Since I could not see it...

1512
01:57:22,991 --> 01:57:26,034
I supposed the lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1513
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:28,495
So I began to scratch and dig...

1514
01:57:31,622 --> 01:57:34,374
look for the spring.
Since I could not see it...

1515
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:37,585
I supposed the lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1516
01:57:40,336 --> 01:57:43,131
There is still the possibility of deception.

1517
01:57:44,173 --> 01:57:46,467
Further proof is necessary.

1518
01:57:46,633 --> 01:57:48,760
The evidence is insufficient.

1519
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:13,528
Come in, Bernadette.

1520
01:58:13,695 --> 01:58:15,446
I'm sorry to be late...

1521
01:58:15,613 --> 01:58:17,740
but my brother had a frostbitten nose.

1522
01:58:17,907 --> 01:58:19,991
- Come by the fire.
- I had to rub snow on it.

1523
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:22,409
March is coming in like a lion, isn't it?

1524
01:58:22,618 --> 01:58:25,871
- Sit down, Bernadette.
- Thank you, Father.

1525
01:58:26,037 --> 01:58:29,123
Sorry I was unable to attend
your sister's wedding Thursday.

1526
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:31,333
Father Pomian tells me it was lovely.

1527
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:35,544
Yes, we had lots of cakes,
one with figures on it.

1528
01:58:35,711 --> 01:58:37,338
It was ever so nice.

1529
01:58:38,213 --> 01:58:41,257
I suppose she'll give up her position
with Madame Millet.

1530
01:58:41,423 --> 01:58:43,634
Yes, they're going to live on a farm...

1531
01:58:43,759 --> 01:58:47,011
but Madame Millet's
going to take me as housemaid.

1532
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,555
So I heard today.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1533
01:58:50,722 --> 01:58:54,350
Oh, it's not hard work,
and the pay is good.

1534
01:58:55,309 --> 01:58:58,645
You know, it's strange, Your Reverence.

1535
01:58:59,437 --> 01:59:03,774
The lady once told me
I could never be happy in this world...

1536
01:59:04,316 --> 01:59:06,108
but I am.

1537
01:59:06,275 --> 01:59:08,276
Happier than I've ever been.

1538
01:59:08,944 --> 01:59:12,446
I've got a position, and...

1539
01:59:12,905 --> 01:59:16,074
And Monsieur Antoine
is a splendid young man.

1540
01:59:19,743 --> 01:59:21,453
Bernadette...

1541
01:59:21,912 --> 01:59:25,915
have you any idea of what the
bishop's commission has been doing?

1542
01:59:26,207 --> 01:59:31,293
The gentlemen have examined and tested
all the people who have been cured.

1543
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:34,129
That's true. What of yourself?

1544
01:59:34,296 --> 01:59:37,841
Don't you think that you and your case
are part of their task also?

1545
01:59:38,466 --> 01:59:41,260
I've answered all
the gentlemen's questions.

1546
01:59:41,426 --> 01:59:44,262
I hope they won't ask me anymore.

1547
01:59:45,596 --> 01:59:47,264
The commission is now engaged...

1548
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:50,100
in writing a very important report
about you.

1549
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:54,519
It admits the possibility that
you were chosen by the powers above...

1550
01:59:54,686 --> 01:59:56,396
and that your hand alone...

1551
01:59:56,563 --> 01:59:59,773
brought forth the spring
responsible for miraculous cures.

1552
02:00:01,316 --> 02:00:03,734
Don't you understand what that means?

1553
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:05,528
No.

1554
02:00:06,027 --> 02:00:09,364
It means that the greatest
and the wisest men in the Church...

1555
02:00:09,572 --> 02:00:12,032
will be watching you for decades...

1556
02:00:12,491 --> 02:00:16,536
and then perhaps long after the rest
of us are dead and thought of no more...

1557
02:00:16,744 --> 02:00:19,454
- you will...
- But that's dreadful.

1558
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:22,123
I don't want it. It can't be.

1559
02:00:23,374 --> 02:00:25,333
It's no small matter.

1560
02:00:25,917 --> 02:00:27,669
No, no.

1561
02:00:28,211 --> 02:00:29,587
No!

1562
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:34,173
Tell me, aren't the Sisters
in the hospital and in the school...

1563
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:35,842
good and kind?

1564
02:00:36,259 --> 02:00:37,593
Yes.

1565
02:00:37,801 --> 02:00:39,970
Yes, they are. They're very sweet.

1566
02:00:40,136 --> 02:00:42,847
Could you imagine yourself
as one of them someday?

1567
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:45,849
Dear God, no. That's far above me.

1568
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:51,103
I just want to go and work
for Madame Millet as housemaid.

1569
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:52,604
Please.

1570
02:00:52,854 --> 02:00:54,480
My dear child.

1571
02:00:57,024 --> 02:01:00,484
To you,
the Most Blessed Virgin condescended.

1572
02:01:01,402 --> 02:01:04,154
This places a responsibility on you.

1573
02:01:04,779 --> 02:01:06,698
You can't suddenly play truant...

1574
02:01:06,865 --> 02:01:09,742
run away from your destiny
as though it were school...

1575
02:01:09,909 --> 02:01:12,535
and become an old widow's servant.

1576
02:01:13,703 --> 02:01:18,081
A long time ago, I told you
you were playing with fire, Bernadette.

1577
02:01:18,539 --> 02:01:22,168
Your lady was heavenly fire.

1578
02:01:22,334 --> 02:01:24,544
Heaven chose you...

1579
02:01:24,711 --> 02:01:28,005
and now there's nothing left for you
but to choose heaven.

1580
02:01:28,631 --> 02:01:30,214
Isn't that true?

1581
02:01:30,381 --> 02:01:31,883
Yes.

1582
02:01:32,216 --> 02:01:35,302
You'll like the life
with the Sisters at Nevers.

1583
02:01:35,677 --> 02:01:41,390
Their order is beautiful and lofty
and very much involved in practical life.

1584
02:01:50,188 --> 02:01:53,690
Everything you have said is true,
Your Reverence...

1585
02:01:53,857 --> 02:01:56,568
and I will do exactly as you say.

1586
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:01,404
- But...
- You're worried about your family?

1587
02:02:01,738 --> 02:02:03,198
You needn't.

1588
02:02:03,406 --> 02:02:05,240
You may stay with them until summer.

1589
02:02:05,407 --> 02:02:08,618
It'll take that long
before the report is fully complete...

1590
02:02:09,285 --> 02:02:13,789
and I've arranged for your father
to be established in the mill.

1591
02:02:14,289 --> 02:02:17,291
There, he can practise the trade
for which he was meant...

1592
02:02:17,458 --> 02:02:20,293
and your family can live
without fear of poverty.

1593
02:02:23,712 --> 02:02:25,506
No, no, no, no.

1594
02:02:27,216 --> 02:02:28,633
Bernadette.

1595
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:31,135
Just one moment.

1596
02:02:36,347 --> 02:02:38,599
I've something more to say.

1597
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:45,437
Although, as a member
of the commission, I shouldn't say it.

1598
02:02:45,604 --> 02:02:49,148
Now, mind you, I have full faith in you...

1599
02:02:49,857 --> 02:02:54,360
but there's always been one detail
which I never could help but doubt.

1600
02:02:54,944 --> 02:02:57,488
It's the words "Immaculate Conception."

1601
02:03:02,491 --> 02:03:07,954
If you could ever admit that this
phrase was not spoken by the lady...

1602
02:03:10,956 --> 02:03:13,624
things might be very different.

1603
02:03:15,793 --> 02:03:18,670
If you could retract this single incident...

1604
02:03:19,713 --> 02:03:23,674
then there might be, somewhere
in this world, a little corner...

1605
02:03:24,258 --> 02:03:27,218
where you could hide
and lead a normal life.

1606
02:03:33,472 --> 02:03:35,766
Would you like a little time
to think it over?

1607
02:03:37,642 --> 02:03:42,521
I don't need time, Your Reverence,
because I have never lied to you.

1608
02:03:43,689 --> 02:03:45,440
Did I speak of lying?

1609
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:47,483
And...

1610
02:03:47,983 --> 02:03:50,485
I don't want a little corner to hide in.

1611
02:03:52,611 --> 02:03:54,405
Good day, Your Reverence.

1612
02:04:19,256 --> 02:04:20,549
Bernadette.

1613
02:04:21,633 --> 02:04:24,302
May the patron saint of travellers
watch over you.

1614
02:04:24,469 --> 02:04:27,554
- Thank you.
- That's what we gave her!

1615
02:04:27,804 --> 02:04:30,890
Two will make my journey doubly safe.

1616
02:04:31,682 --> 02:04:33,892
Go along, Junior. Go along.

1617
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:35,810
Go on, Junior.

1618
02:04:41,273 --> 02:04:43,274
I don't want to say it. It sounds silly.

1619
02:04:43,441 --> 02:04:47,027
You owe your life to Bernadette.
You say it exactly as I taught you.

1620
02:04:52,782 --> 02:04:56,201
- We're going to miss you.
- I'm going to miss you too.

1621
02:04:56,367 --> 02:04:59,745
Bernadette, if I live to be 100,
I shall never forget this hour...

1622
02:04:59,912 --> 02:05:04,290
for it was you who snatched me
from the jaws of death and... Here.

1623
02:05:04,664 --> 02:05:08,126
A St. Christopher! How thoughtful.

1624
02:05:09,502 --> 02:05:11,629
Well, well, well, Bernadette.

1625
02:05:12,462 --> 02:05:14,422
I shall be only a moment.

1626
02:05:15,215 --> 02:05:18,383
I'm sorry to be late.
I was making a speech at the depot.

1627
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:21,969
So my old and dear friend
is leaving Lourdes.

1628
02:05:22,136 --> 02:05:27,390
Bernadette, never will I forget
those first days of trial and tribulation...

1629
02:05:27,556 --> 02:05:30,768
when practically we alone
stood side by side...

1630
02:05:30,935 --> 02:05:32,811
facing a doubting world.

1631
02:05:32,977 --> 02:05:35,354
- Always, I'll remember...
- Pardon me, Your Honour.

1632
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:37,689
The Sisters in the carriage grow impatient.

1633
02:05:37,856 --> 02:05:40,358
And I've not yet said goodbye to my family.

1634
02:05:40,525 --> 02:05:42,859
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly, certainly.

1635
02:05:43,026 --> 02:05:46,029
Here's something to enjoy on your journey.

1636
02:05:46,196 --> 02:05:48,739
- Thank you, monsieur.
- And this.

1637
02:05:48,906 --> 02:05:51,616
May the ever-watching
patron saint of travel...

1638
02:05:51,783 --> 02:05:56,578
hover over your carriage
and guide you safely to your destination.

1639
02:05:57,329 --> 02:05:58,746
Thank you, monsieur.

1640
02:06:05,876 --> 02:06:07,211
I...

1641
02:06:07,378 --> 02:06:09,963
wanted to say goodbye in here.

1642
02:06:21,847 --> 02:06:25,391
Keep well wrapped up, and remember that...

1643
02:06:27,184 --> 02:06:29,227
Maman, I don't need a shawl.

1644
02:06:29,394 --> 02:06:31,688
Nonsense.
It'll be windy, and your asthma...

1645
02:06:31,896 --> 02:06:33,188
Louise.

1646
02:06:34,189 --> 02:06:37,441
This is no time to talk about shawls.

1647
02:06:38,317 --> 02:06:42,362
So much to say
and so little time to say it.

1648
02:06:44,738 --> 02:06:47,907
When the time comes, one can say nothing.

1649
02:06:49,659 --> 02:06:52,035
One can only feel.

1650
02:06:53,787 --> 02:06:55,289
Goodbye, Papa.

1651
02:06:55,455 --> 02:06:57,582
Goodbye, my child.

1652
02:07:00,125 --> 02:07:02,085
Goodbye, Maman.

1653
02:07:08,256 --> 02:07:10,300
Goodbye, Bernadette.

1654
02:07:19,264 --> 02:07:23,726
Say goodbye to Madame Nicolau and...

1655
02:07:23,893 --> 02:07:25,769
And her son.

1656
02:07:43,908 --> 02:07:46,951
Please, dear Sisters,
I know you've waited so long.

1657
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:48,870
But may I have another moment?

1658
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,913
We must reach Toulouse before dark.

1659
02:07:51,079 --> 02:07:52,623
Oh, nothing can happen to us.

1660
02:07:52,789 --> 02:07:55,458
Look, I have enough protection
for even the horses.

1661
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:57,667
Very well, but hurry.

1662
02:08:09,343 --> 02:08:12,012
I said goodbye once this morning, I know...

1663
02:08:12,178 --> 02:08:14,639
but I have a little something for you.

1664
02:08:15,139 --> 02:08:17,557
Don't worry, it's not a St. Christopher.

1665
02:08:18,808 --> 02:08:21,727
You have only four.
I blessed five this morning.

1666
02:08:21,894 --> 02:08:23,895
Someone must be late.

1667
02:08:25,021 --> 02:08:26,689
Bernadette...

1668
02:08:27,564 --> 02:08:31,525
sometimes to express
certain things in a letter is difficult.

1669
02:08:32,151 --> 02:08:33,986
So wherever you may go...

1670
02:08:34,195 --> 02:08:36,321
if ever you should need me...

1671
02:08:36,988 --> 02:08:38,949
just send me this.

1672
02:08:39,531 --> 02:08:42,618
I shall understand and come immediately.

1673
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,204
Your Reverence...

1674
02:08:47,162 --> 02:08:50,249
if only you knew how much this means to me.

1675
02:08:51,207 --> 02:08:52,750
Goodbye.

1676
02:09:09,137 --> 02:09:11,681
Goodbye, Bernadette, and God bless you.

1677
02:09:51,918 --> 02:09:53,795
For you, mademoiselle.

1678
02:09:55,046 --> 02:09:57,256
Monsieur, they are so beautiful.

1679
02:09:57,423 --> 02:10:00,925
I didn't come to say goodbye
with the others because...

1680
02:10:01,718 --> 02:10:04,428
there was something I wanted to tell you.

1681
02:10:04,594 --> 02:10:06,513
What was it, Monsieur Antoine?

1682
02:10:07,930 --> 02:10:09,432
Well, I...

1683
02:10:10,308 --> 02:10:12,142
I wanted to say...

1684
02:10:13,518 --> 02:10:15,936
Well, my mother is getting old.

1685
02:10:17,062 --> 02:10:20,356
She and I are used to each other.
We get along very well.

1686
02:10:20,523 --> 02:10:22,774
So I've decided never to take a wife...

1687
02:10:24,109 --> 02:10:27,403
because a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law...

1688
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,905
well, that doesn't work out so well.

1689
02:10:31,364 --> 02:10:34,616
I'm going to stay unmarried too.

1690
02:10:36,201 --> 02:10:38,953
Well, that's what I wanted to say to you.

1691
02:10:40,121 --> 02:10:43,206
And now I wish you luck
on your journey, Bernadette.

1692
02:10:50,128 --> 02:10:52,255
Goodbye, Antoine.

1693
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:35,411
You are the postulant from Lourdes?

1694
02:11:35,578 --> 02:11:37,205
Yes, Mother Superior.

1695
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:38,873
What is your name?

1696
02:11:39,331 --> 02:11:42,334
Soubirous. Bernadette Soubirous.

1697
02:11:42,542 --> 02:11:43,918
How old are you?

1698
02:11:44,085 --> 02:11:45,669
Just past 20.

1699
02:11:45,836 --> 02:11:47,170
What can you do?

1700
02:11:47,962 --> 02:11:49,589
Oh...

1701
02:11:49,756 --> 02:11:51,882
Nothing that amounts to much.

1702
02:11:52,257 --> 02:11:54,842
In the world, what would you like
to have been?

1703
02:11:55,802 --> 02:11:58,804
I always thought I could have been
a good servant girl.

1704
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:01,056
Is that you, Sister Marie Therese?

1705
02:12:01,223 --> 02:12:02,681
Yes, Mother Superior.

1706
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:06,059
This is the mistress of the novices.
Look to her for guidance.

1707
02:12:06,393 --> 02:12:09,062
This is Bernadette Soubirous,
a new postulant.

1708
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:10,562
We know each other.

1709
02:12:10,729 --> 02:12:13,315
The postulant will start
in the kitchen tomorrow.

1710
02:12:13,482 --> 02:12:17,567
You will be asked to wash dishes,
scrub floors, sweep corridors.

1711
02:12:17,734 --> 02:12:20,821
In brief, do all the lowly tasks
that need to be done.

1712
02:12:20,987 --> 02:12:23,114
But, please observe, I do not command you.

1713
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,031
I am merely proposing this.

1714
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:28,451
If you do not feel equal to it,
or if it is repellent to you...

1715
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:31,578
physically or spiritually,
I wish you would say so now.

1716
02:12:31,745 --> 02:12:35,206
Oh, no, Mother Superior,
I'm very happy to work in the kitchen.

1717
02:12:35,373 --> 02:12:38,792
Good. Sister Marie Therese
will show you to your cell.

1718
02:12:38,959 --> 02:12:40,709
With your permission...

1719
02:12:40,876 --> 02:12:43,170
there is one other matter to be considered.

1720
02:12:43,337 --> 02:12:46,923
The postulant bears a name which
has made a great noise in the world.

1721
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:49,341
But among us,
great names have no meaning...

1722
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:53,010
although they may have been acquired
through far greater effort.

1723
02:12:53,469 --> 02:12:56,721
We disassociate ourselves
from all we have meant to the world...

1724
02:12:56,888 --> 02:12:58,765
and all it has meant to us.

1725
02:12:58,932 --> 02:13:04,352
Moreover, the name "Bernadette"
is a childish and trivial diminutive.

1726
02:13:04,644 --> 02:13:06,104
Quite right.

1727
02:13:06,312 --> 02:13:08,439
Before actually entering
upon your novitiate...

1728
02:13:08,647 --> 02:13:10,441
you will want to choose another name.

1729
02:13:10,649 --> 02:13:13,401
Under the circumstances,
it would be best to do so now.

1730
02:13:13,609 --> 02:13:15,986
Have you given the matter any thought?

1731
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:17,654
No, I haven't.

1732
02:13:17,821 --> 02:13:19,405
What was your godmother's name?

1733
02:13:19,613 --> 02:13:20,948
Bernarde.

1734
02:13:21,115 --> 02:13:24,951
Then surely you'll be happy to bear
the name of Marie Bernarde, my child.

1735
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:27,578
This way, Marie Bernarde.

1736
02:13:56,641 --> 02:13:59,226
This cell is not to your liking,
Marie Bernarde?

1737
02:13:59,393 --> 02:14:02,979
Yes, Sister, it is quite to my liking.

1738
02:14:03,146 --> 02:14:05,439
You will learn to be comfortable in it.

1739
02:14:09,442 --> 02:14:14,362
A convent is no prison.
No force is exercised here.

1740
02:14:14,905 --> 02:14:17,656
If you do not feel capable
of our obedience...

1741
02:14:17,823 --> 02:14:20,492
you will find the door is always open.

1742
02:14:21,075 --> 02:14:22,869
Good night, Marie Bernarde.

1743
02:14:23,036 --> 02:14:24,786
Good night, Sister.

1744
02:15:04,566 --> 02:15:06,359
Marie Bernarde.

1745
02:15:06,484 --> 02:15:07,818
Yes, Sister?

1746
02:15:08,027 --> 02:15:09,986
What are you thinking about?

1747
02:15:11,238 --> 02:15:12,614
About my family.

1748
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:15,783
Worldly remembrances
have no place in this house.

1749
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:18,159
We're here
for the purpose of concentration.

1750
02:15:18,326 --> 02:15:20,119
Not for reverie and woolgathering.

1751
02:15:20,328 --> 02:15:22,204
Yes, Sister.

1752
02:15:39,634 --> 02:15:42,636
- You find this work repellent?
- Oh, no, Sister, I...

1753
02:15:42,803 --> 02:15:46,639
Then let's show our willingness to serve
God and not hesitate in our tasks.

1754
02:15:46,806 --> 02:15:48,181
Yes, Sister.

1755
02:16:05,361 --> 02:16:07,862
Sister Marie Bernarde is limping.

1756
02:16:08,029 --> 02:16:09,990
Yes, I've noticed it.

1757
02:16:14,577 --> 02:16:18,496
I'm afraid it is a worldly desire
to become the centre of attention.

1758
02:16:19,454 --> 02:16:21,582
I shall speak to her.

1759
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,335
Sister Marie Bernarde.

1760
02:16:27,002 --> 02:16:29,671
- Come here, please.
- Yes, Sister.

1761
02:16:29,879 --> 02:16:31,672
I wish to speak with you.

1762
02:16:31,839 --> 02:16:35,508
Certainly, Sister.
Would you have me finish prayers first?

1763
02:16:35,675 --> 02:16:38,677
What I have to say
is just as important for your soul.

1764
02:16:38,844 --> 02:16:40,971
- We will speak in your cell.
- Yes, Sister.

1765
02:16:41,138 --> 02:16:43,222
Excuse me, Mother Superior.

1766
02:16:52,646 --> 02:16:54,522
Sit down, Marie Bernarde.

1767
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:58,859
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

1768
02:17:01,694 --> 02:17:03,029
Why do you limp?

1769
02:17:03,195 --> 02:17:04,696
Oh, it's nothing, Sister.

1770
02:17:04,863 --> 02:17:07,824
Limping gains sympathy
from the other Sisters. Is that it?

1771
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:09,533
But I never...

1772
02:17:09,742 --> 02:17:11,952
You forget, I've known you for many years.

1773
02:17:12,161 --> 02:17:14,996
In the outside world, you were celebrated.

1774
02:17:15,204 --> 02:17:18,624
From all over France,
people came just to gaze upon you.

1775
02:17:18,832 --> 02:17:20,541
Here, you are a nonentity.

1776
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:24,336
- You find that difficult, don't you?
- Oh, no.

1777
02:17:24,502 --> 02:17:28,339
The temptation to cling to your eminence
is undoubtedly too strong for you.

1778
02:17:28,672 --> 02:17:30,466
Truly, Sister...

1779
02:17:30,591 --> 02:17:34,552
never have I said or done anything
to attract attention.

1780
02:17:34,761 --> 02:17:38,889
I wish only to be one of the Sisters here,
nothing more.

1781
02:17:40,348 --> 02:17:44,392
Ten years ago I was forced to doubt you.
I have not changed.

1782
02:17:45,101 --> 02:17:47,102
I have never told you an untruth.

1783
02:17:48,145 --> 02:17:50,147
I have tried to believe you.

1784
02:17:50,314 --> 02:17:53,274
Only God knows how hard I've tried...

1785
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,275
but I cannot.

1786
02:17:55,776 --> 02:17:57,694
What is it you don't believe?

1787
02:17:57,861 --> 02:18:00,279
What everyone else is willing to believe.

1788
02:18:00,613 --> 02:18:02,364
The lady?

1789
02:18:02,947 --> 02:18:06,283
I did see her. I did.

1790
02:18:07,451 --> 02:18:11,913
Many agree with you,
even the Holy Father in Rome...

1791
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,956
but I do not. I cannot.

1792
02:18:16,667 --> 02:18:19,251
What do you know of suffering?

1793
02:18:19,794 --> 02:18:21,253
Nothing.

1794
02:18:21,628 --> 02:18:24,172
In all our sacred history...

1795
02:18:24,631 --> 02:18:28,133
the chosen ones have always been
those who have suffered.

1796
02:18:28,634 --> 02:18:31,052
Why, then, should God choose you?

1797
02:18:31,844 --> 02:18:33,303
Why not me?

1798
02:18:35,305 --> 02:18:37,098
I cannot answer that.

1799
02:18:37,264 --> 02:18:39,392
I know what it is to suffer.

1800
02:18:40,059 --> 02:18:44,395
Look at my eyes.
They burn like the very fires of hell.

1801
02:18:44,561 --> 02:18:45,938
Why?

1802
02:18:46,105 --> 02:18:50,400
Because they need sleep. They need
rest, which I will not give them.

1803
02:18:50,566 --> 02:18:53,443
My throat is parched from constant prayer.

1804
02:18:53,610 --> 02:18:57,196
My hands are gnarled
from serving God in humiliation.

1805
02:18:57,363 --> 02:19:00,699
My body is pain-racked from stone floors.

1806
02:19:00,865 --> 02:19:05,494
Yes, I have suffered, because I know
it is the only true road to heaven.

1807
02:19:06,078 --> 02:19:10,832
And if I, who have tortured myself,
cannot glimpse the Blessed Virgin...

1808
02:19:10,998 --> 02:19:15,584
how can you, who have never
felt pain, dare to say you've seen her?

1809
02:19:17,044 --> 02:19:19,504
I don't know why I was chosen.

1810
02:19:20,672 --> 02:19:23,465
You are a hundred times more worthy.

1811
02:19:24,550 --> 02:19:26,968
If only I could find evidence.

1812
02:19:27,635 --> 02:19:30,012
If only you could give me some proof...

1813
02:19:30,554 --> 02:19:32,848
maybe then I could believe.

1814
02:19:34,181 --> 02:19:37,101
Maybe then these monsters
of doubt and hate...

1815
02:19:37,268 --> 02:19:40,437
would stop consuming my very soul.

1816
02:19:41,229 --> 02:19:44,773
For the love of God, Sister,
give me some proof!

1817
02:19:45,606 --> 02:19:48,192
I wish I could help you.

1818
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:52,279
But I have never suffered.

1819
02:19:53,071 --> 02:19:54,864
I've never

1820
02:19:58,450 --> 02:20:00,702
Perhaps I can help you.

1821
02:20:02,369 --> 02:20:05,246
It may be there is proof for you.

1822
02:20:41,774 --> 02:20:43,441
Well, doctor?

1823
02:20:43,608 --> 02:20:46,778
Well, in addition to the large tumor
on the knee...

1824
02:20:46,943 --> 02:20:49,404
she has tuberculosis of the bone.

1825
02:20:50,113 --> 02:20:52,531
She has never complained of pain?

1826
02:20:53,324 --> 02:20:54,699
No.

1827
02:20:56,451 --> 02:20:58,119
Has she?

1828
02:20:58,368 --> 02:21:00,412
She never mentioned it.

1829
02:21:01,038 --> 02:21:02,914
I can't understand it.

1830
02:21:03,456 --> 02:21:05,917
She's had this affliction for a long time.

1831
02:21:06,082 --> 02:21:10,127
The constant pain and suffering which
is so characteristic of this disease...

1832
02:21:10,294 --> 02:21:12,588
is too horrible to describe.

1833
02:21:26,848 --> 02:21:28,141
Oh, God.

1834
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:32,977
I have tried to storm the gates of heaven
by sacrificing myself.

1835
02:21:33,269 --> 02:21:35,855
I know now that we must be chosen...

1836
02:21:36,064 --> 02:21:39,399
that we must be graced
as you have graced this child.

1837
02:21:40,566 --> 02:21:42,527
God forgive me.

1838
02:21:42,693 --> 02:21:45,445
I've persecuted her,
and I did not believe her...

1839
02:21:45,612 --> 02:21:48,697
because I was filled with hate and envy.

1840
02:21:50,449 --> 02:21:55,662
God help me to serve this chosen soul
for the rest of my days.

1841
02:21:56,787 --> 02:21:58,664
God help me!

1842
02:21:58,789 --> 02:22:00,706
God help me!

1843
02:22:41,862 --> 02:22:44,531
You seem a trifle stronger today, Sister.

1844
02:22:44,698 --> 02:22:47,741
Yes, thank you, Mother Superior, I am.

1845
02:22:47,908 --> 02:22:51,369
Sister Marie Therese and I
have been discussing the possibility...

1846
02:22:51,536 --> 02:22:53,079
of your taking a trip.

1847
02:22:53,246 --> 02:22:54,580
Trip?

1848
02:22:54,746 --> 02:22:58,541
We could make the journey to our
convent at Lourdes in easy stages.

1849
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:00,585
Lourdes?

1850
02:23:01,001 --> 02:23:04,212
Should not you, of all people,
take advantage of the benefit...

1851
02:23:04,379 --> 02:23:06,797
that's come to the whole world through you?

1852
02:23:08,132 --> 02:23:09,966
That cannot be done.

1853
02:23:10,133 --> 02:23:11,926
And why not?

1854
02:23:12,968 --> 02:23:15,429
The spring is not for me.

1855
02:23:16,304 --> 02:23:19,682
Why should not the spring work
in your case of all cases, Sister?

1856
02:23:21,391 --> 02:23:23,768
The spring is not for me.

1857
02:23:24,351 --> 02:23:26,687
Did the lady tell you that, my child?

1858
02:23:27,812 --> 02:23:33,942
She said, "I cannot promise you
happiness in this world.

1859
02:23:34,693 --> 02:23:36,736
Only in the next."

1860
02:23:40,322 --> 02:23:42,782
The spring is not for me.

1861
02:24:09,968 --> 02:24:11,553
Thank you, doctor.

1862
02:24:13,888 --> 02:24:16,891
In that case, Father,
we must notify the bishop immediately.

1863
02:24:17,099 --> 02:24:21,560
He wants to hear from Marie
Bernarde's lips a final confirmation.

1864
02:25:05,468 --> 02:25:08,720
Sister Marie Bernarde,
we shall read to you...

1865
02:25:08,887 --> 02:25:12,390
the final protocol
of the Commission of Investigation...

1866
02:25:12,556 --> 02:25:14,517
assembled in 1858.

1867
02:25:15,392 --> 02:25:20,437
It contains a record of all the testimony
which you offered at the time.

1868
02:25:20,688 --> 02:25:25,316
We ask nothing of you,
except that you confirm that testimony.

1869
02:25:25,942 --> 02:25:28,652
Do you feel equal to that?

1870
02:25:36,533 --> 02:25:38,158
Yes.

1871
02:25:41,828 --> 02:25:45,747
"On February 11th,
in the year of our Lord, 1858...

1872
02:25:45,956 --> 02:25:48,792
I, Bernadette Soubirous,
was sent in the company...

1873
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:52,670
of my sister Marie
and my friend Jeanne Abadie...

1874
02:25:52,878 --> 02:25:54,838
to fetch firewood in the forest."

1875
02:25:55,255 --> 02:25:56,965
Do you confirm this?

1876
02:25:58,465 --> 02:25:59,800
I did see her.

1877
02:25:59,967 --> 02:26:02,093
"At a location known as Massabielle...

1878
02:26:02,301 --> 02:26:05,804
I rested while my sister and friend
crossed the River Gave."

1879
02:26:05,971 --> 02:26:08,265
Do you confirm this?

1880
02:26:10,599 --> 02:26:13,768
I did see her.

1881
02:26:13,935 --> 02:26:15,562
"For a time, nothing happened...

1882
02:26:15,729 --> 02:26:18,939
- and then, suddenly, I noticed...
- I did see her!

1883
02:26:19,106 --> 02:26:21,691
the grotto was shaking.
I thought this strange..."

1884
02:26:21,858 --> 02:26:23,526
I did see her.

1885
02:26:24,109 --> 02:26:26,695
I did see her.

1886
02:26:32,699 --> 02:26:33,992
I...

1887
02:26:35,243 --> 02:26:37,828
did see her.

1888
02:26:47,877 --> 02:26:50,004
You're not sorry you came back to visit us?

1889
02:26:50,171 --> 02:26:54,007
No. Five years,
I've been stationed in Languedoc...

1890
02:26:54,215 --> 02:26:57,009
a stinking hole if ever there was one.

1891
02:26:57,301 --> 02:27:01,637
Now that I see this, I realise
what a paradise I've been living in.

1892
02:27:01,846 --> 02:27:07,058
You see, my friend, how deeply
hell reaches into human life.

1893
02:27:07,224 --> 02:27:10,894
Poor ignorant sheep. Why do they come?

1894
02:27:11,061 --> 02:27:14,605
Because they have faith.
Because they're desperate.

1895
02:27:14,772 --> 02:27:17,316
Because occasionally someone is cured.

1896
02:27:17,483 --> 02:27:21,360
And because some hypochondriac,
due to emotional excitement...

1897
02:27:21,526 --> 02:27:24,196
forgets a malady that never existed.

1898
02:27:24,362 --> 02:27:27,198
Oh, yes, we have hundreds of those.

1899
02:27:27,364 --> 02:27:31,201
But we have many, many other cases
that aren't so easy to explain.

1900
02:27:31,367 --> 02:27:36,080
Yesterday, there was a woman
with lupus, tuberculosis of the face.

1901
02:27:36,913 --> 02:27:39,832
Suddenly, she discovered
a nose and a mouth...

1902
02:27:39,999 --> 02:27:41,583
where only minutes before...

1903
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:45,169
there was nothing
but one large, decaying cavity.

1904
02:27:45,336 --> 02:27:46,670
Please, doctor...

1905
02:27:46,837 --> 02:27:49,631
I'm not a gullible sheepherder
from the Pyrenees.

1906
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:53,258
We have pictures in the office.
Would you care to see?

1907
02:27:53,425 --> 02:27:55,469
Gentlemen, what's the use?

1908
02:27:55,886 --> 02:27:59,138
This same argument has been going on
for a great many years...

1909
02:27:59,347 --> 02:28:02,432
and, I'm afraid, will go on
for a great many more.

1910
02:28:02,599 --> 02:28:05,851
To those who believe in God,
no explanation is necessary.

1911
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:08,728
To those who do not,
no explanation will suffice.

1912
02:28:08,895 --> 02:28:10,230
- Your Reverence.
- Adolar.

1913
02:28:10,396 --> 02:28:12,856
A message. Your housekeeper
thought it was important...

1914
02:28:13,065 --> 02:28:14,900
- and asked me to bring it.
- Thank you.

1915
02:28:15,066 --> 02:28:17,777
This is the first. You remember him,
the Bouhouhorts child?

1916
02:28:18,528 --> 02:28:21,696
- Is that all, Your Reverence?
- Yes, thank you, Adolar.

1917
02:28:24,490 --> 02:28:27,200
Have the doctor give you
something for that cold.

1918
02:28:27,367 --> 02:28:28,701
No.

1919
02:28:29,035 --> 02:28:33,372
It's just a little laryngitis I picked up
from the drafty train last night.

1920
02:28:33,539 --> 02:28:35,456
It will be gone by tomorrow.

1921
02:28:35,706 --> 02:28:37,041
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1922
02:28:37,208 --> 02:28:39,918
- Good day.
- Good day, dean.

1923
02:28:40,502 --> 02:28:43,087
And I give you full permission,
dear doctor...

1924
02:28:43,295 --> 02:28:45,631
to write down in your big book...

1925
02:28:45,797 --> 02:28:50,676
that my amazing recovery
was due solely to the Lady of Lourdes.

1926
02:28:51,677 --> 02:28:53,220
If I kept such a book...

1927
02:28:53,386 --> 02:28:56,139
I would write you down
merely as a skeptic...

1928
02:28:56,430 --> 02:29:00,016
who I promise will leave Lourdes
at least...

1929
02:29:00,642 --> 02:29:01,976
wondering.

1930
02:29:02,184 --> 02:29:05,728
Not I, doctor. Not I.

1931
02:29:06,312 --> 02:29:08,772
This place only succeeds in revolting me.

1932
02:29:08,939 --> 02:29:11,942
Once it was a dull
but pleasing little village.

1933
02:29:12,109 --> 02:29:15,069
Now look at it. A tremendous sponge...

1934
02:29:15,236 --> 02:29:18,697
- sopping up the infection of the world.
- Good morning, Monsieur Jones.

1935
02:29:18,864 --> 02:29:20,614
- Morning, Dr. Dozous.
- Gentlemen.

1936
02:29:20,781 --> 02:29:23,159
- Good day, monsieur.
- You look better today.

1937
02:29:23,325 --> 02:29:26,911
Yes, doctor, I think I feel much better
today, thank you.

1938
02:29:31,331 --> 02:29:33,833
Monsieur Jones' voice
has a lot in common...

1939
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,668
with Monsieur Dutour's.

1940
02:29:40,004 --> 02:29:41,547
Don't you think?

1941
02:29:42,298 --> 02:29:45,508
Yes, now that you mention it.

1942
02:29:47,509 --> 02:29:50,845
Monsieur Jones has cancer of the larynx.

1943
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,021
- Holy Mary.
- Pray for us.

1944
02:30:02,229 --> 02:30:04,189
- Mother of God.
- Pray for us.

1945
02:30:04,397 --> 02:30:07,149
- Holy Virgin of virgins.
- Pray for us.

1946
02:30:07,357 --> 02:30:09,234
- Mother of Christ.
- Pray for us.

1947
02:30:09,401 --> 02:30:11,444
- Mother of divine grace.
- Pray for us.

1948
02:30:11,652 --> 02:30:12,945
Mother most pure.

1949
02:30:13,154 --> 02:30:15,155
<i>I am a stranger here.</i>

1950
02:30:15,363 --> 02:30:18,157
<i>I am not like these thousands of souls...</i>

1951
02:30:18,324 --> 02:30:22,076
<i>flickering brightly and hopefully
in the darkness.</i>

1952
02:30:22,243 --> 02:30:25,913
<i>My pride has always stood
between them and me.</i>

1953
02:30:26,455 --> 02:30:30,041
<i>The pride of being a superior human being.</i>

1954
02:30:30,583 --> 02:30:34,711
<i>But now I know that we are all
a wretched, animal species...</i>

1955
02:30:34,878 --> 02:30:40,466
<i>distinguished from the insects only
by nerve centres and false reasoning.</i>

1956
02:30:40,757 --> 02:30:44,177
<i>A hungry cancer is feeding at my throat.</i>

1957
02:30:44,635 --> 02:30:47,763
<i>Tomorrow, I'll crawl back to Languedoc...</i>

1958
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:51,766
<i>hide in some hole of death
and be heard of no more.</i>

1959
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:55,936
<i>I'll be alone, alone and desolate.</i>

1960
02:30:56,393 --> 02:30:59,730
<i>And why not? It's logical.</i>

1961
02:30:59,896 --> 02:31:03,191
<i>I'll be alone
because I have loved no one...</i>

1962
02:31:03,399 --> 02:31:07,277
<i>no one and nothing, not even myself.</i>

1963
02:31:10,905 --> 02:31:12,489
Nothing.

1964
02:31:14,449 --> 02:31:16,075
Nothing.

1965
02:31:17,201 --> 02:31:19,369
- Queen of Apostles.
- Pray for us.

1966
02:31:19,535 --> 02:31:21,454
- Queen of Martyrs.
- Pray for us.

1967
02:31:21,621 --> 02:31:23,038
Queen of All Saints.

1968
02:31:23,205 --> 02:31:25,707
Pray for me, Bernadette.

1969
02:31:47,139 --> 02:31:49,808
- Your Reverence.
- My child.

1970
02:31:51,309 --> 02:31:53,311
I didn't lie to you.

1971
02:31:53,477 --> 02:31:55,854
God knows you didn't.

1972
02:31:56,897 --> 02:31:59,440
They questioned me...

1973
02:31:59,607 --> 02:32:02,109
again and again.

1974
02:32:03,235 --> 02:32:05,278
I saw her.

1975
02:32:08,114 --> 02:32:10,657
Tell them I saw her.

1976
02:32:12,492 --> 02:32:14,827
They won't believe me.

1977
02:32:15,369 --> 02:32:18,037
Yes, my little one. You saw her.

1978
02:32:19,247 --> 02:32:21,456
And you will see her again.

1979
02:32:23,166 --> 02:32:24,959
I'm not so sure.

1980
02:32:27,712 --> 02:32:30,422
Maybe I haven't suffered enough.

1981
02:32:30,588 --> 02:32:34,341
You've suffered enough, my child,
for the heaven of heavens.

1982
02:32:36,050 --> 02:32:37,427
No.

1983
02:32:39,387 --> 02:32:42,264
I know about sick people.

1984
02:32:44,557 --> 02:32:47,642
We all exaggerate a little.

1985
02:32:50,395 --> 02:32:54,064
Our pains aren't so terrible.

1986
02:32:56,816 --> 02:32:59,901
I believe.

1987
02:33:03,404 --> 02:33:04,905
Sister.

1988
02:33:06,781 --> 02:33:08,241
Sister.

1989
02:33:10,576 --> 02:33:12,411
Are the pains worse?

1990
02:33:17,914 --> 02:33:20,042
What day is this?

1991
02:33:20,208 --> 02:33:21,834
Wednesday.

1992
02:33:22,752 --> 02:33:24,503
Wednesday?

1993
02:33:29,923 --> 02:33:31,425
Tomorrow...

1994
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:35,595
Tomorrow will be Thursday.

1995
02:33:41,098 --> 02:33:43,142
The lady...

1996
02:33:45,352 --> 02:33:47,145
Madame...

1997
02:33:49,104 --> 02:33:51,273
Madame...

1998
02:33:55,610 --> 02:33:57,611
Madame...

1999
02:34:01,864 --> 02:34:05,283
The lady won't come here, Your Reverence.

2000
02:34:07,202 --> 02:34:09,953
I'll never see her again.

2001
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:12,288
You will, my child.

2002
02:34:12,538 --> 02:34:13,915
No.

2003
02:34:15,749 --> 02:34:19,001
No, I was stupid and lazy.

2004
02:34:20,878 --> 02:34:25,673
I didn't even know
what the Holy Trinity was.

2005
02:34:26,549 --> 02:34:28,842
Where are you, madame?

2006
02:34:29,593 --> 02:34:31,552
Where are you?

2007
02:34:32,512 --> 02:34:34,388
She's gone.

2008
02:34:34,805 --> 02:34:37,557
Behold, my beloved, speaketh to me.

2009
02:34:37,724 --> 02:34:41,644
Arise, make haste, my love, my dove,
my beautiful one.

2010
02:34:41,852 --> 02:34:43,186
I won't see her.

2011
02:34:43,353 --> 02:34:47,064
For winter is now past...

2012
02:34:47,231 --> 02:34:50,441
I'll never see her again.

2013
02:34:50,608 --> 02:34:52,902
Divine flowers yield their sweet smell...

2014
02:34:53,069 --> 02:34:54,653
Never...

2015
02:34:56,363 --> 02:34:58,114
Never...

2016
02:35:01,491 --> 02:35:04,369
I'll never see...

2017
02:35:04,828 --> 02:35:09,539
Let thy voice sound in my ears,
for thy voice is sweet.

2018
02:35:20,505 --> 02:35:22,382
I love you.

2019
02:35:23,383 --> 02:35:25,008
I love you.

2020
02:35:25,175 --> 02:35:28,886
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

2021
02:35:29,053 --> 02:35:32,305
Holy Mary, mother of God...

2022
02:35:32,472 --> 02:35:35,100
pray for me.

2023
02:35:38,853 --> 02:35:43,397
<i>Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.</i>

2024
02:35:43,564 --> 02:35:45,065
Amen.

2025
02:35:45,357 --> 02:35:48,067
You are now in heaven and on earth.

2026
02:35:49,026 --> 02:35:52,195
Your life begins, O Bernadette.
