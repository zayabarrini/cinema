1
00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:03,380
(film reel rattling)

2
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,627
(dramatic orchestral music)

3
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,700
(peaceful piano music)

4
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:47,043
(people socializing)

5
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,337
- Now, now, Charles, that's
not being chivalrous.

6
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:50,746
- And don't worry, Mr. Wilcox.

7
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,399
There's no place in
this game for chivalry.

8
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:56,177
It tends to bring out
the animal in all of us.

9
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,889
Evie, not fair!

10
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,186
(owl hooting)

11
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,727
(lilting harp and flute music)

12
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:30,688
- "Dearest Meg, I'm
having a glorious time.

13
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,023
"I like them all.

14
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,900
"They are the very
happiest, jolliest

15
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,652
"family that you could imagine.

16
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,946
"The fun of it is that
they think me a noodle

17
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:42,158
(chuckles) "and say so,
at least Ms. Wilcox does.

18
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,494
"Oh, Meg, shall we ever
learn to talk less?

19
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,581
(laughs) "Oh, but, Meg,
Meg, dearest, dearest Meg,

20
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,293
"I don't know what to
say or what you will say.

21
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,420
"Paul Wilcox and I are in love.

22
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,880
"We are engaged."

23
00:04:58,883 --> 00:04:59,467
Annie.

24
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,470
- Well, you Schlegel girls.

25
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,930
- Tibby, look.

26
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:07,809
- Margaret, if I may interfere,
what on earth is going on?

27
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,311
- I can tell you
nothing, Aunt Juley.

28
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,231
I know no more than you do.

29
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,817
We only met the
Wilcoxes last spring

30
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,819
while we were hiking in Germany.

31
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,612
- Oh, dear.

32
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,239
Obviously, someone
must go down to

33
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,927
this Howards House
and make inquiries.

34
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,116
- Howards End.

35
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,910
- No, Margaret,
inquiries are necessary.

36
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,578
What do we know
about these Wilcoxes?

37
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,579
Are they our sort?

38
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,832
Are they likely people?

39
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,085
- But Aunt Juley,
what does it matter?

40
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,212
Helen's in love.

41
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,548
That's all I need to know.

42
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,593
- Would you please get me
a train timetable, dear?

43
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,430
(birds chirping)

44
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,070
- Morning.

45
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,196
- Morning.

46
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,243
- Paul?

47
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,001
- [Henry] I'm afraid Crane
has reported sick again.

48
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,409
- [Evie] But he was to take me

49
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,771
to the Warringtons
today for tennis.

50
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,047
I told him.

51
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,507
- Probably shamming, of course.

52
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:22,818
You should get rid
of him, Father.

53
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:23,634
Hire a new chauffeur.

54
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,387
(motor running)

55
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,598
Mother, we're off, goodbye.

56
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,892
- But Charlie,
Charlie, wait, wait!

57
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,684
- What?

58
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,894
- Is Papa there?

59
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,353
Wait a minute.

60
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,522
We've got some cherries.

61
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:42,361
(engine drowns out other sounds)

62
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,451
Evie.

63
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,914
- All right, we're off!

64
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,122
- Bye-bye.

65
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,837
- About last night.

66
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,631
- Nothing happened.

67
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,818
- I'm afraid I lost
my head, rather.

68
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,427
- Yes, we both did.

69
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,431
It must have been the moonlight,
except there was no moon.

70
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,892
Well, that's quite all right.

71
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,729
- Do you mind?

72
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:17,938
- No.

73
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,655
- You see, I've no
money of my own,

74
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,534
and I still have to
make my way in Nigeria.

75
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,136
It's beastly out there
for a white woman,

76
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,165
what with the climate and
the natives and all that.

77
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,851
I say, I do think
you're a ripping girl.

78
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,252
- It's quite all right.

79
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,212
No one knows about it.

80
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,132
Meg, I wrote to my sister.

81
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,508
- [Paul] Oh no, you didn't.

82
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,717
- Yes, I'm sorry.

83
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,177
Look, she's sure to come down.

84
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,595
We must stop her.

85
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,031
- We'll have to send a telegram.

86
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,098
Oh, Crane's off sick.

87
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,599
- [Helen] Isn't there a bicycle?

88
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,601
- Oh yes, there is, somewhere.

89
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,689
(lilting harp and flute music)

90
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:05,736
- [Shop Owner] That will be one

91
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,072
and threepence, halfpenny, sir.

92
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:12,410
- [Helen] M.J. Schlegel, Six
Wickham Place, London, West.

93
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,413
Dear Meg, all over.

94
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,957
Wish I'd never written.

95
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,834
Tell no one, Helen.

96
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,796
(train chuffing)

97
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,071
- Excuse me, I'm looking for
somewhere called Howards House.

98
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,364
- [Charles] My parcel?

99
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,908
- The porter has it.

100
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,870
- Mr. Wilcox, this
lady wants Howards End.

101
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,455
- Forgive my asking, are you the

102
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,249
younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?

103
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,834
- The younger, ah.

104
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,420
This station's
abominably organized.

105
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,356
If I had my way, the whole lot
of them should get the sack.

106
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,089
Thank you. Bernard.

107
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,758
- [Bernard] Thank you. Sir.

108
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,760
- Perhaps I should
introduce myself.

109
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,720
I am Ms. Schlegel's aunt.

110
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,823
- Oh, rather, yes, Ms.
Schlegel's stopping with us.

111
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,431
(whistling)

112
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,766
Do you want to see her?

113
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,993
- Well, that would
be very nice, yes.

114
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,519
- I could run you
up in the motor.

115
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:30,196
- All the Schlegels
are exceptional.

116
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,124
They are, of course,
British to the backbone

117
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,243
but their father was
German, and that is why

118
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,829
they care for
literature and art.

119
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,331
- Just one minute.

120
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,254
Wilcox, Howards End.

121
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,782
- I'd like you to
know that I come

122
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,966
in no spirit of interference.

123
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:54,262
I'm here to represent the
family, and to talk to you

124
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,307
about Helen, Mr. Wilcox,
my niece and you.

125
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,476
- Ms. Schlegel and myself?

126
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,914
- [Aunt Juley] I trust there's
been no misunderstanding.

127
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,958
- [Charles] Well, it is true
that I am engaged to be married

128
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:08,651
but to another young
lady, not to Ms. Schlegel.

129
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,337
- [Aunt Juley] Helen
wrote to us, Mr. Wilcox.

130
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,738
She has told us everything.

131
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:16,534
- Good God, it's some
foolery of Paul's.

132
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,119
- But you are Paul.

133
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,537
- No, I'm not.

134
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,181
- Then why did you
say so at the station?

135
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:21,914
- I said nothing of the sort.

136
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:22,832
- I beg your pardon, you did.

137
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,101
- I beg your pardon, I did not.

138
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,960
My name is Charles.

139
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,046
Do you mean to tell me that
Paul and your niece have...

140
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,255
The idiot!

141
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,173
Damn fool!

142
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,803
Look, I warn you.

143
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,513
It's useless.

144
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:38,472
Paul hasn't a penny.

145
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,016
- No need to warn us.

146
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,851
The warning is
all the other way.

147
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,936
- Oh, but he hasn't told
us, whereas your niece

148
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,980
has lost no time in
publishing the news.

149
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,940
- If I were a man,
Mr. Wilcox, for that

150
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,900
last remark, I'd box your ears.

151
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,004
You're not fit to sit in
the same room as my niece.

152
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,468
- All I know is she
spread the news—

153
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,216
- Might I finish my
sentence, please?

154
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,159
- No, I decline to argue
with such a person!

155
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,453
Let me out of this
car this instant!

156
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,038
- Don't try and stand up!

157
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,307
- [Aunt Juley] Stop, stop!
- Sit down, sit down!

158
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,915
- [Aunt Juley] Stop!
- Just sit down!

159
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,376
For goodness sakes, just...

160
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:13,257
(peaceful orchestral music)

161
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,598
(bicycle bell rings)

162
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,111
Push it down.

163
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,997
- It's all right.

164
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,842
("Symphony No. 5 in C minor"
by Ludwig van Beethoven)

165
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,995
- It will, I think, be generally

166
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,124
admitted that Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony

167
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,377
is the most sublime
noise ever to

168
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,213
have penetrated the ear of man.

169
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:36,966
What does it mean?

170
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,136
We can hardly fail to
recognize in this music

171
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:44,014
a mighty drama, the
struggle of a hero

172
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:48,060
beset by perils,
riding to magnificent

173
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,605
victory and ultimate
triumph, as described

174
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,526
in the development section
of the first movement.

175
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,695
What I want to draw
your attention to now

176
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,613
is the third movement.

177
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,952
We no longer hear the
hero, but a goblin.

178
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,745
Thank you, Mother.

179
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,248
(classical piano music)

180
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,750
- A single, solitary goblin,

181
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,796
walking across the universe,

182
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,425
from beginning to end.

183
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,475
- Why a goblin?

184
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,370
- [Lecturer] I beg your pardon?

185
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,021
- Why a goblin?

186
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,439
- Well, it's obvious.

187
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,984
The goblin signifies
the spirit of negation.

188
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:40,571
- [Man Asking a Question] But
why specifically a goblin?

189
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,534
- Panic and emptiness, that
is what the goblin signifies.

190
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,453
Minor, spelling panic.

191
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,499
Major, magnificent.

192
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,000
(classical orchestral music)

193
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,668
A hero, triumphant.

194
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,298
- Miss.

195
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,552
Excuse me, Miss, my umbrella.

196
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,308
Miss.

197
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,242
(thunder rumbles)

198
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,371
Miss, miss!

199
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,211
(splashing)

200
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,672
(church bells ringing)

201
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,343
- Mrs. Wilcox, I haven't
got her wedding dress wet.

202
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,279
- [Man Running Towards
Charles] Hurry up, Charles.

203
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,222
(screams)

204
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,308
- Go on, in you go.

205
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,192
Paul, my hat's in your hand.

206
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,610
- Goodbye.

207
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:02,987
See you there.

208
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,321
(rain hissing)

209
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,242
(horses clopping)

210
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,971
(thunder rumbles)

211
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,892
- What astonishing bad
luck, that in the whole

212
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,729
of London, they could
find no flat to rent

213
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,273
except the one bottled right
up against our library window.

214
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,442
- [Tibby] Who
could find no flat?

215
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,694
- Oh Tibby, the Wilcoxes.

216
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,864
Surely even you
remember that business

217
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,950
last summer with
Helen and Paul Wilcox.

218
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,827
- Paul Wilcox.

219
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,872
The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

220
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,290
(dramatic classical music)

221
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,167
- [Leonard] Oh, miss!

222
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,229
- What is it?

223
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,981
- Is Tibby ill?

224
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,983
- Tibby's making tea.

225
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:27,363
- Oh, well, if it's
nothing worse than that.

226
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:32,034
- Now, Helen, oh dear,
something odd has happened.

227
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,370
Promise me you won't mind.

228
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,456
It's the Wilcoxes.

229
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,709
They've taken the
flat opposite for

230
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,254
the wedding of their
son, the other son.

231
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,842
You do mind.

232
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,687
- Will Paul Wilcox point
at our house and say,

233
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,655
"There lives the girl
who tried to catch me?"

234
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,731
- Ridiculous.

235
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:05,567
They've only taken the flat for

236
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,237
a few weeks, the porter said.

237
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:15,160
- Do we bow, or do
we cut them dead?

238
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:19,248
- Darling, why don't you take
up Cousin Frieda's invitation

239
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,751
and go to Hamburg
for those few weeks?

240
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,461
- Yes, I think I shall.

241
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,256
Not that it matters, but...

242
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,427
one wouldn't want to keep
bumping into Wilcoxes.

243
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,516
- Don't hog all
those scones, Tibby.

244
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,692
- Is that young man
for us, do you suppose?

245
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,943
He is for us.

246
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,371
- If you'll pardon me,
Miss, you took my umbrella.

247
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,248
Quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

248
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:05,586
At the Ethical Hall,
"Music and Meaning."

249
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,629
- I'm so sorry.

250
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,506
I do nothing but
steal umbrellas.

251
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:10,424
Do come in and choose one.

252
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,301
It's all right, Annie.

253
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,928
Now let's see, is yours
a hooky or a knobbly?

254
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:15,721
Mine's a knobbly.

255
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:16,513
At least, I think it is.

256
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:17,723
No, that's Tibby's.

257
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,349
How about this one?

258
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,619
I suppose you really oughtn't
open these things indoors.

259
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,643
Oh well, never mind.

260
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,146
No, it's all gone
along the seams.

261
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,434
It's an appalling umbrella.

262
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,732
It must be mine.

263
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,028
Oh, I'm so sorry.

264
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,614
- Has my sister
stolen your umbrella?

265
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,157
Oh, not again, Helen.

266
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,525
She is an incorrigible thief.

267
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,993
I am so sorry.

268
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,496
- I say, do stay
for tea, Mister...

269
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,704
- Bast.

270
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,099
- Mr. Bast, won't
you stay for tea?

271
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,476
- Oh yes, do stay
for tea, Mr. Bast.

272
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,460
It's the least we can do,
having made you all wet.

273
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,587
Our brother's upstairs,
so you'll have a chaperon.

274
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,839
- Look, he's soaked,
Meg, please come up.

275
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,051
- [Margaret] Helen,
bring him upstairs.

276
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,719
- What did you think
of the lecture?

277
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,488
I don't agree about
the goblins, do you?

278
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,348
But I do about the
heroes and shipwreck.

279
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,916
You see, I'd always
imagined a trio

280
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,851
of elephants dancing
at that point.

281
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,100
Well, he obviously didn't.

282
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,246
"Music and Meaning," Margaret.

283
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,438
- Oh, "Music and Meaning."

284
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,149
Does music have meaning, of
the literary kind, I mean?

285
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,358
- That's pure slush.

286
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
- A guest.

287
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,921
Mr. Bast, won't you
take off your coat?

288
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,446
- And trust us
with your umbrella?

289
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,198
And sit down.

290
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,574
- Have some tea, won't you?

291
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,594
- How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

292
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,202
- China tea?

293
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,453
- Do you take sugar?

294
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,056
- Only the score, what
an insidious only.

295
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,849
- Now, we do have the other
kind of tea, if you prefer.

296
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,041
- Well, thank you, but—

297
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,171
- Here are some scones that
Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

298
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,919
- We are so very sorry to have

299
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,889
put you to this inconvenience.

300
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,766
I hope you will
come another day.

301
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,975
Would you?

302
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,688
We should be so glad.

303
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,314
Do take our card.

304
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:53,610
- Thank you, if you'll excuse
me, I really must be going.

305
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,117
- [Helen] I'll see you out.

306
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,095
Are you sure you don't want
a scone for the journey?

307
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,332
- [Leonard] No, no, thank
you, I must be going, goodbye.

308
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,336
(melancholic orchestral music)

309
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:34,359
- Why didn't you make that
young man welcome, Tibby, hmm?

310
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:38,155
You must do the host
a little, you know.

311
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,032
You could've coaxed
him into stopping,

312
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,369
instead of letting him be
swamped by screaming women.

313
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,669
(train whistles)

314
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,424
(horse clopping)

315
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,177
(man whistling)

316
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,013
- [Soup Seller] Get
your hot soup here.

317
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,390
Hot soup, lovely and warm.

318
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,853
(train rumbling)

319
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,483
- That you, Len?

320
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,111
Where have you been?

321
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,855
I'm off my head with worrying.

322
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:21,490
- About what?

323
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,491
- [Jacky] About you.

324
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,242
- Let go, Jacky.

325
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,720
Every time I'm
five minutes late,

326
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,064
you see me lying
dead in the road,

327
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,164
crushed and killed in
a gruesome accident.

328
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,613
- Well, people do get killed in

329
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,584
accidents and don't
come home no more.

330
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,961
- Anymore, Jacky.

331
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:40,175
I told you I was going to a
lecture on "Music and Meaning."

332
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,260
I lost my umbrella.

333
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,053
It's all right.

334
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,388
I got it back.

335
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,062
- Have you had your tea?

336
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,523
I've kept you a bit
of tongue in jelly.

337
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,731
- No.

338
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:56,899
- Sure?

339
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,153
I'll have it then.

340
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,613
Funny, isn't it?

341
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,867
Every time I worry, I
get starving hungry.

342
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:12,249
The thoughts that go through
my head, you'd laugh.

343
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,668
You listening, Len?

344
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,670
Not only accidents.

345
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,381
That you'll get wet in the rain.

346
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,589
- Did you?

347
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,758
- No.

348
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,287
- You said you
lost your umbrella.

349
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,637
I'll think, "Lord,
he'll catch cold.

350
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,723
"It'll go to his chest.

351
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,267
"And where's the money to
come from for the doctor?

352
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,269
"And what if he
is in an accident,

353
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,063
"and they take him to the
hospital in the ambulance?

354
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,606
"And him with holes
in his socks."

355
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:37,815
- Hey, Jacky.

356
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,858
- I want to see.

357
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,693
- What?

358
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:40,694
- If there's holes
in your socks.

359
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,154
- Oh, stop it, Jacky.

360
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,533
- Len.

361
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,379
Come to bed.

362
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,049
- I'll just finish this chapter.

363
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,133
- Len.

364
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:12,517
You love your
Jacky, do you, Len?

365
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:13,894
- Let me read.

366
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,359
- Len.

367
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,965
Are you gonna make it all right?

368
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,784
- You're not starting
on that again.

369
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,636
I've told you a hundred
times if I've told you once,

370
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,330
we'll get married
the day I'm 21.

371
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,974
I'd do it before if it
weren't for my brother

372
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,291
would come and put a stop to it.

373
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,127
(train whistles)

374
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:41,588
What's it to him?

375
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,090
What's he ever done for me?

376
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,007
- That's right.

377
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,384
What's anyone ever done?

378
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,928
It's just you and me.

379
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,680
And if you was to go and leave
me, I don't know what I'd do.

380
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,057
I truly don't.

381
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,979
- Now, go to bed.

382
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,942
- You come too, come on!

383
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,490
- Book marker.

384
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:13,662
- "Margaret Schlegel," and
who is Margaret Schlegel?

385
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,621
- Just a lady I met.

386
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,957
- Oh, a lady, la-di-da.

387
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,833
- Come off it, Jacky.

388
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,709
She's a hundred years old.

389
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,002
- Says you.

390
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,963
So that's where
you had your tea.

391
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,716
Nice cucumber sandwiches
cut ever so thin.

392
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,846
(train rumbles)

393
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,820
- [Leonard] "Ankle-deep, he
waded through the bluebells.

394
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,822
"His spirit rose and exulted as

395
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,075
"he breathed in the
sun-drenched air.

396
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,288
"The glorious day was
in its last decline.

397
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,082
"Long shadows lay on the sward,

398
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,459
"and from above,
the leaves dripped

399
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,671
"their shimmering drops
of gold-green light.

400
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,133
"Moths and butterflies
swarmed in merry hosts,

401
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,178
"flittering here,
glimmering there.

402
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,055
"But hush, could
that be a deer?"

403
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,062
(mysterious orchestral music)

404
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,824
(train rumbling)

405
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,609
- [Ruth] Oh, please show her in.

406
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,204
- [Margaret] Hello,
I'm so sorry.

407
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,040
- Why, Ms. Schlegel,

408
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,168
how kind of you to call.

409
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,963
- I've wanted to
for ever so long.

410
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:32,717
- But we haven't been
here for ever so long.

411
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,552
- Mrs. Wilcox, may I?

412
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:41,017
You see, all that business
last summer at Howards End,

413
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,061
oh no, it goes
further than that.

414
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,939
Since we met at Speyer,
do you remember?

415
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,984
That restored cathedral
that we all hated so.

416
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:52,779
- What I remember
principally about Speyer

417
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:57,158
was the great pleasure of
meeting you, Ms. Schlegel.

418
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,995
- Helen's gone to Germany.

419
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,622
- And Paul's gone to Nigeria.

420
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:04,916
(laughing)

421
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:09,087
- So, you see, now we can
meet because they can't.

422
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,656
It's no use beating
about the bush.

423
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,300
What happened in the
summer was unfortunate

424
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,884
for both of them,
don't you feel?

425
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,387
Because I'm sure you
think the same way.

426
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,139
Because they should not meet.

427
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,682
- Yes, I feel that.

428
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,159
- They belong to
types that can fall

429
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,269
in love but can't live together.

430
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,605
I'm afraid that in
nine cases out of 10,

431
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,735
nature pulls one way and
human nature the other.

432
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:34,988
I do rattle on.

433
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,657
I'm afraid I shall tire
you out in no time.

434
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:42,037
- It is true I am not
particularly well just today.

435
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,124
But I'm so grateful
for your visit.

436
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,043
Ms. Schlegel, you
see, I'm quite alone.

437
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,919
My husband and
daughter have gone off

438
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,380
on a motoring tour in Yorkshire,

439
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,467
and the young couple
are on their honeymoon.

440
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,926
- Charles and Dolly.

441
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:57,719
- Oh, may I see?

442
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:58,927
How lovely.

443
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,765
- They've gone to Naples.

444
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,018
I can hardly imagine
my Charles in Naples.

445
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,346
- Doesn't he like traveling?

446
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,855
- Oh yes, he likes travel,

447
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,941
but he does see
through foreigners so.

448
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,738
What he would enjoy most is
a motor tour through England.

449
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,908
Charles takes after
me, Ms. Schlegel.

450
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,910
He truly loves England.

451
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:25,997
Not, of course, London.

452
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,041
None of us love London.

453
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,380
It's so...

454
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:39,803
It makes one feel so
unstable, impermanent,

455
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,016
with houses being torn
down on all sides.

456
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,980
- Including, in the
foreseeable future, ours.

457
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,608
- Are you having to
leave Wickham Place?

458
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,736
- Yes, in 18 months or so
when the lease expires.

459
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,255
- [Ruth] Have you
been there long?

460
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,031
- All our lives,
we were born there.

461
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
- Oh,

462
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,828
that is monstrous.

463
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,038
Oh, I do pity you, from
the bottom of my heart.

464
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:10,792
I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

465
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,293
- How dreadful.

466
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,211
- Oh.

467
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,754
- Oh, you poor, poor girls.

468
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,091
- Well, of course, we
are fond of the house,

469
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,094
but it is an ordinary
London house.

470
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,971
We shall easily find another.

471
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,180
- No.

472
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,724
Not in this world.

473
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,980
Not the house that
you were born in.

474
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,900
You'll never find that
again, poor, poor girls.

475
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,027
(sighs)

476
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,739
Howards End was almost
pulled down once.

477
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,950
It would have killed me.

478
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,326
It's my house, you know.

479
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,164
It was left to me by my
brother who died out in India.

480
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,415
I love it so.

481
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,836
I even resisted when
Henry, my husband,

482
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,840
wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

483
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,009
He knew best, of course.

484
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,388
We even have a garage.

485
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,062
To the west of the house,

486
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,316
just beyond the chestnut tree,

487
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:21,279
in the paddock where
the pony used to be.

488
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,949
- Where's the pony gone?

489
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,246
- The pony, oh, dead,
ever so long ago.

490
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,834
- [Woman in Black Dress] The
vice of the pan-German mind

491
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,003
is that it only cares
for what it can use.

492
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:38,689
- No, that is the vice
of the imperial mind.

493
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,757
- No, that is the vice
of the vulgar mind.

494
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,842
- But, and this is
the tremendous part,

495
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,844
they take poetry seriously.

496
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,387
They do take poetry seriously.

497
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,076
- Yes, but is anything
gained by that?

498
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:51,226
- Yes, the Germans are
always striving for beauty.

499
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,228
- Oh, but Mrs. Wilcox, my father

500
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:56,231
was a German of the old
school, a philosopher,

501
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,567
an idealist, the countryman
of Hegel and Kant.

502
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,045
- But isn't that
your father's sword

503
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,379
you have upstairs
in the drawing room?

504
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,822
- Oh yes, he was a soldier
too when he had to be,

505
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,367
but he was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side

506
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:11,871
that he just hung up his
sword and never used it again.

507
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,415
- My idea has always been that

508
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,588
if we could bring the mothers

509
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,635
of the various nations together,

510
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,016
then there would be no more war.

511
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,268
- Well, indeed, yes.

512
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,853
- Absolutely, I mean, if
the mothers went to war,

513
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,289
there'd be no one
left to defend.

514
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,313
(laughing)

515
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,316
- Mrs. Wilcox, will
you have another jelly?

516
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:41,859
- Thank you.

517
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,445
You are fortunate in your cook.

518
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,197
We have found it
difficult to get

519
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,199
reliable servants in London.

520
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,576
- It is difficult.

521
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,720
- Your servants have become
as unreliable as we are,

522
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,097
and we can hardly
expect them to listen

523
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,881
to radical discussions
at the luncheon table.

524
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,583
- Annie does very
well, don't you, Annie?

525
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,960
You're very patient with us.

526
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,213
- We never discuss
at Howards End,

527
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,132
except perhaps sport.

528
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,842
- Oh, but you should.

529
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,760
Discussion keeps a house alive.

530
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,179
- You will laugh at my
old-fashioned ideas.

531
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,890
- (chuckles) I will not.

532
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,809
- I sometimes think...

533
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,109
it would be wiser to leave
action and discussion to men.

534
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:27,071
- But then where would
we be with the suffrage?

535
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,451
- I am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

536
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,043
- Shall we go up for coffee?

537
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,461
Duncan, will you lead the way?

538
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,130
(chattering)

539
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,397
- What interesting
lives you all lead.

540
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,857
- No, we don't.

541
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,527
It's no use pretending
you enjoyed lunch,

542
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:10,531
for you loathed it, but I
hope you will forgive me

543
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,534
by coming again, alone,
or by asking me to you.

544
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,995
- I enjoyed my lunch very much.

545
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,244
Ms. Schlegel, truly I did.

546
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,541
I only wish I could've
joined in more.

547
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,837
You're so clever,
and yet, so good.

548
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:30,385
- No, that's very kind of you,
but I am neither, I'm afraid.

549
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,969
- You've been very good to me.

550
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,388
You've kept me from brooding.

551
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,057
I'm too apt to brood.

552
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,308
- About what?

553
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,310
- Well, I don't know.

554
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,062
I really don't know.

555
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,942
I think about my
house a great deal.

556
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,568
You've never seen Howards End.

557
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,070
I want to show it to you.

558
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,949
(grandiose orchestral music)

559
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,614
- [Margaret] Now, this is
the scientific approach

560
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,181
to Christmas shopping, a list.

561
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,768
- [Mrs. Wilcox] A
list, what a good idea.

562
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,646
Why don't you put your own
name at the top of the list?

563
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:29,068
- Oh hooray, how very kind
of you to start with me.

564
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:32,947
"Schlegel," now, next,
shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

565
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,495
(people socializing)

566
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,514
Now, what do you think of that?

567
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,307
And a pretty box.

568
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,808
- Oh, yes.

569
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,351
Oh, thank you very much.

570
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,936
- Good, I'm glad.

571
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,897
- Oh, you are
wonderfully efficient.

572
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,833
- Thank you, could we wrap
that with a nice bow, please?

573
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,442
- Certainly, Madam.

574
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,503
- But your name still remains
at the top of the list.

575
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,822
- (chuckles) Yes, so,
Dolly, there she goes.

576
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:19,202
- I would like to give you
something worth your friendship.

577
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,414
Couldn't you get it renewed?

578
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:25,374
- I beg your pardon?

579
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,863
- [Ruth] The lease
of your house?

580
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,479
- Oh, have you been
thinking of that?

581
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,545
How very kind of you.

582
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,514
- [Ruth] Why, surely
something could be done.

583
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,234
- No, values have
risen too enormously.

584
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:34,526
They mean to pull
down Wickham Place

585
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,718
and build flats like yours.

586
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,303
- [Ruth] But how horrible.

587
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,822
- [Margaret] Landlords
are horrible.

588
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,349
- [Ruth] And so are
the flats they build.

589
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,810
I fail to understand how people

590
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,938
can actually choose
to live in them.

591
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,651
- [Margaret] There we are.

592
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,862
Oh dear, there, there
we are, thank you.

593
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,197
(chuckles) Thank you.

594
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,533
- [Maid] Thank you, Madam.

595
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:06,957
- Thank you.

596
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,756
(groans)

597
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,049
Oh, I'm so sorry.

598
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,843
We shouldn't have
done this today.

599
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:20,012
- No, no, we had
to do it before.

600
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,389
- Before?

601
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,016
- Before my operation.

602
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,602
I still haven't told my
family yet, Ms. Schlegel.

603
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,272
Everyone hates illnesses.

604
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,524
Ah, it's as it should be.

605
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:36,529
There's a chestnut
tree at Howards End

606
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,699
that has pigs' teeth
stuck into the trunk

607
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,952
about four feet from the ground.

608
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,079
Yes, the teeth of a pig.

609
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,083
The country people put
them there long ago,

610
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:54,422
and they think that if they
chew a piece of the bark,

611
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,674
it will cure the toothache.

612
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,763
- I love folklore and
the old superstitions.

613
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,350
Isn't it is curious
though, that unlike Greece,

614
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,269
England has no true mythology.

615
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:12,648
All we have are witches
and fairies. (sighs)

616
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:18,029
- Will you come with
me to Howards End?

617
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,530
- Oh, I would so much like to.

618
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,490
- Come with me now,
now, come with me now.

619
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:22,718
- [Margaret] Now,
but it is too late.

620
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,327
- There is a train
from St. Pancras

621
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,703
at 5 o'clock if we hurry.

622
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:26,912
I want you to see it.

623
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,623
- And I want to see it.

624
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,334
It sounds such a glorious
place, so redolent and—

625
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,923
I was born there.

626
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,801
- Well, might I
come some other day?

627
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,511
- Yes.

628
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:46,641
Some other day.

629
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:56,275
Well, a thousands thanks,
Ms. Schlegel, for your help.

630
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:59,612
It is a comfort to have
the presents off my mind,

631
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,031
the Christmas cards especially.

632
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,741
I do admire your choice.

633
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,661
(clock chimes)

634
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,832
(train whistles)

635
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,630
(conductor whistles)

636
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:18,965
(horses clopping)

637
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,883
- [Horse Driver] Whoa!

638
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,729
(train whistles)

639
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:37,441
- Mrs. Wilcox.

640
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,151
- Ms. Schlegel.

641
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,296
- I will come if I still may.

642
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,531
- Return to Hilton, please.

643
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,534
We'll stop the night, my dear.

644
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,868
- Yes.

645
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,121
- It's in the morning my
house looks most beautiful.

646
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,872
Two returns, please.

647
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:53,915
- Thank you.

648
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,712
This is yours?

649
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,840
- I can't show you my meadow
properly except in the sunrise.

650
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,591
- [Margaret] It was so romantic.

651
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,884
It was in Italy.

652
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,511
- [Ruth] In Italy?

653
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,738
- Yes, and the two trains
stopped on either side,

654
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,305
you see, and I
opened the window,

655
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,642
and this man just
handed a rose across.

656
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,061
I don't know where he got it.

657
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,354
- Was he Italian?

658
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,873
- [Margaret] Yes, I
think so, Italian.

659
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,577
- Ah, he'd have to be
Italian, wouldn't he?

660
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,774
- Mother!

661
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:21,402
- Evie, my dearest girl.

662
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,611
- The motor's smashed.

663
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,880
- Ruth, what on earth
are you doing here?

664
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,322
- Why aren't you in Yorkshire?

665
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,074
- We crashed the car.

666
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,702
Are you going to
Howards End, why?

667
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,995
How are you?

668
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:31,746
- It's all such a
lovely surprise.

669
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:32,997
I'm fit as a fiddle.

670
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,582
You remember Ms. Schlegel?

671
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,625
- Ms. Schlegel, oh yes,
Helen's sister, hello.

672
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,878
Evie crashed the
car in Yorkshire.

673
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,629
- How do you do?

674
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:41,547
- We must go home.

675
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,215
We can't go to Howards End.

676
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:44,550
It's 10 to five.

677
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,639
- Oh, Ms. Schlegel, I'm
afraid our little outing

678
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,304
is going to have
to be another day.

679
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,638
- Oh, before I forget—

680
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:51,682
for that I believe, Ms. Schlegel

681
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,726
(speaks in German)

682
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,770
Yes, not canceled,
but postponed.

683
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,562
- Postponed.

684
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,438
- Come home with us.

685
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,230
- No, no.

686
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,023
- You sure?

687
00:39:59,231 --> 00:39:59,815
- Please, goodbye.

688
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,400
- Goodbye.

689
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:02,651
- Till later.

690
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,655
- [Henry] How lovely to see you.

691
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,119
(train whistles)

692
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,379
- I've been thinking of you.

693
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,091
(bell rings)

694
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,884
And of our meadow.

695
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:28,802
- Here.

696
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,393
The day you are strong enough,

697
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,230
I shall hold you
to your promise.

698
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:30,823
- Oh, Ms. Schlegel.

699
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,959
(melancholic piano
and horn music)

700
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:55,366
So, to repeat, we have
here, forwarded by

701
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:59,745
the matron of that nursing home,
sealed and addressed to me,

702
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:04,708
a note purporting to be in
your mother's handwriting.

703
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:08,087
And it says, "I would
like Ms. Schlegel,

704
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:11,048
"Margaret, to have Howards End."

705
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,468
- Mother never wrote that.

706
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:18,471
- No date.

707
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,808
No signature.

708
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,143
- Of course, it's a forgery.

709
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,900
- Not now, please,
later, thank you.

710
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:32,477
The house was, of course, your

711
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,739
mother's to leave
to whom she wished.

712
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:37,074
- Let me see it.

713
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:42,871
Why, it's only in pencil.

714
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,707
Pencil never counts.

715
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,084
- Yes, we know that it is
not legally binding, Dolly.

716
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:48,919
We are aware of that.

717
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:53,674
Of course, my dear, we consider
you as one of the family,

718
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,402
but it will be better
if you don't interfere

719
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:56,444
with what you don't understand.

720
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,468
Thank you.

721
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:01,682
- The question is
whether, during the time

722
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,310
that this Ms. Schlegel managed
to befriend my mother—

723
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,273
As to my mind, the question is

724
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,984
the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

725
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,820
- My dear father, consult
an expert if you wish,

726
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:17,489
but I don't admit that it
is my mother's handwriting.

727
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:19,366
- You just said it was.

728
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,285
- Never mind if I did.

729
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,915
- So we are all agreed
then that legally,

730
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:28,564
I would be quite
justified in tearing

731
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:31,003
this up and throwing
it into the fire.

732
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,797
- All else aside,
how is this gift

733
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,799
to be conveyed to Ms. Schlegel?

734
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:37,319
Is she to have a
life interest in it,

735
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,677
or is she to own it absolutely?

736
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:40,166
- She may be on
her way down this

737
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:43,557
very minute to turn us all out.

738
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,452
- I don't believe Ms.
Schlegel knows anything

739
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,771
about this, this whim
of your mother's.

740
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,107
- Mother believed
so in ancestors.

741
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:56,070
She would never have left
anything to an outsider.

742
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:57,613
- If Ms. Schlegel had been poor,

743
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,657
if she had wanted a house...

744
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:02,493
but she has a house.

745
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,079
Why should she want another?

746
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,542
- She wouldn't have wanted
us to even see this thing.

747
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:14,671
- No, your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

748
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:29,144
(paper scratches)

749
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,483
(dramatic strings music)

750
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:57,297
- Len, you coming in?

751
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:59,049
- In a minute.

752
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:00,634
Yeah, all right.

753
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:10,060
- What are you looking at?

754
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,728
- See that big one up there?

755
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,440
It's Ursa Major, the great bear.

756
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,026
You follow those two
down about four times,

757
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,736
and that one there
is the polestar.

758
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,423
I'm fairly certain
that's it, and they all—

759
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:24,824
- Jacky, stop it.

760
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,076
It's important.

761
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,955
- [Jacky] You'll
catch your death.

762
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,359
(chattering)

763
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:01,987
- Excuse me, sir, Mr.
Purefour's policy.

764
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:05,073
- Yes, yes, yes, yes,
that's all signed.

765
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:07,284
It seems fine with
me, thank you.

766
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:11,538
- [Mr. Purefour] So may
I expect to receive that?

767
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,014
- Could you complete that?

768
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:31,183
- Yes, of course, sir.

769
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:48,033
(dramatic orchestral music)

770
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:56,500
"The trees reared
in mighty columns,

771
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,045
"their tops still radiant
in sunlight which,

772
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:03,423
"spilling downward through
the wealth of leaves,

773
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:07,761
"dissolved at last in the
darkness of the mossy earth.

774
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:13,016
"Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers,

775
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:17,396
but their scent lingered to
honey the air he breathed."

776
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,057
- There's a woman
to see you, Ma'am.

777
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:55,809
- A woman and not a lady, Annie?

778
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,519
- [Annie] She won't
give her name.

779
00:48:57,728 --> 00:48:59,146
- Well, ask her to come up.

780
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,648
- She says she won't come up.

781
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,027
- Well, then we shall
have to go down.

782
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,283
Good afternoon.

783
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,910
- I'm looking for my husband.

784
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:14,703
- [Helen] Here?

785
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,121
- Thank you, Annie.

786
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,208
- [Jacky] I have my reasons
to believe that he is here.

787
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,894
- Well, you're welcome to
search for him, certainly.

788
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,254
- I'm so sorry,
your husband's name?

789
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:27,174
- Leonard Bast, as I'm
sure you're aware of.

790
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:31,303
- Margaret, are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard Bast?

791
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,699
- There appears to have been
some mistake, Mrs. Bast.

792
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:37,142
I do not think we are
acquainted with your husband.

793
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:39,311
- Oh no, there's no mistake.

794
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,980
I know for a fact that he
has visited in this house.

795
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:43,315
He had his tea here.

796
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,067
- That is a grave allegation.

797
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,111
- Yes, to have corrupted a
married man with giving him tea.

798
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,322
- I wish we could
help you. Mrs. Bast.

799
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,492
- It seems you can't, or won't,

800
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,203
except to have a
laugh at my expense.

801
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,163
So I'm very sorry
to have troubled you

802
00:49:58,372 --> 00:50:01,458
and wish you a very
good afternoon.

803
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,398
- You do what you
can for the house.

804
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,840
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

805
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,109
- If you start smoking too, the

806
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:10,801
house might be even more musty.

807
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,052
- I doubt it.

808
00:50:13,345 --> 00:50:14,805
This is lovely. Annie.

809
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,473
- There's a Mr. Leonard Bast.

810
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:18,934
- Oh no, I don't believe it.

811
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,227
- The missing husband.

812
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,270
- He must be brought
in immediately, Annie.

813
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:23,479
- I'll do the host.

814
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,856
- Thank you.

815
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,442
- [Tibby] Mr. Bast,
come this way.

816
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,486
- [Margaret] Do
come in, Mr. Bast.

817
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:30,696
Good evening.

818
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:31,613
- [Helen] Good
evening, do come in

819
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:33,022
and have some pudding with us.

820
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,676
- Yes, or would you
prefer some dinner?

821
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:35,492
- I've had my tea, thank you.

822
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:37,494
- Have a chair, a glass of wine?

823
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:38,286
- No.

824
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:39,204
- Port?

825
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:40,455
- No, thank you.

826
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,424
- Well, do take a seat
in any case, Mr. Bast,

827
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,460
and let us know how
we can help you.

828
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:53,385
- You wouldn't remember
giving me this?

829
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,720
- Not as such.

830
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,568
- Well, that was how
it happened, you see.

831
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,098
- How what happened?

832
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,683
- Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

833
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,226
For the moment,
I don't remember.

834
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:05,355
- It was more than a year
ago at the Ethical Society.

835
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,357
The lecture was on
"Music and Meaning."

836
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,318
- Oh, I see, so the mistake
arose out of my card, did it?

837
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:11,754
The lady who called
here yesterday

838
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,005
thought you were calling as well

839
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,365
and that she would
find you here.

840
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:17,284
- In the afternoon,
I said to my wife,

841
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,704
I said to Mrs. Bast, "I have
to pay a call on some friends."

842
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:23,290
And Mrs. Bast said
to me, "Do go."

843
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:27,127
But while I was gone, she
wanted me on important business

844
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,921
and thought I had come
here, owing to the card.

845
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,132
And I beg to tender my
apologies, and hers too,

846
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,801
for any inconvenience
we may have caused you.

847
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,386
- [Margaret] None at all, truly.

848
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:37,804
- I still don't understand.

849
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:41,183
When did you say you paid this
call, this afternoon call?

850
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,059
- In the afternoon, of course.

851
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,021
- Saturday afternoon or Sunday?

852
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:46,813
- Saturday.

853
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:48,190
- Really?

854
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:49,751
And you were still
calling on Sunday

855
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:51,359
when your wife came here?

856
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,069
A long visit.

857
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:55,006
- It was very good of you to
come and explain, Mr. Bast.

858
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,407
The rest is, naturally,
no concern of ours.

859
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,201
We are going to go
upstairs for coffee.

860
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:02,329
I do hope that you will join us.

861
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:03,681
Annie, pour the coffee, please.

862
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:05,874
- It's not what you think.

863
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:08,417
I was...

864
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:14,841
I left my office and
walked right out of London.

865
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,093
I was walking all
Saturday night.

866
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,346
- All night, in the dark?

867
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:22,390
- It got so dark I
couldn't see my own hand.

868
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:25,727
- Mr. Bast, you must
be a born explorer.

869
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,665
- I tried to steer by the
polestar, but once out of doors,

870
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,483
everything gets so
mixed, and I lost it.

871
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:32,442
- Don't tell me
about the polestar.

872
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,819
I know its little ways.

873
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:37,614
It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

874
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,373
- [Helen] Yes, but why?

875
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,874
Why did you do it?

876
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,294
I wanted to just walk,

877
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:54,256
just get out.

878
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,509
I've been reading The
Ordeal of Richard Feverel.

879
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:58,927
- Yes, I remember.

880
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:00,404
There's that chapter where
Richard walks all night.

881
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,656
- [Leonard] In a
forest by moonlight.

882
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,400
- Yes, and Margaret,
what's that wonderful—

883
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:10,105
- [Both] "The forest
drooped glimmeringly."

884
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,731
- [Helen] Wait, I'll get it.

885
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,442
- The chapter's called
"Nature Speaks."

886
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:17,279
- Where do your
people come from?

887
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,572
- London.

888
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,615
- Yes, I know, but
I mean before that.

889
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:23,201
They didn't always
live in a town.

890
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,370
- No, they came from
around Shropshire.

891
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,789
They worked on the land.

892
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,624
They were agricultural laborers.

893
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,585
- There, you see?

894
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:34,713
It was ancestral
voices calling you.

895
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,466
- Yes, here it is.

896
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:40,844
"Richard was walking hurriedly.

897
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,470
"A pale gray light
on the skirts of

898
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,639
"the flying tempest
displayed the dawn."

899
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,099
Did you see the dawn?

900
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:47,468
- Yes, suddenly it got light.

901
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:48,268
- And was it wonderful?

902
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,060
- No.

903
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:51,104
(laughing)

904
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:52,898
It was only gray.

905
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,567
And anyway, by that time, I
was so tired and so hungry.

906
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,055
I didn't know when
you're walking

907
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:58,352
you want a breakfast and lunch

908
00:53:58,445 --> 00:53:59,589
and tea during
the night as well,

909
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,740
and all I had was a
packet of Woodbines.

910
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,326
(chuckling)

911
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:07,594
- [Helen] No, money,
give Mr. Bast money.

912
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:10,624
- We really must
go, Meg, come on.

913
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,810
- [Woman in Green Dress] Your
Leonard Bast wouldn't know

914
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,628
what to do if you
just gave him money.

915
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,796
- Nonsense, money
is very educational,

916
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:18,445
much more so than
the things it buys.

917
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,712
- Such crass materialism
out of your mouth, Margaret.

918
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:21,593
- Give them money.

919
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,136
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

920
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:25,597
(chattering)

921
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,003
- But he won't
gain his soul until

922
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,020
he has enough money
to do it with.

923
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:33,480
Give Mr. Bast money.

924
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:37,067
(ladies socializing)

925
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,503
- [Helen] Good night, yes,
well, you worry about the first.

926
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,821
- [Margaret] Goodbye, goodbye.

927
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,660
- Good night, good night.

928
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:53,583
(lilting tango music)

929
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,691
- So what do you
think is the most

930
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,509
important thing in
the world, then?

931
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:07,347
- Well, I suppose it is
whatever matters to you most.

932
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:08,835
- What, like love, for instance?

933
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:11,160
- Yes, like love for instance,
or Oxford if you're Tibby.

934
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,686
- Ms. Schlegel?

935
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:13,645
Henry Wilcox.

936
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:14,437
- [Margaret] Oh, hello.

937
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:15,689
- Hello, good evening.

938
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:16,916
- Good evening, how
nice to see you.

939
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,060
- What a wonderful surprise.

940
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,593
I heard two ladies
talking of love.

941
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,111
- (chuckles) Oh, no.

942
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,405
- No, we were continuing
a serious discussion.

943
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:24,698
- Yes?

944
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,706
- Yes, we belong to a
sort of club which meets

945
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,160
once a week to discuss
various subjects.

946
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,495
How are you?

947
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:33,039
I would've thought you would
be down at Howards End.

948
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:34,248
- Howards End is let.

949
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,583
We've bought a house in Mayfair.

950
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,919
- Yes, Mr. Wilcox, supposing
you were a millionaire.

951
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:40,714
- Oh, but I expect you are one.

952
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:43,299
- We have met a young
man who is very poor,

953
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,885
and we think sensitive and
intelligent, and we wondered

954
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,430
if one was a millionaire,
how one could help him.

955
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,638
- What's his profession?

956
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:51,406
- He's a clerk in,
what was it, Margaret?

957
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:54,102
- The Porphyrion Fire
Insurance Company.

958
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:54,894
- Porphyrion?

959
00:55:55,103 --> 00:55:56,103
- Yes.

960
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,899
- Ah, then Ms.
Schlegel, if I were

961
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:02,861
to help your young clerk, I'd
advise him to clear out of

962
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:04,589
the Porphyrion with
all possible speed.

963
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:05,864
- Why?

964
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,633
- Now, this is between
friends, you understand,

965
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:09,534
but the Porphyrion is
insufficiently reinsured.

966
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,703
It'll be in the receivers'
hands before Christmas.

967
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,621
In other words, it will smash.

968
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,830
- Oh, do you hear?

969
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:16,583
Helen, the Porphyrion
will smash.

970
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:17,584
- We'll have to warn Mr. Bast.

971
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,853
He'll have to get another place.

972
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:20,420
- I hope he'll get
one very quickly.

973
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,213
- But rather than
wait to make sure?

974
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,673
- Yes, decidedly.

975
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:25,776
You understand, the man who
is already in a situation when

976
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,721
he applies for work stands a
much better chance, naturally.

977
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,699
This is letting you into
state secrets, of course,

978
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:35,101
but it does affect
an employer greatly.

979
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,644
Human nature, I'm afraid.

980
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,122
- Well, our human nature appears

981
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,373
to be quite the
other way around.

982
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:41,816
We employ people because
they're unemployed.

983
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:43,401
The bootman, for instance.

984
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,235
- How does he clean the boots?

985
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,028
- Not well.

986
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,279
- There you are.

987
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,281
- Mr. Wilcox, is it
very difficult nowadays

988
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,741
for a clerk to get a situation?

989
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:50,992
- Yes, extremely.

990
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:52,577
- I'm so sorry
about Howards End.

991
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:53,786
- Hmm?

992
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,580
- I mean that you're
not living there.

993
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,124
I think I have some
idea of how much

994
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,710
her house meant to Mrs. Wilcox.

995
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:03,379
- Yes, but to us, the family,
it has certain drawbacks.

996
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:05,507
- Would you be able
to help, our friend,

997
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:07,967
help him to a new situation?

998
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:09,803
- Well, unfortunately, we have

999
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:12,138
very few positions
and vacancies,

1000
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:14,307
and when there is
one, of course,

1001
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,142
always hundreds of applicants.

1002
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,477
- Of course.

1003
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:18,269
- Well, it has been a pleasure.

1004
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:19,187
- Yes, indeed.

1005
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,647
- Ms. Schlegel, Ms. Schlegel.

1006
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,816
I hope your young
clerk finds success.

1007
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:26,528
- Thank you, good night.
- [Henry] Good night.

1008
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,380
- Well, he was in a hurry
to get away, wasn't he?

1009
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,657
(laughing)

1010
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:41,751
- Mr. Bast, I fear you may have

1011
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,337
thought our letter a little odd.

1012
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:45,255
- We're not odd, really.

1013
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:46,543
We're just over-expressive.

1014
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:47,715
That's all.

1015
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,524
- The more a lady has
to say, the better.

1016
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:50,986
Ladies brighten
every conversation.

1017
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,095
- Yes, I know.

1018
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:52,929
The darlings are
regular sunbeams.

1019
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:54,764
Let me give you a plate.

1020
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:58,184
- Your company is the
Porphyrion, isn't it?

1021
00:57:58,393 --> 00:58:00,478
Would you call it
a solid concern?

1022
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,813
- Cake?

1023
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:04,065
This big one or one of
these little deadlies?

1024
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:06,818
- It depends what
you mean by solid.

1025
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:09,028
- We were told the
Porphyrion's a no-go.

1026
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:12,240
- A friend of ours
did think that

1027
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:13,783
it's insufficiently reinsured.

1028
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:16,119
- And advised you to clear out.

1029
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,847
- You can tell your
friend that he's wrong.

1030
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:18,871
- Oh, good!

1031
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,124
(laughing)

1032
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:22,876
- Wrong, so to speak.

1033
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:25,420
- [Helen] How, so to speak?

1034
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,839
- I mean, I wouldn't say
he was right altogether.

1035
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:29,924
- Then he is right partly?

1036
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:33,887
- Tell your friend to
mind his own business.

1037
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,722
(knocking)

1038
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,098
- Annie.

1039
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,559
- Mr. Wilcox, Ms. Wilcox.

1040
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:40,767
- Oh.

1041
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:42,353
- What a surprise!

1042
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,814
(laughing)

1043
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:47,734
- Oh, they're beautiful.

1044
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:49,235
- Mr. Wilcox, do come in.

1045
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,005
- Ms. Schlegel, pray forgive
us for calling so unexpectedly.

1046
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:52,155
- How nice to see you.

1047
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,632
- Mr. Bast, look, come
and play with the puppies.

1048
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:56,117
- Mr. Wilcox, this is Mr. Bast.

1049
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:57,702
- Aren't they beautiful?

1050
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,120
- I must be going.

1051
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:00,872
- Oh, must you really?

1052
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,290
- [Helen] Oh, come again.

1053
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:03,082
- No, I shan't.

1054
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,043
I shan't come again.

1055
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,254
- I call that a
very rude remark.

1056
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:10,423
What do you want to turn
on me like that for?

1057
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:14,010
- I thought you invited me
here as, for a friendly chat.

1058
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,529
Instead, it turns
out you want to pick

1059
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:16,947
my brains about my
place of business.

1060
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:17,555
Oh yes, "Send for him.

1061
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:18,348
"Cross-question him.

1062
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:19,265
"Pick his brains."

1063
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:20,642
- No, no!

1064
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,911
- Are we intruding,
Ms. Schlegel?

1065
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:22,935
Shall we go?

1066
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,854
- No, no, thank you.

1067
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:27,315
Helen, go after him, explain.

1068
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,907
- What was all that about?

1069
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,355
- I knew I shouldn't have come.

1070
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,636
It was all right last time, but

1071
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,060
things like that
always get spoiled.

1072
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:42,413
- Things do but people don't.

1073
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:43,831
Don't you understand?

1074
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,209
We really did want to warn
you about the Porphyrion.

1075
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,795
We were worried about you.

1076
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,564
- [Leonard] Why should
you worry about me?

1077
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,507
- Because we like you.

1078
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,550
That's why, you noodle.

1079
00:59:57,971 --> 00:59:59,531
- There's no cause to
call a person names.

1080
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,699
- Oh yes, there is when a person

1081
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,934
is being tremendously stupid.

1082
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,938
Oh, listen, this is serious.

1083
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,707
Our friend said you
should be looking around

1084
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:11,276
for another post now
before anything happens.

1085
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:12,777
Will you?

1086
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:14,255
- [Leonard] I'll think about it.

1087
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:15,822
- No, you must do
more than think.

1088
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,742
You must search for another
place while you still have one.

1089
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:24,289
Now, promise you will do
that at least, please.

1090
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:29,085
- [Leonard] All right,
thank you, Ms. Schlegel.

1091
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:30,494
- Come and tell us when you've

1092
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:32,255
found another place,
or just come anyway.

1093
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,591
And don't say no,
don't dare to say no.

1094
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:40,888
And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

1095
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:50,106
- You ought to be more
careful, Ms. Schlegel.

1096
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:51,458
Your servants ought
to have orders

1097
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,522
not to let such people in.

1098
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,569
- Oh, but we invited him in.

1099
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,779
Yes, we wanted to see
him again and talk to him

1100
01:00:56,988 --> 01:01:00,450
and maybe help him, not
only in a practical way.

1101
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:01,909
- You're too kind.

1102
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:04,438
You behave too well to people,
and then they impose on you.

1103
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:06,873
I know the world and
that type of man.

1104
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,833
- Oh, but he is not
a type, Mr. Wilcox.

1105
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,042
(chuckles)

1106
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:12,211
No, I think he is a
quite unusual young man,

1107
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,005
and he has something in him.

1108
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:16,090
I don't know what
it is except that

1109
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:18,676
he wants something
better than he's got.

1110
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:19,969
- Oh.

1111
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:23,139
- Yes, he has a sort
of romantic ambition.

1112
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:28,227
- It is your view of him that
is romantic, Ms. Schlegel.

1113
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:32,856
Evie.

1114
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,170
We wish you to have something
to remember Mrs. Wilcox by

1115
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:39,280
in return for your kindness
to her in those days.

1116
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:41,574
- Oh, thank you so much.

1117
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:43,826
What a lovely
thought, thank you.

1118
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:44,786
- She would want you to have it.

1119
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:46,138
She spoke very fondly of you.

1120
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:47,162
- It's beautiful.

1121
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:48,205
Are you sure?

1122
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:51,000
Is it 18th century?

1123
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,627
It must be crystal.

1124
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,088
Thank you, thank you, Evie.

1125
01:01:57,632 --> 01:01:58,925
- So what does she look like?

1126
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,426
- Sort of an old-maid type.

1127
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:02,475
Goodness knows why Father
wanted me to ask her.

1128
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:03,179
She talks and talks.

1129
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:04,430
Here she is.

1130
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:05,723
Ms. Schlegel.

1131
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:07,141
- Hello. Ms. Wilcox.

1132
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,350
- [Evie] How do you do?

1133
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,228
This is my fiance, Percy Cahill.

1134
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,980
- [Percy] How do you do?

1135
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,357
- Ah, good afternoon.

1136
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,402
- Hello, I didn't
expect to see you.

1137
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,962
- Well, Evie told me
of her little plot,

1138
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,586
so I just slipped in
and secured a table.

1139
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:21,489
Always secure a table first.

1140
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:22,782
Evie, sit there.

1141
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,093
Ms. Schlegel, if
you please, here.

1142
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,117
- Thank you very much.

1143
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,744
- Mr. Cahill, there.

1144
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:32,083
Well, are you still worrying
around after your young clerks?

1145
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,084
I hope you're hungry.

1146
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:34,572
- Famished, I want to eat heaps.

1147
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,629
- Good, what will you have?

1148
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:37,922
- Fish pie.

1149
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:39,715
- Ah, fish pie.

1150
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:41,592
Fancy coming for fish
pie to Simpson's.

1151
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:43,195
It's not a good
thing to go for here.

1152
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:44,512
- Go for something for me then.

1153
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,972
- Right, umm...

1154
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:50,435
roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding and...

1155
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:51,227
- What will you have?

1156
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:52,562
- Cider to drink.

1157
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:53,354
That's the type of
thing to go for.

1158
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:54,981
- I'll have trout.

1159
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:55,940
- Yes, I like this place
for a joke once in a while.

1160
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:57,389
It's so thoroughly old English.

1161
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:58,317
Don't you agree?

1162
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,945
(lively accordion music)

1163
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:03,406
- I began an inventory
of our possessions.

1164
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,616
There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone

1165
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,118
Oh, thank you, lovely.

1166
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:09,078
And that's not
counting the books.

1167
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:11,539
Whatever shall I do?

1168
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:13,467
You see, the modern
ownership of moveables—

1169
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:15,376
- [Margaret] Is reducing
us again to a nomadic—

1170
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,188
- We are reverting
to a civilization

1171
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:20,047
of luggage, Mr.
Wilcox. (chuckles)

1172
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:21,256
- Thank you.

1173
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,299
- Thank you, sir.

1174
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:23,593
- Always tip the carver.

1175
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,511
Tip everywhere is my motto.

1176
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,156
- Perhaps it does
make life more human.

1177
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,282
- Yes, then these
fellows remember

1178
01:03:28,306 --> 01:03:29,765
one again, especially
in the East.

1179
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,743
If you tip, they remember you
from year's end to year's end.

1180
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,144
- Have you been in the East?

1181
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,512
- Yes, Greece and the Levant.

1182
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,356
I used to go for sport
and business to Cyprus.

1183
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:38,925
A few piastres
properly distributed

1184
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,388
help to keep one's memory green.

1185
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,111
- [Margaret] How
shockingly cynical.

1186
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,155
- Not a bit, simply realistic.

1187
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:45,716
- Excuse me, sir, how would
you like your beef done?

1188
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,324
- Well done.

1189
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:47,532
- Well done.

1190
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,204
- You don't like cheese.

1191
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:52,412
You never take cheese.

1192
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,247
- Percy, I adore cheese.

1193
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:54,916
- You said you didn't like it.

1194
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:56,560
- That's the most despicable
lie, Percy, and you know it.

1195
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,960
You've gone quite pink.

1196
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:58,753
- [Percy] I haven't gone pink.

1197
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,046
- Yes you have.

1198
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,398
Your ears have gone slightly
pink about the tips.

1199
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:01,964
- [Percy] Evie, I have not.

1200
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:03,341
- Evie, I like that.

1201
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,152
Ms. Schlegel expects me to
act as house agent for her.

1202
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,637
- (chuckles) I want a
new home in September,

1203
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,845
and someone must find it.

1204
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:09,805
I can't.

1205
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:11,933
- Do you know of
anything, Percy?

1206
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:13,351
- Can't say I do.

1207
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,771
- I wish you would
give us Howards End.

1208
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:20,024
- Howards End, I'm
afraid, is let.

1209
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:23,152
- Can't you turn out your
tenant and let it to us?

1210
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:24,362
- No.

1211
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,491
- (sighs) We're nearly demented.

1212
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,826
Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

1213
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,248
- One bit of advice,
fix your district,

1214
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,875
then fix your price,
then don't budge.

1215
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:41,254
That's how I got Ducie
Street and Oniton.

1216
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:45,508
Well, I shall, I shall
look around a bit for you.

1217
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,426
- Would you?

1218
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:49,469
- Yes.

1219
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:50,754
- [Margaret] Would you really?

1220
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:53,224
- Yes.
- [Margaret] Well, how kind.

1221
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,226
But I warn you, the
house has not been built

1222
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,270
that would suit the
Schlegel family.

1223
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:59,814
It's no fun trying to help us.

1224
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:02,108
- Fun, no, but it's a
pleasure and a privilege

1225
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:06,904
to do whatever I can for
Ms. Margaret Schlegel.

1226
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:08,823
- Thank you very much.

1227
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,326
- [Henry] Dear Ms.
Schlegel, dare I intrude

1228
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:15,288
on your holiday in Devon
and request you to come up

1229
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:18,583
to London, where, I may
add, you are greatly missed?

1230
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,918
Matter is of some urgency.

1231
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:24,547
- But to interrupt your
holiday, dear Margaret,

1232
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:27,174
and before we have undertaken
any of our excursions.

1233
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:30,261
You haven't even been
to Nine Barrows Down.

1234
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,972
- I know, Aunt Juley, but I
shall be back before long.

1235
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,683
Let me go up to town
today and take the house

1236
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,310
if it's the least bit possible.

1237
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:38,144
- I don't understand.

1238
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,352
Whose house is this?

1239
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:40,104
- It's Mr. Wilcox's, Tibby.

1240
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:41,593
You are being remarkably obtuse.

1241
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:43,566
Are you doing it on purpose?

1242
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,776
Look, "Owing to
changed circumstances,"

1243
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,425
he means that Evie's
getting married.

1244
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:48,988
That's his daughter.

1245
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:51,490
"I no longer have need for
a London house of this size

1246
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:53,701
"and am willing to let
it on a yearly tenancy."

1247
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,244
Now, it's perfect.

1248
01:05:55,453 --> 01:05:56,893
- Out of all our
hotel acquaintances,

1249
01:05:57,038 --> 01:05:58,558
Mr. Wilcox is the
only one who's stuck,

1250
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:00,875
and yet, we've met far
more interesting people.

1251
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,294
- Interesting people
don't get one houses.

1252
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:06,088
- I shall never forget
that dreadful motor driver,

1253
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,132
that perfectly dreadful Charles.

1254
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:09,741
My one consolation
is that for once,

1255
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:12,303
I was able to be
useful to you girls.

1256
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,472
- Thank you, Aunt Juley.

1257
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:18,893
And now it is my
turn to be useful.

1258
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,899
(horses clopping)

1259
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:29,362
(ominous strings music)

1260
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,180
- This is the ballroom.

1261
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:58,557
- [Margaret] Goodness, oh.

1262
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:00,475
- Like it?

1263
01:07:00,518 --> 01:07:02,186
- (chuckles) Rather!

1264
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:05,606
Even I know a good
thing when I see it.

1265
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:13,197
- Yes, but nowadays, with
Evie always out with her fiance,

1266
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:14,466
when I get home in the evenings,

1267
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,367
I tell you, I can't
stand the place.

1268
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:18,285
- Yes, it would be
very lonely for you.

1269
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:19,494
- Yes.

1270
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:23,374
Do you ever get
lonely, Ms. Schlegel?

1271
01:07:23,582 --> 01:07:25,334
- I soon shall, horribly.

1272
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:31,340
It's heartbreaking to
leave one's old home.

1273
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:34,135
Goodness, how high
this ceiling must be.

1274
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:35,343
- Hmm?

1275
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:37,096
Yes, it must be over 30 feet.

1276
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:41,267
No, maybe 40, I should
think, perhaps even more.

1277
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:45,646
Ms. Schlegel...

1278
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:51,485
I've had you up here
on false pretenses.

1279
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:52,445
I want to speak on a much more

1280
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:55,239
serious matter than the house.

1281
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:03,414
Do you think you could
be induced to share?

1282
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,834
I mean, is it at
all probable that—

1283
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,011
- Ms. Schlegel.

1284
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,262
Margaret.

1285
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:22,057
I don't think you
quite understand.

1286
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:24,018
- Oh, yes, indeed, yes.

1287
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:25,978
- I'm asking you to be my wife.

1288
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:27,938
- Yes, I know, I know.

1289
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:31,358
- Are you offended?

1290
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:32,985
- How could I be?

1291
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:34,796
- Well, perhaps I
should've written first.

1292
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,282
- No, no, rather, you will
receive a letter from me.

1293
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,617
- [Henry] Thank you.

1294
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:42,369
- Not at all, and
it's you I thank.

1295
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,961
- Should I order
the motor round now?

1296
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,799
- That would be most kind.

1297
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,969
- [Charles] I am
warning you, Evie.

1298
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,473
She will never set
foot in this house!

1299
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:25,742
- [Evie] It's not my fault!

1300
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:28,541
- Of course it's your fault.

1301
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:31,377
Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

1302
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:32,169
- Girls?

1303
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:34,380
They're hardly girls.

1304
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,382
I never dreamt of such a thing.

1305
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,990
Dad took me to call
and then made me

1306
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,511
ask her to Simpson's,
that's all.

1307
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:41,929
Well, I'm altogether off Dad.

1308
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:42,721
(baby Crying)

1309
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:43,597
- You've woken Didums.

1310
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:45,349
I knew you would.

1311
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:50,020
- Well, Ms. Schlegel's
fairly got us on toast.

1312
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:53,440
You know, she always meant
to get hold of Howards End.

1313
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:56,569
Now, thanks to
you, she's got it.

1314
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,779
- I call that most unfair.

1315
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:00,739
- Oh, Evie, why
don't you pretend

1316
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:02,324
to break off your engagement?

1317
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:03,635
Then, perhaps, your father will

1318
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,578
also quarrel with Ms. Schlegel.

1319
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,389
- [Charles] Stop talking
nonsense, darling.

1320
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,915
- I'm jolly well going to get
married as soon as possible.

1321
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:11,792
And Dad can do what he likes.

1322
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:14,670
- She's taking Mother's place.

1323
01:10:14,879 --> 01:10:16,171
The idea!

1324
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,550
- I could simply scratch
that woman's eyes out.

1325
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,385
Toto, Toto, play.

1326
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:22,928
- Come on, Dolly.

1327
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,722
I'll have a try.

1328
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:25,723
Come on.

1329
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,309
Well, it's no use talking.

1330
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:32,521
We're in a bad hole and
must make the best of it.

1331
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:36,150
But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

1332
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,861
And if I find them
putting on airs

1333
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:42,156
with their artistic beastliness,

1334
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:43,991
I intend to put my foot down.

1335
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,199
Yes, firmly.

1336
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,787
(thunder claps)

1337
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:53,375
(gulls squawking)

1338
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,429
- I've had a letter
too, not a nice one.

1339
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:07,431
I want to talk it over with you.

1340
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,850
My letter is about Howards End.

1341
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:12,478
The tenants have decamped.

1342
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:13,395
And what is worse, he's trying

1343
01:11:13,604 --> 01:11:14,897
to sublet the house, Margaret.

1344
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:16,585
Here, he's trying
to sublet the house.

1345
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,690
What are you laughing at?

1346
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:20,444
- Henry, you
haven't had a chance

1347
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:22,255
for a talk with Helen
yet have you, I suppose?

1348
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,590
- What do you mean,
a talk with her?

1349
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:24,782
- Well, do before you go.

1350
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,367
- Why, what's the matter?

1351
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:29,328
- No, nothing, I'm just anxious
you two should be friends.

1352
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,680
- [Henry] We've always
hit it off together.

1353
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:31,455
- [Margaret] Shh.

1354
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:32,998
- Well, we do.

1355
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:35,143
There's no clause in the
agreement to allow subletting.

1356
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,627
There you are, read it yourself.

1357
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:37,835
That's awfully jolly.

1358
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,004
- Thank you.

1359
01:11:39,213 --> 01:11:41,006
- Yes, especially
that, foxgloves.

1360
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:42,967
- Yes, dear old digitalis.

1361
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,594
- Digitalis, sounds
like a sneeze.

1362
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:47,638
(laughing)

1363
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:50,557
- [Helen] Margaret, such
nice news from Mr. Bast.

1364
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:51,350
- [Margaret] Really?

1365
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:52,226
Good.

1366
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,478
- Here we all are then.

1367
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:56,563
Mr. Bast is now with
Dempster's Bank.

1368
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,190
That's his news.
- [Margaret] Good.

1369
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:01,485
- Thanks to your hint, he
cleared out of the Porphyrion.

1370
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:03,779
- Not a bad business,
the Porphyrion.

1371
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:06,348
Margaret, I shall have to go
to Howards End and take charge,

1372
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,283
and I would like
you to come with me.

1373
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:09,535
- Not a bad business?

1374
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:10,887
- Yes, I would like
that very much.

1375
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,013
- Good, what about tomorrow?

1376
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,037
- Tomorrow?

1377
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,456
Oh no, I couldn't well do that.

1378
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:15,916
- Why not?

1379
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:16,834
- You told us the Porphyrion
would smash before Christmas.

1380
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,460
- Did I?

1381
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:21,171
Yes, well, it was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

1382
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,132
Took some rather bad policies.

1383
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,510
But lately, it came
in, safe as houses now.

1384
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:27,970
What's wrong with tomorrow?

1385
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,459
- Well, Aunt Juley would be
so disappointed if I left now.

1386
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:31,616
- [Helen] Didn't
Mr. Wilcox clearly

1387
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,784
tell us that the
Porphyrion would—

1388
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,913
- Henry, Aunt Juley
regards this visit as a—

1389
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,219
and Mr. Bast need
never have left

1390
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,818
and taken another post at
a greatly reduced salary.

1391
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,403
- My dear Helen.

1392
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,822
I grieve for your
clerk, I really do.

1393
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:49,074
But it is all part of
the battle of life.

1394
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:49,867
- Battle of life?

1395
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,452
- Yes.

1396
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,221
- A man who had little
money has less, owing to us.

1397
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:54,997
- Oh, come, come,
you're not to blame.

1398
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,205
No one is to blame.

1399
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,041
- No one?

1400
01:12:57,249 --> 01:12:58,584
Is no one to blame for anything?

1401
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,792
- I didn't say that.

1402
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:01,021
You take things
far too seriously.

1403
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:01,670
- [Aunt Juley] Margaret!

1404
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:02,671
- There's your aunt.

1405
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,672
I'll go and have
a word with her.

1406
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:04,631
- [Aunt Juley] Margaret!

1407
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,383
- Helen.

1408
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:08,719
- Helen, a word of advice—

1409
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:13,599
- Don't take up a sentimental
attitude over the poor.

1410
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,726
See that she doesn't, Margaret.

1411
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:16,977
The poor are poor.

1412
01:13:17,186 --> 01:13:20,230
One is sorry for
them, but there it is.

1413
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,791
I'll talk to Aunt
Juley about tomorrow.

1414
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:22,815
Don't you bother.

1415
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:26,737
- [Aunt Juley] Girls,
aren't you cold?

1416
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:29,656
- Helen, I am very
sorry about Mr. Bast,

1417
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:31,325
but you must be civil to Henry.

1418
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:32,743
- You yourself are a witness.

1419
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:36,747
- Yes, I know there may be
another side to this question.

1420
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:41,085
But Henry is my future husband,
and I must be on his side.

1421
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:47,424
Why are you so
bitter, dearie, hmm?

1422
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:50,886
- Because I'm an old maid.

1423
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:52,095
- Oh, Helen.

1424
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,264
No, darling.

1425
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,019
Helen!

1426
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:04,023
- Margaret will explain.

1427
01:14:04,108 --> 01:14:06,819
- Margaret, Magsy,
if it isn't true,

1428
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:08,403
surely, what Mr.
Wilcox is saying,

1429
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:09,947
that you want to
go away tomorrow?

1430
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:12,366
- [Henry] Yes, we
must leave tomorrow.

1431
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,660
I have business at Howards
End, and my business

1432
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,496
is now also, unfortunately,
my Margaret's.

1433
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,944
- So we'll go for our walk now.

1434
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:20,833
See you at tea time,
unless it rains.

1435
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,852
In which case, we'll see you
a great deal sooner, bye.

1436
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,253
- Have a good walk.

1437
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:39,476
- Yes, that's him.

1438
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:40,435
- [Margaret] So this
is the famous office?

1439
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:41,812
- What?

1440
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:42,729
- [Margaret] I'd expected
something more African.

1441
01:14:42,938 --> 01:14:44,648
- Oh, heavens, no. (laughs)

1442
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:47,734
- Spears and animal skins
and that sort of thing,

1443
01:14:47,943 --> 01:14:49,653
but I suppose this
is the imperial part

1444
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:51,742
of the Imperial and West
African Rubber Company.

1445
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:53,007
- Yes, we still haven't settled

1446
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,509
the question of the
London house, have we?

1447
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,927
- Well, that all
depends, doesn't it?

1448
01:14:55,951 --> 01:14:56,951
- On what?

1449
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:58,054
- When do you want to marry me?

1450
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,430
- (chuckles) How
you do fly around.

1451
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:00,038
My head's in a whirl.

1452
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:00,789
Let's dance!

1453
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:03,250
(laughing)

1454
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:07,212
(Henry singing)

1455
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:12,259
- I hope that my wife,
oh, how do you do,

1456
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,736
will give you a
decent lunch after

1457
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,304
you've had a good
look at Howards End.

1458
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,573
- I can hardly wait to see it,

1459
01:15:16,597 --> 01:15:18,307
although I almost feel I have.

1460
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:20,684
- I don't know in what
state you'll find it.

1461
01:15:20,893 --> 01:15:23,228
The tenant decamped
without even arranging

1462
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:25,606
for a charwoman to
clear up after him.

1463
01:15:25,814 --> 01:15:26,523
- Oh, dear.

1464
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:28,025
- Yes, I've more than a little

1465
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:29,693
bone to pick with that tenant.

1466
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,737
Margaret, here's an idea.

1467
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:32,945
- [Margaret] Yes?

1468
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:34,907
- Why don't we use
Howards End to store

1469
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:36,742
your furniture
from Wickham Place

1470
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,702
'til you decide
what to do with it?

1471
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,555
- [Margaret] Oh, would
you, would you really?

1472
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,163
- [Henry] Good idea?

1473
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,998
- Oh, how kind.

1474
01:15:43,207 --> 01:15:47,544
Only until Helen and Tibby are
settled of course, Charles.

1475
01:15:47,753 --> 01:15:49,796
- I hope you won't
be disappointed.

1476
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,299
It's quite a measly
little place.

1477
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:54,092
Never really suited us.

1478
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:55,469
- Heavens, no.

1479
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:10,484
(engine rumbles)

1480
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,788
- Oh, it's lovely.

1481
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,206
- Margaret.
- [Dolly] Oh, dear.

1482
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,457
- What?

1483
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,124
- I seem to have
forgotten the keys.

1484
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:26,917
- What?

1485
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:27,834
- I've lost the keys.

1486
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:29,283
- Crane, we'll have to go back.

1487
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:30,730
- Oh, well, won't
you leave me here?

1488
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:31,463
- You sure?

1489
01:16:31,672 --> 01:16:32,872
- Yes, yes, I'll wait for you.

1490
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:34,841
Dolly, have a nice glass
of milk at the farm.

1491
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,885
Henry, see that she gets
a nice glass of milk.

1492
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:38,279
I'll walk around in the garden.

1493
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:40,889
(engine rumbles)

1494
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:43,224
Goodbye.

1495
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:45,328
- Why did you forget the key?

1496
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:46,392
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

1497
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,813
- Where did you leave it?

1498
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,565
- Well, it could be with Didums.

1499
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:05,163
(peaceful piano music)

1500
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:13,315
(thumping)

1501
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:21,365
- [Margaret] Hello?

1502
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:26,912
- I took you for Ruth Wilcox.

1503
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,872
- I, like Mrs. Wilcox?

1504
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:33,085
- You have her way of walking...

1505
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:35,629
'round the house.

1506
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:24,803
(engine rumbles)

1507
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,307
- [Margaret] Henry, Henry!

1508
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:33,562
Henry, I've found the teeth.

1509
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,480
- [Henry] Yes, what?
- The pigs' teeth.

1510
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:36,398
- [Henry] Teeth, where?

1511
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,650
- The pigs' teeth in the bark.

1512
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:40,777
Yes, look, just here.

1513
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,028
You see?

1514
01:19:42,237 --> 01:19:43,237
Four feet up.

1515
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:44,739
- [Henry] How extraordinary.

1516
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,117
- Yes, and you chew the
bark to cure the toothache.

1517
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,118
- [Henry] What a rum notion.

1518
01:19:48,326 --> 01:19:50,704
- Surely, you knew that.

1519
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:53,224
- Did that silly old Ms. Avery
give you a fright, Margaret?

1520
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:56,042
None of you girls has
any nerve. (laughs)

1521
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,502
- Did you take her for a spook?

1522
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:58,795
She's very odd.

1523
01:19:59,004 --> 01:20:00,881
She carries on as if
she owned Howards End.

1524
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:02,757
- Ms. Avery has always
lived on the place?

1525
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:05,802
- Oh yes, she grew up there
on the farm like Mrs. Wilcox.

1526
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:07,512
Weren't she and
Mrs. Wilcox friends

1527
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:09,681
when Howards End,
too, was a farm?

1528
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:11,266
They do say that Mrs. Wilcox had

1529
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:13,101
a brother, or was it an uncle?

1530
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:16,980
Anyhow, he popped the question,
and Ms. Avery, she said no.

1531
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:19,065
Just imagine if she'd said yes.

1532
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:20,984
She'd have been Charles's aunt.

1533
01:20:21,193 --> 01:20:24,237
Oh, I say, that's rather
good, Charlie's aunt.

1534
01:20:24,446 --> 01:20:26,031
I must chaff him about that.

1535
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,409
(mysterious orchestral music)

1536
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:31,328
She's so mad about Howards End.

1537
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:32,763
Goodness knows
what she'll do when

1538
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:35,040
your furniture gets
there, Margaret.

1539
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,501
She might fling it
all out, or she might

1540
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,253
simply adopt it for Howards End.

1541
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,371
- Excuse me, sir, where would I

1542
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:28,176
go to inquire about a position?

1543
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:30,804
- What position
would that be, sir?

1544
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:32,389
- I heard there was one.

1545
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,266
- Not at this time.

1546
01:21:59,249 --> 01:21:59,833
- I thought it was you.

1547
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,209
How do you do?

1548
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:03,295
Why did you never
come to see us again?

1549
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,838
You promised.

1550
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:06,089
But this isn't your bank.

1551
01:22:06,298 --> 01:22:07,316
You took a situation
with Dempster's.

1552
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:08,425
- I lost it.

1553
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,260
- [Helen] Sorry?

1554
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:12,762
- I lost the situation.

1555
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:15,223
They cut back on their
staff and the last to join,

1556
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:18,018
like me, were the
first to be let go.

1557
01:22:18,226 --> 01:22:20,562
I've been inquiring
for another place here.

1558
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,689
The way they look at you
when you come to ask.

1559
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,297
They're sure you've
stolen something

1560
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,818
or why else would any decent
person be out of work?

1561
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:28,028
- It's our fault.

1562
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,279
- No.

1563
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:30,280
- No, we made you
leave the Porphyrion,

1564
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:32,198
I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox,

1565
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:34,200
who is at this very
moment, celebrating

1566
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,620
his daughter's wedding at
his castle in Shropshire,

1567
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,997
with the maximum expense
and ostentation, of course.

1568
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:40,665
I could murder him!

1569
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:44,794
- "Murder will out,
it is most foul."

1570
01:22:46,046 --> 01:22:47,273
How have you been, Ms. Schlegel?

1571
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:48,465
Any interesting lectures?

1572
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:52,385
- [Helen] You know, he jolly
well owes you a situation.

1573
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:55,823
- [Margaret] What
nice houses you have

1574
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:58,350
all over the place,
I like this one too.

1575
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,269
- [Henry] Oniton Grange,
waiting to get it off my hands.

1576
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:02,478
- [Margaret] Why?

1577
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,938
- [Henry] Well,
what is one to do?

1578
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:05,750
The shooting is bad and
the fishing is even worse.

1579
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:08,151
Anyway, it's in the
wrong part of Shropshire.

1580
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,570
- Henry, are these all Wilcoxes?

1581
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:12,155
- Heavens, no.

1582
01:23:12,364 --> 01:23:14,366
I bought the place
lock, stock and barrel.

1583
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:16,117
The fellow just took the money

1584
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:18,370
and cleared off
to Italy, I think.

1585
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:19,639
I'm told some of
these are rather good.

1586
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:20,372
What do you think?

1587
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,580
- I think they're lovely.

1588
01:23:21,665 --> 01:23:22,248
- Rather good, isn't it?

1589
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:23,124
- Which one?

1590
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,333
- Top one.

1591
01:23:24,501 --> 01:23:26,252
- Yes, very grand,
it's rather like you.

1592
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:30,382
- (chuckles) So, I'll
show you the cellar.

1593
01:23:33,468 --> 01:23:35,261
It's very damp, isn't it?

1594
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:38,932
(socializing and laughing)

1595
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:43,853
Do you have enough ice now?

1596
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:45,062
- Yes, sir.

1597
01:23:45,146 --> 01:23:46,207
- [Henry] Second orders?
- Yes, sir.

1598
01:23:46,231 --> 01:23:47,899
- Good, all right.

1599
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:49,150
- Good afternoon.

1600
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:50,777
- It's this way.
- [Margaret] Right.

1601
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:51,985
Thank you.

1602
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,616
- It is difficult to decide
what to do about the children.

1603
01:23:56,825 --> 01:23:58,743
Yes, here we are.

1604
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:01,272
Now, Charles, as the eldest,
will someday have Howards End.

1605
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:03,307
And I'm just anxious not
to be unjust to the others.

1606
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:05,250
- Of course not, you mean money?

1607
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,061
- Yes, money, since
you put it so frankly.

1608
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:10,088
- Goodness, we'll never
get through all this wine.

1609
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,416
Well, how much have you got?

1610
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:12,590
- What?

1611
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:14,039
- How much have you got a year?

1612
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:14,926
I have 600.

1613
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:16,135
- My income?

1614
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:17,887
- Don't you know your income?

1615
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:19,180
- Of course I do.

1616
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,808
- (laughs) Well, don't
you want to tell it me?

1617
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,393
Do it this way.

1618
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:24,870
If you were to divide
your income into 10 parts,

1619
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,205
how many parts would
you give to Charles,

1620
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:28,189
how many to Evie and
how many to Paul?

1621
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:28,982
Go ahead.

1622
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:29,774
Give away all you can.

1623
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:31,443
Be generous.

1624
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:33,211
- You don't beat about
the bush, do you?

1625
01:24:33,403 --> 01:24:34,403
(chuckles)

1626
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:35,487
No.

1627
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:39,743
(regal horns music)

1628
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:50,396
- [Charles] I suppose
she'll get her hands

1629
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,255
on this place as
well as Howards End.

1630
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:55,008
- It's only her furniture
that's gone there.

1631
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:58,553
- No, that's the thin
edge of the wedge.

1632
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,640
I don't know what's
to happen to us, Dolly

1633
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:04,434
Two children to bring up.

1634
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:08,104
- Charles, you are pleased
about the baby, aren't you?

1635
01:25:08,313 --> 01:25:09,313
- What?

1636
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,107
Oh, pleased as punch.

1637
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:14,486
Pleased as punch.

1638
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:22,368
Though it's not
going to be easy.

1639
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:26,289
The pater wants to be fair,
but money isn't elastic.

1640
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:29,083
What if Evie has a family?

1641
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:29,876
Or the pater himself?

1642
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,085
(laughs)

1643
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:31,878
What?

1644
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,086
- Shh.

1645
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,302
- Who's there?

1646
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:43,598
Saxon or Celt?

1647
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:53,441
(bouncy orchestral music)

1648
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:57,487
(cheering and wishing farewells)

1649
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:10,416
It went like clockwork.

1650
01:26:11,626 --> 01:26:13,211
"Quite like a Durbar,"
Lady Edser said.

1651
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,713
- Ah, you did awfully well.

1652
01:26:16,631 --> 01:26:18,258
I'm very proud of you.

1653
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:19,801
Thank you.

1654
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:22,220
It was very successful.

1655
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:23,555
Who are those people?

1656
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,163
- Well, perhaps
they're townspeople,

1657
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:27,183
come to see the
wedding presents.

1658
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:31,437
If you'll gracefully
vanish, I'll deal with them.

1659
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:40,488
What is it?

1660
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:41,697
What's wrong?

1661
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:42,323
Is Tibby ill?

1662
01:26:42,532 --> 01:26:43,116
They're starving!

1663
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:43,992
I found them starving!

1664
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,200
- Who is starving?

1665
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:46,554
- The Basts.
- [Margaret] Oh, Helen.

1666
01:26:46,578 --> 01:26:47,596
- He's lost his
place because he's

1667
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,038
been turned out of
Dempster's bank.

1668
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:51,499
They reduced their staff,
and he was the first to go.

1669
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,501
Yes, thanks to
us, he's done for.

1670
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:54,377
We've ruined him.

1671
01:26:54,586 --> 01:26:56,004
- Are you mad?

1672
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:57,690
- If you like, I'm mad, but
I'll stand for this no longer!

1673
01:26:57,714 --> 01:27:00,466
Two people starving, and
meanwhile, all this vulgar show!

1674
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:03,678
(peaceful violin music)

1675
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:07,348
- Helen, have you
actually brought

1676
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:11,561
two starving people from
London to Shropshire?

1677
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,122
- There was a restaurant
car on the train.

1678
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:14,230
Don't be absurd.

1679
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:15,749
I won't have such
theatrical nonsense.

1680
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:16,524
How dare you?

1681
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:17,733
Yes, how dare you!

1682
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:19,501
Bursting into Evie's
wedding in this way.

1683
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:20,612
My goodness,

1684
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,822
but you've a perverted
notion of philanthropy.

1685
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:24,490
Look at them.

1686
01:27:24,699 --> 01:27:26,594
They think it's some vulgar
scandal, and I must explain,

1687
01:27:26,618 --> 01:27:28,703
"Oh no, it's only
my sister screaming,

1688
01:27:28,912 --> 01:27:30,747
"and only two hangers-on
of ours whom she has

1689
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:32,308
"brought here for no
conceivable reason."

1690
01:27:32,332 --> 01:27:34,709
- We want to see Mr. Wilcox.

1691
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:39,088
- Mr. Bast, this
is an odd business.

1692
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:40,965
What view do you take of it?

1693
01:27:41,174 --> 01:27:42,383
- There is Mrs. Bast too.

1694
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,592
- Yes, how do you do?

1695
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,469
- How do you do?

1696
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:45,470
- She's not well.

1697
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:46,678
She fainted on the train.

1698
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:48,222
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1699
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:49,658
Won't you sit down for a minute?

1700
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:51,082
- I'm sure we don't
wish to intrude,

1701
01:27:51,142 --> 01:27:53,519
but you have been so kind in
the past, you and your sister.

1702
01:27:53,728 --> 01:27:54,788
- Look, my sister has put you in

1703
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:55,831
a false position, I'm afraid.

1704
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:57,148
- Jacky, let's go.

1705
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:59,067
- Please, Helen,
offer them something.

1706
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:03,321
Mrs. Bast, please, won't you
have something to eat, please?

1707
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:12,538
Now, Helen. I would like
to do something for them,

1708
01:28:12,747 --> 01:28:14,832
because I agree, we are
in some way responsible.

1709
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,041
- Via Mr. Wilcox.

1710
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,645
- Let me tell you,
once and for all, that

1711
01:28:17,669 --> 01:28:22,215
if you take up that attitude,
I'll do nothing, so choose.

1712
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:25,134
If you promise to
take them to the hotel

1713
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:28,471
quietly as my guests,
then I will speak to Henry

1714
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,932
about finding work for Mr.
Bast, in my own way, mind.

1715
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:35,019
There is to be no more
of this absurd screaming.

1716
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:36,688
Well?

1717
01:28:36,896 --> 01:28:38,648
- All right. I promise.

1718
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,401
- Very well, take them off to
the George then, and I'll try.

1719
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:42,609
But Helen...

1720
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,864
you have been most
self-indulgent.

1721
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:49,534
You have less restraint, rather
than more, as you get older.

1722
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:53,705
Think it over, Helen,
and alter yourself,

1723
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:55,915
or we shan't have happy lives.

1724
01:28:56,124 --> 01:28:59,836
(bouncy string band music)

1725
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:02,922
(people socializing)

1726
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:05,633
- Let's eat some cake, shall we?

1727
01:29:30,033 --> 01:29:31,576
- Sorry, excuse me.

1728
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:33,344
- Now, I must see to
getting some rooms.

1729
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:34,638
- No, we don't want
to be any trouble.

1730
01:29:34,662 --> 01:29:35,246
We should come with you.

1731
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:36,456
- Len.

1732
01:29:36,664 --> 01:29:37,725
- Perhaps you'd like to stay.

1733
01:29:37,749 --> 01:29:39,459
- Look, there's
all this pudding.

1734
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,085
- Mrs. Bast is extremely tired.

1735
01:29:41,294 --> 01:29:42,336
- I'm hungry.

1736
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:45,173
- Perhaps you should
come back for her.

1737
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:46,132
- Will you be all right?

1738
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,884
- I'll be all right.

1739
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:56,433
- Ah.

1740
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:20,249
- Charles, Charles, look!

1741
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:25,713
Whoever's that?

1742
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:26,922
- [Charles] Where?

1743
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:28,549
- [Dolly] Pink scarf.

1744
01:30:39,936 --> 01:30:42,647
- Charles Wilcox, how do you do?

1745
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:44,065
Bride or groom?

1746
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:53,658
I'm very pleased to have
made your acquaintance.

1747
01:30:55,326 --> 01:30:57,703
- [Server] Champagne, madam?

1748
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:00,957
- Helen?

1749
01:31:01,165 --> 01:31:02,165
What, here?

1750
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:04,877
But, she refused the invitation.

1751
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:07,839
I thought she despised weddings.

1752
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:08,798
Where is she now?

1753
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,091
- She's gone now.

1754
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,926
I've bundled her
off to the George.

1755
01:31:12,135 --> 01:31:13,177
- George Hotel?

1756
01:31:13,386 --> 01:31:14,746
Well, you shouldn't
have done that.

1757
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:18,516
- Well, she has two of
her proteges with her.

1758
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,811
- Ah, yes, her proteges.

1759
01:31:22,812 --> 01:31:24,981
Well, let them all come.

1760
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,816
- No, but later on,

1761
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:32,029
I would like to talk
to you about them.

1762
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:32,947
- [Henry] Well, why not now?

1763
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:34,657
No time like the present.

1764
01:31:34,866 --> 01:31:35,867
- Shall I?

1765
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:39,537
- Mmm, yes, if it
isn't too long a story.

1766
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,289
- [Margaret] It's
not five minutes.

1767
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:42,497
- Yes.

1768
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:46,127
- But there's a sting
at the end of it.

1769
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:47,461
- [Henry] Hmm?

1770
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:53,843
- For I want you to find the
man some work in your office.

1771
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:56,137
(laughs)

1772
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,808
- Well, what are
his qualifications?

1773
01:32:02,393 --> 01:32:03,753
- [Margaret] He's
a clerk, I think.

1774
01:32:03,895 --> 01:32:05,771
- [Henry] Yes,
where was he before?

1775
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,857
- [Margaret] Dempster's Bank.

1776
01:32:08,065 --> 01:32:10,902
- [Henry] Dempster's,
why did he leave?

1777
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,820
- [Margaret] They
reduced their staff.

1778
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,029
- Oh.

1779
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:16,741
Yes, all right.

1780
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:20,244
I'll see what I can do.

1781
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:21,787
- [Margaret] Thank you.

1782
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:24,874
- Margaret, this cannot be
taken as a precedent, you know.

1783
01:32:25,082 --> 01:32:28,085
I can't fit in your proteges
or Helen's proteges every day.

1784
01:32:28,294 --> 01:32:29,003
You do understand?

1785
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:31,714
- Of course, of course not.

1786
01:32:31,923 --> 01:32:34,926
But he's, he's rather
a special case.

1787
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:39,931
- Yes, well, proteges
always are, aren't they?

1788
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:45,853
(guest socializing)

1789
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:00,135
- [Departing Woman]
Well, goodbye.

1790
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,786
Thank you so much.

1791
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:02,994
- [Margaret] Goodbye.

1792
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,250
- Why, if it isn't
Henry. (laughs)

1793
01:33:10,711 --> 01:33:13,881
Hello. Henry, fancy
seeing you here.

1794
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,883
- This is Mrs. Bast.

1795
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:17,372
Sorry, she's a little overtired.

1796
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:18,135
- She's drunk.

1797
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,554
- Don't you remember Jacky?

1798
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:25,101
Henry, aren't you
gonna say hello?

1799
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:26,560
- Do you know Mrs. Bast?

1800
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:28,104
- No, I don't!

1801
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:30,356
- [Jacky] Know Henry?

1802
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:32,244
Who doesn't know Henry?
- [Margaret] Henry?

1803
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,086
- [Jacky] We've had some gay
old times, haven't we, Hen?

1804
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,319
- You're drunk!

1805
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:38,113
- Henry?

1806
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:40,449
Henry, Henry.

1807
01:33:41,993 --> 01:33:43,313
- Are you satisfied
now, Margaret?

1808
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:45,449
I can now understand your
keen interest in the Basts.

1809
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:46,747
I must say I congratulate you

1810
01:33:46,956 --> 01:33:47,748
on your little plan to trap me.

1811
01:33:47,957 --> 01:33:48,957
- [Margaret] Trap you?

1812
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:49,834
- I release you from
your engagement.

1813
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:51,377
- Henry, Henry, Henry!

1814
01:34:00,052 --> 01:34:01,137
Here we are.

1815
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:02,705
- Oh, please don't
bother, my dear.

1816
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:04,765
I'm sure I can manage.

1817
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:09,854
- [Henry] That's all right,
I'll do that, I'll do it.

1818
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:11,062
- So that's it.

1819
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:12,315
- Oh, that is what?

1820
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:14,442
Thank you, dear chap.

1821
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,901
You were saying?

1822
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:18,297
- No, Henry and I were just
having the fiercest argument,

1823
01:34:18,321 --> 01:34:19,739
but I think he has forgiven me.

1824
01:34:19,947 --> 01:34:22,742
- Oh, I don't expect
there's much to forgive.

1825
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:24,076
- No.

1826
01:34:24,285 --> 01:34:26,996
- Well, I really must be
going, or we shall be late.

1827
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,998
Thank you so much
for a lovely time.

1828
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:31,167
And hasn't the weather
been kind to us?

1829
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:31,959
- Glorious.

1830
01:34:32,168 --> 01:34:33,252
- A lovely day.

1831
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:35,129
Thank you, my dear,
very much, thank you.

1832
01:34:35,338 --> 01:34:36,380
- Have a safe journey.

1833
01:34:36,589 --> 01:34:37,941
- Thank you, bye-bye,
Dolly, bless you.

1834
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:38,716
- [Margaret] Bye-bye, Albert.

1835
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:39,592
- You take care of yourself.

1836
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,509
- I shall.

1837
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:41,427
- [Margaret] Bye-bye, Mrs.—

1838
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:43,971
- [Albert] No, it's all
right, it's here, Father.

1839
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,806
- Oh, ah, thank you, Albert.

1840
01:34:46,015 --> 01:34:47,015
- Safe journey.

1841
01:34:47,141 --> 01:34:48,702
- Ah, are the womenfolk
all alright then?

1842
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:49,852
- [Woman in Front Seat] Yes.

1843
01:34:50,061 --> 01:34:51,705
- I'll shut the doors,
then we're all ready.

1844
01:34:51,729 --> 01:34:53,230
Well, thank you.

1845
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:54,857
(engine rumbles)

1846
01:34:55,066 --> 01:34:56,817
Oh, oh, drive on then.

1847
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:08,579
(dramatic chimes music)

1848
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:12,875
(sobbing)

1849
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:39,272
- What's the matter, Jacky?

1850
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:41,320
(crying)

1851
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:43,948
- It was a shock, seeing him.

1852
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:45,783
- Him?

1853
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:46,991
Seeing who?

1854
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:49,495
- I really don't want
to talk about it.

1855
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:50,972
- [Waitress] Too much
champagne? (giggles)

1856
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:54,208
- What do you think
you're looking at?

1857
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:55,417
- Len.

1858
01:36:07,304 --> 01:36:08,304
- Henry.

1859
01:36:11,892 --> 01:36:13,227
Henry, look at me.

1860
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:21,527
So you were that woman's lover.

1861
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,071
- [Henry] Since you put it with

1862
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,656
your usual delicacy, yes, I was.

1863
01:36:25,865 --> 01:36:26,865
- When?

1864
01:36:28,325 --> 01:36:29,325
When, please?

1865
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:30,368
- 10 years ago!

1866
01:36:32,246 --> 01:36:34,748
(sighs) I'm sorry, 10 years ago.

1867
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,460
(clock ticking)

1868
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:44,758
- Henry, dear, it's not
going to trouble us.

1869
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:56,103
- Ah yes, we fellows all fall
from grace once in our time.

1870
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:56,896
Do you believe that, Margaret?

1871
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:58,856
- Yes, I do believe it.

1872
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:01,817
- You with your refined
pursuits and your books.

1873
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:04,278
What can you guess
of any man's life?

1874
01:37:04,487 --> 01:37:06,989
The temptations, temptations.

1875
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:12,036
Well, that's enough.

1876
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:13,404
I've spoken too much already.

1877
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:14,747
- Yes, that's enough, dear.

1878
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:17,291
(lilting harp music)

1879
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,376
- [Henry] It was in Cyprus.

1880
01:37:19,585 --> 01:37:20,586
It was very lonely.

1881
01:37:20,794 --> 01:37:22,114
You can never
forgive me, can you?

1882
01:37:22,213 --> 01:37:24,381
- I have forgiven you. Henry.

1883
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:26,257
- Well, I...

1884
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:32,473
I could find an
excuse, but I won't.

1885
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:36,977
- Let us speak no
more about it, dear.

1886
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:38,646
It is all behind us.

1887
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:39,854
- Really?

1888
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:45,069
You can really bring
yourself to forgive me?

1889
01:37:46,904 --> 01:37:49,907
(lilting harp music)

1890
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,119
You've learned that
I'm far from a saint.

1891
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:55,328
In fact, the reverse.

1892
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:57,498
No, no, no, no, no.
- [Margaret] Shh.

1893
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:58,832
- The reverse.

1894
01:38:00,668 --> 01:38:01,961
Where are those people now?

1895
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:03,879
- Helen has taken
them to the George.

1896
01:38:04,088 --> 01:38:06,882
- Oh, then let them leave
first thing in the morning

1897
01:38:07,091 --> 01:38:10,010
because there must be
no gossip at the George.

1898
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:12,388
And anyway, Helen
should be here with us,

1899
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:16,141
not stopping at a hotel
with some ragtags.

1900
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:21,188
Tell you what, Margaret.

1901
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:23,041
Why don't you kindly write
a note to that effect,

1902
01:38:23,065 --> 01:38:27,152
and I'll have Burton send it
out to Helen straight away.

1903
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:29,446
Burton!

1904
01:38:29,655 --> 01:38:32,283
(raucous laughing)

1905
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:33,491
Burton!

1906
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:36,453
- [Voiceover] Yes, sir.

1907
01:38:36,662 --> 01:38:37,847
- [Henry] I want you
to take a note over

1908
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,191
to the George Hotel
straight away.

1909
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:40,457
- [Voiceover] Yes, sir.

1910
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,919
- [Henry] There's far
too much noise out there.

1911
01:38:47,464 --> 01:38:48,924
- [Margaret] I'm
sorry to tell you

1912
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:52,303
that Henry can do
nothing for Mr. Bast.

1913
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:54,638
He feels the Basts
are not at all

1914
01:38:54,847 --> 01:38:57,474
the type we should
trouble about.

1915
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,354
We found the woman
drunk on the lawn.

1916
01:39:02,563 --> 01:39:04,189
Please see that they
leave first thing

1917
01:39:04,398 --> 01:39:07,192
in the morning and
come here yourself.

1918
01:39:07,401 --> 01:39:08,944
- He made her write it.

1919
01:39:09,153 --> 01:39:10,571
This isn't Margaret.

1920
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:13,282
Would you put it in the fire?

1921
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:24,978
- You better let us
be, Ms. Schlegel.

1922
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:27,421
You don't want to
get mixed up in this.

1923
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:29,256
- Mixed up in what?

1924
01:39:32,176 --> 01:39:33,218
What is it?

1925
01:39:33,427 --> 01:39:36,472
You must trust me
that far, at least.

1926
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:42,853
- Mr. Wilcox met Jacky before,

1927
01:39:43,062 --> 01:39:45,481
out in Cyprus, when she was 16.

1928
01:39:48,025 --> 01:39:51,487
I told you you didn't
want to hear about it.

1929
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:52,695
- Go on.

1930
01:39:52,738 --> 01:39:54,823
Why was she in Cyprus?

1931
01:39:55,032 --> 01:39:57,076
- Her father was a clerk
in an export business.

1932
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:59,578
So after her mother died,
she'd gone out to be with him.

1933
01:39:59,787 --> 01:40:00,829
Then he died.

1934
01:40:02,373 --> 01:40:05,918
Accidentally drowned
because he couldn't swim.

1935
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:08,545
Jacky was left having
to fend for herself

1936
01:40:08,754 --> 01:40:11,507
'til she managed
to get back home.

1937
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:26,313
(gloomy strings music)

1938
01:40:46,709 --> 01:40:49,837
I didn't have to
marry her, but I did.

1939
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:51,439
My family wouldn't have
anything to do with us.

1940
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:55,134
They tried to stop me, but
I married her all the same.

1941
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:56,760
Because I promised.

1942
01:40:58,262 --> 01:40:59,698
Listen, if I hadn't,
where would she be today,

1943
01:40:59,722 --> 01:41:01,449
after the Mr. Wilcoxes of this
world had finished with her?

1944
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:04,268
- It would never, never,
not in a thousand years,

1945
01:41:04,476 --> 01:41:07,771
enter that man's mind that
he'd done anything wrong

1946
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:11,608
because there's nothing
here and nothing here.

1947
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:13,235
And you're the opposite.

1948
01:41:13,444 --> 01:41:15,821
You believe in
personal responsibility

1949
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:17,448
and personal everything.

1950
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:18,656
- Very nice.

1951
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:21,660
What good am I to
myself or to Jacky,

1952
01:41:21,869 --> 01:41:23,138
marrying her only
to pull her down

1953
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:25,372
with me so we can
starve together?

1954
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,684
- You'll find another position
somewhere, surely you will.

1955
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:29,543
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1956
01:41:29,752 --> 01:41:33,297
If rich people fail at one
profession, they can try another.

1957
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:36,300
But with us, once a man over 20

1958
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:40,053
loses his own particular
job, he's done for.

1959
01:41:42,598 --> 01:41:46,226
- I'd do anything in
the world to help you.

1960
01:41:47,686 --> 01:41:48,937
- Well, help me row then.

1961
01:41:49,146 --> 01:41:50,146
I'm tired.

1962
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:14,588
You're the one person
who ever has helped me.

1963
01:42:14,797 --> 01:42:16,131
- You mean by passing on false

1964
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,051
information to make
you give up your job?

1965
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:23,847
- I mean by being the
sort of person you are.

1966
01:42:24,056 --> 01:42:25,408
I didn't think people
like you existed

1967
01:42:25,432 --> 01:42:28,018
except in books, and
books aren't real.

1968
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:30,312
- Oh, no, they're more
real than anything.

1969
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:34,650
When people fail you, there's
still "Music and Meaning."

1970
01:42:36,318 --> 01:42:37,545
- That's for rich
people, to make

1971
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:40,572
them feel good
after their dinner.

1972
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:48,413
- Everything's got spoiled
for you, hasn't it?

1973
01:43:20,654 --> 01:43:23,156
(bells tolling)

1974
01:43:25,576 --> 01:43:30,873
Don't know what's to be done,
Tibby, or what to say to Meg.

1975
01:43:31,081 --> 01:43:33,542
Don't want to face her or even
to go back to Wickham Place.

1976
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:36,587
- You mean because of Mr. Wilcox

1977
01:43:36,795 --> 01:43:38,088
and the woman you say he seduced

1978
01:43:38,297 --> 01:43:41,425
in between growing
currants in Cyprus?

1979
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:45,762
- I want you to give Meg
my love and tell her,

1980
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:50,976
tell her I'm going away to
Germany, to Munich or else Bonn.

1981
01:43:51,184 --> 01:43:53,854
- Such a message
is easily given.

1982
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:57,566
God, I wish I could escape
from Meg's wedding too.

1983
01:43:57,774 --> 01:43:59,401
- Is she really going
through with it?

1984
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:02,070
How is it possible for
our Meg to be a Wilcox?

1985
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:03,947
And now, after all this?

1986
01:44:04,156 --> 01:44:05,508
- You'd much better
go away to Germany.

1987
01:44:05,532 --> 01:44:06,617
(knocking)

1988
01:44:06,825 --> 01:44:07,844
There's Martlett with
the Apple Charlotte.

1989
01:44:07,868 --> 01:44:09,053
Do you mind if I
take it from him?

1990
01:44:09,077 --> 01:44:10,913
It spoils with waiting.

1991
01:44:13,749 --> 01:44:14,749
Ah, Martlett.

1992
01:44:16,209 --> 01:44:17,336
- Shall I clear now, sir?

1993
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:18,921
- Not now, later.

1994
01:44:19,129 --> 01:44:20,839
- Thank you very much.

1995
01:44:24,217 --> 01:44:28,013
- I feel, no, I know we owe
the Basts some compensation.

1996
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:29,221
- Oh, those people again?

1997
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:31,308
- Yes, those people again.

1998
01:44:31,516 --> 01:44:33,518
Don't see who is
to pay if I don't.

1999
01:44:33,727 --> 01:44:35,604
I'm placing what I consider
is a minimum amount

2000
01:44:35,812 --> 01:44:37,731
to your account, and
when I'm in Germany,

2001
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:41,026
you'll pay it over
to the Basts for me.

2002
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,295
I shall never forget
your kindness,

2003
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,071
Tibbikins, if you do this.

2004
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:45,447
- What's the sum?

2005
01:44:45,656 --> 01:44:46,323
- 5,000.

2006
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:47,531
- Good God!

2007
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:49,368
- It's useless just
giving out driblets

2008
01:44:49,576 --> 01:44:52,329
of charity, just
shillings and blankets.

2009
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:54,247
No doubt people
will think me mad.

2010
01:44:54,456 --> 01:44:57,250
- I don't give a damn
what people think,

2011
01:44:57,459 --> 01:44:58,919
but I do mind if
you ruin yourself

2012
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:01,505
for some quixotic
reason of your own.

2013
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:04,132
- I didn't expect
you to understand me.

2014
01:45:04,341 --> 01:45:06,093
- I understand nobody.

2015
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:07,719
- But you'll do it?

2016
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:09,846
- Apparently.

2017
01:45:22,693 --> 01:45:24,403
- [Jacky] Are you
writing to your brother?

2018
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:25,731
He could send us another 10.

2019
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:27,614
- Yes, and a long
lecture to go with it.

2020
01:45:27,823 --> 01:45:29,092
- [Jacky] Your sister
could afford a fiver.

2021
01:45:29,116 --> 01:45:30,784
- Oh, leave me alone!

2022
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:38,542
- Why are you
taking it out on me?

2023
01:45:39,835 --> 01:45:42,212
- You can see I'm
busy, can't you?

2024
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:45,173
(train squeaking)

2025
01:45:52,848 --> 01:45:55,392
(bells tolling)

2026
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:00,939
Dear Mr. Schlegel, I acknowledge
receipt of your letter

2027
01:46:01,148 --> 01:46:04,985
dated 2nd of October, enclosing
a check for 5,000 pounds.

2028
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:06,737
I am very grateful
for your concern,

2029
01:46:06,945 --> 01:46:08,280
but having no
immediate necessity,

2030
01:46:08,488 --> 01:46:11,616
I have the honor to return
your check herewith.

2031
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:14,369
Yours sincerely, Leonard Bast.

2032
01:46:15,328 --> 01:46:17,622
(chattering)

2033
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:22,210
Excuse me, sir,
sorry to bother you.

2034
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:25,088
I worked in this
office for four years.

2035
01:46:25,297 --> 01:46:27,758
I was wondering if there were
any vacancies at the moment?

2036
01:46:27,966 --> 01:46:28,592
- No, no, I'm sorry.

2037
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:29,926
I've nothing.

2038
01:46:30,135 --> 01:46:31,219
- Nothing at all?

2039
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:33,930
- Nothing at this
time, thank you.

2040
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:39,895
(dramatic orchestral music)

2041
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:24,856
- All right, the servants
will have the benefit

2042
01:47:25,065 --> 01:47:26,775
of the central
heating if we keep

2043
01:47:26,983 --> 01:47:29,152
them here instead of at
the back of the house.

2044
01:47:29,361 --> 01:47:30,737
That's what the
architect prefers.

2045
01:47:30,946 --> 01:47:33,406
- Oh, if only it would hurry
up and get itself built.

2046
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:35,784
- All in good time.

2047
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:37,552
- I'm getting tired
of living in London.

2048
01:47:37,661 --> 01:47:38,787
- Are you?

2049
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:40,181
- Yes, I can't be
as young as I was.

2050
01:47:40,205 --> 01:47:41,206
- Yeah?

2051
01:47:41,414 --> 01:47:42,892
- So I'm perfectly
happy to do without all

2052
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,001
the new plays and
discussion societies and—

2053
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:52,300
- Yes, what I miss are trees
and mountains and meadows.

2054
01:47:52,509 --> 01:47:53,509
- Yes.

2055
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:57,472
- I also miss my own things.

2056
01:47:57,681 --> 01:47:59,121
- They're safe enough
at Howards End.

2057
01:47:59,224 --> 01:48:01,601
- And, of course, I'm very
grateful to have them there,

2058
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:03,250
but I would so like
to see everything

2059
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:06,231
in our own home,
my share at least.

2060
01:48:06,439 --> 01:48:10,360
Goodness only knows what
Tibby intends to do with his.

2061
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:11,569
Or Helen.

2062
01:48:14,072 --> 01:48:16,533
There's been another
postcard from her.

2063
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:19,828
Still the same poste
restante address in Bavaria,

2064
01:48:20,036 --> 01:48:21,788
but now she speaks
of going to Italy.

2065
01:48:21,997 --> 01:48:24,249
- Is she never coming
back to England?

2066
01:48:24,457 --> 01:48:27,794
She's been away now the,
how long has it been?

2067
01:48:28,003 --> 01:48:31,464
- It will be four months
and three weeks on Tuesday.

2068
01:48:31,673 --> 01:48:32,673
- Yes.

2069
01:48:33,925 --> 01:48:35,051
Your sister is odd.

2070
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:36,011
She always has been.

2071
01:48:36,219 --> 01:48:39,014
There's no getting away from it.

2072
01:48:39,931 --> 01:48:40,974
What is this?

2073
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:44,561
How, what's been reading now?

2074
01:48:44,769 --> 01:48:45,437
Theo—

2075
01:48:46,563 --> 01:48:49,649
- Oh, yes. (laughs)

2076
01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:54,946
Madame Blavatsky, now, what
a clever little woman it is.

2077
01:48:55,155 --> 01:48:57,324
You see, that's what
I mean about Helen.

2078
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:00,535
She reads these things,
and her mind gets addled.

2079
01:49:00,744 --> 01:49:03,997
My Margaret, she keeps
her facts straight.

2080
01:49:04,206 --> 01:49:06,249
- What facts are those, dear?

2081
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:08,919
- Hmm, about men and women
and all that sort of thing,

2082
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:11,922
who is who and what is what.

2083
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:14,174
Yes, now, what is that?

2084
01:49:14,382 --> 01:49:17,093
- Mr. Schlegel, sir,
you've forgotten these.

2085
01:49:17,302 --> 01:49:17,969
- Ah, thank you, Martlett.

2086
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:19,596
- Thank you, sir.

2087
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:26,394
(dramatic strings music)

2088
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:31,149
- Ah, oh dear, Annie.

2089
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:36,279
Look, it's another one.

2090
01:49:38,907 --> 01:49:40,033
And no letter.

2091
01:49:50,252 --> 01:49:54,839
See, I just can't feel
that Helen's really alive.

2092
01:49:55,048 --> 01:49:56,208
These postcards and telegrams

2093
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:57,884
don't seem to have
come from her.

2094
01:49:58,093 --> 01:49:59,844
That's not her.

2095
01:50:00,053 --> 01:50:01,846
- I know what you mean.

2096
01:50:03,139 --> 01:50:04,450
You'll break that if you
keep fiddling with it.

2097
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:05,267
- [Margaret] Well,
then put it on.

2098
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:06,518
- [Tibby] Oh!

2099
01:50:07,519 --> 01:50:09,813
- [Margaret] Give me my card.

2100
01:50:10,021 --> 01:50:13,608
- [Helen] M.J. Schlegel, The
Rise, Straight Fleming, Devon.

2101
01:50:13,817 --> 01:50:16,861
Dearest Meg, arriving
London Thursday.

2102
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,822
Please telegraph, care my bank,

2103
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:22,701
whether Aunt Juley is better
or likely to become worse.

2104
01:50:22,909 --> 01:50:24,286
Give my love to the invalid and

2105
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:26,913
keep some for yourselves, Helen.

2106
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:31,126
- If only you had a companion
to take your walks with.

2107
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:34,129
- I have Tibby, dear Aunt Juley.

2108
01:50:36,089 --> 01:50:38,633
And it won't be long,
thank you, Maggie,

2109
01:50:38,842 --> 01:50:41,303
before you'll be up and about.

2110
01:50:41,511 --> 01:50:43,471
- When is Helen coming?

2111
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,931
- Well, very soon, dear.

2112
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,934
She will already
have reached London.

2113
01:50:56,735 --> 01:50:58,611
- [Tibby] She's got
to London all right.

2114
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,863
- Yes, but?

2115
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:02,198
- She says to telegraph
if Aunt Juley is better.

2116
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,908
Obviously, if you
want to see her,

2117
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:05,869
you must telegraph
she is not better.

2118
01:51:06,077 --> 01:51:07,871
- We can't start
lying to each other.

2119
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:08,663
But Helen wouldn't—

2120
01:51:10,206 --> 01:51:13,001
- She couldn't stay
away at such a time.

2121
01:51:17,964 --> 01:51:20,383
Dearest Helen, Aunt Juley better

2122
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:24,763
and eagerly expecting
you, as am I, your Meg.

2123
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:26,890
- [Helen] Must return
Germany at once.

2124
01:51:27,098 --> 01:51:28,258
Telegraph to bank whereabouts

2125
01:51:28,308 --> 01:51:30,810
our books and furniture, Helen.

2126
01:51:31,019 --> 01:51:33,646
- But why did she have
to go back to Germany?

2127
01:51:33,855 --> 01:51:36,191
- I'll explain it all
to you after your nap.

2128
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,085
- You'd think she might have
come to see her old aunt.

2129
01:51:38,109 --> 01:51:39,569
I haven't been well, you know.

2130
01:51:39,778 --> 01:51:43,073
Is Cook doing the mackerel
the way Tibby likes them?

2131
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:45,241
I know his whole day is spoiled

2132
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:46,951
if his breakfast isn't right.

2133
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,411
- The mackerel were perfect.

2134
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:51,456
In fact, Tibby particularly
mentioned them this morning.

2135
01:51:51,664 --> 01:51:53,144
Don't tell me, Tibby,
that it is still

2136
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:56,127
that business over Henry
and that woman, Mrs. Bast.

2137
01:51:56,336 --> 01:51:58,254
Goodness me, how morbid.

2138
01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:01,966
His wife forgives him
and his sister-in-law

2139
01:52:02,175 --> 01:52:04,928
cannot bear to
look upon his face.

2140
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:08,723
I don't believe it,
not even of Helen.

2141
01:52:08,932 --> 01:52:11,810
- We all know to what
extremes Helen goes.

2142
01:52:12,018 --> 01:52:13,579
We've all suffered
under her temperament.

2143
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:14,603
- But this is different.

2144
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:17,065
This is not
temperament, but a kind

2145
01:52:17,273 --> 01:52:19,651
of madness, as if she were mad.

2146
01:52:21,903 --> 01:52:24,614
(horses clopping)

2147
01:52:39,379 --> 01:52:43,258
- Margaret, you've got black
marks again under your eyes.

2148
01:52:43,466 --> 01:52:45,927
Well, you know that's
strictly forbidden, don't you?

2149
01:52:46,136 --> 01:52:48,763
I'll not have my girl looking
as old as her husband.

2150
01:52:48,972 --> 01:52:50,332
- You haven't quite
seen our point.

2151
01:52:50,473 --> 01:52:51,933
- No, I don't
suppose I ever shall.

2152
01:52:52,142 --> 01:52:55,812
- Our point is this,
our sister may be mad.

2153
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,149
- Oh, Charles, do come in.

2154
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,109
We are again in trouble.

2155
01:53:01,317 --> 01:53:03,027
Can you help us at all?

2156
01:53:03,236 --> 01:53:05,363
- No, I'm afraid I cannot.

2157
01:53:05,572 --> 01:53:06,906
What were the facts?

2158
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:09,159
We're all mad, more or
less, you know, these days.

2159
01:53:09,367 --> 01:53:11,035
- The facts are that
our sister has been

2160
01:53:11,244 --> 01:53:13,455
in England three days
and won't see us.

2161
01:53:13,663 --> 01:53:16,082
She's forbidden the bankers
to give us her address.

2162
01:53:16,291 --> 01:53:18,501
She refuses to
answer any questions.

2163
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:21,212
All we have are these telegrams.

2164
01:53:21,421 --> 01:53:24,257
- And you want to get
hold of her, is that it?

2165
01:53:24,466 --> 01:53:25,466
- Well, yes.

2166
01:53:27,385 --> 01:53:28,665
- It's perfectly easy, Margaret.

2167
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:30,472
She wants her books, yes?

2168
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,807
Send her after them,
to Howards End.

2169
01:53:33,016 --> 01:53:34,809
When she's there,
you just stroll in.

2170
01:53:35,018 --> 01:53:37,138
If there's nothing wrong
with her, so much the better.

2171
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:39,772
But remember, the motor
will be around the corner.

2172
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:41,292
We quite simply run
her up to London

2173
01:53:41,316 --> 01:53:42,901
to a specialist, no time at all.

2174
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:44,486
- That's impossible.

2175
01:53:44,694 --> 01:53:47,071
- [Henry] Why is it impossible?

2176
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,616
- Because Helen and I, we...

2177
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:55,997
don't speak that particular
language, if you see my meaning.

2178
01:53:56,206 --> 01:53:57,486
- Yes, because
you have scruples,

2179
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:00,126
and it's all very well,
and I understand perfectly.

2180
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:03,213
I'm as scrupulous as
any man alive, I hope.

2181
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,089
But when it is a case like this,

2182
01:54:05,298 --> 01:54:06,799
when it is a
question of madness—

2183
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,178
- You said yourself.

2184
01:54:10,386 --> 01:54:13,890
- It's madness when I say
it but not when you say it.

2185
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:17,602
- Pater, you may as well
keep Howards End out of it.

2186
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,103
- Why, Charles?

2187
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:23,250
- Well, the whole house
is at sixes and sevens.

2188
01:54:23,274 --> 01:54:25,360
We don't want any more mess.

2189
01:54:26,611 --> 01:54:27,987
- And who is we?

2190
01:54:29,948 --> 01:54:31,950
Pray, Charles, who is we?

2191
01:54:33,535 --> 01:54:35,370
- Beg your pardon, I'm sure.

2192
01:54:35,578 --> 01:54:38,623
I seem always to be intruding.

2193
01:54:38,831 --> 01:54:40,708
- No, Charles, Charles!

2194
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,881
- Then let's send a telegram.

2195
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:50,218
Come along, let's do it.

2196
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,226
I really can't have this
sort of behavior, Charles.

2197
01:54:58,434 --> 01:54:59,434
- What?

2198
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:01,479
- Margaret, she's
far too sweet-natured

2199
01:55:01,688 --> 01:55:04,065
to mind, but I mind for her.

2200
01:55:12,282 --> 01:55:14,158
- [Margaret] All your
books now at Howards End.

2201
01:55:14,367 --> 01:55:17,704
Ms. Avery will let you
in 3pm Monday, Meg.

2202
01:55:19,998 --> 01:55:21,541
- Our main object
is not to frighten

2203
01:55:21,749 --> 01:55:24,043
Ms. Schlegel, you understand?

2204
01:55:24,252 --> 01:55:27,255
Trouble seems to be nervous,
wouldn't you say so, Margaret?

2205
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,882
- Would you say she was normal?

2206
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:32,135
- Well, she's always
been highly strung.

2207
01:55:32,343 --> 01:55:35,847
Musical, literary,
artistic but quite normal,

2208
01:55:36,055 --> 01:55:38,224
quite a charming girl, really.

2209
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:40,893
- Would you say there
was anything congenital?

2210
01:55:41,102 --> 01:55:42,145
- No, no.

2211
01:55:42,353 --> 01:55:43,771
- Or anything hereditary?

2212
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,980
- No.

2213
01:56:02,165 --> 01:56:03,291
Margaret?

2214
01:56:03,499 --> 01:56:07,962
- Yes, Henry, just wait
here just for a second.

2215
01:56:08,171 --> 01:56:10,173
Oh, my darling, quickly, quickly

2216
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:13,635
just get inside
please, just quickly.

2217
01:56:13,843 --> 01:56:16,179
- Ms. Schlegel is managing.

2218
01:56:16,387 --> 01:56:17,972
You can go back to the motor.

2219
01:56:18,181 --> 01:56:19,349
Margaret?

2220
01:56:19,557 --> 01:56:21,768
- Henry, Henry I shall surely
need your advice later,

2221
01:56:21,976 --> 01:56:23,603
but now I must be
alone with Helen.

2222
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:25,146
- Certainly.

2223
01:56:25,355 --> 01:56:26,832
- [Margaret] Yes, please,
my dear, kind Henry.

2224
01:56:26,856 --> 01:56:27,440
- Yes.

2225
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:28,649
- Thank you.

2226
01:56:34,614 --> 01:56:37,367
(engine rumbling)

2227
01:56:47,293 --> 01:56:48,670
- Where are all our furniture?

2228
01:56:48,878 --> 01:56:51,381
- Ah, there's been a mistake.

2229
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:55,718
- How well the carpet fits.

2230
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:57,220
I'll be sending
some milk 'round,

2231
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,263
and we should be ordering coals.

2232
01:56:59,472 --> 01:57:00,866
- There's been a
mistake, Ms. Avery.

2233
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:02,183
You've been very
kind, but we are

2234
01:57:02,392 --> 01:57:03,535
not going to live
at Howards End.

2235
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:05,269
This is not our house.

2236
01:57:10,483 --> 01:57:13,403
I think she may be
a little touched.

2237
01:57:15,029 --> 01:57:16,489
I'm sorry, Helen.

2238
01:57:17,615 --> 01:57:18,991
I ought not to have—

2239
01:57:21,869 --> 01:57:23,329
- We thought you were ill.

2240
01:57:23,538 --> 01:57:24,556
- As you see, I'm not ill, but

2241
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:27,709
I'm expecting a child in June.

2242
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:28,917
Is the coast clear?

2243
01:57:29,043 --> 01:57:30,086
I must leave.

2244
01:57:30,294 --> 01:57:32,171
I'm going back to
Germany in the morning.

2245
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:34,215
Give my love to Aunt
Juley and to Tibby.

2246
01:57:34,424 --> 01:57:35,007
- Let me get that.

2247
01:57:35,216 --> 01:57:36,467
- Don't.

2248
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:40,388
It's curious, isn't it,
that our carpet fits?

2249
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:43,266
Yes, the sword looks right too.

2250
01:57:44,267 --> 01:57:45,560
- Yes, doesn't it?

2251
01:57:51,357 --> 01:57:53,109
Someone's polished it.

2252
01:57:53,317 --> 01:57:54,317
- Yes.

2253
01:57:56,654 --> 01:57:58,030
I'll carry this.

2254
01:58:02,493 --> 01:58:03,762
Even if you didn't
want to tell me

2255
01:58:03,786 --> 01:58:05,371
because of Henry,
I understand that.

2256
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:07,248
- I thought I had
to be by myself.

2257
01:58:07,457 --> 01:58:09,625
That's why I hid
away in Germany.

2258
01:58:09,834 --> 01:58:11,294
- What about Tibby?

2259
01:58:11,502 --> 01:58:14,297
- You know, Meg, really, I
alone must be responsible

2260
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:18,968
for myself and this
child, and I want to be.

2261
01:58:19,177 --> 01:58:21,137
Of course, Leonard doesn't know.

2262
01:58:21,345 --> 01:58:22,345
- Leonard?

2263
01:58:24,307 --> 01:58:25,349
Leonard Bast?

2264
01:58:26,809 --> 01:58:27,518
- Yes.

2265
01:58:27,727 --> 01:58:28,811
(gasps)

2266
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,064
Oh, Meg, did you ever
hear from him again?

2267
01:58:35,485 --> 01:58:39,322
(sighs) I have no idea
what he's doing now

2268
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:42,617
or what's happened
to either of them.

2269
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,415
- Dolly.

2270
01:58:49,624 --> 01:58:51,584
- Hello.
- [Dolly] Hello.

2271
01:58:53,586 --> 01:58:56,005
- My dear, I must ask you.

2272
01:58:56,214 --> 01:58:58,382
Was your sister
wearing a wedding ring?

2273
01:58:58,591 --> 01:58:59,591
- No.

2274
01:58:59,634 --> 01:59:00,634
- What?

2275
01:59:00,676 --> 01:59:01,676
- No.

2276
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,932
Henry, I really came just to
ask a favor about Howards End.

2277
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,308
- Yes, one point at a time.

2278
01:59:07,517 --> 01:59:08,726
Please, sit down.

2279
01:59:11,437 --> 01:59:12,437
Margaret,

2280
01:59:14,273 --> 01:59:18,361
I must now ask you for
the name of her seducer.

2281
01:59:18,569 --> 01:59:19,362
You may have some inkling, and

2282
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,113
the slightest hint
would help us.

2283
01:59:21,322 --> 01:59:22,406
- Us, who is "us"?

2284
01:59:22,615 --> 01:59:23,783
- Hmm?

2285
01:59:23,991 --> 01:59:27,203
Well, I thought it
best to ring Charles.

2286
01:59:27,411 --> 01:59:29,455
- That was unnecessary.

2287
01:59:29,664 --> 01:59:31,582
- My dear, listen to me.

2288
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:35,253
Charles and I wish to act in
your sister's best interests.

2289
01:59:35,461 --> 01:59:38,506
It's still not too
late to clear her name.

2290
01:59:38,714 --> 01:59:41,801
- What are we to make
her seducer marry her?

2291
01:59:42,009 --> 01:59:44,428
But Henry, suppose he turned
out to be married already?

2292
01:59:44,637 --> 01:59:46,722
One has heard of such cases.

2293
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:56,566
- Then he must pay heavily for
his misconduct, mustn't he?

2294
01:59:56,774 --> 01:59:58,067
Now, stay calm.

2295
02:00:01,654 --> 02:00:03,447
I want to talk to you.

2296
02:00:03,656 --> 02:00:05,491
Listen to me, Margaret.

2297
02:00:07,535 --> 02:00:08,535
Come here.

2298
02:00:09,787 --> 02:00:11,497
Look at me.

2299
02:00:11,706 --> 02:00:13,040
What's the matter?

2300
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:17,460
Hmm?

2301
02:00:17,503 --> 02:00:19,380
- May I ask you my question now?

2302
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:20,590
- Certainly.

2303
02:00:20,798 --> 02:00:22,383
- Tomorrow Helen
goes to Germany.

2304
02:00:22,592 --> 02:00:23,175
- Yes.

2305
02:00:23,384 --> 02:00:24,427
- I'm fine.

2306
02:00:24,635 --> 02:00:26,220
Tonight. With your permission—

2307
02:00:27,722 --> 02:00:30,683
- She would like to
sleep at Howards End.

2308
02:00:32,143 --> 02:00:33,769
- (chuckles) But
why at Howards End?

2309
02:00:33,978 --> 02:00:34,687
I don't understand.

2310
02:00:34,896 --> 02:00:36,522
- It is an odd request, but you

2311
02:00:36,731 --> 02:00:38,274
know what women
in her state are.

2312
02:00:38,482 --> 02:00:40,401
- Yes, I could
understand if it were

2313
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:42,278
her own home
associations and so on,

2314
02:00:42,486 --> 02:00:44,488
but Helen has no associations
with Howards End.

2315
02:00:44,697 --> 02:00:46,490
I don't see why she
wants to stay there.

2316
02:00:46,699 --> 02:00:48,034
She'll only catch cold anyway.

2317
02:00:48,242 --> 02:00:51,078
- Call it fancy,
but she wants to.

2318
02:00:51,287 --> 02:00:52,330
- I don't understand.

2319
02:00:52,538 --> 02:00:53,640
If she wants to sleep
there one night,

2320
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:54,290
she'll want to sleep there two.

2321
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:55,578
- [Margaret] No, no, just—

2322
02:00:56,626 --> 02:00:57,906
- But that matters so very much?

2323
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,280
- [Henry] But of
course it would—

2324
02:01:00,296 --> 02:01:01,797
Howards End for this one night.

2325
02:01:02,006 --> 02:01:03,257
I shall stay with her

2326
02:01:03,466 --> 02:01:04,776
- No, that's quite impossible
and that's madness.

2327
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,069
I want you here to meet Charles.

2328
02:01:06,093 --> 02:01:07,470
- What has Charles
to do with this?

2329
02:01:07,678 --> 02:01:09,518
- Margaret, as the future
owner of Howards End,

2330
02:01:09,555 --> 02:01:10,699
it has everything
to do with Charles.

2331
02:01:10,723 --> 02:01:11,849
- [Margaret] In what way?

2332
02:01:12,058 --> 02:01:13,643
Please answer me, Henry.

2333
02:01:13,851 --> 02:01:14,560
- [Henry] You're
forgetting yourself.

2334
02:01:14,769 --> 02:01:15,829
There's Dolly and the servants.

2335
02:01:15,853 --> 02:01:16,979
- [Margaret] In what way?

2336
02:01:17,188 --> 02:01:18,665
Would Helen's condition
depreciate the property?

2337
02:01:18,689 --> 02:01:19,774
- Margaret!

2338
02:01:20,816 --> 02:01:23,402
(baby cooing)

2339
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:25,904
Margaret.

2340
02:01:31,202 --> 02:01:33,079
I shall do what I
can for your sister,

2341
02:01:33,287 --> 02:01:35,623
but I cannot treat it as
if nothing has happened.

2342
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:38,031
I should be forced from my
position in society if I did.

2343
02:01:38,209 --> 02:01:40,002
- Tomorrow, she
will go to Germany

2344
02:01:40,211 --> 02:01:42,672
and trouble society no longer.

2345
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,717
Tonight, she asks to
sleep in your empty house.

2346
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:49,053
May she?

2347
02:01:49,261 --> 02:01:51,681
Will you give my sister leave?

2348
02:01:51,889 --> 02:01:53,516
Will you forgive her,

2349
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:59,563
as you yourself
have been forgiven?

2350
02:01:59,772 --> 02:02:00,856
- As I myself have been—

2351
02:02:04,694 --> 02:02:06,445
- Your sister can
sleep at the hotel.

2352
02:02:06,654 --> 02:02:07,923
I have my children
and the memory

2353
02:02:07,947 --> 02:02:10,282
of my dear wife to consider.

2354
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:13,661
- You have mentioned
Mrs. Wilcox.

2355
02:02:13,869 --> 02:02:16,622
In reply, may I
mention Mrs. Bast?

2356
02:02:19,667 --> 02:02:20,418
- You have not been
yourself all day—

2357
02:02:22,211 --> 02:02:23,212
You have had a mistress.

2358
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:24,005
I forgave you.

2359
02:02:24,213 --> 02:02:25,506
My sister has a lover.

2360
02:02:25,715 --> 02:02:27,591
You drive her from the house!

2361
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,640
Why can you not be honest
for once in your life

2362
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,889
and say to yourself, "What
Helen has done, I have done"?

2363
02:02:39,103 --> 02:02:41,397
- I repeat what I said before.

2364
02:02:41,605 --> 02:02:45,609
I do not give your sister
leave to sleep at Howards End.

2365
02:02:45,818 --> 02:02:47,653
Now, do you understand?

2366
02:02:56,162 --> 02:02:58,581
(bell tolling)

2367
02:02:58,789 --> 02:03:00,458
- If a man played
about with my sister,

2368
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:01,876
I'd send a bullet through him,

2369
02:03:02,084 --> 02:03:07,298
but I suppose you're sunk too
deep in books and rubbish.

2370
02:03:07,506 --> 02:03:09,216
Do you mind what
happens to your sister?

2371
02:03:09,425 --> 02:03:10,745
- As a matter of
fact, I mind very

2372
02:03:10,885 --> 02:03:13,345
much what happens to my sister,

2373
02:03:13,554 --> 02:03:16,432
but I have a different way
of expressing it from yours,

2374
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:17,975
not to speak of
different manners.

2375
02:03:18,184 --> 02:03:20,728
- By Jove, I'm glad of my way!

2376
02:03:22,605 --> 02:03:23,999
I'm glad that my
father never sent me

2377
02:03:24,023 --> 02:03:27,568
to the varsity if this is
what they teach you here.

2378
02:03:27,777 --> 02:03:31,947
Look, you must know something
of your sister's life.

2379
02:03:33,365 --> 02:03:34,992
Do you know of anyone?

2380
02:03:35,201 --> 02:03:35,785
- No.

2381
02:03:35,993 --> 02:03:37,703
- Whom do you suspect?

2382
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:43,626
Did she mention anyone by name?

2383
02:03:43,834 --> 02:03:44,834
Come on, yes or no.

2384
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,586
You're hiding something, man.

2385
02:03:45,795 --> 02:03:47,129
Speak up.

2386
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:49,107
- She did mention some
friend called Leonard Bast.

2387
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:50,758
- Leonard Bast, eh?

2388
02:03:52,968 --> 02:03:55,304
Leonard Bast, do you know him?

2389
02:03:56,972 --> 02:04:00,476
Have you had any
dealings with him?

2390
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:02,561
Oh, what a family.

2391
02:04:02,770 --> 02:04:03,771
What a family!

2392
02:04:03,979 --> 02:04:05,356
God help the poor pater.

2393
02:04:05,564 --> 02:04:08,442
- I'd say God help
my poor sisters.

2394
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,424
- [Annie] Admiring isn't
purchasing, you know.

2395
02:04:14,448 --> 02:04:15,926
- [Deliveryman] But they
were ordered on approval.

2396
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:17,034
- Excuse me.

2397
02:04:17,243 --> 02:04:17,618
- [Annie] We do not
accept things on approval.

2398
02:04:17,827 --> 02:04:18,828
- Excuse me.

2399
02:04:19,036 --> 02:04:21,914
- [Annie] Wait.
- [Deliveryman] Ma'am.

2400
02:04:22,123 --> 02:04:24,834
- [Leonard] Excuse me, I was
looking for Ms. Schlegel.

2401
02:04:25,042 --> 02:04:26,168
- It's...

2402
02:04:26,377 --> 02:04:27,044
- Leonard Bast, I used
to call at Wickham Place.

2403
02:04:27,253 --> 02:04:28,838
Is Ms. Schlegel in?

2404
02:04:29,046 --> 02:04:30,046
Or Mrs. Wilcox?

2405
02:04:30,089 --> 02:04:31,799
- They're all down
at Howards End.

2406
02:04:32,007 --> 02:04:34,176
- Where would that
be now, Howards End?

2407
02:04:34,385 --> 02:04:37,596
- It's at Hilton,
near Hilton Junction.

2408
02:04:38,848 --> 02:04:40,182
Are you all right?

2409
02:04:41,642 --> 02:04:42,268
Let me get you a drink of water.

2410
02:04:42,476 --> 02:04:43,811
- No, thank you.

2411
02:04:47,857 --> 02:04:48,897
- Please take them, Ma'am.

2412
02:04:48,941 --> 02:04:49,650
This is—

2413
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:59,869
- I don't want you to
conclude that my wife and I

2414
02:05:00,077 --> 02:05:02,371
have had anything
like a quarrel.

2415
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:04,915
She is overwrought, as who
would not be, naturally.

2416
02:05:05,124 --> 02:05:06,124
- Naturally.

2417
02:05:07,626 --> 02:05:09,020
- The question, to
my mind, is connected

2418
02:05:09,044 --> 02:05:12,339
to something far greater, the
rights of property itself.

2419
02:05:12,548 --> 02:05:13,716
- Absolutely.

2420
02:05:13,924 --> 02:05:17,011
- The house is mine and will
one day be yours, Charles.

2421
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:20,556
When I say that I don't want
anyone living at Howards End,

2422
02:05:20,764 --> 02:05:23,225
I mean that no one is
to live at Howards End.

2423
02:05:23,434 --> 02:05:24,619
- Then I take it
tomorrow morning,

2424
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:27,021
I may go up in the motor?
- Mmm.

2425
02:05:28,522 --> 02:05:31,483
Yes, say that you're acting
as my representative,

2426
02:05:31,692 --> 02:05:34,612
and that they must
clear out at once.

2427
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:35,529
You must go to bed now.

2428
02:05:35,738 --> 02:05:36,197
I've kept you up far too late.

2429
02:05:36,405 --> 02:05:38,949
(baby cooing)

2430
02:05:40,201 --> 02:05:42,494
- Can I do anything
for you, sir?

2431
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:43,746
- Hmm?

2432
02:05:43,954 --> 02:05:46,373
No, nothing, thank you, my boy.

2433
02:05:47,625 --> 02:05:48,709
Good night.

2434
02:05:48,918 --> 02:05:50,002
- Night, sir.

2435
02:05:54,965 --> 02:05:56,884
(train rumbling)

2436
02:05:57,092 --> 02:05:58,844
(groans)

2437
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:06,602
- It's only the train.

2438
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:13,192
(train whistle blows)

2439
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:16,946
(dramatic orchestral music)

2440
02:06:41,136 --> 02:06:44,014
(train rumbling)

2441
02:06:54,233 --> 02:06:57,486
Len, have you got
that pain again, Len?

2442
02:07:01,365 --> 02:07:02,574
You're all dressed!

2443
02:07:02,783 --> 02:07:05,244
- I'm just going out for a bit.

2444
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:09,248
- What ho, Len.

2445
02:07:09,456 --> 02:07:11,166
- What ho, Jacky.

2446
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:13,502
See you again later.

2447
02:07:13,711 --> 02:07:16,880
(train whistle blows)

2448
02:07:24,054 --> 02:07:28,058
(mysterious orchestral music)

2449
02:07:32,104 --> 02:07:34,773
(dogs barking)

2450
02:07:41,947 --> 02:07:44,700
(wheels rattling)

2451
02:08:14,313 --> 02:08:17,441
(train whistle blows)

2452
02:08:38,754 --> 02:08:41,131
(horn honking)

2453
02:08:55,813 --> 02:08:57,898
- [Helen] Did you see the dawn?

2454
02:08:58,107 --> 02:08:59,274
And was it wonderful?

2455
02:08:59,483 --> 02:09:00,192
- [Leonard] No.

2456
02:09:00,401 --> 02:09:01,693
(Helen and Margaret laughing)

2457
02:09:01,902 --> 02:09:03,153
It was only gray.

2458
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,691
[Leonard] Excuse me, could
you direct me to Howards End?

2459
02:09:23,715 --> 02:09:25,467
- This is Howards End.

2460
02:09:36,687 --> 02:09:38,981
- Yes, thank you
very much, Charles.

2461
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:42,401
There are two boxes
of books in the...

2462
02:09:48,198 --> 02:09:53,036
- Ms. Schlegel, Mrs. Wilcox,
you'll have forgotten me.

2463
02:09:53,245 --> 02:09:56,457
- No, Mr. Bast, I have
not forgotten you.

2464
02:09:58,041 --> 02:10:00,544
- I only want to know where
your sister is, where Helen is.

2465
02:10:00,752 --> 02:10:01,336
- [Charles] Who is it?

2466
02:10:01,545 --> 02:10:02,545
- Helen?

2467
02:10:04,506 --> 02:10:05,506
- Leonard!

2468
02:10:07,384 --> 02:10:09,970
- Oh, so this is Leonard Bast.

2469
02:10:11,305 --> 02:10:12,931
This is for insulting
the name of woman.

2470
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:14,140
(slaps)
(screams)

2471
02:10:14,183 --> 02:10:15,601
Get me a stick,
Margaret, a stick.

2472
02:10:15,809 --> 02:10:17,370
- Charles, we are perfectly
capable of dealing with this.

2473
02:10:17,394 --> 02:10:17,978
(metal rings)

2474
02:10:18,187 --> 02:10:19,188
(screams)

2475
02:10:19,396 --> 02:10:20,396
- Get back!

2476
02:10:22,524 --> 02:10:23,524
Stand up!

2477
02:10:23,692 --> 02:10:24,443
- [Women] Charles!

2478
02:10:24,651 --> 02:10:25,360
- Stand up!

2479
02:10:25,569 --> 02:10:26,569
- Stop it, Charles!

2480
02:10:26,612 --> 02:10:30,157
(dramatic orchestral music)

2481
02:10:48,008 --> 02:10:49,235
- [Henry] So it is your opinion

2482
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:52,054
that he was in the last
stages of heart disease?

2483
02:10:52,262 --> 02:10:53,462
- It would not be professional

2484
02:10:53,555 --> 02:10:57,184
to say so before an
autopsy, but in private,

2485
02:10:57,392 --> 02:10:59,937
that could well be my diagnosis.

2486
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,373
Obviously, he was
in the last stage

2487
02:11:02,397 --> 02:11:04,816
because the moment I touched him

2488
02:11:05,025 --> 02:11:06,568
with the sword, he
simply crumpled up.

2489
02:11:06,777 --> 02:11:10,489
- Excuse me, sir, what
sword would that have been?

2490
02:11:10,697 --> 02:11:12,866
- Well, it's inside.

2491
02:11:13,075 --> 02:11:14,910
You'd better follow me.

2492
02:11:23,043 --> 02:11:26,046
It's their father's
old German sword.

2493
02:11:27,339 --> 02:11:30,217
Course, I only touched
him with the flat of it.

2494
02:11:30,425 --> 02:11:31,134
- Just once?

2495
02:11:31,343 --> 02:11:33,595
- Yes, once, perhaps twice.

2496
02:11:37,516 --> 02:11:40,394
- I presume you will be staying
in Hilton, Mr. Wilcox, sir?

2497
02:11:40,602 --> 02:11:41,603
- Ah, yes, yes,

2498
02:11:41,812 --> 02:11:45,148
I'll be available as long
as is necessary.

2499
02:11:45,190 --> 02:11:47,693
- And, Mr. Charles
Wilcox, we shall be

2500
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:51,655
requesting your presence
at the inquest, sir.

2501
02:11:51,863 --> 02:11:53,103
- Yes, well, I did expect that.

2502
02:11:53,282 --> 02:11:57,244
I shall naturally be the
most important witness.

2503
02:11:59,621 --> 02:12:02,541
(somber piano music)

2504
02:12:36,742 --> 02:12:37,742
- Margaret?

2505
02:12:43,498 --> 02:12:44,642
- Good, Henry, I
was going to come

2506
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:46,460
up to Hilton to give you these.

2507
02:12:46,668 --> 02:12:48,788
- [Henry] Yes, I have something
to tell you, Margaret.

2508
02:12:48,837 --> 02:12:50,597
- Never mind, Henry, I
don't need to hear it.

2509
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:51,840
I'm leaving you.

2510
02:12:52,049 --> 02:12:53,675
My life is with Helen now.

2511
02:12:53,884 --> 02:12:55,302
- Yes.

2512
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:57,054
I'm extremely tired.

2513
02:12:58,555 --> 02:13:00,932
Come and sit down for a moment.

2514
02:13:02,309 --> 02:13:03,328
- Yes, for a moment, we'll have

2515
02:13:03,352 --> 02:13:04,770
to sit here on the grass then.

2516
02:13:04,978 --> 02:13:05,978
- Yes.

2517
02:13:11,401 --> 02:13:12,569
- Here are your keys.

2518
02:13:12,778 --> 02:13:14,098
We shall be staying
with Ms. Avery

2519
02:13:14,279 --> 02:13:16,198
at the farm 'til we can leave.

2520
02:13:16,406 --> 02:13:18,700
- Yes, where are you going?

2521
02:13:20,619 --> 02:13:21,953
- To Germany.

2522
02:13:22,162 --> 02:13:24,790
We'll start as soon as
possible after the inquest.

2523
02:13:24,998 --> 02:13:25,999
- After the inquest.

2524
02:13:26,208 --> 02:13:27,560
- [Margaret] If
Helen is well enough.

2525
02:13:27,584 --> 02:13:31,213
- You realize what the
verdict will be, don't you?

2526
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:33,006
- Yes, heart disease.

2527
02:13:34,383 --> 02:13:37,010
- No, manslaughter,
if not worse.

2528
02:13:38,553 --> 02:13:40,347
Charles may go to prison.

2529
02:13:40,555 --> 02:13:42,349
I dare not tell him.

2530
02:13:43,392 --> 02:13:45,352
I don't know what to do.

2531
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:49,439
I don't know what to do.

2532
02:13:50,607 --> 02:13:52,609
(sobs)

2533
02:13:52,818 --> 02:13:55,237
(sniffles)

2534
02:13:55,445 --> 02:13:56,445
I'm sorry.

2535
02:13:58,490 --> 02:14:01,743
(somber orchestral music)

2536
02:15:32,626 --> 02:15:34,336
Now, is this going
to suit everyone?

2537
02:15:34,544 --> 02:15:36,464
Because I don't want you
all coming here later on

2538
02:15:36,671 --> 02:15:39,132
and complaining that
I've been unfair, Paul?

2539
02:15:39,341 --> 02:15:42,427
- Apparently, it's
got to suit us.

2540
02:15:42,636 --> 02:15:44,095
- You've only to speak, my boy,

2541
02:15:44,304 --> 02:15:46,306
and I'll leave the
house to you entirely.

2542
02:15:46,515 --> 02:15:47,867
- Since I have to be at
the business all week,

2543
02:15:47,891 --> 02:15:50,602
I'll find something
that suits me better.

2544
02:15:50,811 --> 02:15:52,251
This place is not
really the country,

2545
02:15:52,312 --> 02:15:55,607
and, well, it's
certainly not the town.

2546
02:15:57,818 --> 02:16:00,195
- Does my arrangement
suit you, Evie?

2547
02:16:00,403 --> 02:16:01,488
- Of course, Father.

2548
02:16:01,696 --> 02:16:03,114
- Good, you, Dolly?

2549
02:16:04,366 --> 02:16:06,451
- I thought Charles
wanted it for the boys,

2550
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:09,412
but last time I saw
him, he said no,

2551
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:10,821
because we can't possibly live

2552
02:16:10,956 --> 02:16:13,208
in this part of England again.

2553
02:16:13,416 --> 02:16:14,769
Charles even says
we ought to change

2554
02:16:14,793 --> 02:16:17,587
our name, but I
can't think what to.

2555
02:16:17,796 --> 02:16:20,549
Wilcox just suits
Charles and me,

2556
02:16:20,757 --> 02:16:23,718
and I can't think
of any other name.

2557
02:16:25,387 --> 02:16:26,387
- Yes.

2558
02:16:27,597 --> 02:16:30,517
Then I leave Howards End
to my wife absolutely.

2559
02:16:30,725 --> 02:16:33,436
Let everyone understand
that, and after I'm dead,

2560
02:16:33,645 --> 02:16:36,815
let there be no jealousy
and no surprise.

2561
02:16:37,023 --> 02:16:39,359
In consequence, I
leave my wife no money,

2562
02:16:39,568 --> 02:16:41,486
that is her own wish, and all my

2563
02:16:41,695 --> 02:16:45,490
other assets are to
be divided among you.

2564
02:16:45,699 --> 02:16:47,534
This house, Howards
End, she intends,

2565
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:49,452
at her death, to
leave to her nephew.

2566
02:16:49,661 --> 02:16:53,415
(dramatic orchestral music)

2567
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,335
- [Helen] Whoop!

2568
02:16:57,544 --> 02:17:00,005
(baby coos)

2569
02:17:00,213 --> 02:17:01,506
- It does seem curious.

2570
02:17:01,715 --> 02:17:03,475
Mrs. Wilcox wanted
Margaret to have Howards—

2571
02:17:04,801 --> 02:17:07,137
- And now she gets it after all.

2572
02:17:07,345 --> 02:17:08,054
- Dolly.

2573
02:17:08,263 --> 02:17:10,307
- Did I put my foot in it?

2574
02:17:18,315 --> 02:17:18,982
- Hmm?

2575
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:20,190
Yeah, yeah.

2576
02:17:27,866 --> 02:17:29,266
- Come on, let's
get out of the way.

2577
02:17:29,326 --> 02:17:31,536
Tom, Tom, take baby's hand.

2578
02:17:38,752 --> 02:17:41,129
Oh, look, what's over there?

2579
02:17:42,714 --> 02:17:44,466
I wonder what it is.

2580
02:17:45,926 --> 02:17:47,719
- Oh, it's a sweet child,

2581
02:17:47,928 --> 02:17:49,679
rather like Didums
was at that age.

2582
02:17:49,888 --> 02:17:51,640
- Come along, Dolly.

2583
02:17:55,602 --> 02:17:56,787
- [Margaret] Safe journey.
- [Helen] Goodbye.

2584
02:17:56,811 --> 02:17:58,605
- Is it trapped?

2585
02:17:58,813 --> 02:18:02,067
Come on, it's time away
we came from the jungle.

2586
02:18:02,275 --> 02:18:04,736
Look, look who's there, look!

2587
02:18:09,824 --> 02:18:11,576
- What did Dolly mean
about Howards End?

2588
02:18:11,785 --> 02:18:12,785
- Hmm?

2589
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:16,706
My poor Ruth, during
her last days,

2590
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:20,251
scribbled your name
on a piece of paper.

2591
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:24,881
Knowing her not to be
herself, I set it aside.

2592
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:27,008
Didn't do wrong, did I?

2593
02:18:27,217 --> 02:18:27,801
There, they're off.

2594
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:29,260
(engine rumbling)

2595
02:18:29,469 --> 02:18:30,929
There they go, bye.

2596
02:18:32,931 --> 02:18:34,015
Bye.

2597
02:18:34,224 --> 02:18:37,769
(dramatic orchestral music)

2598
02:19:10,635 --> 02:19:14,097
(lilting orchestral music)
