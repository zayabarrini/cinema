1
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,500
Birchfield County Sheriff Emergency.

2
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,000
- I'm reporting a girl in trouble.
- May I have your name, please?

3
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,130
Listen, a girl's in trouble, okay?
It's the Mill, the bar on Mill Road.

4
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,400
- Sir, I must have your name.
- Listen to me, goddamn it!

5
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,510
Stop!

6
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,680
There's a rape! Three or four guys.
I don't know. There's a whole crowd!

7
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,660
- I will send someone down.
- Send somebody!

8
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,340
Raise your chin.

9
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,780
What kind of contraceptive
do you normally use?

10
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,110
IUD.

11
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,710
- When was your last period?
- Show me your hands, please.

12
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,350
Ten, twelve days.
Bad cramps.

13
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,730
- What's your usual cycle?
- Turn around. Raise your gown.

14
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,230
Twenty-six, twenty-seven days.

15
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,070
Are you gonna examine me?

16
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,870
- Your leg.
- I need some more history first.

17
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,130
Your leg, please.

18
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,800
Before the incident,
when was your last intercourse?

19
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,370
- Turn around, lower your gown.
- A while.

20
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,110
- Can you be more specific?
- Please lower your gown.

21
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,580
- Two weeks.
- Are you sure?

22
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,090
Yeah.

23
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,420
Sarah, have you ever had
a venereal disease?

24
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm Carol Honnicut
from the Rape Center.

25
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,010
Is there anyone
you'd like me to call?

26
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,360
Well, I'm here to help...

27
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,360
so if there's anything I can do,
let me know, okay?

28
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,140
Try to relax.

29
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,270
You're tensing. Easy.

30
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,440
Breathe deeply for me.

31
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,740
Easy.

32
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,290
One more. Hold on.

33
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,630
- I'm gonna comb for hairs, Sarah.
- Not yours. Theirs.

34
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,440
Now, let's get you down.

35
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,110
I want to scrape under your nails
in case you scratched one of them.

36
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,000
Sarah, this is Kathryn Murphy.

37
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,000
She'll be the deputy
district attorney for your case.

38
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,840
You can take a shower now,
and a douche.

39
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,320
The ladies room
is down the hall and on your left.

40
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,960
I brought you something to wear.

41
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,860
I hope you don't mind gray.

42
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,470
- You got any mouthwash?
- Sure.

43
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,150
- A lot of alcohol.
- Legally drunk.

44
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,150
- And grass too. What else?
- What difference does that make?

45
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,490
- She was raped by three men.
- I'm not a rape counselor.

46
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,150
I'm a prosecutor,
and I have to make a rape case.

47
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,590
Then go prosecute.

48
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,360
I'll wait
in the supervisor's office.

49
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,900
- Murphy?
- 101.

50
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,410
Thank you.

51
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,110
I heard somebody screaming,
and it was me.

52
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,120
Sarah, this is Detective Duncan.

53
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,780
Dunc. How you doing?

54
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,070
Would you recognize any of the men?

55
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,190
The Mill is still open. We'd like
you to go over there with us...

56
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,460
and see if you could make
a positive ID.

57
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,200
We'd be right there with you.

58
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,780
If you want to get them,
I need your help.

59
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,150
Yeah.

60
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,160
Do you recognize
any of your attackers?

61
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,780
Let's go.

62
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,080
The guy in the yellow T-shirt.

63
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,120
Check the back room.

64
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,130
The one in the vest.

65
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,400
Are there any others?

66
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,650
John, could you take her
out to my car, please?

67
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,190
I'll be there in a minute.

68
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,760
I'm Kathryn Murphy, deputy district
attorney in Birchfield County.

69
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,240
We have a report of a felony
committed on these premises.

70
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,270
- Felony?
- I have a signed search warrant.

71
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,640
This is Detective Duncan.
He's in charge of the investigation.

72
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,710
Want to turn down the television
so we can talk in peace?

73
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,920
Hey, Polito, how are you doing?

74
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,580
Didn't think I was gonna see you
for a couple of years.

75
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,030
The college one wasn't there.

76
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,680
Kurt, Danny and the college one.

77
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,740
My girlfriend Sally was there.

78
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,150
Bob's the college one. Bob.
Did you go to college?

79
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,630
Oh, yeah, you're a lawyer.
Of course you went.

80
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,770
Turn right here.

81
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Listen, maybe you should
just leave me off here.

82
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,300
You know, 'cause...

83
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,240
'cause he's probably asleep.

84
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,620
He likes to get stoned,
listen to music and fall asleep.

85
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,660
You okay?

86
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,430
Yeah.

87
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,120
My eyes hurt.

88
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,460
- Are you married?
- No. Are you?

89
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,200
My ma was married for ten years,
but he left when I was born.

90
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,140
Are you into astrology at all?

91
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,440
No. No, I'm not.

92
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,450
That's too bad.
I could do your chart for you.

93
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,890
- When were you born?
- 1959.

94
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,460
I sure hope I can wake him up.

95
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,730
You want me to come in with you?

96
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,750
Can I ask you a Question?

97
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,890
Does my face look really bad?

98
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,190
He likes to touch my face.

99
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,880
I wish I knew what to say.

100
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,390
What?

101
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,400
I said, I wish I knew what to say.

102
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Want to take a drive?

103
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,470
Get some air. Go out.

104
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,990
I'll be back in a while.

105
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,300
- Hi. It's me.
- Sarah?

106
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,930
It's awful late.
Is something wrong?

107
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,370
No, nothing's wrong.
No special reason.

108
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
I just figured I'd say hello.

109
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,650
You lost your job?

110
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,210
How's Amos?

111
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,080
- Gone.
- Already?

112
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,620
Thanks a lot, Sarah.

113
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,050
I wasn't making fun of you, Ma.

114
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,120
Are you calling for some money?

115
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,190
No, I don't need any money.
I was just thinking...

116
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,730
I was thinking maybe I'd drive out.
Maybe I'd come out for a week or so.

117
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,770
You're in trouble, right?

118
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,330
No, I'm not in any trouble, Ma.
I just figured...

119
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm going away.

120
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,840
- Where?
- Florida.

121
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,090
That sounds like fun.

122
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,920
Listen, Ma,
you have a good time, okay?

123
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,190
Hey, how's Sadi doing?

124
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,590
She's fine. I just got her
a new flea collar, so...

125
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,630
Will I talk to you soon?

126
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,670
Yeah, real soon.

127
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,470
It's kind of expensive to call.
That's why I don't...

128
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,940
I've got to get up in two hours.

129
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,240
Yeah, all right.

130
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,110
You go back to sleep, Ma.

131
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,580
You take care.

132
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

133
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,760
- It's the one in the green sweater.
- The green sweater.

134
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,370
All right.

135
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,210
All right.

136
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,770
Back up, boys, just a second.
County sheriff. Your name Bob?

137
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,780
- Put your hands on the car.
- For what?

138
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,720
Because you're under arrest.
Put your hands on the car.

139
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,150
- For what?
- Put your hands on the car!

140
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,820
"You have the right
to remain silent.

141
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,330
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

142
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,950
anything you say, can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

143
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,120
You have a right to an attorney
during Questioning."

144
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,530
Paul, call my dad!

145
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,470
"If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.

146
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,000
You have the right
to make one phone call."

147
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,170
Do you understand the rights
I have just read to you?

148
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,140
- Yes.
- Fine. Join us.

149
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,470
We expect to indict
for first-degree felony.

150
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,380
My client has no prior record.

151
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,640
In a crime like this, there's
a risk of the defendants fleeing.

152
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,210
- Your Honor, my client...
- Release him to his family.

153
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,950
This is a crime of extreme violence.
The victim has safety concerns.

154
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,920
$ 10,000 each.

155
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,470
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

156
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,400
- She's not moving in.
- It's only two days.

157
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
That's what you said last time,
and she was here for three months.

158
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,210
Miss.

159
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,610
I ordered this well-done.
It's raw.

160
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm sorry.
I'll have it for you in a minute.

161
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,190
Yeah, and I asked for some ketchup.

162
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,190
I'm just going
a little senile today.

163
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,490
Three men accused of raping
a woman at a local bar...

164
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,760
were released today on $ 10,000 bail.

165
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,630
Lawyers for the accused men
expressed confidence...

166
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,690
that the facts of the case
will reveal...

167
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,400
that the young woman
was not actually raped.

168
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,340
Our defense is simple.
There was no rape.

169
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,840
The so-called victim consented
to all of the alleged acts.

170
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,500
She put on a show, pure and simple.

171
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,210
Thank you, Marcia.

172
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,050
The on-again, off-again debate...

173
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,090
between the five candidates
vying for the council seat...

174
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,450
of Daniel Fine
now appears to be on again.

175
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,930
Representatives for the candidates
met four hours behind closed doors...

176
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,620
All right. Bye.

177
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,630
- Who is it?
- Kathryn Murphy.

178
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,660
Why did you let them out on bail?

179
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,960
I didn't let them out.
It's standard procedure.

180
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,590
Until a jury finds you guilty,
you're free if you can post bail.

181
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,610
The guy on the TV made it sound
like I did a live sex show.

182
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,570
That's not the last time
that that's gonna happen.

183
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,170
May I come in?

184
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,650
Oh, yeah. Come on in.

185
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,980
Sadi, shut up.

186
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,020
The bartender at the Dugout
said you were sick.

187
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,180
You went looking for me?

188
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,660
Well, I had to go to the doctor,
and nobody at work knows.

189
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,820
Come on, Sadi.
You want a seat?

190
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,600
Would you like something to drink?
I could really use a drink.

191
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,640
Thank you, no.

192
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,170
Just to smooth out
the edges a little bit, you know?

193
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,110
Listen, what time were you born?

194
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,140
I already told you
I didn't believe in that astrology.

195
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,080
Oh, so what? I do. What time?

196
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,150
- At night, 7:00, August 9.
- Oh. Where?

197
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,290
Portland. Do you always drink
to smooth out the edges?

198
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,600
Sometimes I'll take a hit of pot.
Why? You want some?

199
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,800
Did you have anything to drink
before you went to the Mill?

200
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,070
Or smoke anything?

201
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,710
Half a joint, a couple beers.
You know, nothing heavy.

202
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,900
- And while you were there?
- I don't know.

203
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,510
I mean, I wasn't
falling-down drunk or anything.

204
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,710
- How were you dressed?
- What's that supposed to mean?

205
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,020
It means were you dressed
provocatively?

206
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,550
Showing a lot of cleavage?
See-through blouse?

207
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,090
What difference does it matter?
They tore it off me!

208
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,420
Did how you dress make those guys
think they could have sex with you?

209
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,450
Did how you dress make those guys
think they could have sex with you?

210
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,330
Did you put on a show?

211
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
What the hell are you talking about?
You saw me at the hospital!

212
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,310
You think I asked for that?
Is that what you think?

213
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,360
If that's what you think,
you get the fuck out of my house!

214
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,380
Why didn't you tell me
that you had a record?

215
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,510
Fuck you!

216
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,480
I ain't got no record.

217
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,680
You want to tell me about it?

218
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,850
All right.

219
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,490
I was helping my girlfriend move
with a U-Haul.

220
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,690
We were going through Jersey,
and we ran into this cop.

221
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,360
He sees we got a busted tail light,
and he pulls us over.

222
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,330
He starts looking through her desk
and stuff she's got in the back...

223
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
and he finds a half gram of coke.

224
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,200
It was her desk.
It wasn't my stuff.

225
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,800
- So why is it still on the books?
- I don't know. You tell me!

226
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,710
I mean, my record
was definitely...

227
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,720
- Expunged?
- Yeah, expunged.

228
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,880
Have you ever made love
to more than one man at a time?

229
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,880
What the fuck
kind of Question is that?

230
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,050
It's the kind of Question
you're gonna be asked on the stand.

231
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,930
You're also gonna be asked if a man
has ever hit you and you liked it.

232
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,930
You're also gonna be asked
about your drug bust...

233
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,930
and how many drinks a day you have
to smooth out the edges.

234
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,370
And how many joints.

235
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,430
And how often
you go to bars alone...

236
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,800
and whether or not you wear
underwear when you go to them...

237
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,170
and which diseases you've caught
and how many abortions you've had.

238
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,400
And I will object
to all those Questions.

239
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,540
And sometimes the judge will
sustain me, but sometimes not.

240
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,550
That ain't fair.

241
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,350
You're a witness, and it's the
defense's job to show the jury...

242
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,480
that you're a rotten witness because
you've got a rotten character.

243
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,360
I got a rotten character?

244
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,990
You ain't gonna defend me
because I'm some low-class bimbo?

245
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,660
I didn't say that.

246
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,890
Will those bastards go to jail?

247
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,660
Is that what you want?

248
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,440
I want those motherfuckers
put away forever!

249
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,650
Sarah said that you were here
with her that night.

250
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,480
Yeah, I was here,
but I didn't see what happened.

251
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,150
But if Sarah says she was raped,
she was raped.

252
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,190
Can you identify any of the men
who assaulted her?

253
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,950
No. I was out there.

254
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,160
There were a bunch of guys
blocking the door...

255
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,030
so I really couldn't see.

256
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,660
It was the end of my shift,
so I left while she was still here.

257
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,170
Do you know any of these guys?

258
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,570
There's a bunch of them
that were real rowdy.

259
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,440
You know, yelling, clapping.

260
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,550
I really just thought
she was partying, you know?

261
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,180
Well, is there anyone
that you can identify?

262
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,080
Like how?

263
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,020
Did you notice anything
different about any of them?

264
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,960
Let's say long hair,
beard, moustache?

265
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,460
Birthmark, bandana, jewelry?

266
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,160
- Scar, tattoo?
- Tattoo, yeah.

267
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,400
- Well, can you describe it?
- A scorpion.

268
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,410
This one guy, he had a scorpion.

269
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,310
How many drinks
would you say she'd had?

270
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,320
I don't know.
She was pretty loaded.

271
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,850
She'd just had this big fight
with Larry...

272
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,080
the guy she lives with...

273
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,350
She just needed
to cool out a little.

274
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,750
What do you know about Larry?

275
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,460
Not much, except he's an asshole.

276
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,430
I mean, he says he's a musician,
but he's just a dealer.

277
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,100
And he rides a motorcycle.

278
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,710
Come on, man, give me a break.
These guys are my bread and butter.

279
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,680
You didn't see anyone else?

280
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,210
Some kid I never seen before played
one of the video machines all night.

281
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,190
- Who was with him?
- Nobody I saw.

282
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,230
I'll tell you what, Jesse. I'm gonna
inform the state liquor authority...

283
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,460
and tell them how
you kept serving up booze...

284
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,590
while a violent felony was being
committed in your back room.

285
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,640
- Ready?
- Thanks, Jesse.

286
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,790
We'll talk.

287
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,740
I need these by 11:00.
See you tomorrow.

288
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,380
Is he free?

289
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,690
Game time. Let's go.

290
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,950
Hang on just a second.
I don't believe this.

291
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,660
I really don't believe this.
Tina!

292
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,990
- Where the hell are the tickets?
- Gave them to me to hold.

293
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,870
- How are you doing on Tobias?
- We'll talk about it at the game.

294
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,910
If Charley calls,
I'll be home after 11:00.

295
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:54,110
Hey, ref! Cross-checking!
Open your eyes, will ya!

296
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,980
Take him out, Donovan!
Take him out!

297
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,250
- You two, play hockey!
- Did you see that? Thanks.

298
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,860
Thanks. Now, if I take it
to trial, they'll destroy her.

299
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,260
She walked in there alone,
she got drunk, she got stoned.

300
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,600
She came on to them.
She's got a prior for possession.

301
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,800
- That's inadmissible.
- Penalty.

302
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,930
Sure, it's inadmissible,
but they'll ask her about it.

303
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll object, the judge will sustain
it, but the jury will hear it.

304
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,700
- She's a sitting duck.
- I read her Q and A.

305
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,150
Gang rape on a pinball machine.
It's an ugly case.

306
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,770
Is it winnable?

307
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,510
We understand
that you love to win...

308
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,220
but I can't let you dismiss
just because you don't have a lock.

309
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,350
A lock? I don't have a case.

310
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,750
Her girlfriend didn't see anything.
The bartender didn't see anything.

311
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,490
The others didn't think
anything special was going on.

312
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,360
Now, I got Polito...

313
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,000
but the minute the defense brings up
that he's on probation...

314
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,270
they'll know that we squeezed him.

315
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,310
What about the guy who reported it?

316
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,210
I have his voice on tape...

317
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,040
but we don't know who he is
or where to look for him.

318
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,140
Well, do you believe she was raped?

319
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,050
Yes, but I can't win it.

320
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,580
But they can't walk.
So make a deal and put them away.

321
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,150
- A deal with what?
- You got enough. Go for rape two.

322
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,860
So, any felony, as long
as it's a violent one... assault...

323
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,330
coercion, reckless endangerment,
menacing...

324
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,070
- I can't do that.
- You said she was raped.

325
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,940
So make a deal
and put them away.

326
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,710
I don't care if they only get
six months, just make a deal.

327
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,320
You understand, Mr. Polito,
that you'll be testifying...

328
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,860
before a grand jury and at a trial?

329
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,360
Yeah, I got that.

330
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,560
And you realize that you'll be
testifying against acquaintances?

331
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,730
Yeah.

332
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,070
Have I or anyone
in the sheriff's department...

333
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,070
or anyone in the district
attorney's office...

334
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,270
offered you any inducement
to testify?

335
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,830
Money, gifts, anything?

336
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,310
Thank you, Mr. Polito.

337
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,810
Well, he's just a taste.
The bar was filled with witnesses.

338
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,720
We know who they are, and we
anticipate that they'll all testify.

339
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,280
Anticipate? A hundred says you'll
have to drag them into court.

340
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,990
Another hundred says they'll be
useless because they were too drunk.

341
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,730
Whatever you say.

342
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,460
Keep in mind that we don't need
corroboration to prove rape.

343
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,870
And we do have medical evidence...
No doubt about penetration...

344
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,370
and physical evidence...
no doubt about force.

345
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,500
- What will you take?
- Rape one.

346
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,740
We were thinking more in the line
of, say, sexual abuse two.

347
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,510
Rape one.

348
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,280
Maybe I could convince the judge
not to give them the maximum.

349
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,190
- I'd rather go to trial.
- Fine.

350
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,990
Oh, by the way, no separate deals.

351
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,030
One goes to trial,
all go to trial.

352
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,630
What would you say
to sexual abuse one?

353
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,470
I'd say rape one.

354
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,700
Kathryn, cut the crap.
This guy Polito looks like shit.

355
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,240
If you had anybody better,
you'd have shown us his tape.

356
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,340
And your complaining witness...
She walked into a bar...

357
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,440
got loaded and stoned and did
everything but yank their dicks.

358
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,680
- No jury will buy her.
- What would you say to rape two...

359
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,620
with a recommendation for one year?

360
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,830
I'd say go to hell.

361
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,060
Are you sure you're in a position
to be Quite so adamant?

362
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,160
- A rape trial...
- Is always a gamble.

363
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,860
I agree, Mr. Henley,
and I know your reputation.

364
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,370
But look at these photographs!

365
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,230
This is what the jury will see,
and they'll see the girl too.

366
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,940
And you can't tell it from these,
but she's tiny.

367
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,170
She's the most defenseless-looking
thing you ever saw.

368
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,150
If we go to trial and you lose,
I'm gonna ask for 15 to 25...

369
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,150
and I'll get it.

370
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,750
- Eighteen months.
- Stop dancing.

371
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,380
What's your best offer?

372
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,030
Two to five, rape two.

373
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,330
With luck, your boys will be out
in nine months. That's a gift.

374
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,340
On one condition. I'll accept that
on behalf of my client...

375
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,570
if the formal charge is changed
to one without the sexual element.

376
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,510
He's a kid of 22.
He's an "A" student.

377
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,910
- He's got a future.
- I can't do that.

378
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,750
He won't plead guilty
to a sexual offense.

379
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,060
Assault? Coercion?
Reckless endangerment?

380
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,930
- Malicious...
- Reckless endangerment.

381
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,780
The theft occurred
about 5:30 a. M...

382
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,510
as the woman and her husband
were entering their house.

383
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,920
Three men accused of raping
a young woman at a local bar...

384
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,520
pleaded guilty today to a reduced
charge of reckless endangerment.

385
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,560
They were sentenced to two
and a half to five years in prison.

386
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,570
Neither the district attorney
nor spokesman for the defense...

387
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,000
would officially comment
on the plea bargain.

388
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,830
No explanation was given for
the reduction in the charges...

389
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,900
from rape to reckless endangerment.

390
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,440
A source close to the defense
hinted that it was because...

391
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,450
the young woman who was
the alleged victim in the case...

392
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,610
would not have made
a strong witness for the state.

393
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,510
Oh, come on! You?

394
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,490
- It was red.
- Red?

395
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,820
- Where do you want these?
- There.

396
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,920
I think this looks raw.

397
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,730
- Oh, shit!
- I'll get it.

398
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,770
Thanks.

399
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,700
Here we go. This is an experiment,
so I want you all to be kind.

400
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,200
Excuse me!

401
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,670
You double-crossing bitch!
You sold me out!

402
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,840
Did you see this?
Is this what you did?

403
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,280
- Excuse us.
- I wouldn't make a good witness?

404
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm too fragile.
My past is too Questionable.

405
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,550
I'm a drunk.
I'm a pothead, a drug addict!

406
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,460
I'm some slut that got bounced
around a little bit in a bar, right?

407
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,960
So I didn't get raped, huh?
I never got raped?

408
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,260
- Of course you were raped.
- How come it doesn't say that?

409
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,800
How come it doesn't say,
"Sarah Tobias was raped"?

410
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,800
What the fuck
is reckless endangerment?

411
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,000
It's a felony that carries
the same prison term as rape.

412
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,870
You asked me to put them away,
and that's exactly what I did.

413
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,710
Who the hell are you to decide that
I ain't good enough to be a witness?

414
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,410
I'll bet you if I went to law school
and I didn't live in some dump...

415
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,750
I understand how you feel.
I did my best.

416
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,750
You under...
You don't understand how I feel!

417
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,190
I'm standing there
with my pants down...

418
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,350
and my crotch hung out
for the world to see...

419
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,360
and three guys
are sticking it to me...

420
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,160
and a bunch of other guys
are yelling and clapping...

421
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,570
and you're standing there telling me
that that's the best you can do!

422
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,170
If that's the best you can do,
then your best sucks!

423
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,940
I don't know what you got
for selling me out...

424
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,340
but I sure as shit
hope it's worth it!

425
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,280
Wow. What did you do?

426
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,490
- That looks weird.
- I needed a change.

427
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,170
Hey, it's nothing heavy.
It's just...

428
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,050
I'm not used to it.

429
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,410
Stop. All right? Stop.

430
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,910
When are you gonna get over this?

431
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,640
You'll have to snap out of this
soon, 'cause it's getting boring.

432
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,540
Get out of here.

433
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,130
Fine.

434
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,830
- Be back in a couple hours.
- No!

435
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,110
You get the fuck out
and don't come back.

436
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,900
Shit, you can cut your fucking hair
any way you want.

437
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,040
This is my house,
and I don't want you in it.

438
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,350
- Now, get out.
- Fine. I'm gone.

439
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,940
You caught me.
I'm sorry.

440
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,500
This is gonna sound like crap,
but I seen you somewhere...

441
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,010
You're right. It's crap.

442
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,320
I have seen you. You're a friend
of Johnny Alworth's sister, right?

443
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,970
It was Duck Island. Last
Sunday afternoon, softball game.

444
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,970
Your hair was different.

445
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,510
- Yes. It was longer.
- Look, I live with somebody, okay?

446
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,380
I got it. Sorry.
He's a lucky guy.

447
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,330
You sure you don't
want to go out tonight?

448
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,390
Oh, I got a smile!
Well, it's a start.

449
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,940
Hey, Sexy Sadi, what about it?

450
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,940
I told you,
I live with somebody!

451
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,600
- I don't mind. I'm liberated.
- I do. I mind.

452
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,310
- I do know you, Sexy Sadi.
- You got me mixed up with somebody.

453
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,320
No. You're the girl
from the Mill that night.

454
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,920
I remember Sexy Sadi!

455
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,550
I do know you! Am I right?
Hey, Sexy Sadi!

456
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,390
I know you!
Oh, do I remember you!

457
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,840
Hey, look, lady!

458
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,270
Hey, want to play pinball?

459
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,940
I've always paid my bills!
I'm sick and tired of this!

460
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,980
- There's nothing I can do.
- Come on.

461
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,780
- I'm sorry.
- Come on!

462
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,520
I'm sorry about this.

463
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,580
But I do know
that I did make the payment.

464
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,820
- There's no records?
- The insurance company I paid.

465
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,950
- I just can't find them.
- Well, my husband...

466
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,620
- This is it.
- Come on, babe!

467
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,790
I'll phone you. Thanks.

468
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,100
You can go in now.
Keep it short.

469
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,810
Thanks.

470
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,660
What happened?

471
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,350
- "Want to play pinball?"
- What?

472
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,330
That's what he said.
"You want to play pinball?"

473
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,960
He sees I'm a piece of shit.

474
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,100
Everybody figures
I'm a piece of shit.

475
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,610
Why not?

476
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,620
You told them that. I never
got to tell nobody nothing.

477
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,610
You did all my talking for me.

478
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,720
I don't get it.

479
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,860
I thought you were on my side.

480
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,730
You told me you were on my side.

481
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,330
Why did you do that?

482
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,790
Sorry, Officer, but
it's been one of those days.

483
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,380
My insurance is no good.
I pay all my bills!

484
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,550
My insurance is no good.
I pay all my bills!

485
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,060
- What happens?
- Come on!

486
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,790
I want to tell the officer.

487
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,300
I'm sorry, okay?

488
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,700
- How's your head?
- Oh, great! Just great.

489
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,240
Honey, just wait here.
I'll go get the car.

490
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,470
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry to bother you.

491
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,740
What exactly happened?

492
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,970
Exactly, she rammed my truck.

493
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,140
I was minding my own business.
She drove her car into my truck.

494
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,450
- All right?
- Do you know why?

495
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,150
How do I know why she rammed me?
She's nuts!

496
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,250
- Do you know her?
- No, I don't know her.

497
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,300
She's a whore. Last time I saw her,
she was doing a sex show.

498
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,030
- Come on!
- You watched?

499
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,590
You bet your ass I watched.
She put on a great show.

500
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,530
- I thought she was raped.
- Raped?

501
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,440
She fucked a bar full of guys,
then she blamed them.

502
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,840
Listen, lady, she loved it.
She did the show of her life.

503
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,240
- Come on, move over!
- Honey, do you think...

504
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,220
Next time she does another show,
tell her I'll be there to cheer.

505
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,650
I'd like to report
there's a girl in trouble.

506
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,310
Sir, may I have your name?

507
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,090
There's a girl in trouble
at a bar on Mill Road.

508
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,600
Sir, I'm sorry.
I must have your name.

509
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,360
There's three or four guys.
I don't know.

510
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,490
There's a whole crowd.

511
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,130
There's an assault going on.

512
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,140
There's three or four guys.
I don't know.

513
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,140
There's a whole crowd.

514
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,970
Send somebody, okay?

515
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:41,700
"Or otherwise attempts to persuade
another person to commit a felony."

516
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,530
Please, I know
about criminal solicitation.

517
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,840
But in this case,
it simply doesn't apply.

518
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,740
- It's not the statute's intent.
- Listen again.

519
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,340
"A person is guilty
of criminal solicitation...

520
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,810
if he commands, induces, entreats...

521
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,980
or otherwise attempts to persuade
another person to commit a felony."

522
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,110
You can read it to me
till you're blue in the face.

523
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,350
I am not gonna let you prosecute
a bunch of spectators.

524
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:09,230
They're not spectators.
They solicited the rape.

525
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,430
Do you really want to ask a jury
to lock up a bunch of people...

526
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,690
for clapping and cheering?

527
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,730
Clapping, cheering,
pushing, goading...

528
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,330
getting the rape going
and keeping it going.

529
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,340
What happens if you lose?
You'll look like an incompetent.

530
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,680
If you win, you'll look
like a vengeful bitch.

531
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,720
Either way, you hurt yourself
and you hurt this office.

532
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,690
Now, drop it. You've got
more important things to do.

533
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,980
No, I haven't.

534
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,990
You haven't got more important
things to do...

535
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,120
than go to trial
with a sure loser?

536
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,960
- What the hell has gotten into you?
- We owe her.

537
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,290
Owe her what?
We put the rapists away.

538
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,670
- I owe her.
- I see.

539
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,000
You want to spend my money to put
a bunch of spectators on trial...

540
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,910
a trial you'll lose,
because you owe her!

541
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,040
You don't get to use this office
to pay your debts.

542
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,480
I am gonna try this case,
and you're not gonna stop me.

543
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,520
I'm not?
Kathryn, you're an ace.

544
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,190
You've got a great future.
Don't put it in jeopardy.

545
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,960
What are you gonna do, fire me?
Go right ahead.

546
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,970
My first case will be a civil suit
against the rapists...

547
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,530
the solicitors,
the bar and the state.

548
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,540
And I will show that Sarah Tobias
wound up in the hospital...

549
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,540
because this office sold her out.

550
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,170
I will subpoena your records,
put you on the stand...

551
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,950
and cross-examine you on every
plea bargain this office ever made.

552
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,450
You go try your case!
You have a good time!

553
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,890
Because win or lose,
you're through!

554
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,960
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

555
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,000
I'd like to talk to you.
May I come in?

556
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,170
We got nothing to talk about.

557
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,910
- Yes, we...
- Get outta here!

558
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,180
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- I have to talk to you.

559
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,420
- Get out of my house.
- Will you listen to me, please?

560
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,830
I'm listening.

561
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,290
Sarah, I made a mistake.

562
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,370
Before I agreed to the deal...

563
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,100
I should have offered you
the choice of testifying at a trial.

564
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,340
I can offer that to you now.

565
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,580
I found a way for you to go to court
and testify that you were raped.

566
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,520
- The case is over.
- The rape case, sure.

567
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,350
You made sure of that.

568
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,560
I want to prosecute the others.
The ones who cheered and clapped.

569
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,220
- The ones who made it happen.
- So you can make another deal?

570
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,730
No. I'm not gonna make
any more deals.

571
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,970
If I prosecute the others,
the rapists will stay in jail...

572
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,140
for the full five years,
and the rape will go on record.

573
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,250
The deal won't matter
because the rape will go on record.

574
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,520
You really want to do that?

575
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,720
Only if you help me.
I need you to testify.

576
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,730
- I get to tell my story?
- Yes.

577
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,740
You alone now?

578
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,840
Yeah. I kicked him out.

579
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,220
While I was laid up, he came back
to pick up all his stuff, you know?

580
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,190
What's his is his.
What's mine is his.

581
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,190
- Thank God he left me the radio.
- Anything I can do?

582
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,030
Yeah.

583
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,570
What?

584
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,270
No deals.

585
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,370
No deals.

586
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,410
No deals.

587
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,100
It's Kathryn Murphy.

588
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,970
Listen, I need your help again.

589
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,640
Hey, come on. Cut it out.

590
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,880
- Are these yours?
- Let's play.

591
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,490
- Go play someplace else now, okay?
- Come on, let's go!

592
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,590
- Come over here.
- Okay, I'm coming.

593
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,830
I thought it was all over.

594
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,030
I'm gonna prosecute the ones
that cheered it on.

595
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,540
You said of the guys
blocking your view...

596
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:23,870
that they were real rowdy,
yelling and clapping.

597
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,950
Not the guys at the door.
The ones by the pinball machine.

598
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,050
So you knew that
they were yelling about Sarah?

599
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,050
Yeah, but they aren't the kind of
guys you really want to mess with.

600
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,560
You know what I mean?

601
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,220
Listen, I'd like you to come in
and see if you could identify them.

602
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,500
Oh, Jesus! They're gonna be
right there, aren't they?

603
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,630
- Yes.
- I don't know.

604
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,010
Let's make a date for you to come
into to my office and talk about it.

605
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,310
Sally, she's your friend.

606
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,820
Number two.

607
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,510
Seven.

608
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,910
You positive?

609
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,120
Yes.

610
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,870
Number four, definitely.

611
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,100
Do you believe it?

612
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,680
You can go in now. It's down to
the end of the hall to your right.

613
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,500
There's no purpose in meeting again,
because I'm taking them to trial.

614
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,330
Well, good luck to you too.

615
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,310
- Thank you for coming.
- It's okay.

616
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,710
- There's no need for you to come.
- I figured she needs the company.

617
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,550
Would you mind waiting outside?
Would you please hold my calls?

618
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,560
I'll wait outside.

619
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,920
Sally, why don't you have a seat
right down here, okay?

620
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,220
I want to begin by asking you
a few Questions...

621
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,290
about the night of April 18th.

622
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,990
I'd like you to answer them
as simply and honestly as possible.

623
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,490
A few. Maybe three.

624
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,660
I've seen her drink
a lot more than that.

625
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,000
She needed to get loose. She'd just
had this big fight with her old man.

626
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,010
And she goes,
"I'm so pissed at him"...

627
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,850
'cause she's sure
he's running around on her.

628
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,320
You mean sleeping around, right?

629
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,220
Right. Which I bet he is.

630
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,420
So we were sitting in a booth,
and we were just sort of talking...

631
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,810
There were these two
fraternity guys there.

632
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,910
And Sarah looks
at one of them... Bob.

633
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,020
She goes, "He's cute. Who's he?"
So we started joking around.

634
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,580
What do you mean, joking around?

635
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,020
Well, like what would be
the best way to get back at Larry.

636
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,070
Like should she take this guy home
and do it right in front of him.

637
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,860
You said that
she should take Bob home?

638
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,840
No. She said it. She didn't mean it.
She was just joking around.

639
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:58,270
Well, she'd had a few drinks.
God, she didn't mean it.

640
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,560
- I'll wait for you downstairs.
- Wait a minute.

641
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,930
- I want to talk to you.
- What's going on?

642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,400
- I warned you... no secrets.
- I didn't keep any secrets.

643
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,440
She told me what you said
in the bar when you met Bob.

644
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,200
Do you remember? Do you?

645
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,710
I said I'd like
to take that guy home...

646
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,210
and fuck his brains out
right in front of Larry.

647
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,680
- It was a joke.
- She can't be a witness for you.

648
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,150
In fact, when the defense finds her,
she'll be a witness for them.

649
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,110
What other surprises
have you got waiting for me?

650
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,450
None.

651
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,570
I'm sorry.

652
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,190
Is Jesse around?

653
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,590
No, it's his day off.
Can I get you a drink?

654
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,260
No, thank you.

655
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,210
- Mr. Joyce?
- Hi.

656
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,610
I'm Deputy District Attorney
Kathryn Murphy.

657
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,470
I'd like to talk about April 18.

658
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,040
- The night of the rape at the Mill.
- I don't know anything.

659
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:31,050
Yes, you do, Mr. Joyce. Do you
wanna talk about it over here?

660
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,950
- Sorry, I got a class.
- Your class can wait.

661
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,050
You were there.
Your name is on the video machine.

662
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,560
I'm calling you as a witness.

663
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:40,720
Would you like to sit down
and we can talk about it?

664
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,160
What do you want?
You got the ones who did it.

665
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,560
I'm prosecuting the others...
the ones who cheered them on.

666
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,070
I didn't see a thing.

667
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,070
Yes, you did.

668
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,560
You were in the room all night.

669
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,540
You saw everything.

670
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,670
Those other guys
didn't do anything.

671
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,110
They probably didn't even know
what was going on.

672
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,170
I mean, it was like a show.
Big deal. They watched.

673
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:09,250
If you asked a thousand people,
999 would watch. It's no crime.

674
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,580
They did more than watch,
and that is a crime.

675
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,860
You want to tell me about it?

676
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,460
Look, if you don't tell me now...

677
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:23,260
you're gonna have to tell me
on the witness stand.

678
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:27,500
Why? Why? This isn't my business.
I don't care about this.

679
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,510
Yes, you do.

680
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,910
Birchfield County Emergency.

681
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,140
I'd like to report
this girl in trouble.

682
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,080
Your name, please?

683
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,550
There's a girl in trouble
at the Mill. It's a bar.

684
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:43,720
- I must have your name.
- There's an assault. It's a rape!

685
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,730
There's three or four...

686
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,030
And arriving at the courthouse
is Kathryn Murphy...

687
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,190
the deputy district attorney
in this precedent-setting case.

688
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,930
With her is Sarah Tobias.

689
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
This is our first chance
to see the victim in the case.

690
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,470
Will you put Miss Tobias
on the stand?

691
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,740
- No comment.
- Who else are you putting on?

692
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,140
- No comment.
- Are your friends gonna testify?

693
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:10,740
- Son of a bitch!
- We hear you made a deal.

694
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,410
No comment.

695
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,050
What were you thinking
when it happened?

696
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,590
Are you deaf, asshole?
No comment!

697
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,100
You'll wait here for the officer.
What are you doing here?

698
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,080
Moral support.
Saw Whitewood having breakfast.

699
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:40,170
Seemed in a really good mood.

700
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,010
Good luck, Sarah.

701
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,580
Please come in.

702
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:43,240
Do you swear to tell the truth,
so help you God?

703
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,870
- I do.
- State your name.

704
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:49,210
- Sarah Tobias.
- Please be seated.

705
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,390
Miss Tobias, on the night
of the rape at the Mill...

706
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,890
Objection!

707
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,860
These men are not on trial
for rape.

708
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,070
Your Honor, it is imperative
that the jury understand...

709
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,760
what was happening to Miss Tobias
before, during and after the rape.

710
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:16,170
You may continue your line
of Questioning, but be brief.

711
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,400
Thank you, Your Honor.

712
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,040
Miss Tobias, please tell us what
happened that night at the Mill.

713
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,090
Well, my boyfriend...

714
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,560
My boyfriend and I
had kind of a fight.

715
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:38,760
So I got in my car and drove to see
my girlfriend Sally at the Mill.

716
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:42,830
I figured she'd be getting off
work, and we could talk.

717
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,430
She works there?

718
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,440
Yeah. She's a waitress,
just like me.

719
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,310
So, anyway, she was on a break.

720
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,070
We were sitting
in this booth, talking...

721
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:58,080
and this guy Danny
sent over a couple drinks.

722
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,920
She knew him,
so we took the drinks.

723
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:04,180
He sat down, and...

724
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,020
we started talking.

725
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,360
And he was funny.

726
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,400
You know, he had a line.

727
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,330
So what happened next?

728
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:23,110
A bunch of guys went
into the back room to play pinball.

729
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,640
So me and Danny went in and started
playing with this guy Bob.

730
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:32,150
And after I finished my turn,
I went to smoke.

731
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,520
You know, smoke a little pot.

732
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,320
And...

733
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:40,860
Somebody put money
into the jukebox...

734
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:44,160
and this song I really liked
came on the jukebox.

735
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,130
So I started to dance.

736
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,800
And then Danny comes up...

737
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,970
and he starts dancing with me...

738
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,840
real close, you know,
tight, close.

739
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,640
And then he kissed me.

740
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,880
I'm sorry, Miss Tobias.
Could you please speak up?

741
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,490
He kissed me.

742
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,750
Did you try to stop him?

743
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,620
No. I let him kiss me,
because I figured...

744
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,530
he was drunk and stoned and that he
would kiss me and leave me alone.

745
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,130
And then he...

746
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,900
put his hand up my shirt
and grabbed at my breast.

747
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,040
I tried to push him away,
but he kept pulling me closer.

748
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:36,950
And he put his hand
on my throat.

749
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,480
And he's a really strong guy,
you know.

750
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:42,950
And the next thing I knew...

751
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:48,420
Please go on, Miss Tobias.

752
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,420
He was squeezing
my throat with his hands...

753
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,100
and he pushed me down
on the pinball machine.

754
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,160
And he ripped my shirt.

755
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,800
He lifted my skirt.

756
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,900
He pulled down my underpants
really, really hard.

757
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:12,940
I get...

758
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,450
I wanted to move...

759
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,860
but he was holding me down
really hard and he was jamming...

760
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,330
He was kissing me very hard...

761
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,920
and he was jamming his hand
up my crotch.

762
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,090
I heard a bunch
of people yelling...

763
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,030
"Hold her down! Hold her down!"

764
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,910
And then the big guy,
Kurt, held my arms down...

765
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,780
and I could hear them yelling
and clapping and cheering.

766
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,350
And then...

767
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:49,720
Danny put his hands over
my mouth and over my face.

768
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,930
And I shut my eyes.

769
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,790
He was inside of me.

770
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,860
And then...

771
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,030
And then they switched.

772
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,660
I could hear them saying,
"Frat boy, frat boy."

773
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,330
And then Bob was inside of me...

774
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:16,950
And there was all this yelling
and clapping and laughing.

775
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:21,620
And then I heard them
call for Kurt, "needle dick."

776
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:26,460
And then they switched again...

777
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,930
and Kurt was inside of me.

778
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,690
They were yelling,
"Kurt, Kurt, Kurt."

779
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,500
And there was...
There was all this chanting.

780
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:45,840
Please continue, Miss Tobias.
What did they chant?

781
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,420
Something, uh...

782
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,780
"Poke that pussy."

783
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:57,480
The room was full of people
cheering this on?

784
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,860
Yeah. I kicked him.
I kicked him really hard.

785
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,660
And I ran out into the road and...

786
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,330
This guy picked me up
and took me to the hospital.

787
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,570
No further Questions,
Your Honor.

788
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,760
Miss Tobias,
my name is Ben Wainwright.

789
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:42,000
Now, I know
this isn't easy for you...

790
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:45,000
so I'm gonna ask you
only a handful of Questions.

791
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:51,870
You have testified that all the men
present were strangers to you.

792
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,420
You also testified that while you
were on the pinball machine...

793
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,490
that you mostly kept
your eyes closed.

794
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:02,850
Is that right?
Your eyes were closed?

795
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,690
Yes, sometimes.

796
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,090
Is it fair to say
you can't tell us who applauded...

797
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,490
or who shouted?

798
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,930
- Is that fair?
- L...

799
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,800
Is it possible that
only one person shouted?

800
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,810
No. There were
different voices.

801
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,470
So at least two, then.
Could it have been only two?

802
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,980
No. They overlapped.

803
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:31,980
Miss Tobias, you testified that
you were assaulted by three men.

804
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,990
Is that right?

805
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,720
Yes.

806
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:39,090
Okay. Is it possible...
I'm just saying possible...

807
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,130
that the only ones who shouted
were among your assaulters?

808
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:48,330
No. The voices were coming
from further away.

809
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:56,270
You had had several drinks.
You had smoked marijuana.

810
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,780
The TV was playing.
The jukebox was playing.

811
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:03,980
You were in a room full of noisy
video games and pinball machines.

812
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:08,010
You had your eyes closed,
sometimes.

813
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,920
And you were being assaulted.

814
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:13,980
Now, given these conditions...

815
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:19,400
can you truly say
how many voices you heard...

816
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,130
and where those voices
were coming from?

817
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:30,740
Is it fair to say, then,
that you can't tell us...

818
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,250
who applauded or who shouted?

819
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,350
Is that fair?

820
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,690
Yes, that's fair.

821
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,320
Okay. Thank you.

822
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,300
While you were on
the pinball machine...

823
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,710
did you at any time
cry "help" or "rape"?

824
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,550
No. I tried, but they were
covering my mouth.

825
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,060
They were either kissing me or they
had their hands all over my mouth.

826
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,190
I kept saying no.

827
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,130
Right. No.
L... No. I said no.

828
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:36,680
Not "rape" or "help" or "police."

829
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:41,780
But "no."

830
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,520
Right. No.

831
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,060
- Did anybody hear you?
- I don't know.

832
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,390
Did you signal to anybody?
Say, a hand signal?

833
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,400
No. My hands were
pinned down, right?

834
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,400
Signal to anybody
with your eyes?

835
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,570
- Were you struggling?
- Yes!

836
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,170
Anybody see you struggling?

837
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:12,910
They must have.

838
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,350
Can you in any way prove to us
that someone in that room...

839
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,150
saw you struggling
or heard you say no?

840
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,220
No more Questions.

841
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:41,130
Miss Tobias, while you were being
gang-raped, what were you thinking?

842
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:47,680
- Thinking?
- What words came into your head?

843
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,180
Three men were repeatedly raping
you, holding you down...

844
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,880
Your Honor, prosecution...

845
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,550
and their friends cheered.

846
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:59,820
You lay there naked, struggling,
every part of you in pain.

847
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:02,590
What words came into your head?

848
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,530
What words?

849
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,760
"No."

850
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,210
No further Questions,
Your Honor.

851
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,210
The witness is excused.

852
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,690
- How you doing?
- Good.

853
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,660
Good.
Did you cut the whole day?

854
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:14,430
No big deal. How you doing?

855
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,560
I've been better. So how's
everything? What am I missing?

856
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:25,370
Listen. They're prosecuting
those guys.

857
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,880
The other guys in the bar
who were cheering.

858
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:31,510
They're making me testify,
so you have nothing to worry about.

859
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:34,020
I just wanted to tell you
anyway.

860
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,250
Nothing to worry about?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

861
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,220
- You're not even on trial.
- What are you gonna say?

862
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:41,390
I'm gonna tell them
what happened.

863
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,420
- And what happened?
- Come on, man. You know.

864
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,130
A bunch of guys were cheering
and yelling and stuff.

865
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,400
You, Kurt and Danny.
You raped her.

866
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:55,240
Who said I raped her?
I'm not in here for rape.

867
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,940
Did you see me rape her, Ken?

868
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,010
What do you think?

869
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,750
You didn't, did you?

870
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,310
Yes, I did, Bob.

871
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:15,230
Ken, if you say that,
you know what happens to me?

872
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,060
- Nothing's gonna happen!
- No.

873
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:21,570
Instead of nine months, the parole
board will make it five years.

874
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,370
You don't understand.
They're making me do this.

875
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,340
No. All they can do is call you.

876
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,640
They can't make you say anything.
You don't remember. You were drunk.

877
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,640
You were too confused
to get it straight.

878
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,580
I don't want to lie.

879
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,740
You want to visit me
the next five years?

880
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,500
Hi. I hope you like it black.

881
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,300
I do, thanks.

882
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,040
I meant to tell you...

883
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:05,170
this week, Leos,
they frighten away friends...

884
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,300
Not now, Sarah, please.

885
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,810
Sorry.

886
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:13,820
Excuse us, Miss Murphy.

887
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,620
Mr. Joyce has something
to tell you and Miss Tobias.

888
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:20,990
Mr. Joyce has told me he doesn't
remember the events in Question.

889
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,090
He only told you what he did
because you coerced him.

890
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,900
If you put him on the stand,
he will recant.

891
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,560
He'll take it all back.

892
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,160
Did you have something
to do with this?

893
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:37,580
I suggest you notify the court and
the defense he won't be testifying.

894
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:42,340
In fact, it might be less awkward
to move for immediate dismissal.

895
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:47,080
Wait right here one minute.

896
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:54,360
Why?

897
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,420
I don't remember. I only told her
what I told her...

898
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,370
'cause she forced me to.

899
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,100
If she makes me take the stand,
I'm gonna recant it all.

900
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,760
Why?

901
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,870
I don't remember anything.

902
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,070
You're full of shit.

903
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:16,050
Where do you get off telling me
I'm full of shit? I was there.

904
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:20,280
Right. You were there.
You saw me have a few drinks.

905
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:23,320
You saw me blow some grass.
You saw me flirt a little bit.

906
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:27,790
And then you saw me gang-raped,
and you think I had it coming.

907
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,160
You're just like all the others.

908
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,820
Would you look?
My best friend is in prison.

909
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,890
If I do this, they're gonna
keep him for five years.

910
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,600
Right. Your best friend
is some great guy...

911
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,200
and I'm just
this lowlife whore...

912
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:43,000
that he raped
right in front of you.

913
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,640
You're not like all the others,
you're worse.

914
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:48,610
That's not true.
I'm not like that.

915
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,110
Okay?

916
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,010
Are you scared?

917
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,630
Yeah.

918
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,520
Me too.

919
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,430
Your Honor, the people call
Kenneth Joyce.

920
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,800
Kenneth Joyce.

921
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,100
Do you swear to tell
the whole truth, so help you God?

922
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,760
- I do.
- State your name.

923
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,300
Kenneth Joyce.

924
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,360
Be seated, please.

925
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:51,780
Mr. Joyce, were you in the Mill the night
of the events involving Sarah Tobias?

926
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,040
Yes.

927
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:57,140
Would you please recount for us
what happened?

928
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,250
Well, it was late, and me and my
friend Bob had been to the game.

929
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,290
Then afterwards, he took me
to this bar he sometimes goes to.

930
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,660
The Mill. We had been there for
a while when this girl walked in.

931
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,660
She was really sexy.

932
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,930
And she was sitting
at the table behind us...

933
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,060
talking to her friend
while this guy Danny...

934
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,290
he was sitting
at the end of the bar.

935
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,930
He saw her come in too, and he sent
the bartender over with drinks.

936
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,700
So I'm washing dishes.

937
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,900
Then I hear Bonnie screaming her
head off, and go, "Oh, great."

938
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,780
So Chip walks out
in cowboy boots...

939
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:05,040
and goes, "I didn't just kick her
in the head."

940
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,320
- Hey, dude. What's going on?
- I don't know.

941
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,380
He's cute. Who's he?

942
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,920
Oh, Bob something.
Some college guy.

943
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:22,960
I should take him home and fuck
his brains out in front of Larry.

944
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,430
Yeah, right!

945
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,460
Can I watch?

946
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,810
Behind you.

947
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,380
Blonde girl.
Wants me in a big way.

948
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,880
Jess.
Jesse, come here.

949
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,160
Here we go, ladies.

950
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:55,500
Compliments of the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

951
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:06,880
What do you think he'd do?

952
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,310
Evening, ladies.

953
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:14,480
Danny, this is my friend Sarah.

954
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,110
Thanks for the drinks, Danny.

955
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:19,620
Well, it was my pleasure, Sarah.

956
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,490
Well, you talking shop?

957
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,930
No. We're talking
modern romances.

958
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,590
Yeah? Well, I'm a romantic.

959
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:29,630
That makes me
just like you, Sarah.

960
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:34,300
You are one romantic-looking girl.
Woman.

961
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,170
It's your turn.

962
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:42,310
- Romantic, huh? Romantic?
- She didn't come with me.

963
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,780
She didn't!

964
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:46,320
You don't have to
take my word for it.

965
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:50,050
Just walk in the back
and see for yourself.

966
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,500
- This is the game room.
- Oh, yeah?

967
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:13,940
Then she got up and followed him
into the game room.

968
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:18,140
Pretty soon they were playing
pinball and getting really loaded.

969
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:21,810
- Ooh. I get 100.
- That's a double.

970
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,510
- She's on a roll!
- You better shut up.

971
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,560
Oh, I don't want to
distract you, now, do I?

972
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,590
- Yeah!
- Line it up.

973
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:36,690
Line it up again.

974
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,860
Pay up now. She can score.

975
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,370
Yeah! Go, go, go, go!

976
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,670
Yeah! You lose.

977
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,370
- No. I'm a winner. I don't lose.
- Check the score.

978
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,110
Look at that.

979
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,620
- Like I said, lucky.
- Lucky, my ass. You wish.

980
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,350
Yeah?

981
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:59,350
Looks like your hand's
connected to her ass.

982
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,660
What's your problem?

983
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:04,060
Who is she?
Get her out of here. I hate her.

984
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,650
I don't know.

985
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:08,360
- You're up.
- All right. Maybe next time.

986
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:10,370
Hey, knock it off.

987
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:16,570
- Go for it.
- I'm gonna.

988
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,880
You gonna keep that
all to yourself?

989
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,420
Yeah.

990
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,140
- Didn't your mom teach you manners?
- No.

991
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:30,910
- Angela, put some music on.
- I don't have any change.

992
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:33,890
Hey, Angie, I got some change.

993
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,530
You're so funny,
I can't stand it.

994
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,890
That's what everybody tells me.
I like that.

995
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,400
So modest too.

996
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:42,430
Very modest.
Let's get out of here.

997
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:46,400
- Look who's bossy.
- I'll even let you drive.

998
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:50,410
- You know how to drive?
- You know how to walk?

999
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,150
I think you're
the funniest girl here.

1000
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,840
You're not as funny as me.

1001
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:03,680
- Let's get out of here.
- No. Oh, I love this song.

1002
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,300
- Are you off, honey?
- Yeah. I don't like the show.

1003
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,070
God, I hope it's gonna be me.

1004
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,320
Young lady.
Have you been drinking tonight?

1005
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,690
Me? Oh, no, Officer.

1006
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,430
Hey, listen. I gotta go,
'cause I gotta work tomorrow.

1007
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,340
- I'm a working thing.
- I'll pay you whatever they pay.

1008
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:05,770
I'm too drunk.
I got to go home.

1009
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,040
Mr. Funny Man, I gotta go.

1010
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:20,780
Come on!

1011
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,540
Wait a minute.

1012
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,110
No, l...

1013
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:49,450
Go, Danny! Stick 'em.

1014
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,450
Right!

1015
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,450
All right! Yeah!

1016
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,860
Come on. Go for it!

1017
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:09,000
Danny's gonna fuck her right there!

1018
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,040
Grab her hands, Kurt.

1019
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,980
Go for it, Danny!
Come on, big guy!

1020
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,790
Smell that new blood, baby.

1021
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,610
Come on, she's loving it!

1022
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,210
Hey, college boy, you're next!

1023
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,990
Fuck it, bro! Yeah!

1024
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,750
That's it, man.
Go, go!

1025
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:19,870
Has been effective
shooting that right hand.

1026
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,280
Burt has been landing
significant body shots.

1027
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,280
If he can keep doing that...

1028
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:30,140
Get the frat boy in there!
Go on!

1029
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:31,780
Come on, move!

1030
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,520
Go get her, frat boy!

1031
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:57,310
That's it!
Pump that fucking college ass!

1032
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:00,220
- Go, go!
- Stick it to her!

1033
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:02,850
Don't stop! Hold her down!

1034
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:07,990
Is she ready to come?
I can't see.

1035
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,990
Hold her down.
Make her moan!

1036
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,500
Make her fucking moan!

1037
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,330
Hold her down!

1038
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,840
Make her moan!

1039
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:23,030
Hey, Kurt! Come on!

1040
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:24,940
Watch the kid,
you might learn something.

1041
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:27,710
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

1042
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,840
Listen to needle dick!

1043
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,510
You a faggot?

1044
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,610
You let them talk to you
like that? You a faggot?

1045
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:38,420
You pull down your pants,
we'll see silk panties, huh?

1046
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:40,620
You shut the fuck up!

1047
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,260
- You got the champion!
- Here comes Kurt!

1048
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,630
Go. Fucking get her!

1049
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,040
Gonna see his panties!

1050
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,830
You're next, huh?

1051
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:19,920
In control.

1052
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,690
Burt is trying
to apply the pressure here.

1053
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,800
One, two, three, four.
Poke that pussy till it's sore!

1054
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:20,080
Mr. Joyce, do you believe...

1055
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:22,620
that Sarah Tobias
instigated that rape?

1056
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,320
No, I don't.

1057
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:27,120
Thank you.

1058
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,340
So?

1059
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:48,210
So Ken helped.
Larry, I don't know.

1060
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:51,410
Jesse hurt.

1061
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,180
What about Sally?

1062
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,450
Bad, huh?

1063
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,460
Shit!

1064
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,550
You want to go for a drink?

1065
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,800
No. I have to
put together my summation.

1066
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,530
What are our chances?

1067
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,300
50-50 at best.

1068
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,510
Good night.

1069
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,210
Your Honor, my colleagues have
agreed to a single summation.

1070
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:33,050
No objection, Your Honor.

1071
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,360
Ladies and gentlemen...

1072
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,460
the state has charged
these three men with a crime.

1073
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,510
The state has
supported that charge...

1074
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,670
with the testimony
of two witnesses.

1075
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,610
Sarah Tobias...

1076
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,340
who told you
how three men raped her...

1077
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,140
and she told you how she heard
other men...

1078
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:01,620
shouting encouragement
to her attackers.

1079
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:05,420
Did she name these other men?

1080
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:08,720
No. Did she describe
these other men?

1081
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,700
No. Could she tell you
what these other men shouted?

1082
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:18,360
No.

1083
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:23,310
Her sworn testimony... her poignant,
heart-rending sworn testimony...

1084
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,840
was an appeal to your pity.

1085
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:29,350
And if her story is true,
you should pity her.

1086
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:32,250
But even if her story
is true and you do pity her...

1087
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,340
that has nothing to do
with this case.

1088
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:39,620
Because those three men
did not rape her.

1089
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:43,530
Her sworn testimony is nothing...

1090
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,460
and you must treat it as nothing.

1091
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:50,870
Now...

1092
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:53,460
if you wish, you can also treat
as nothing...

1093
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,270
the testimony of her lover,
Larry...

1094
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,970
who told you
what kind of woman she is.

1095
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,510
You can treat as nothing
the testimony of the bartender...

1096
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:06,570
Jesse, who told you that she was
so drunk she could barely stand.

1097
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:11,280
And you can treat as nothing the
testimony of her friend, Sally...

1098
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,920
who told you what
Miss Tobias's intentions were...

1099
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:15,720
when she first saw our clients.

1100
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,620
Our case does not
depend on those witnesses...

1101
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:23,830
just as the People's case
does not depend on Sarah Tobias.

1102
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:29,800
The People's case...

1103
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,970
depends on Kenneth Joyce.

1104
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:36,410
If you believe him,
you'll convict those three men...

1105
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,420
and if you don't,
you'll acquit them.

1106
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:44,320
Do you believe him?

1107
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,490
Why did Kenneth Joyce testify?

1108
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,620
Every day, for months,
he said to himself, "I'm guilty."

1109
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:59,130
Finally he was offered a way to
purge that guilt, and he took it.

1110
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,540
Kenneth Joyce told you
he watched a rape.

1111
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:04,040
He told you everyone else
in that room watched a rape.

1112
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,170
How did he know that?
Did he read their minds?

1113
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:11,940
To solicit a crime, you must first
know it is a crime.

1114
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,780
Well, who knew it?

1115
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,290
Kenneth Joyce.

1116
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:24,790
Do you think it matters
to Kenneth Joyce who shouted?

1117
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:27,230
In his mind, every person
in that room was guilty.

1118
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,770
He told you that.

1119
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:30,800
And Kenneth Joyce...
who is guilty...

1120
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:32,960
who did watch a rape
and do nothing...

1121
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,440
will purge himself by bringing down
anyone who was in that room.

1122
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:42,540
And, of course,
at no legal cost to himself...

1123
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,440
while those three men
face prison.

1124
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,860
Do you believe him?

1125
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:07,700
Well, if you do, convict.

1126
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,480
And if you don't...

1127
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:15,080
and I know you don't...

1128
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:18,450
acquit.

1129
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:35,300
Miss Murphy.

1130
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,570
Ladies and gentlemen...

1131
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,610
Mr. Paulsen has told you
that the testimony...

1132
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,950
of Sarah Tobias is nothing.

1133
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:56,350
Sarah Tobias was raped,
but that is nothing.

1134
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:00,480
She was cut and bruised
and terrorized...

1135
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,290
but that is nothing.

1136
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,530
All of it happened
in front of a howling crowd...

1137
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,130
and that is nothing.

1138
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,000
Well, it may be nothing
to Mr. Paulsen...

1139
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:16,670
but it is not nothing
to Sarah Tobias.

1140
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:20,700
And I don't believe
it's nothing to you.

1141
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,940
Next Mr. Paulsen
tried to convince you...

1142
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:25,850
that Kenneth Joyce was
the only person in that room...

1143
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,610
who knew that Sarah Tobias
was being raped.

1144
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:35,020
The only one.

1145
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:38,090
Now, you watched Kenneth Joyce.
How did he strike you?

1146
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,690
Did he seem
especially sensitive?

1147
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:43,930
Especially observant?

1148
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,370
Did he seem so remarkable
that you said to yourselves...

1149
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:52,380
"Of course. This man would notice
things other people wouldn't."

1150
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,810
Do you believe Kenneth Joyce
saw something...

1151
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,370
those three men didn't see?

1152
01:39:56,450 --> 01:40:00,540
In all the time Sarah was held down
on that pinball machine...

1153
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,090
the others didn't know?

1154
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,950
Kenneth Joyce confessed to you...

1155
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:11,160
that he watched a rape
and did nothing.

1156
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:16,600
He told you that everyone
in that bar behaved badly.

1157
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:19,260
And he's right.

1158
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:23,240
But no matter
how immoral it may be...

1159
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,610
it is not the crime
of criminal solicitation...

1160
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,980
to walk away from a rape.

1161
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:31,020
It is not the crime
of criminal solicitation...

1162
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:35,680
to silently watch a rape.

1163
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:38,720
But it is the crime
of criminal solicitation...

1164
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:42,350
to induce or entreat
or encourage...

1165
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:46,890
or persuade another person
to commit a rape.

1166
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:52,130
"Hold her down. Stick it to her.
Make her moan."

1167
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,070
These three men
did worse than nothing.

1168
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:00,010
They cheered and they clapped...

1169
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,640
and they rooted the others on.

1170
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,620
They made sure that Sarah Tobias
was raped...

1171
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:12,420
and raped and raped.

1172
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:16,180
Now...

1173
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,290
you tell me...

1174
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,300
is that nothing?

1175
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,410
- What time is it?
- You just asked me that.

1176
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:40,550
They want Ken Joyce's testimony
read to them again.

1177
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:43,280
I don't get it.
That's the third time for him.

1178
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,950
How come they never
ask for mine?

1179
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,960
Because they believed you.

1180
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:54,430
Oh, look. I did your chart. You're
gonna like this. This is great.

1181
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,730
The tenth house
is really something.

1182
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,270
Saturn in the tenth house
is career and ambition.

1183
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:04,270
Mercury ruling the tenth...
public work.

1184
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:07,070
And you had Sun and Pluto
in the tenth.

1185
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:09,610
That's law
and higher understanding.

1186
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,010
I mean, I'm telling you...

1187
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,180
the tenth house
is really excellent.

1188
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:20,550
You could be president
or something.

1189
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:22,150
What about you?
What's your future?

1190
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:29,220
Oh, I forgot it at home.

1191
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,830
Don't you remember it?

1192
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:36,930
Yeah, it's just...

1193
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:39,200
seventh house mostly.

1194
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,410
It's like, uh, feelings, faith...

1195
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,780
intuition, mystery.

1196
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:46,820
Really useful shit.

1197
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,510
Do I have any of that?

1198
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:52,320
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

1199
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,820
You got a little bit right there.
See that?

1200
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:01,760
Keep it.

1201
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:07,660
I was going to sign it,
but I figured...

1202
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:10,230
you're really not
into that kind of stuff.

1203
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,740
So...

1204
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,310
Will you sign it, please?

1205
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,600
Thank you.

1206
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:40,960
Likewise.

1207
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,840
Still no verdict in the
precedent-setting Tobias trial.

1208
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,600
As the jury continues...

1209
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:48,840
The second day, the jury is showing
no Quick verdict.

1210
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:51,610
Many observers predict
the case will...

1211
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:56,250
The jury has been out for two days.
Both sides express confidence...

1212
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,090
but one thing is certain,
this will be an historic decision.

1213
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:05,220
They're coming in.

1214
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,370
Ladies and gentlemen,
have you reached a verdict?

1215
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,100
We have, Your Honor.

1216
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:04,040
Will the defendants
please rise and face the jury?

1217
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,530
"We find the defendant
Matthew Haines...

1218
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,340
guilty of criminal solicitation.

1219
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:29,640
We find the defendant
Stuart Holloway...

1220
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:31,340
guilty of criminal solicitation.

1221
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:34,150
We find the defendant
Clifford Albrect...

1222
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,710
guilty of criminal solicitation."

1223
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:39,190
Sentence will be imposed
two weeks from today...

1224
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,320
at 10:00.

1225
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:42,880
This court is adjourned.

1226
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:30,030
What was the deciding factor
in the case?

1227
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:31,800
There were many
deciding factors.

1228
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,670
What are your plans?

1229
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,540
I'd like to go home
and play with my dog.
