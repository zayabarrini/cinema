1
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,829
What do we care if we were expelled?

2
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,873
The war's gonna start,
so we would've left anyhow.

3
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,834
War! Isnâ€™t it exciting, Scarlett?

4
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,586
- Those fool Yankees want a war.
We'll show them!

5
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,506
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!

6
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,592
This war talk's spoiling
all the fun at every party.

7
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,178
I get so bored I could scream.

8
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,597
Besides, there isn't
going to be any war.

9
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,767
Not gonna be any war?
- Of course there'll be a war.

10
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,478
If either of you boys
says "war" once again...

11
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,021
...I'll go in the house.

12
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,316
- But, Scarlett!
- Don't you want us to have a war?

13
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,486
Wait a minute, honey, please!
We're sorry.

14
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,740
Well...

15
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,619
But remember, I warned you.

16
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,204
I've got an idea!

17
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,874
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

18
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,543
You're eating barbecue with us,
aren't you?

19
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,754
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

20
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,089
We want all your waltzes.

21
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,675
First Brent, then me,
then Brent, and so on.

22
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,636
- Promise?
- Why, I'd just love to.

23
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,390
If only I didn't have every one
of them taken already.

24
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,393
- You can't do that to us!
- We'll tell you a secret.

25
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,769
A secret? Who by?

26
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,646
You know Melanie Hamilton?

27
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,316
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting-

28
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,277
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?

29
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,029
Anyway, we heard- They say-

30
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,323
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.

31
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,160
- Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
Do we get those waltzes?

32
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,828
Of course.

33
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,212
- It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
Scarlett!

34
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,716
- What's gotten into her?
- Suppose we made her mad?

35
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,637
Where are you going without your
shawl and the night air coming?

36
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,348
How come you didn't ask them
gentlemen to supper?

37
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,808
You got no more manners
than a field hand.

38
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,645
After me and Miss Ellen
done labored with you!

39
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,273
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.

40
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,527
No! I'm going to wait
for Pa to come home.

41
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,445
Come on in here!

42
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,280
Come on!

43
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,630
Quitting time!

44
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,299
- Who says it's quitting time?
- I said.

45
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,636
I's the foreman. I say
when it's quitting time at Tara.

46
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,513
Quitting time!

47
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,974
Quitting time!

48
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,393
There's none in the county
can touch you, and none in the state.

49
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,729
Pa!

50
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,189
How proud of yourself you are!

51
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,279
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
so you've been spying on me.

52
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,033
Like your sister, you'll tell
your mother that I was jumping again.

53
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,410
You know I'm no tattletale
like Suellen.

54
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,080
But after you broke your knee
last year jumping that fence-

55
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,668
I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.

56
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,337
It's my own neck, so it is.

57
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,714
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.

58
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,342
- How are they at Twelve Oaks?
- The Wilkeses?

59
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,721
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue
and talking nothing but war.

60
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,016
Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?

61
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,935
Their cousin Melanie
and her brother, Charles.

62
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,564
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,
mealy-mouthed ninny!

63
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,191
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

64
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,277
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.

65
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,822
What's your interest
in Ashley and Miss Melanie?

66
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,659
Nothing. Let's go into the house.

67
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,162
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

68
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,664
- No.
- Nor will he.

69
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,458
I had it in strict confidence
from John Wilkes today...

70
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,460
...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.

71
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,254
It'll be announced
tomorrow night at the ball.

72
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,756
I don't believe it!

73
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,634
Here! Where are you off to?

74
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,052
Scarlett!

75
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,637
What are you about?

76
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,975
Have you been running after a man
who's not in love with you?

77
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,936
When you might have any other?

78
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,606
I haven't been running after him,
it's just a surprise.

79
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,359
Now, don't be jerking
your chin at me!

80
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,904
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.

81
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,449
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

82
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,909
I would! I would!

83
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,330
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.

84
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,125
And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.

85
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,293
I don't want it.
It doesn't mean anything-

86
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,796
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...

87
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,132
...that land doesn't mean
anything to you?

88
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,801
Land is the only thing in the
world worth working for...

89
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,886
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.

90
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,432
- It's the only thing that lasts!
- You talk like an Irishman.

91
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,561
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting...

92
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,062
...that you're half Irish too.

93
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,606
To anyone with a drop
of Irish blood in them...

94
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,817
...the land they live on
is like their mother.

95
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,111
But there now. You're just a child.

96
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,447
It'll come to you,
this love of the land.

97
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,533
There's no getting away from it
if you're Irish.

98
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,309
Here she comes!

99
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,728
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,
your mama's home!

100
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,814
Acting like a wet nurse to
them white-trash Slatterys...

101
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,109
...instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!

102
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,320
Got no business wearing herself out...

103
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,864
Pork! Take the lamp
out on the porch.

104
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,326
Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!

105
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,578
Waiting on them poor white trash.

106
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,705
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!

107
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,374
Get up from there!
Don't you hear Miss Ellen?

108
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,919
Get out there and get
her medicine chest!

109
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,505
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.

110
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,090
It's all right, Pork. I'm home.

111
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,261
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished
plowing the creek bottom today.

112
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,972
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?

113
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,768
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmie Slattery's bedside.

114
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,436
Your child has been born.

115
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,856
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.

116
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,109
Has been born and
mercifully has died.

117
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,362
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.

118
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,617
I fix your supper myself
and you eats it.

119
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,495
- Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
- Yes'm.

120
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,666
Mr. O'Hara, you must
dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

121
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,461
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.

122
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,339
He must go tomorrow morning,
the first thing!

123
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,759
- No.
- Yes.

124
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,263
The Yankee Wilkerson and
the white-trash Slattery girl?

125
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,933
- We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
- Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

126
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,520
Scarlett's dress
is prettier than mine!

127
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,898
Can't she wear my pink dress?
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.

128
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,235
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.

129
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,363
Can't I stay up for the ball?
- You may wear my garnets.

130
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,241
Why can't I stay up for
the ball tomorrow?

131
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:33,454
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.

132
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,123
I'm all right, Mother.

133
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,668
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.

134
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,212
You may go to the barbecue.

135
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,673
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!

136
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,593
- Hush up!
Prayers, girls.

137
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,896
- and to all the saints, that I have
sinned in thought, word and deed...

138
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:03,109
...through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

139
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,613
Therefore, I beseech thee,
blessed Mary, ever virgin...

140
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,032
...blessed Michael the Archangel...

141
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,034
...blessed John the Baptist...

142
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,496
...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,
and all the saints...

143
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,081
...pray to the Lord...

144
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,542
Ashley doesn't know I love him.

145
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,420
I'll tell him that I love him...

146
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,964
...and then he can't marry.

147
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,301
Hear thee Almighty,
most merciful Lord...

148
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,972
...grant us pardon, absolution
and remission of our sins. Amen.

149
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,519
Just hold on and suck in!

150
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,022
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.

151
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,775
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.

152
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes'm, you is!

153
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,528
You's gonna eat every mouthful.

154
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,449
No, I'm not!

155
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,411
Put on the dress.
We're late already.

156
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,330
- What my lamb gonna wear?
- That.

157
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,459
No, you ain't! You can't show
your bosom before 3:00!

158
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,586
I'm gonna speak to your ma!

159
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,923
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.

160
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,719
Well...

161
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,188
Keep your shawl on. I ain't
aiming for you to get freckled...

162
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,901
...after the buttermilk I done put
on you, bleaching them freckles.

163
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,745
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on
and be good and eat just a little, honey.

164
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,791
No! I'm going to have a good time
today and eat at the barbecue.

165
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,794
If you don't care
what folks says, I does!

166
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:50,133
You can always tell a lady by how
she eats in front of folks like a bird.

167
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,637
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!

168
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,347
Fiddle-dee-dee!

169
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,892
Ashley told me he likes
girls with a healthy appetite.

170
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,812
What gentlemens says
and thinks is different things.

171
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,024
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking for to marry you.

172
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,753
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
a having it come right back up again.

173
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,591
Why is it a girl has to be
so silly to catch a husband?

174
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,720
Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not
down here by the time I count 10...

175
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,056
- ... we'll go without you!
- I'm coming, Pa!

176
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:43,436
One, two, three, four, five...

177
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,147
Oh, dear!

178
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,735
My stays are so tight, I'll never
get through the day without belching!

179
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,427
Well, John Wilkes.

180
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,931
- It's a grand day for the barbecue.
- So it seems, Gerald.

181
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,808
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

182
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,603
She's settling accounts with the overseer,
but she'll be along tonight.

183
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,482
- Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
- Thank you kindly, India.

184
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,819
Your daughter's getting
prettier every day, John.

185
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,905
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

186
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,367
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.

187
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,244
That's your brother's business.

188
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,913
You must remember
your duties as hostess.

189
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,666
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.

190
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,709
Good morning, Scarlett.

191
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,046
India Wilkes,
what a lovely dress!

192
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,966
I just can't take my eyes off it.

193
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,468
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.

194
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,222
You look mighty fine
this morning, Miss Scarlett.

195
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,601
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.

196
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,564
Ashley!

197
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,152
Scarlett, my dear!

198
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,654
I've been looking for you everywhere.

199
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,616
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?

200
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,412
Yes, I'd like to, but I have
something to tell you too.

201
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,249
Something I hope
you'll be glad to hear.

202
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,626
Come say hello
to my cousin Melanie first.

203
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,503
Oh, do we have to?

204
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,507
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again. Melanie!

205
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,429
Here's Scarlett.
- Scarlett!

206
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,015
I'm so glad to see you again.

207
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,934
Melanie, what a surprise
to run into you here.

208
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,395
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.

209
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,107
I hope I shall stay long enough
for us to become real friends.

210
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,110
- I do want us to be.
- We'll keep her here, won't we?

211
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,030
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!

212
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,033
If anybody can give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.

213
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,536
Our good times must seem silly
to you. You're so serious.

214
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,497
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

215
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,834
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.

216
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,879
You mustn't flatter me
and say things you don't mean.

217
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,674
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

218
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,927
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?

219
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,429
He never means a word
he says to any girl.

220
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,391
Why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

221
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,060
But, Miss O'Hara, I-

222
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,148
Was it kind to bring your good-looking
brother here to break my poor heart?

223
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,653
Now that Charles is your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

224
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,197
Charles, I want to eat
barbecue with you.

225
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,034
Don't go philandering with any other girl,
because I'm mighty jealous.

226
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,621
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!

227
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,917
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look
dashing with those new whiskers.

228
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,544
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

229
00:20:56,004 --> 00:21:01,092
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with
them, but I told them I promised you.

230
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,137
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.

231
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,307
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

232
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,559
I'll see what I can do.

233
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,312
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?

234
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,399
As if I couldn't do better
than that old maid in britches.

235
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,026
Brent and Stuart,
you handsome old things!

236
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,446
- I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
- What have we done?

237
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,242
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.

238
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,286
I was counting on eating with you.

239
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,205
- You are, Scarlett.
- Of course you are, honey.

240
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,959
I never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest.

241
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,587
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.

242
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,381
Oh, shucks!

243
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,595
- Cathleen, who's that?
- Who?

244
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,973
That man looking at us and smiling.

245
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,349
The nasty dark one.

246
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,520
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.

247
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,273
He has a most terrible reputation.

248
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,614
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy.

249
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,367
My dear, he isn't received.

250
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,496
He spends his time up North
because his folks won't speak to him.

251
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,999
He was expelled
from West Point, he's so fast.

252
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,252
And there's that business
about the girl he wouldn't marry.

253
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,587
Tell, tell!

254
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:24,842
He took her out buggy-riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon...

255
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,137
...and then he refused to marry her!

256
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,185
No, but she was ruined just the same.

257
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,358
Ashley...

258
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,569
- Happy?
- So happy.

259
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,697
You seem to belong here...

260
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,617
...as if it had all been
imagined for you.

261
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,245
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

262
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,374
- You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
- Yes, Ashley.

263
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,252
I love it as more than a house.

264
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,215
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

265
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,302
It's so unaware
that it may not last forever.

266
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,722
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes?

267
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,892
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

268
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,396
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

269
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,732
Whatever comes, I'll love you...

270
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,112
...just as I do now, until I die.

271
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,951
Isnâ€™t this better than a table?

272
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,079
A girl hasn't got but two sides
to her at a table.

273
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,998
- I'll get her dessert.
- She said me!

274
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,458
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?

275
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,838
I think...

276
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,843
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

277
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,140
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!

278
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,393
Go get it, boy!
Isnâ€™t he the luckiest...

279
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,777
Miss O'Hara...

280
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,280
...I love you.

281
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,033
I don't guess I'm as hungry
as I thought.

282
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,914
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.

283
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,375
Well-brought-up ladies
takes naps at parties.

284
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,254
It's time you behave and act
like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

285
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,425
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.

286
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,887
And you won't see no Yankee
girls at the ball, neither.

287
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,555
How was Ashley today?

288
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,266
He didn't pay much attention to you.

289
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,976
You mind your own business!

290
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,604
You'll be lucky you don't lose
whisker-face Kennedy.

291
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,357
You're sweet on Ashley, and his
engagement's being announced tonight.

292
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,443
That's as much as you know.

293
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:52,281
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!

294
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,326
If you's old enough for parties,
you should act like ladies!

295
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,119
Who cares?

296
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,464
We've borne enough insults
from the Yankees.

297
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,802
We'll keep our slaves
with or without their approval.

298
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,597
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.

299
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,600
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

300
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,980
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.

301
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,399
- There's no other way.
That's right!

302
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,526
Let the Yankees ask for peace.

303
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:15,114
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

304
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,992
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.

305
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,079
One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
We'll beat them in one battle.

306
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,665
Gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble.

307
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,208
Gentlemen always fight better.

308
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,794
What does the captain
of our Troop say?

309
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,215
Well, gentlemen,
if Georgia fights, I go with her.

310
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,510
I hope the Yankees let us
leave the Union in peace.

311
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,220
Ashley, they've insulted us!

312
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,306
You can't mean you don't want war?

313
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,684
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

314
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,814
And when the wars were over,
no one ever knew what they were about.

315
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,527
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's
been up North, I hear.

316
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,154
Don't you agree with us?

317
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,866
I think it's hard winning
a war with words.

318
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,326
What do you mean, sir?

319
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,078
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

320
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,289
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

321
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,459
It'll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

322
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,420
Are you hinting
that the Yankees can lick us?

323
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,796
No, I'm not hinting.

324
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,758
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

325
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,177
They've got factories,
shipyards, coal mines...

326
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,138
...and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us.

327
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,933
All we've got is cotton and slaves,
and arrogance.

328
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,853
I refuse to listen
to any renegade talk!

329
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,399
- I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
- Apologies aren't enough, sir.

330
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,235
I hear you were turned out
of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.

331
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,072
And you aren't received in
any family in Charleston.

332
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,490
Not even your own!

333
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,623
I apologize again
for all my shortcomings.

334
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,585
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?

335
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,172
I seem to be spoiling everybody's
brandy and cigars...

336
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,174
...and dreams of victory.

337
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,351
That's what you can expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.

338
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,311
You did everything but call him out.

339
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,814
- He refused to fight.
- Not quite there, Charles.

340
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,733
- He refused to take advantage of you.
- Take advantage of me?

341
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,028
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved many times.

342
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,906
- He's got steadier hands than yours.
- Well, I'll show him!

343
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,617
Please. Don't go tweaking
his nose anymore.

344
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,829
You may be needed for more
important fighting.

345
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,331
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.

346
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,834
I think I'll just show him around.

347
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,639
Ashley!

348
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,606
Ashley...

349
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,316
Scarlett.

350
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,987
Who are you hiding from in here?

351
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,077
What are you up to?

352
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,499
Why aren't you upstairs,
resting with the other girls?

353
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,294
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?

354
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,296
Oh, Ashley...

355
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,672
Ashley!

356
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,300
- I love you.
- Scarlett!

357
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,761
I love you, I do!

358
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,807
Isnâ€™t it enough that you gathered
every other man's heart today?

359
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,351
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

360
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,978
Don't tease me now.

361
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,064
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!

362
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,150
You mustn't say such things.

363
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,027
You'll hate me for hearing them.

364
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,906
I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

365
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,909
You do care, don't you?

366
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,204
Yes, I care.

367
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,459
Can't we go away
and forget we ever said these things?

368
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,587
But how can we do that?

369
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,006
Don't you-?
Don't you want to marry me?

370
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,716
I'm going to marry Melanie.

371
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,260
But you can't!
Not if you care for me!

372
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,806
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

373
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,725
How can I make you understand?

374
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,103
You're so young, you don't
know what marriage means.

375
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,689
I know I love you,
and I want to be your wife.

376
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,358
You don't love Melanie.

377
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,151
She's like me, Scarlett.

378
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,821
She's my blood
and we understand each other.

379
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,323
But you love me!

380
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,408
How could I help loving you?

381
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,911
You have all the passion
for life that I lack.

382
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:35,624
That kind of love isn't enough
for two people as different as we are.

383
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,877
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

384
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,380
You'd marry that fool
who can only say...

385
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,967
..."yes," "no" and raise
a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!

386
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,343
You mustn't say that!

387
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,346
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on!

388
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,599
- You made me believe you'd marry me.
- Scarlett, be fair!

389
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,394
- I never at any time-
- You did! It's true, you did!

390
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,437
I'll hate you till I die!

391
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,358
I can't think of anything
bad enough to call you!

392
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,303
Has the war started?

393
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,974
Sir, you should have made
your presence known.

394
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,518
In the middle of that
beautiful love scene?

395
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,812
That wouldn't have been tactful,
would it?

396
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,773
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

397
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,777
- Sir, you are no gentleman.
- And you, miss, are no lady.

398
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,573
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.

399
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,534
First you take advantage of me,
then you insult me!

400
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,369
I meant it as a compliment.

401
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,874
I hope to see more of you, when
you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.

402
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,210
He doesn't strike me as good
enough for a girl of your-

403
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,088
What was it?
Your "passion for living. "

404
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,674
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots!

405
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,804
And you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life.

406
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,685
She certainly made a fool
of herself running after all the men.

407
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,354
That's not fair, India.

408
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,482
She's so attractive,
men naturally flock to her.

409
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,817
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.

410
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,696
- Didn't you see her going after Charles?
- And she knows Charles belongs to me.

411
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,406
You're wrong, India.

412
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,743
Scarlett's just high-spirited
and vivacious.

413
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,955
Men flirt with girls like that,
but they don't marry them.

414
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,749
I think you're being very mean to her.

415
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,982
Miss O'Hara!

416
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,027
Miss O'Hara!

417
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,280
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers
to fight against us!

418
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,992
Don't you men think
about anything important?

419
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:19,079
But it's war! Everybody's going off
to enlist. I'm going too!

420
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,998
Everybody?

421
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,295
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?

422
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,797
To see us go?

423
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,633
I'll cry into my pillow every night.

424
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,593
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.

425
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:38,140
You're the most beautiful girl in the world,
and the sweetest, the dearest.

426
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,642
I couldn't hope that you could love me.

427
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,312
I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.

428
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:48,191
But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.

429
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,526
Just anything, I promise.

430
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,445
What did you say?

431
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,198
Miss O'Hara, I said,
"Would you marry me?"

432
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,706
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

433
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,459
You will? You'll marry me?
You'll wait for me?

434
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,379
- I don't think I'd want to wait.
- You'll marry me before I go?

435
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,216
Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.

436
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,929
- When may I speak to your father?
- The sooner the better.

437
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,517
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?

438
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,645
Dear!

439
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,398
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!

440
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,944
- It'll be a week before they call me.
- A week till they take you away from me!

441
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,633
Oh, Ashley.

442
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,106
I thought of you
at our wedding yesterday...

443
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,566
...and I hoped yours
would be as beautiful.

444
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,444
- And it was!
- Was it?

445
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,489
Now we're really and truly sisters.

446
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,199
- Charles!
- Melanie.

447
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,416
Don't cry, darling.

448
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,004
The war will be over in a few weeks,
and I'll be coming back to you.

449
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,466
Miss Scarlett!

450
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,803
I don't care!
I'm too young to be a widow.

451
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,388
Miss Scarlett!

452
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,518
Why, I'd just go around
scaring people in that thing.

453
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,188
You shouldn't be around people.
You's in mourning!

454
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,149
For what? I don't feel anything.

455
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,319
Why should I have to
pretend and pretend?

456
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,654
What is it?

457
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:43,074
Oh, poor baby!

458
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,534
What is it?

459
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,411
My life is over!

460
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,790
- Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
- Darling...

461
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,794
Oh, Mother,
I know you think I'm horrible.

462
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,505
But I just can't bear
going around in black.

463
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,843
It's bad enough not being able to
go to parties. But looking this way too?

464
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,762
I don't think you're at all horrible.

465
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,350
It's only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young.

466
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,852
Oh, baby!

467
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,356
How would you like to visit somewhere?
Savannah, perhaps?

468
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,317
What would I do in Savannah?

469
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,820
Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.

470
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,157
And you can stay with Melanie
and her Aunt Pittypat.

471
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,201
Melanie?

472
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,577
Yes.

473
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,412
Yes, I could, couldn't I?

474
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,749
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter
than anybody in the world!

475
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,417
You'd like it, really?

476
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,964
All right, then.
Now stop your crying and smile.

477
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,841
You can take Prissy with you.

478
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,427
Start packing
Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.

479
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,305
I'll go write the necessary letters.

480
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,684
Atlanta!

481
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,312
Savannah would be better for you.
You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.

482
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,772
What are you talking about?

483
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,401
You know what I's talking about.
I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.

484
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,905
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave
and you waiting for him just like a spider!

485
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,742
- He belongs to Miss Melanie-
- Go pack my things like Mother said!

486
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,224
They're all whispering,
and I know it's about her!

487
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,518
What's it matter, Pittypat?

488
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,689
Scarlett's living under my roof,
so they think I'm responsible for her.

489
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,776
And for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering...

490
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,654
...every time I think of it, I feel faint.

491
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:49,034
You know Scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the Cause.

492
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,203
It was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice.

493
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:57,584
Anyone hearing you talk would think
she came to dance instead of sell things.

494
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:14,851
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have important news! Glorious news!

495
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,646
Another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms!

496
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,816
General Lee has completely
whipped the enemy...

497
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:26,071
...and swept the Yankee army
northward from Virginia!

498
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,500
And now, a happy surprise
for all of us.

499
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,171
We have with us tonight, that most
daring of all blockade runners...

500
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,716
...whose fleet schooners,
slipping past the Yankee guns...

501
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,929
...have brought us here the very
woolens and laces we wear tonight.

502
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,183
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that
will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.

503
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,061
None other than our friend
from Charleston...

504
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,063
...Captain Rhett Butler!

505
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,252
Permit me.

506
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,801
Captain Butler, such a pleasure
to see you again.

507
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,886
I met you last at my husband's home.

508
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,597
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.

509
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,392
Did you meet Captain Butler
at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?

510
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,727
Yes, I- I think so.

511
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,313
Only for a moment.
It was in the library.

512
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,816
You had broken something.

513
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,111
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.

514
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,073
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your
jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.

515
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,367
We aren't wearing any.
We're in mourning.

516
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,910
Wait.

517
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,289
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes
and Mrs. Hamilton.

518
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,874
Thank you, Captain Butler.

519
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,460
Just a moment, please.

520
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,839
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.

521
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,718
It may help my husband more
off my finger.

522
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,470
Thank you.

523
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,557
That was a very beautiful thing to do.

524
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,767
Here.

525
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,395
You can have mine too.
For the Cause.

526
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,443
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.

527
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,652
Melanie?

528
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,071
- Dr. Meade?
- I need your approval...

529
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,200
...for something we want to do
that's rather shocking.

530
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,285
Will you excuse us?

531
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,541
I'll say one thing. The war makes
the most peculiar widows.

532
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,792
I wish you'd go away!

533
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,296
If you had any raising, you'd know
I'd never want to see you again!

534
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,509
Now, why be silly?

535
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,344
You've no reason for hating me.

536
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,680
I'll carry your guilty secret
to my grave.

537
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:02,268
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate
a great hero of the war.

538
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,813
I declare, I was surprised you
turned out to be a noble character.

539
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,359
I can't bear to take advantage
of your little-girl ideas.

540
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,694
I'm neither noble nor heroic.

541
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,657
- But you are a blockade runner?
- For profit, and profit only.

542
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,617
You don't believe in the Cause?

543
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,038
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.

544
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,293
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

545
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,505
...I have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital.

546
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,511
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel
with the lady of your choice...

547
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,096
...you must bid for her!

548
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,644
Caroline Meade, how can you let your
husband conduct this slave auction!

549
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,605
Darlene Merriwether,
how dare you criticize me!

550
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:52,193
Melanie told the doctor that
if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.

551
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,403
She did?

552
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,906
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?

553
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,743
- I think I shall faint.
- Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!

554
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,539
If Melanie says it's all right,
it is all right.

555
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,792
Come, gentlemen,
do I hear your bids? Make your offers!

556
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,461
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!

557
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:15,216
Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars
for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!

558
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,343
Twenty-five dollars
for Miss Fanny Elsing!

559
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,262
Only $25 to give your-

560
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:23,391
- One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
- For what lady, sir?

561
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,393
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

562
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,524
- For whom, sir?
- Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

563
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,735
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.

564
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,738
But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles
would be proud to-

565
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,991
Dr. Meade, I said
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

566
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,535
She will not consider it, sir.

567
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,829
Oh, yes, I will!

568
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,667
My goodness gracious!

569
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,594
Choose your partners
for the Virginia reel!

570
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,056
We've shocked the Confederacy.

571
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,099
It's like blockade running, isn't it?

572
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,436
It's worse. I expect
a very fancy profit out of it.

573
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,689
I don't care what you expect.
I'm gonna dance and dance!

574
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,526
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing
with Abe Lincoln himself!

575
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,310
Another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever.

576
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,813
With enough courage
you can do without a reputation.

577
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,981
Oh, you do talk scandalous!

578
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,158
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.

579
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,121
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaus.

580
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,331
I want more than flirting from you.

581
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,917
What do you want?

582
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:18,131
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take
that Southern belle simper off your face.

583
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,677
Someday I want you to say to me the
words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.

584
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,679
"I love you. "

585
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,725
That's something you'll never hear
from me as long as you live.

586
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:53,791
How sweet. How kind.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.

587
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,920
Why doesn't he say
something about my sacrifice?

588
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,472
Oh, the darling thing!

589
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,724
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!

590
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,935
You didn't really bring it
all the way from Paris just for me.

591
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:17,023
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.

592
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,109
Next trip I'll bring you some
green silk for a frock to match it.

593
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,737
- Oh, Rhett.
- It's my duty to our...

594
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:27,366
...brave boys at the front to
keep our girls at home looking pretty.

595
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,827
It's so long since I had anything new!

596
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,089
How do I look?

597
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,425
Awful! Just awful!

598
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,052
Why? What's the matter?

599
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,681
This war's stopped being a joke when
a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.

600
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,649
Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.

601
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,824
But, Rhett, I don't know
how I'd dare wear it!

602
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,659
You will, though.

603
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,411
And another thing, those pantalets!

604
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,331
I don't know a woman in Paris
who wears pantalets anymore.

605
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,210
What do they-? You shouldn't
talk about such things.

606
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:23,047
You don't mind my knowing about them,
just my talking about them.

607
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,801
I can't go on accepting these gifts,
though you're awfully kind.

608
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,845
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.

609
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,765
I never give without expecting
something in return. I always get paid.

610
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,142
I won't marry you
to pay for the bonnet.

611
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,479
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.

612
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,566
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.

613
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,870
Open your eyes and look at me.

614
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,706
No, I don't think I will kiss you.

615
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,416
Although you need kissing, badly.

616
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,377
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often.

617
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,004
And by someone who knows how.

618
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,548
And I suppose you think
you're the proper person!

619
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,926
I might be, if the right moment
ever came.

620
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,846
You're a conceited,
black-hearted varmint!

621
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,515
I don't know why
I let you come and see me.

622
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,309
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.

623
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,022
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60
who's around to show you a good time.

624
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,816
But cheer up.
The war can't last much longer.

625
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,693
Really, Rhett? Why?

626
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,905
There's a battle going on now
that ought to fix things...

627
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,781
- ... one way or the other.
- Oh, Rhett.

628
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,658
Is Ashley in it?

629
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,038
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.

630
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,625
- Yes, I suppose he's in it.
- But tell me, where is it?

631
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,754
Some little town in Pennsylvania
called Gettysburg.

632
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,661
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!

633
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,377
Please! Please!

634
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,338
Here you is. They was fighting
for them so, it got tore in half.

635
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,090
Scarlett, you look.

636
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,009
The W's at the end.

637
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:21,308
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,
Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman-

638
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,437
Scarlett, you've passed him!

639
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,189
He isn't there! He isn't there!

640
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,650
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!

641
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,987
Oh, he's safe. He's safe!

642
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:39,035
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry
about Ashley like this for me.

643
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,376
I must go to her.

644
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,796
Don't, my dear. Not here.

645
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,798
Let's go home.

646
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,301
Dr. Meade, not-?

647
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,679
Yes, our boy Darcy.

648
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,974
I was making these mittens for him.

649
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,477
He won't need them now.

650
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,395
Well, I'm gonna enlist.

651
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,856
I'll show them!
I'll kill those Yankees!

652
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,149
You hush your mouth.

653
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,570
You think it'll help your mother
to have you shot too? It's silly!

654
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,866
It's a black day, Scarlett.

655
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,534
Haven't had bad news, have you?

656
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,704
- Ashley's safe.
- I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.

657
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,247
There are so many others.

658
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,250
- Any of your friends?
- About every family in the county.

659
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,961
- The Tarleton boys, both of them.
- Yes.

660
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,507
Look at them.
All these poor tragic people.

661
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,719
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.

662
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,262
The Cause.

663
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,724
The cause of living in the past
is dying right in front of us.

664
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,810
I never heard you talk like that.

665
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,981
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry
and that's what this is, sheer waste!

666
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,984
But don't you be downcast.

667
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,863
Ashley's still alive to come home
to the women who love him.

668
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,532
Both of them.

669
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,528
You're here!

670
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,493
Oh, you're here!
You're really here at last!

671
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,662
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!

672
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,123
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!

673
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,421
But we're forgetting Scarlett.

674
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,549
Scarlett, dear.

675
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,430
Why, is this any way to greet
a returning warrior?

676
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,265
Ashley, I...

677
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,350
I...

678
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,687
Merry Christmas, Ashley.

679
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,365
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We's ate all your wives.

680
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,910
We's ate all your little chicks.

681
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,787
You got nobody to worry
your head about leaving.

682
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,958
Come on. Now you just
stand still so you...

683
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,252
...can be Christmas
for the white folks.

684
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,213
Now, hold on!

685
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,173
Hold on!

686
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,966
Don't go getting so uppity.

687
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,637
Even if you is the last chicken
in Atlanta.

688
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,641
Let's not talk about the war.

689
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,478
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara
and times before there was a war.

690
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,021
Could we have the wine?

691
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,523
Why did you say there
wasn't enough?

692
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,319
There's plenty. It's the very last
of my father's fine Madeira.

693
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:04,281
He got it from his uncle
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...

694
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,993
...who married his cousin
Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...

695
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,580
...who was his second cousin
and akin to the Wilkeses too.

696
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,626
I saved it to wish Ashley
a merry Christmas.

697
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:21,131
But you mustn't drink it all at once,
because it is the last.

698
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,388
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.

699
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,807
Only generals have tunics like this.

700
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,684
I'm so happy you like it.

701
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,477
Where did you get the cloth?

702
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,729
It was sent by a Charleston lady.

703
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:40,317
I nursed her son while he was
in the hospital before he died and-

704
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,237
You will take good care of it, won't you?

705
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,782
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me.

706
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,450
You mustn't worry.

707
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:52,830
I'll bring it back to you
without any holes in it. I promise.

708
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,460
Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Scarlett, darling.

709
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,726
Uncle Peter, is it time
for Mr. Ashley to leave?

710
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,561
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.

711
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,315
Melanie isn't going to the depot?
She hasn't changed her mind?

712
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,941
No, ma'am, she's laying down.

713
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,779
She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her
she can't even come downstairs.

714
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,953
Ashley...

715
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,752
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.

716
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,297
Scarlett, I'd rather remember
you as you are now.

717
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,799
Not shivering at the depot.

718
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,468
All right.

719
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,221
Ashley, I've got a present for you too!

720
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,189
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!

721
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,691
Tie it on me, my dear.

722
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:07,488
While Melly was making a new tunic,
I made this to go with it.

723
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,782
You made it yourself?

724
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,701
Well, then I shall
value it all the more.

725
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,455
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

726
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,957
There's something you can do for me.

727
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,459
What is it?

728
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,128
Will you look after Melanie for me?

729
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:27,424
She's so frail and gentle,
and she loves you so much.

730
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,677
- If I were killed-
- You mustn't say that! It's bad luck.

731
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,554
Say a prayer, quickly.

732
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,807
You say one for me.

733
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,685
We shall need all our prayers.
Now the end is coming.

734
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,688
- The end?
- The end of the war...

735
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,817
...and the end of our world, Scarlett.

736
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,362
But you don't think
the Yankees are beating us?

737
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,199
Oh, Scarlett,
my men are barefooted now!

738
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,244
And the snow in Virginia's deep.

739
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,623
When I see them, and I see
the Yankees coming and coming...

740
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,960
...always more and more!

741
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,047
When the end does come,
I shall be far away.

742
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,301
It'll be a comfort to me
to know that she has you.

743
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,055
You will promise, won't you?

744
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,142
Yes.

745
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,645
Is that all, Ashley?

746
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,898
All except... goodbye.

747
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,650
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!

748
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,903
- You must be brave. You must!
- No, no!

749
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,364
How else can I bear going?

750
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:37,578
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine
and strong and beautiful.

751
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,747
Not just your sweet face, my dear...

752
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,583
...but you.

753
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,299
Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.

754
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,511
Ashley.

755
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,850
No, Scarlett. No!
- Oh, Ashley, I love you.

756
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,061
I've always loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.

757
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,731
I only married Charles just to hurt you.

758
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,067
Ashley, tell me you love me.

759
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,196
I'll live on it the rest of my life!

760
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,115
Goodbye.

761
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,012
When the war's over, Ashley.

762
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,723
When the war's over.

763
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,371
- and there's a place back home...

764
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:06,792
...where a wild plum tree
comes to flower in the springtime...

765
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,961
...down by the creek, you know.

766
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,463
Yes, I know, I know.

767
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,883
When we were little,
my brother Jeff and I used to-

768
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,845
I told you about my brother Jeff,
didn't I, ma'am?

769
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,974
I know I did. He...

770
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,102
We don't know
where Jeff is now, ma'am.

771
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:29,064
Since Bull Run,
we haven't heard anything and-

772
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,400
Please, we must have
your temperature now.

773
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,988
Just take this in your mouth
and not talk anymore. Not just now.

774
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,908
Melanie, I'm so tired.
I've got to go home.

775
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,202
Aren't you tired, Melanie?

776
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,372
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

777
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,084
This might be Ashley...

778
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,254
...and only strangers here
to comfort him.

779
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,923
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

780
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,634
They could all be...

781
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,720
...Ashley.

782
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:15,193
I've been waiting one solid hour
to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.

783
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,238
Go on, you trash.
Don't you be pestering these ladies.

784
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:22,034
- Don't talk to her.
- It's all right. Who are you?

785
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,535
My name's Belle Watling.

786
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,080
But that don't matter.
You think I got no business here.

787
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,625
Tell me what you want
to see me about.

788
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,211
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse. "

789
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,507
They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.

790
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,054
Then I tried giving them money.
My money wasn't good enough either!

791
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,639
The old peahens!

792
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,516
I know a gentleman who says
you're a human being.

793
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:50,228
If you are, which they ain't,
you'll take my money for the hospital.

794
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,357
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?

795
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,609
This time I'm conversing
with Mrs. Wilkes!

796
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,821
You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.

797
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:04,618
- I'm sure you're very generous.
- I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.

798
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,370
Of course you are!

799
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,664
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.

800
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,084
But maybe they ain't
as good Christians as you.

801
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,593
Look, Mrs. Meade,
it's a great deal of money.

802
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,179
Ten, 20, 30, 50!

803
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,932
And it's not our paper money,
it's gold!

804
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,310
Let me see that handkerchief. R.B.!

805
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,483
And she's driving away
in Rhett Butler's carriage!

806
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,862
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady,
what wouldn't I tell that varmint!

807
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,774
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

808
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,528
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

809
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,575
He restoreth my soul.

810
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,704
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

811
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,291
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

812
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,794
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

813
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,881
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me. "

814
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,924
The Yankees!

815
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,178
Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade,
they're getting closer.

816
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,724
They'll never get into Atlanta.
Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.

817
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,685
Give me something for the pain!

818
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,062
Give me something for the pain!

819
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,274
Sorry, son, we haven't
got anything to give you.

820
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,445
These animals is driving me crazy!

821
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,615
What luck! You got my jack.

822
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,284
Give me an ace
and I'll start another war.

823
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,369
And I'll bid the moon.

824
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:19,211
- that I never see you
and my Pa again.

825
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,713
This leg's got to come off.

826
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,174
No, don't! Leave me alone!

827
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,550
I'm sorry, soldier.

828
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,095
- We're all out of chloroform.
- We'll operate without it.

829
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,057
No, no, you won't!
You can't do it.

830
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,475
I won't let you do it!

831
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:36,728
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.
It's gangrene.

832
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,814
No! Oh!

833
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,650
I haven't seen my family in three days.

834
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,944
I'm going home for half an hour.

835
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,862
Orderly, give me a lift!

836
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,661
Nurse, you can free this bed.

837
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,746
Miss Scarlett!

838
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,874
Why, Frank Kennedy.

839
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,210
Miss Suellen. Is she well?

840
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,547
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?

841
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,216
- Suellen. Is she-?
- She's all right.

842
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,385
Dr. Wilson needs you
in the operating room.

843
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,804
He's gonna take off that leg.
Better hurry.

844
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,140
I'll be back.

845
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:20,021
No! You leave me alone! Don't!

846
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,024
I can't stand it! No, don't!

847
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,695
Don't cut! Don't cut!

848
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,448
Don't! Don't! Please!

849
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,284
Where's the nurse?

850
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,539
Dr. Wilson's waiting.

851
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,000
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough!

852
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,962
I don't want any more men dying
and screaming. I don't want any more!

853
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,149
Big Sam!

854
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,653
Big Sam! Big Sam!

855
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,656
Almighty Moses!
It's Miss Scarlett!

856
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,533
Big Sam! Big Sam.

857
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:59,079
Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.
I'm so glad to see you.

858
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,790
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.

859
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,750
- She gone got sick.
- Sick?

860
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,044
Just a little bit sick, that's all.

861
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,172
Your pa went wild when
they wouldn't let him fight.

862
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:13,051
He had fits when they took us
to dig the ditch for the soldiers.

863
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,846
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.
We's digging for the South.

864
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,265
- Was there a doctor?
We've got to march.

865
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,810
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.

866
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,645
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.

867
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,730
If you get sick or hurt,
let me know.

868
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,359
- Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

869
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,923
Scarlett! Scarlett!

870
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,639
Climb into this buggy. This is no day
for walking. You'll get run over!

871
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,266
Oh, Rhett.

872
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,351
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.

873
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,896
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?

874
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,195
Just another of Sherman's calling
cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.

875
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,157
I gotta get out of here
before the Yankees come!

876
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,950
Leave your work at the hospital?

877
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,954
Or have you had enough of death
and lice and men chopped up?

878
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,373
I suppose you weren't meant
for sick men.

879
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,753
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!
I wish I could get out of here.

880
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,212
Let's get out together.

881
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,382
No use letting the South
come down around your ears.

882
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,260
There are too many nice places
to go and visit.

883
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:40,346
- Mexico, London, Paris-
- With you?

884
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,806
Yes, ma'am.

885
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,310
With a man who understands
and admires you for what you are.

886
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,563
I figure we belong together,
being the same sort.

887
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:53,359
I've been waiting for you to grow up
and get Ashley out of your heart.

888
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,906
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to
have a baby in another month or so.

889
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:02,327
It'll be hard loving a man with
a wife and baby clinging to him.

890
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:08,541
Well, here we are. Are you going
with me or are you getting out?

891
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,543
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler.

892
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,004
I'll hate and despise you till I die!

893
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,717
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Not that long.

894
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,184
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

895
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,063
Folks is all going to Macon,
and folks is running away!

896
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,566
I can't bear those cannonballs
right in my ears!

897
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,069
I faint every time I hear one.

898
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,197
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.

899
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,741
- You aren't leaving?
- I may be a coward...

900
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:47,038
...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?

901
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,874
I'm going too.
Prissy, go pack my things.

902
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,543
Wait, I won't be a minute.

903
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,212
- Do you really think you ought to?
Scarlett!

904
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,799
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?

905
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,219
Don't try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.

906
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,264
I've had enough of smelling death,
of rot and death.

907
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,851
I'm going home! I want my mother.
My mother needs me.

908
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,270
Listen to me! You must stay here.

909
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:13,231
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't-

910
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,151
Good heavens, this is war,
not a garden party!

911
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,028
- Melanie needs you.
- Oh, bother Melanie!

912
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:22,407
She's ill already. She shouldn't
even be having a baby.

913
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,284
Can't we take her along?

914
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:29,164
Want her to be jounced over rough roads
and have the baby ahead of time?

915
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,000
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her!

916
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,503
We haven't enough doctors
to look after a sick woman.

917
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,005
You've got to stay.

918
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,008
What for? I don't know anything
about babies being born.

919
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,052
I knows! I knows!
I knows how to do it.

920
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,222
I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, doctor. Let me.

921
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,768
- I can do everything.
- Good. I'll rely on you to help us.

922
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,105
Ashley's fighting in the field.
Fighting for the Cause.

923
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,233
He may never come back.
He may die.

924
01:09:57,484 --> 01:10:00,486
Scarlett, we owe him
a well-born child.

925
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,696
Ashley.

926
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,324
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!

927
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,410
I promised Ashley something...

928
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,287
Then you'll stay?

929
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,624
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.

930
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,585
Go on, Uncle Peter.
I don't know what to do.

931
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:19,130
It's like the end of the world!

932
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,592
Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!

933
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,060
Melanie, Melanie!
It's all your fault!

934
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,229
I hate you! I hate you!

935
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,980
And I hate your baby!

936
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:40,985
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.
If only I hadn't promised him!

937
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,976
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop.

938
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,352
Are the Yankees coming?

939
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,104
The army's pulling out.

940
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,439
Pulling out and leaving us
to the Yankees?

941
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:23,111
Not leaving, evacuating. Before
Sherman cuts the McDonough road.

942
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,988
It can't be true!

943
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,322
What'll I do?

944
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:30,201
Better refugee south, right quick.
If you'll excuse me.

945
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,412
Prissy!

946
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:38,167
Prissy! Go pack my things and
Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.

947
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,628
The Yankees are coming!

948
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,341
Scarlett! Scarlett!

949
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,510
Melly, we're going to-

950
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,764
Melly...

951
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,729
I'm sorry to be
such a bother, Scarlett.

952
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,941
It began at daybreak.

953
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,110
But- But-

954
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,738
But the Yankees are coming.

955
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,532
Poor Scarlett.

956
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:13,745
You'd be at Tara now
with your mother, wouldn't you?

957
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:15,496
If it weren't for me.

958
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:20,251
Oh, Scarlett, darling.
You've been so good to me.

959
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,796
No sister could have been sweeter.

960
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:28,593
I've been lying here thinking...

961
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,304
...if I should die...

962
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,640
...will you take my baby?

963
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,227
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.

964
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,356
Aren't things bad enough
without you talking about dying?

965
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,525
- I'll send for Dr. Meade.
- Not yet, Scarlett.

966
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,570
I couldn't let Dr. Meade
sit here for hours...

967
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,741
...while all those poor,
wounded boys...

968
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,160
Prissy! Prissy, Prissy!

969
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,953
Come here, quick!

970
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,623
Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick!

971
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,208
The baby.

972
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,461
Don't stand there like
a scared goat. Run!

973
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,049
Hurry, hurry!
I'll sell you south, I will.

974
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,759
I swear I will!

975
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:13,012
Where's that Prissy?

976
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:20,103
This room's like an oven already
and it isn't noon yet.

977
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,899
Don't worry, Melly.

978
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:29,070
Mother says it always seems
like the doctor will never come.

979
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,824
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!

980
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,249
Oh, Melly...

981
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,335
Know what I heard
about Maybelle Merriwether?

982
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,629
You remember that
funny-looking beau of hers?

983
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,966
The one with the uniform
like ladies' red flannels?

984
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,719
You don't have to keep on
talking for my sake.

985
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,806
I know how worried you are.

986
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:04,689
For to tote the weary load

987
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:07,567
No matter, 'twill never...

988
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:10,486
Oh, Melly...

989
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:13,489
I'll just go and fetch you
some cooler water.

990
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,368
You're slow as molasses in January.
Where's Dr. Meade?

991
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,912
- I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
- What?

992
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,290
He ain't at the hospital.

993
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,668
A man told me that the doctor's
down at the car shed...

994
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,503
...with the wounded soldiers-

995
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:30,006
Well, why didn't you go after him?

996
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:34,802
Miss Scarlett, I's scared
to go down there at the car shed.

997
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:40,183
There's folks dying down there.
And I's scared of dead folks!

998
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,268
Go sit by Miss Melly.

999
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:46,230
And don't you be upsetting her
or I'll whip the hide off you.

1000
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,861
Just a few more days

1001
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,448
For to tote the weary load

1002
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,313
Have you seen-?
Move aside, lady, please.

1003
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,735
Dr. Meade?

1004
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,028
Dr. Meade.

1005
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,030
Dr. Meade, at last!

1006
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,701
Thank heaven you're here.
I need every pair of hands.

1007
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,288
Now, come, child, wake up.
We got work to do.

1008
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,541
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!

1009
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,836
Are you crazy? I can't
leave these men for a baby.

1010
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,672
They're dying! Hundreds!
Get a woman to help.

1011
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,009
But there isn't anybody.
Dr. Meade, she might die.

1012
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,096
Die? Look at them, bleeding
to death in front of my eyes!

1013
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:44,599
No chloroform. No bandages.
Nothing!

1014
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,434
Nothing to ease their pain.

1015
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,686
Run along and don't bother me.

1016
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:52,440
Don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.

1017
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,109
- Bring the stretchers in here.
Dr. Meade?

1018
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,194
Yeah, I'm coming.

1019
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,049
Is the doctor come?

1020
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,634
No, he can't come.

1021
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,470
Oh, Miss Scarlett,
Miss Melly bad off.

1022
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,348
He can't come.
There's nobody to come.

1023
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,435
You've got to manage
without the doctor. I'll help you.

1024
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:31,937
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!

1025
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:33,814
Well, what is it?

1026
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,192
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!

1027
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:39,528
I don't know nothing
about birthing babies!

1028
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,281
- What do you mean?
- I don't know-

1029
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,116
You told me
you knew everything!

1030
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,118
I don't know why I lied!

1031
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,871
Ma ain't never let me around
when folks was having them.

1032
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,501
Scarlett! Scarlett!

1033
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,087
Miss Scarlett!

1034
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,506
Stop it!

1035
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,051
Go light a fire on the stove.
Boil water in the kettle.

1036
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,971
Get me a ball of twine,
clean towels and the scissors.

1037
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:10,393
Don't tell me you can't find them!
Go get them and get them quick!

1038
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:15,398
Scarlett! Scarlett!

1039
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,739
- Scarlett!
- Coming, Melly.

1040
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,242
Coming!

1041
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,706
You better go
before the Yankees get here.

1042
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,708
You know I won't leave you.

1043
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,459
It's no use. I'm gonna die.

1044
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,753
Don't be a goose, Melly.
Hold on to me.

1045
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:41,048
- Hold on to me!
- Talk to me, Scarlett.

1046
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,592
Please, talk to me.

1047
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,012
Don't try to be brave. Yell!
There's nobody to hear.

1048
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:52,351
Ma says if you puts a knife
under the bed, it cuts the pain.

1049
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,191
Captain Butler!

1050
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:02,820
Captain Butler! Captain Butler!

1051
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,822
- Who do you want?
- Captain Butler.

1052
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,658
He's upstairs.
Belle Watling's giving a party.

1053
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,036
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1054
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,000
Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler!

1055
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,169
What's all the rumpus about?

1056
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:21,547
I's got a message
for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.

1057
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:25,259
Captain Butler, you come out here
in the streets to me!

1058
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:30,389
- What is it, Prissy?
- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.

1059
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,018
Miss Melly, she done
had her baby today.

1060
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,729
A fine baby boy.

1061
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,607
And Miss Scarlett and me,
we brung it.

1062
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,317
Are you telling me Scarlett-?

1063
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,736
It was mostly me, Captain Butler.

1064
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,572
Only Miss Scarlett,
she helped me a little.

1065
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:50,075
But I don't expect no doctor
could have done no better.

1066
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:55,080
Only, Miss Melly, she feel
kind of poorly now it's all over.

1067
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:56,957
Yes, I can believe that.

1068
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,668
And the Yankees is coming.
And Miss Scarlett, she says-

1069
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,757
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!

1070
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:08,636
Please come and bring
your carriage for us right away!

1071
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,388
I'm sorry, but the army
took my horse and carriage.

1072
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,766
You better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

1073
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,226
Oh, no, Captain Butler.

1074
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:21,023
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk
if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.

1075
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:25,528
Any of you beauties know where
I can steal a horse for a good cause?

1076
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,206
Is that you, Rhett?
We's here, Miss Scarlett!

1077
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,582
I knew you'd come.

1078
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,627
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're-

1079
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:44,588
If you make any jokes now,
I'll kill you!

1080
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,174
- Don't tell me you're frightened?
- I'm scared to death!

1081
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,051
If you had sense,
you'd be scared too.

1082
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,263
- Oh, the Yankees!
- No, not yet.

1083
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:55,599
That's what's left of our army
blowing up the ammunition.

1084
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,893
We gotta get out of here!

1085
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,187
At your service.
Where are you going?

1086
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:04,108
- Home, to Tara.
- They've been fighting around Tara.

1087
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:08,946
You're going to parade through there
with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?

1088
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,489
Do you intend leaving them?

1089
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,075
They're going with me,
and you can't stop me!

1090
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:16,871
It's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over open country.

1091
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,123
I want my mother!

1092
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,625
I want to go home to Tara!

1093
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:25,212
Tara's probably been burned.
The woods are full of stragglers.

1094
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,381
The least they'll do
is take the horse.

1095
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,217
It's not much,
but I had trouble stealing it.

1096
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:33,721
I'm going home if I have to walk
every step of the way!

1097
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,266
I'll kill you if you try
to stop me! I will, I will!

1098
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,977
I will, I will!

1099
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:48,319
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.

1100
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,949
I guess anybody who did what you've
done today can take care of Sherman.

1101
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,912
Stop crying.

1102
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:03,751
Now blow your nose
like a good little girl. There.

1103
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,681
What're you doing?
- I'm packing!

1104
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,851
Well, stop it
and come and get the baby!

1105
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:24,271
Melly?

1106
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,357
- Melly?
Mrs. Wilkes?

1107
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,360
- We're taking you to Tara.
- Tara?

1108
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:31,153
It's the only way, Melly.

1109
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,281
They'll burn the house
over our heads if we stay.

1110
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,783
It's all right, Melly.

1111
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,993
My baby.

1112
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:40,371
My poor baby.

1113
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:48,587
- Can you put your arms around my neck?
- I think so.

1114
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,967
Never mind.

1115
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,094
Ashley, Charles!

1116
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,553
What's she want?

1117
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,348
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.

1118
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:01,100
Get them.

1119
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,242
What's that?

1120
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,370
Our gallant lads set fire
to the warehouses.

1121
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:24,164
Enough ammunition in boxcars
to blow us to Tara.

1122
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,001
- We have to get across the tracks.
- Not that way!

1123
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:31,130
We have to. McDonough road's the
only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.

1124
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:43,142
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!

1125
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:47,187
- What are you laughing at?
- At you, locking the Yankees out.

1126
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,330
Oh, dear!
I wish they'd hurry.

1127
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:08,042
I wouldn't be in such a hurry
to see them go.

1128
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,587
With them goes the last
semblance of law and order.

1129
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:15,132
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.

1130
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:21,513
Better get out of here fast.

1131
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,891
There's a horse! Get it!

1132
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,227
Give us that horse!

1133
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,736
Down the alley! Cut him off!

1134
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:40,616
Pull that horse!

1135
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,205
I'll get him!

1136
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,834
Give me that horse!

1137
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,013
Oh, Miss Scarlett!

1138
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,394
Haven't left much to take.

1139
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:13,148
We'll make a dash for it before
the fire reaches that ammunition.

1140
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:35,420
Come on!

1141
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,301
Throw me your shawl.

1142
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:47,015
You'll like it better
if you don't see anything.

1143
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,310
Come on!

1144
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:50,495
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment.

1145
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:55,083
Tell your grandchildren how you watched
the Old South disappear one night.

1146
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:16,063
They were gonna lick the Yankees
in a month. The poor gallant fools.

1147
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,439
They make me sick.

1148
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,943
Getting us all into this
by swaggering and boasting.

1149
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:24,905
That's the way I felt once about
their "swaggering and boasting. "

1150
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,616
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.

1151
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:31,787
You can be proud. Proud that
you've been smarter than all of them.

1152
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,583
I'm not so proud.

1153
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,186
Why did you stop?

1154
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:59,356
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.

1155
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,565
Mrs. Wilkes.

1156
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:04,111
Miss Melly done fainted
way back, Captain Butler.

1157
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,699
She's better off. She couldn't
stand the pain if she were conscious.

1158
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,327
Scarlett, are you still determined
to do this crazy thing?

1159
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:15,163
Oh, yes, yes.
I know we can get through, Rhett.

1160
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,417
Not we, my dear, you.
I'm leaving you here.

1161
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,837
You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?

1162
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:25,173
- I'm going to join the army.
- You're joking.

1163
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,802
- I could kill you for scaring me so.
- I'm very serious, Scarlett.

1164
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,555
I'm going to join up
with our brave lads in gray.

1165
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,515
But they're running away.

1166
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:37,728
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them.

1167
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,648
- I'm a little late, but better late-
- You must be joking!

1168
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:43,942
Selfish to the end, aren't you?

1169
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:47,696
Thinking of your own hide,
never a thought for the Cause.

1170
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,406
How could you do this to me?

1171
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,701
And why should you go now that
it's all over, and I need you?

1172
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,619
- Why? Why?
- Why?

1173
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:59,041
I've always had a weakness
for lost causes, once they're really lost.

1174
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,459
Or maybe...

1175
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,171
Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.

1176
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:05,881
Who knows?

1177
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:09,009
You should die of shame
to leave me alone and helpless!

1178
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,053
You? Helpless?

1179
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,598
Heaven help the Yankees
if they capture you.

1180
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,892
Now climb down here.

1181
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:18,977
- I want to say goodbye.
- No!

1182
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,897
Climb down!

1183
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:26,360
Rhett, please don't go!

1184
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:29,738
You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!

1185
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:33,825
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.

1186
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:38,163
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh
at myself for being an idiot.

1187
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:42,334
There's one thing I do know,
and that is I love you, Scarlett.

1188
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:46,713
In spite of you and me and the world
going to pieces, I love you.

1189
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,549
Because we're alike.
Bad lots, both of us.

1190
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:54,930
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look
things in the eye and call them by name.

1191
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:57,265
Don't hold me like that!

1192
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,600
Scarlett...

1193
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,268
Look at me.

1194
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,896
I love you more than
I've ever loved any woman.

1195
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:06,024
And I've waited longer
for you than any woman.

1196
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,193
Let me alone!

1197
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:12,614
A soldier of the South loves you.
Wants your arms around him.

1198
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:15,575
Wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle.

1199
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:17,411
Never mind about loving me.

1200
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:21,540
You're a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory.

1201
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,292
Scarlett, kiss me.

1202
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,962
Kiss me once.

1203
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,844
You low-down, cowardly,
nasty thing, you!

1204
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:38,223
They were right. Everybody was right.
You aren't a gentleman.

1205
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,437
A minor point at such a moment.

1206
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,316
Here. If anyone lays a hand
on that nag, shoot him.

1207
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,527
But don't make a mistake
and shoot the nag.

1208
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,988
Go on! I want you to go.

1209
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:56,158
I hope a cannonball blows you
into a million pieces-!

1210
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:59,619
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.

1211
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:04,583
And when I'm dead on the altar of my
country, I hope your conscience irks you.

1212
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,210
Goodbye, Scarlett.

1213
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,989
Come on, you. We're going home.

1214
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,567
Oh, my poor baby.

1215
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:58,113
Don't worry. Mother will take care
of him when we get home.

1216
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:01,241
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.

1217
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:04,786
- We's got to have something to eat.
- Hush up!

1218
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,456
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.

1219
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:10,250
Go on!

1220
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:16,358
Oh, Ashley.

1221
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:20,320
Ashley, I'm glad
you're not here to see this.

1222
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:25,325
The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!

1223
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,217
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.

1224
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,886
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.

1225
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:48,348
We'll be home soon,
and I's scared of cows.

1226
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,851
Tie her onto the back of the wagon
with your petticoat.

1227
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:56,731
We need milk for the baby, and we
don't know what we'll find at home.

1228
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:07,117
Melly, we're home!

1229
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:10,704
We're at Tara.
Hurry! Move, you brute!

1230
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:14,290
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!

1231
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,626
I can't see the house. Is it there?

1232
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,712
I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?

1233
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:26,761
It's all right! It's all right!
They haven't burned it.

1234
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:28,638
It's still there!

1235
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:35,311
Mother! Mother, I'm home!

1236
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,899
Mother! Mother, I'm home!

1237
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:47,907
Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett!

1238
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:55,832
Oh, Pa!

1239
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,917
I'm home.

1240
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:00,837
I'm home.

1241
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:04,799
Katie?

1242
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,761
Katie Scarlett!

1243
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,638
Oh, darlin'!

1244
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,317
Mammy!

1245
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:25,069
Mammy, I'm home.

1246
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:27,322
Honey child...

1247
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,658
Mammy, I'm so...

1248
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:33,119
Where's Mother?

1249
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:35,663
Why...

1250
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:39,709
...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,
they was sick with the typhoid.

1251
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:43,087
They had it bad,
but they's doing all right now.

1252
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:46,633
- Just weak, like little kittens.
- But where's Mother?

1253
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:49,636
Well...

1254
01:36:50,262 --> 01:36:54,057
Miss Ellen. She went down
to nurse that Emmie Slattery...

1255
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:58,186
...that white trash,
and she took down with it too.

1256
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,731
Then last night, she-

1257
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,191
Mother?

1258
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:07,779
Mother?

1259
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:13,201
Mother?

1260
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,290
Mother?

1261
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:16,639
Miss Scarlett, honey.

1262
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,934
If there's anything I can do,
Miss Scarlett...

1263
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:24,480
- What did you do with Melly?
- Don't worry your pretty head.

1264
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,483
I done slapped her in bed,
along with the baby.

1265
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:30,153
You better put that cow into the barn.

1266
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,322
There ain't no barn no more.

1267
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:36,618
- Yankees burned it for firewood.
This was their headquarters.

1268
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,369
They camped all around.

1269
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:39,996
Yankees in Tara?

1270
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:42,916
Yes'm, and they stole
most everything they didn't burn.

1271
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:47,921
All the clothes and all the rugs,
and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.

1272
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,299
I'm starving.
Get me something to eat.

1273
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:54,552
There ain't nothing
to eat, honey. They took it all.

1274
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:56,512
All the chickens? Everything?

1275
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,348
They took them first.

1276
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:01,309
What they didn't eat,
they carried off.

1277
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,354
Don't tell me any more about
what "they" did!

1278
01:39:20,162 --> 01:39:21,663
What's this, Pa?

1279
01:39:22,164 --> 01:39:25,625
- Whiskey?
- Yes, daughter.

1280
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:31,089
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.

1281
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,425
Your not knowing spirits,
you'll make yourself tipsy.

1282
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,719
I hope it makes me drunk.

1283
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,972
I'd like to be drunk.

1284
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,017
Oh, Pa...

1285
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,480
What are those papers?

1286
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:50,650
Bonds.

1287
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,655
They're all we've saved,
all we have left.

1288
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:57,156
Bonds.

1289
01:39:57,408 --> 01:40:00,034
But what kind of bonds, Pa?

1290
01:40:00,285 --> 01:40:02,578
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.

1291
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,747
Confederate bonds.

1292
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,166
What good are they to anybody?

1293
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:10,086
I'll not have you talking like that.

1294
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:13,423
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do
with no money...

1295
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,258
...and nothing to eat?

1296
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:17,969
We must ask your mother.

1297
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:23,182
That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.

1298
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,685
- Ask Mother?
- Yes.

1299
01:40:26,603 --> 01:40:29,647
Mrs. O'Hara will know
what's to be done.

1300
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:34,318
Now don't be bothering me.
Go out for a ride.

1301
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:35,570
I'm busy.

1302
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:55,757
Oh, Pa...

1303
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,426
Don't worry about anything.

1304
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:01,345
Katie Scarlett's home.

1305
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,308
You needn't worry.

1306
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:25,328
What'll we do with nothing
to feed those sick folks and that child?

1307
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:28,664
I don't know, Mammy.

1308
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,249
I don't know.

1309
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:33,252
We ain't got nothing
but radishes in the garden.

1310
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:36,422
Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...

1311
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:39,717
...they's fussing to be sponged off.

1312
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:43,721
- Where are the other servants?
- Only just me and Pork left.

1313
01:41:43,972 --> 01:41:46,182
The others went to war
or runned away.

1314
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:49,769
I can't take care of
that baby and sick folkses too!

1315
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,438
I's only got two hands.

1316
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:57,819
Who's gonna milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.

1317
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,361
As God is my witness...

1318
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:26,115
As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me.

1319
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:29,327
I'm going to live through this,
and when it's all over...

1320
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:34,081
...I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.

1321
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:38,169
If I have to lie, steal,
cheat, or kill...

1322
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:43,549
...as God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!

1323
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,484
My back's near broken.

1324
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:02,404
Look at my hands!

1325
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:05,949
Mother said you could always
tell a lady by her hands.

1326
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:10,579
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore.

1327
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:14,750
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.
I can pick cotton for both of us.

1328
01:51:15,043 --> 01:51:18,545
Scarlett's hateful!
Making us work in the fields-

1329
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,756
Too bad about that.

1330
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:24,009
Get back to work. I can't do
everything at Tara myself.

1331
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,595
What do I care about Tara?
I hate Tara!

1332
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:32,685
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again!

1333
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:36,021
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.

1334
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,781
There's something
I must speak to you about.

1335
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:46,990
What is it?

1336
01:51:47,242 --> 01:51:50,619
I don't like the way
you're treating Prissy and Mammy.

1337
01:51:50,912 --> 01:51:55,624
You must be firm with inferiors,
but gentle with them. Especially darkies.

1338
01:51:55,917 --> 01:51:59,628
I know. But I'm not asking them to do
what I don't do myself.

1339
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:04,800
Nevertheless, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.

1340
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:22,735
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I must talk to you.

1341
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:25,821
You're all working so hard.
I can't just lie in bed.

1342
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:28,574
Go upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.

1343
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,076
- Please, let me.
- Stop being noble.

1344
01:52:31,327 --> 01:52:35,164
I don't need you making yourself
sick so you'll never be any use.

1345
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:38,333
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.

1346
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:36,558
Who's there?
Halt or I'll shoot!

1347
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:44,691
You all alone, little lady?

1348
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:49,696
You ain't very friendly, are you?

1349
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:55,035
You got anything else
besides these earbobs?

1350
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:57,329
You Yankees have been here before.

1351
01:53:58,122 --> 01:54:00,541
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?

1352
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:04,503
What do you got hidden in your hand?

1353
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,249
Scarlett, you killed him.

1354
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:44,877
I'm glad you killed him.

1355
01:54:46,087 --> 01:54:49,756
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?

1356
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:54,887
Don't be scared!

1357
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:59,600
Your sister was cleaning a revolver
and it went off and scared her.

1358
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:02,728
Thank goodness!
We got enough to frighten us.

1359
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:06,231
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful.

1360
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:10,819
What a cool liar you are, Melly.

1361
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:13,822
We gotta get him out of here
and bury him.

1362
01:55:14,115 --> 01:55:15,699
If the Yankees find him here-

1363
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:18,994
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.

1364
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,829
Even so, we've gotta hide him.

1365
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:25,208
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you.

1366
01:55:27,712 --> 01:55:31,089
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft...

1367
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,342
...but how will I get him
out of here?

1368
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:37,512
- We'll both take a leg and drag him.
- You couldn't drag a cat.

1369
01:55:41,517 --> 01:55:42,684
Scarlett...

1370
01:55:43,853 --> 01:55:46,939
Would it be dishonest
if we went through his haversack?

1371
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,524
I'm ashamed I didn't think
of that myself.

1372
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:52,527
You take the haversack.
I'll search his pockets.

1373
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:08,126
You look. I'm feeling a little weak.

1374
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:11,505
I think it's full of money.

1375
01:56:11,756 --> 01:56:15,884
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30-

1376
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:18,387
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time!

1377
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,722
Do you realize this means we can eat?

1378
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:23,183
Look in his other pockets.

1379
01:56:24,852 --> 01:56:26,353
Hurry, hurry!

1380
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:28,563
We've got to get him out of here.

1381
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:44,913
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it.

1382
01:56:45,164 --> 01:56:48,041
Give me your nightgown.
I'll wad it round his head.

1383
01:56:48,292 --> 01:56:53,422
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.

1384
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:09,438
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.

1385
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:12,441
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.

1386
01:57:12,692 --> 01:57:14,901
I'll clean up my mess
when I've buried him.

1387
01:57:15,403 --> 01:57:17,696
No, I'll clean it up.

1388
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:23,243
Well, I guess I've done murder.

1389
01:57:24,954 --> 01:57:29,458
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

1390
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:42,721
Katie Scarlett!

1391
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:44,723
It's over! It's over!

1392
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:49,102
It's all over, the war.
Lee surrendered!

1393
01:57:49,353 --> 01:57:51,772
- It's not possible.
- Why did we ever fight?

1394
01:57:51,981 --> 01:57:53,607
Ashley will be coming home.

1395
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,234
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.

1396
01:57:56,444 --> 01:58:00,781
We'll plant more cotton.
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.

1397
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:25,889
The flag that makes you free

1398
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:29,142
So we sing the chorus
From Atlanta to the sea

1399
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:32,979
While we were marching through Georgia

1400
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:35,190
Get out of the road, rebel!

1401
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,651
Have you room for a dying man?

1402
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:41,321
Not for any Southern scum,
alive or dead. Get out of the way!

1403
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:44,658
I reckon he'd rather try
and walk it, at that.

1404
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:46,993
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!

1405
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:49,371
Acts like they won the war.

1406
01:58:49,831 --> 01:58:52,332
You come on, give me
them pants, Mr. Kennedy.

1407
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:53,792
Come on!

1408
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,381
Scrub yourself with that lye soap,
'fore I scrub you myself.

1409
01:58:59,632 --> 01:59:02,717
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boiling pot.

1410
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:07,639
The whole army's
got the same troubles...

1411
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:10,517
...crawling clothes and dysentery.

1412
01:59:10,726 --> 01:59:12,644
It's humiliating how
you're treating him.

1413
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:16,690
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.

1414
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:20,026
Oh, come on, Beau!

1415
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:24,447
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.

1416
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:27,534
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.

1417
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:28,994
Nice little fella.

1418
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:32,497
Another two years, and we could've
had him in Cobb's Legion.

1419
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:36,501
- Were you in Cobb's Legion?
Yes, ma'am.

1420
01:59:36,752 --> 01:59:40,213
Why, then, you must know
my husband, Major Wilkes?

1421
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:44,009
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured
at Spotsylvania, I think.

1422
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:48,221
Captured? Oh, thank heaven!
Then he isn't-

1423
01:59:48,472 --> 01:59:51,683
- My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
Melanie?

1424
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:55,437
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.

1425
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,023
I'll watch out for him.
We're good friends.

1426
01:59:58,274 --> 01:59:59,858
Thank you.

1427
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:07,115
I slave day and night
just so we can have enough food...

1428
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:09,618
...and you give it away
to scarecrows.

1429
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:13,622
- I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
- Don't scold me, Scarlett.

1430
02:00:13,789 --> 02:00:16,499
I've just heard that Ashley
was taken prisoner.

1431
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:18,210
- Ashley a prisoner?
- Yes.

1432
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:22,797
And maybe if he's alive and well,
he's on some Northern road right now.

1433
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:26,134
Maybe a Northern woman
is giving him some of her dinner...

1434
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:29,888
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.

1435
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:34,100
- I hope so, Melly.
Miss Scarlett?

1436
02:00:37,438 --> 02:00:41,816
I want to take up something
with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to-

1437
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:44,611
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.

1438
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:46,821
Well, I- I...

1439
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:49,908
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming
to ask for Suellen.

1440
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:55,080
Are you telling me you haven't asked
for her after all these years?

1441
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:58,959
The truth is, I'm so much
older than she is...

1442
02:00:59,168 --> 02:01:01,169
...and now I haven't
a cent to my name.

1443
02:01:01,462 --> 02:01:03,046
Who has, nowadays?

1444
02:01:03,297 --> 02:01:06,007
Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...

1445
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:09,010
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

1446
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:12,430
I'd go and get myself a little business,
if we're engaged.

1447
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:14,975
- As soon as I'm on my feet again-
- All right, Frank.

1448
02:01:15,184 --> 02:01:18,687
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.

1449
02:01:19,146 --> 02:01:22,190
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.

1450
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:27,445
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.

1451
02:01:29,323 --> 02:01:32,200
What seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

1452
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:36,204
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.

1453
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:37,872
Oh, I'm so glad.

1454
02:01:38,207 --> 02:01:42,544
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.

1455
02:01:46,215 --> 02:01:48,133
Oh, another one!

1456
02:01:48,384 --> 02:01:50,677
- Hope this one isn't hungry.
- He'll be hungry.

1457
02:01:50,886 --> 02:01:53,388
I'll tell Prissy to get
an extra plate-

1458
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:06,359
Ashley!

1459
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,071
Ashley!

1460
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:23,918
Miss Scarlett!

1461
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:25,337
Don't spoil it.

1462
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:28,423
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!

1463
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,717
He's her husband, ain't he?

1464
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:44,939
- Miss Scarlett?
- High time you got back.

1465
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:48,193
- Did you get the horse shod?
- Yes'm, he's shod.

1466
02:02:48,402 --> 02:02:50,779
Fine thing, horses
get shoes and humans can't.

1467
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,655
Here, stir this soap.

1468
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,074
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?

1469
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:57,535
I gotta know how much money
have you got left. In gold.

1470
02:02:57,745 --> 02:02:59,746
Ten dollars. Why?

1471
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:01,748
That won't be enough.

1472
02:03:01,957 --> 02:03:03,708
What are you talking about?

1473
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:08,171
Well, I see'd that old no-count
white-trash Wilkerson...

1474
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:10,965
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

1475
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:14,719
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...

1476
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:19,933
...that his Carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

1477
02:03:20,184 --> 02:03:24,729
- How much more we got to pay?
- I hear the taxman say $300.

1478
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:26,398
Three hundred-!

1479
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:31,820
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

1480
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:34,739
Yes'm. How?

1481
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:40,161
- I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
- He ain't got no $300.

1482
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:43,081
Well, I can ask him
if I want to, can't I?

1483
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:47,168
Asking ain't getting.

1484
02:03:56,178 --> 02:03:57,720
Ashley...

1485
02:03:58,722 --> 02:04:01,850
They say Abe Lincoln
got his start splitting rails.

1486
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:05,019
Just think what heights I may
climb to, once I get the knack.

1487
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:09,524
Ashley, the Yankees
want $300 more in taxes.

1488
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:12,277
What shall we do?

1489
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:14,988
Ashley, what's to become of us?

1490
02:04:15,197 --> 02:04:18,741
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

1491
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:21,661
Those with brains and courage
come through all right.

1492
02:04:21,871 --> 02:04:23,538
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

1493
02:04:23,789 --> 02:04:25,039
For heaven's sake...

1494
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:28,751
...don't talk nonsense
when it's us being winnowed out!

1495
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:33,548
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am
talking tommyrot about civilization...

1496
02:04:33,799 --> 02:04:35,884
...while your Tara is in danger.

1497
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:38,970
You've come to me for help,
and I've none to give.

1498
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:43,141
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.

1499
02:04:43,517 --> 02:04:45,643
You, Ashley? A coward?

1500
02:04:46,228 --> 02:04:47,770
What are you afraid of?

1501
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:52,525
Mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

1502
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:55,278
Not that I mind splitting rails.

1503
02:04:55,654 --> 02:05:00,408
But I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.

1504
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:07,081
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

1505
02:05:07,374 --> 02:05:08,583
But the war did come.

1506
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:11,753
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

1507
02:05:12,004 --> 02:05:15,089
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

1508
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:20,512
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

1509
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:22,931
A world in which there's
no place for me.

1510
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,811
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.

1511
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:31,731
You never mind facing realities.

1512
02:05:32,441 --> 02:05:34,943
You never want to escape
from them as I do.

1513
02:05:37,613 --> 02:05:39,239
Escape?

1514
02:05:40,324 --> 02:05:44,452
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.

1515
02:05:44,745 --> 02:05:49,457
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

1516
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:53,211
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton
till I can't stand it.

1517
02:05:53,462 --> 02:05:55,755
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!

1518
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:59,884
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us.

1519
02:06:02,137 --> 02:06:03,596
Oh, Ashley...

1520
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:07,100
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.

1521
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:10,311
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.

1522
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:12,605
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!

1523
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:16,276
You don't love Melanie. You said
you loved me at Twelve Oaks.

1524
02:06:16,485 --> 02:06:18,653
And anyway, Melanie can't-

1525
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:22,657
Dr. Meade said she can't have
more children. I could give you-

1526
02:06:22,908 --> 02:06:24,492
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?

1527
02:06:24,785 --> 02:06:26,995
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?

1528
02:06:27,288 --> 02:06:30,331
Can you honestly say
you don't love me?

1529
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,418
- No, I don't love you.
- It's a lie!

1530
02:06:33,627 --> 02:06:36,588
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?

1531
02:06:36,797 --> 02:06:39,507
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

1532
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,093
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!

1533
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,972
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

1534
02:06:47,182 --> 02:06:49,267
You've carried the load
for all of us.

1535
02:06:49,476 --> 02:06:52,520
From now on, I'll be more help
to you. I promise.

1536
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:54,689
There's only one way you can help me.

1537
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:59,110
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.

1538
02:06:59,987 --> 02:07:01,404
Nothing?

1539
02:07:02,906 --> 02:07:05,158
Nothing except honor.

1540
02:07:17,713 --> 02:07:21,466
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.

1541
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:26,429
You mustn't. Please,
my brave dear, you mustn't.

1542
02:07:38,525 --> 02:07:41,235
You do love me! You do love me!

1543
02:07:41,445 --> 02:07:43,738
- No, don't, don't.
- You love me.

1544
02:07:44,031 --> 02:07:46,199
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!

1545
02:07:46,408 --> 02:07:49,202
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.

1546
02:07:49,453 --> 02:07:52,080
- Say it. You love me.
- All right, I'll say it.

1547
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:56,417
I love your courage and stubbornness
so much that I could forget...

1548
02:07:56,585 --> 02:08:01,255
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!

1549
02:08:10,432 --> 02:08:12,934
Then there's nothing left for me.

1550
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,062
Nothing to fight for.

1551
02:08:16,772 --> 02:08:18,981
Nothing to live for.

1552
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,569
Yes, there is something.

1553
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:26,864
Something you love better than me...

1554
02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:28,991
...though you may not know it.

1555
02:08:34,998 --> 02:08:36,499
Tara.

1556
02:08:39,878 --> 02:08:41,212
Yes.

1557
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:45,258
I still have this.

1558
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:51,514
You needn't go.

1559
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:56,310
I won't have you all starve, simply
because I threw myself at your head.

1560
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,230
It won't happen again.

1561
02:09:26,842 --> 02:09:28,009
It's Emmie Slattery.

1562
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:29,469
- Yes'm, it's me.
Stop!

1563
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:33,639
You haven't forgotten
your old overseer, have you?

1564
02:09:34,349 --> 02:09:36,350
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

1565
02:09:36,602 --> 02:09:39,187
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!

1566
02:09:39,646 --> 02:09:41,355
You can't speak that way to my wife.

1567
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:43,649
Wife? High time
you made her your wife.

1568
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:46,277
Who baptized your brats
after you killed my mother?

1569
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,488
We came out here to pay a call.

1570
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:51,699
A friendly call, and talk business
with old friends.

1571
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:54,368
Friends? When were we ever friends?

1572
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:57,705
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

1573
02:09:57,956 --> 02:09:59,332
Your father's turned idiot.

1574
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:03,461
You can't pay your taxes, and I come
to offer to buy the place from you.

1575
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:07,089
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.

1576
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:09,300
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!

1577
02:10:09,551 --> 02:10:14,138
You'll see who's running
things when you're sold out for taxes.

1578
02:10:14,389 --> 02:10:16,682
I'll buy this place
and I'll live in it!

1579
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,519
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.

1580
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:22,230
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

1581
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,358
You'll be sorry for that.

1582
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,243
We'll be back!

1583
02:10:35,494 --> 02:10:38,079
I'll show you who
the owner of Tara is!

1584
02:10:43,377 --> 02:10:44,919
Pa, come back!

1585
02:10:47,923 --> 02:10:49,757
Pa, come back!

1586
02:10:51,885 --> 02:10:53,386
Yankee coward!

1587
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,353
Pa!

1588
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,877
Lordy, Miss Scarlett,
that's Mr. Gerald's watch!

1589
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:29,088
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

1590
02:11:29,298 --> 02:11:32,550
You ain't got no business
parting from this watch now.

1591
02:11:32,801 --> 02:11:36,095
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

1592
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:38,973
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?

1593
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:41,976
And don't cry.

1594
02:11:42,185 --> 02:11:44,812
I can stand everybody's
tears but yours.

1595
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:51,068
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

1596
02:11:56,325 --> 02:12:00,703
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.

1597
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:04,832
- Think about your Pa like he used to be.
- I can't think about Pa.

1598
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:07,251
I can't think of anything
but that $300.

1599
02:12:07,502 --> 02:12:11,923
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.

1600
02:12:12,215 --> 02:12:16,302
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags
got that much money now.

1601
02:12:17,804 --> 02:12:18,846
Rhett.

1602
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:21,724
Who that? A Yankee?

1603
02:12:25,979 --> 02:12:29,607
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...

1604
02:12:29,816 --> 02:12:32,151
...and I haven't any clothes.

1605
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:44,246
Go and get Ma's old box
of dress patterns.

1606
02:12:44,498 --> 02:12:47,208
- What you up to?
- You'll make me a new dress.

1607
02:12:47,459 --> 02:12:49,877
Not with Miss Ellen's portiÃ¨res!

1608
02:12:50,128 --> 02:12:52,838
Great balls of fire!
They're my portiÃ¨res now.

1609
02:12:53,048 --> 02:12:56,759
I'm going to Atlanta for $300,
and I've got to look like a queen.

1610
02:12:56,969 --> 02:12:58,761
- Who's going with you?
- I'll go alone.

1611
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:03,057
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.

1612
02:13:03,308 --> 02:13:06,060
- Mammy, darling.
- No use to try to sweet talk me.

1613
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:08,771
I knows you since I put
diapers on you.

1614
02:13:09,022 --> 02:13:12,066
I said I's going with you,
and going I is!

1615
02:13:12,275 --> 02:13:15,486
Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.

1616
02:13:16,196 --> 02:13:18,489
It's a pity the war
wasn't a poker game.

1617
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:21,575
You'd done better than Grant,
with far less effort.

1618
02:13:21,743 --> 02:13:22,785
What is it?

1619
02:13:23,036 --> 02:13:26,580
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.

1620
02:13:26,873 --> 02:13:28,416
Another sister?

1621
02:13:28,667 --> 02:13:30,918
This is a jail not a harem, captain.

1622
02:13:31,211 --> 02:13:34,588
No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.

1623
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:37,425
She has?

1624
02:13:38,051 --> 02:13:41,595
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.

1625
02:13:42,806 --> 02:13:46,600
Let's see, my losses for
the afternoon come to what?

1626
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,520
Three hundred and forty?

1627
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:52,523
My debts do mount up,
don't they, major?

1628
02:13:52,733 --> 02:13:57,528
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.

1629
02:13:57,738 --> 02:14:00,781
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1630
02:14:05,037 --> 02:14:09,707
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

1631
02:14:10,625 --> 02:14:13,127
- Rhett!
- Scarlett!

1632
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:16,422
My dear little sister!

1633
02:14:16,798 --> 02:14:21,427
It's all right, corporal. My sister
has brought me no files or saws.

1634
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,641
Can I really kiss you?

1635
02:14:27,934 --> 02:14:29,810
On the forehead, like a good brother.

1636
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:33,314
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope
for better things.

1637
02:14:33,565 --> 02:14:36,484
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.

1638
02:14:36,735 --> 02:14:40,654
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?

1639
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:42,490
Would you be sorry?

1640
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,408
- Oh, Rhett.
- Well, don't worry yet.

1641
02:14:44,659 --> 02:14:47,745
They trumped up a charge,
but they really want my money.

1642
02:14:47,996 --> 02:14:50,664
They think I made off
with the Confederate treasury.

1643
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,459
- Well, did you?
- What a leading question.

1644
02:14:53,668 --> 02:14:55,878
Let's not talk about things
like money.

1645
02:14:56,129 --> 02:14:59,507
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!

1646
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:02,510
How you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

1647
02:15:02,803 --> 02:15:07,306
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.

1648
02:15:08,141 --> 02:15:10,351
You look good enough to eat,
and prosperous.

1649
02:15:10,602 --> 02:15:14,021
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...

1650
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:17,775
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

1651
02:15:18,026 --> 02:15:20,528
You're heartless,
but that's part of your charm.

1652
02:15:20,695 --> 02:15:22,863
You've got more charm
than the law allows.

1653
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,449
I didn't come to talk
silliness about me.

1654
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:28,536
I was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble.

1655
02:15:28,787 --> 02:15:31,705
I was mad at you when
you left me on the road to Tara.

1656
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:34,875
- And I still haven't forgiven you.
- Don't say that.

1657
02:15:35,127 --> 02:15:39,046
Well, I must admit I might not be
alive now, only for you.

1658
02:15:39,297 --> 02:15:43,050
When I think of myself
with anything I could possibly hope for...

1659
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:47,138
...not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail.

1660
02:15:47,347 --> 02:15:51,058
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!

1661
02:15:51,726 --> 02:15:54,145
Listen to me trying to make jokes...

1662
02:15:54,354 --> 02:15:56,063
...when I really want to cry.

1663
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:58,315
In a minute I shall cry.

1664
02:16:01,736 --> 02:16:03,028
Scarlett...

1665
02:16:03,363 --> 02:16:04,905
Can it be possible that-?

1666
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:06,949
Can what be possible, Rhett?

1667
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:10,703
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.

1668
02:16:10,954 --> 02:16:14,039
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

1669
02:16:15,876 --> 02:16:19,170
It's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

1670
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:22,756
It's well worth it.

1671
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:29,597
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolia.

1672
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:33,767
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?

1673
02:16:34,102 --> 02:16:39,190
- I went riding without my gloves-
- You've been working like a field hand!

1674
02:16:39,399 --> 02:16:41,567
Why did you lie,
and what are you up to?

1675
02:16:41,776 --> 02:16:44,904
- I almost believed you cared.
- But I do care!

1676
02:16:45,113 --> 02:16:48,240
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...

1677
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:50,576
...to put on quite a
show in your velvets.

1678
02:16:50,785 --> 02:16:53,204
What is it? Money?

1679
02:16:53,413 --> 02:16:55,998
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

1680
02:16:56,249 --> 02:16:58,709
I lied when I said
everything was all right.

1681
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:03,464
Things are as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions.

1682
02:17:04,466 --> 02:17:06,050
What collateral do you have?

1683
02:17:06,259 --> 02:17:07,760
- My earbobs.
- Not interested.

1684
02:17:07,969 --> 02:17:10,262
- Mortgage on Tara.
- What would I do with a farm?

1685
02:17:10,472 --> 02:17:14,892
- I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
- Not good enough.

1686
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:19,813
You once said you loved me.

1687
02:17:20,023 --> 02:17:21,482
If you still love me...

1688
02:17:22,275 --> 02:17:24,652
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.

1689
02:17:25,528 --> 02:17:28,280
No, I haven't forgotten.

1690
02:17:33,536 --> 02:17:35,663
You're not worth $300.

1691
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:38,791
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

1692
02:17:39,251 --> 02:17:42,086
I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

1693
02:17:42,337 --> 02:17:46,006
I won't let Tara go! I can't while
there's a breath left in my body.

1694
02:17:46,174 --> 02:17:49,843
Oh, Rhett, won't you please
give me the money?

1695
02:17:50,136 --> 02:17:52,179
I couldn't if I wanted to.

1696
02:17:52,430 --> 02:17:54,348
My funds are in Liverpool,
not Atlanta.

1697
02:17:54,599 --> 02:17:58,352
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me
like a duck on a June bug.

1698
02:17:58,603 --> 02:18:02,356
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

1699
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:09,280
Here, here. Stop it! You want
the Yankees to see you like this?

1700
02:18:09,531 --> 02:18:13,617
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.

1701
02:18:13,868 --> 02:18:17,037
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and you let me go on!

1702
02:18:17,205 --> 02:18:19,957
I enjoyed hearing
what you had to say. Cheer up.

1703
02:18:20,166 --> 02:18:22,376
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.

1704
02:18:22,627 --> 02:18:24,378
I'll come to your hanging!

1705
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:28,632
I'm just afraid they won't hang you
in time to pay the taxes on Tara!

1706
02:18:35,181 --> 02:18:36,724
Tell him Belle Watling.

1707
02:18:36,891 --> 02:18:39,893
Where you been? I thought
you deserted Captain Butler.

1708
02:18:40,186 --> 02:18:42,813
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.

1709
02:18:51,531 --> 02:18:55,409
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.

1710
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:57,202
You know a dyed-haired woman?

1711
02:18:57,412 --> 02:19:00,581
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.

1712
02:19:02,667 --> 02:19:04,543
Whatever they done
to you in there...

1713
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:08,714
...they didn't do no more than you
deserve for visiting white trash.

1714
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,848
Fresh and green.
Right off the farm.

1715
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:21,769
What you doing tonight, Susie?
That's a Georgia peach!

1716
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:23,687
Nothing like that in Ohio.

1717
02:19:23,855 --> 02:19:25,272
You know what we'll do?

1718
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,482
What?

1719
02:19:26,649 --> 02:19:29,526
We're gonna give every one of you
40 acres and a mule.

1720
02:19:29,778 --> 02:19:32,529
And a mule?
- Forty acres and a mule!

1721
02:19:32,697 --> 02:19:35,115
Gee!
- Because we're your friend.

1722
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:39,661
And you're gonna become voters
and vote like your friends do!

1723
02:19:41,581 --> 02:19:44,041
What's your hurry?
What's come over this town?

1724
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:47,961
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.

1725
02:19:50,131 --> 02:19:51,965
Out of our way, trash!

1726
02:19:52,258 --> 02:19:54,885
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.

1727
02:20:03,186 --> 02:20:04,686
It can't be Miss Scarlett!

1728
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:06,605
Frank Kennedy!
And Mammy.

1729
02:20:06,815 --> 02:20:08,690
It's good to see home folks.

1730
02:20:08,942 --> 02:20:11,777
I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know you were.

1731
02:20:11,986 --> 02:20:14,279
Didn't Suellen tell you
about my store?

1732
02:20:14,489 --> 02:20:17,408
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

1733
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:21,161
- This?
- Won't you come in, look around a bit?

1734
02:20:29,337 --> 02:20:31,839
I don't suppose
it looks like much to a lady...

1735
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:34,341
...but I can't help being proud of it.

1736
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:37,428
- You're not making money?
- Well, I can't complain.

1737
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:39,346
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

1738
02:20:39,597 --> 02:20:42,015
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.

1739
02:20:42,308 --> 02:20:45,185
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.

1740
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:48,730
- Are you doing as well as all that?
- Yes, I am.

1741
02:20:48,982 --> 02:20:50,607
I'm no millionaire yet...

1742
02:20:50,859 --> 02:20:53,277
...but I've cleared $1000 already.

1743
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:54,987
And lumber too.

1744
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:59,366
- That's only a sideline.
- A sideline, Frank?

1745
02:20:59,534 --> 02:21:03,454
With all the good Georgia pine
around Atlanta, and all this building?

1746
02:21:03,663 --> 02:21:06,373
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...

1747
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:08,959
...and I gotta think
about buying a home.

1748
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:10,544
Why would you want a home?

1749
02:21:10,795 --> 02:21:13,046
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.

1750
02:21:13,506 --> 02:21:14,965
Here in Atlanta.

1751
02:21:15,175 --> 02:21:17,468
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.

1752
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,387
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

1753
02:21:21,264 --> 02:21:23,182
I don't know what you mean.

1754
02:21:24,058 --> 02:21:25,809
I don't mean a thing.

1755
02:21:26,478 --> 02:21:29,313
How'd you like to drive me
to my Aunt Pitty's?

1756
02:21:29,647 --> 02:21:31,982
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.

1757
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:33,775
You better stay to supper.

1758
02:21:34,027 --> 02:21:37,196
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,
and I'd like a long visit.

1759
02:21:37,405 --> 02:21:40,908
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

1760
02:21:41,242 --> 02:21:43,285
And will you tell me all the news...

1761
02:21:43,536 --> 02:21:44,912
...of Miss Suellen?

1762
02:21:48,082 --> 02:21:51,168
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

1763
02:21:51,669 --> 02:21:55,172
Oh, no, no. I thought
surely she had written you.

1764
02:21:55,381 --> 02:21:58,592
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.

1765
02:21:58,843 --> 02:22:01,094
How awful to have such a mean sister.

1766
02:22:01,429 --> 02:22:03,180
You must tell me.

1767
02:22:03,431 --> 02:22:05,390
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

1768
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,936
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

1769
02:22:10,021 --> 02:22:13,690
She got tired of waiting,
was afraid she'd be an old maid and...

1770
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:16,818
Oh, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.

1771
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:19,947
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.

1772
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,450
Would you mind if I put my hand
in your pocket?

1773
02:22:39,467 --> 02:22:42,302
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done!

1774
02:22:42,554 --> 02:22:44,972
She's gone and married
my Mr. Kennedy!

1775
02:22:45,223 --> 02:22:47,266
He's my beau and she's married him!

1776
02:22:47,475 --> 02:22:50,727
- She did it to save Tara.
- I hate Tara!

1777
02:22:50,979 --> 02:22:54,565
I hate Scarlett! She's
the only thing I hate worse than Tara!

1778
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,612
It's all my fault.

1779
02:23:01,447 --> 02:23:04,616
I should've committed robbery
to get that tax money for you.

1780
02:23:04,867 --> 02:23:07,119
I couldn't let you do
anything like that.

1781
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:08,787
Anyway, it's done now.

1782
02:23:08,997 --> 02:23:11,164
Yes, it's done now.

1783
02:23:11,374 --> 02:23:13,500
You won't let me do
anything dishonorable...

1784
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:16,837
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

1785
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:19,840
You won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

1786
02:23:21,509 --> 02:23:22,926
What do you mean?

1787
02:23:23,177 --> 02:23:25,012
I'm going to New York.

1788
02:23:26,264 --> 02:23:27,973
I've arranged
for a position in a bank.

1789
02:23:28,182 --> 02:23:30,183
But you can't do that.

1790
02:23:32,395 --> 02:23:35,814
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and...

1791
02:23:35,982 --> 02:23:37,024
I counted on you.

1792
02:23:37,275 --> 02:23:40,027
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.

1793
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,696
You know as much as you do
about banking...

1794
02:23:42,989 --> 02:23:45,699
...and I'd give you half the business.

1795
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:48,493
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

1796
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,454
But it isn't that.

1797
02:23:50,663 --> 02:23:53,540
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

1798
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:56,209
...I'd bury any hope
of ever standing alone.

1799
02:23:56,461 --> 02:23:57,794
Oh, is that all?

1800
02:23:58,004 --> 02:24:02,716
You could gradually buy the business,
and then it would be your own and-

1801
02:24:03,384 --> 02:24:04,843
No, Scarlett.

1802
02:24:07,472 --> 02:24:09,848
Oh! Ashley!

1803
02:24:17,315 --> 02:24:18,899
Ashley!

1804
02:24:26,366 --> 02:24:27,449
Scarlett?

1805
02:24:28,826 --> 02:24:30,077
Scarlett, what is it?

1806
02:24:30,328 --> 02:24:32,704
Ashley's so mean and hateful!

1807
02:24:32,955 --> 02:24:34,665
What have you done?

1808
02:24:35,375 --> 02:24:37,918
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

1809
02:24:38,503 --> 02:24:42,172
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!

1810
02:24:42,757 --> 02:24:44,549
How unchivalrous of you.

1811
02:24:44,759 --> 02:24:46,760
Why, think, Ashley, think!

1812
02:24:47,011 --> 02:24:50,097
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...

1813
02:24:50,264 --> 02:24:52,766
...and maybe we wouldn't have
little Beau.

1814
02:24:52,975 --> 02:24:55,435
When I think of her picking cotton
and plowing...

1815
02:24:55,687 --> 02:24:58,230
...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just-

1816
02:24:58,439 --> 02:25:00,524
Oh, my darling.

1817
02:25:04,570 --> 02:25:07,280
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.

1818
02:25:09,492 --> 02:25:11,410
I can't fight you both.

1819
02:25:26,259 --> 02:25:28,260
Come on, lift them feet!

1820
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:33,515
There's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.

1821
02:25:33,766 --> 02:25:36,810
The pick of all the best jails
in Georgia.

1822
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:40,313
They look thin and weak.
Halt!

1823
02:25:42,942 --> 02:25:44,317
They're the best you can lease.

1824
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:47,279
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher
a free hand...

1825
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,740
...you'll get what you want
out of them.

1826
02:25:49,949 --> 02:25:51,825
All right, you're the foreman.

1827
02:25:52,076 --> 02:25:55,412
Just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.

1828
02:25:55,663 --> 02:25:58,498
Johnnie Gallegher's
your man, miss. But remember...

1829
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:01,293
...no questions and no interference.

1830
02:26:01,669 --> 02:26:04,129
That's a bargain.
Start in the morning.

1831
02:26:04,338 --> 02:26:06,298
Come on, get a move on there!

1832
02:26:06,507 --> 02:26:11,261
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman-

1833
02:26:11,471 --> 02:26:12,679
Why do you complain?

1834
02:26:12,972 --> 02:26:15,182
You wouldn't own a mill
if I didn't take over.

1835
02:26:15,349 --> 02:26:17,058
But I didn't want the mill.

1836
02:26:17,268 --> 02:26:20,937
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't
pressed our friends for their debts.

1837
02:26:21,105 --> 02:26:22,272
Isn't that right, Ashley?

1838
02:26:22,482 --> 02:26:24,566
Are you running
a charitable institution?

1839
02:26:24,817 --> 02:26:28,195
Go back to the store, and go home
and take your medicine.

1840
02:26:28,488 --> 02:26:30,030
Sugar, don't you think-?

1841
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:33,950
Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar. "

1842
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:37,621
All right. All right.
Good night, Ashley.

1843
02:26:38,206 --> 02:26:39,706
My, my!

1844
02:26:39,957 --> 02:26:43,126
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

1845
02:26:44,462 --> 02:26:46,296
I don't like to interfere...

1846
02:26:46,506 --> 02:26:49,841
...but I wish you'd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts.

1847
02:26:50,092 --> 02:26:51,218
We could do better.

1848
02:26:51,511 --> 02:26:54,221
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.

1849
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:56,181
If we give Gallegher a free hand-

1850
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:59,643
A free hand? That means
he'll starve and whip them.

1851
02:26:59,894 --> 02:27:01,895
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.

1852
02:27:02,104 --> 02:27:03,480
How you do run on.

1853
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:06,316
If I let you alone,
you'd give them chicken...

1854
02:27:06,567 --> 02:27:08,610
...and tuck them in with quilts.

1855
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:12,572
I won't make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others.

1856
02:27:12,824 --> 02:27:14,324
You didn't mind owning slaves.

1857
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:17,160
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

1858
02:27:17,411 --> 02:27:19,412
I'd have freed them
when father died...

1859
02:27:19,705 --> 02:27:21,832
...if the war hadn't
already freed them.

1860
02:27:22,083 --> 02:27:23,583
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

1861
02:27:23,751 --> 02:27:26,002
Do you forget what it's like
without money?

1862
02:27:26,254 --> 02:27:29,005
Money is the most
important thing in the world.

1863
02:27:29,215 --> 02:27:31,341
I don't intend to be without it again.

1864
02:27:31,592 --> 02:27:35,887
I'll make enough the only way I know
how so the Yankees can't take Tara.

1865
02:27:36,138 --> 02:27:38,515
We're not the only Southerners
who've suffered.

1866
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:42,394
Look at all our friends. They're
keeping their honor and kindness.

1867
02:27:42,645 --> 02:27:46,147
And they're starving. I've no use
for fools who won't help themselves.

1868
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:48,608
I know what they say about me.
I don't care.

1869
02:27:48,776 --> 02:27:51,570
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game.

1870
02:27:51,779 --> 02:27:53,655
And you'll beat them with me.

1871
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:59,369
That's it. Pull it
a little over to that side.

1872
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:02,163
- Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
- Good afternoon.

1873
02:28:02,415 --> 02:28:05,041
- Business is certainly growing.
- It certainly is.

1874
02:28:06,752 --> 02:28:08,879
You're doing business
with the people...

1875
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:12,090
...who robbed us, tortured us
and left us to starve.

1876
02:28:12,258 --> 02:28:13,300
All that's past.

1877
02:28:13,593 --> 02:28:17,178
I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.

1878
02:28:19,807 --> 02:28:22,976
And do you know that Dr. Meade
actually saw her...

1879
02:28:23,227 --> 02:28:26,563
- ... peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
- That isn't all.

1880
02:28:26,772 --> 02:28:29,482
It's shocking what she's doing
to my brother.

1881
02:28:29,692 --> 02:28:32,611
She's even taken to driving
her own buggy.

1882
02:28:40,119 --> 02:28:43,496
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!

1883
02:28:43,706 --> 02:28:45,999
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me!

1884
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:49,920
You could've had my millions
if you'd just waited a while.

1885
02:28:50,171 --> 02:28:51,588
Oh, how fickle is woman!

1886
02:28:51,839 --> 02:28:54,090
What is it you want?
I have things to do.

1887
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:58,261
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me?

1888
02:28:58,471 --> 02:28:59,679
Well, what is it?

1889
02:29:00,222 --> 02:29:04,309
Tell me, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?

1890
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:07,854
How'd you get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?

1891
02:29:08,356 --> 02:29:11,608
Oh, that! There's nothing much
that money won't buy.

1892
02:29:11,817 --> 02:29:15,153
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

1893
02:29:15,446 --> 02:29:19,366
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.

1894
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:24,329
You still think you're the belle of the
county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.

1895
02:29:24,538 --> 02:29:27,666
- That every man is in love with you.
- Let me by.

1896
02:29:28,542 --> 02:29:31,628
Don't be angry.
Tell me, where are you going?

1897
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:34,965
- I'm going out to the mill.
- Through Shantytown alone?

1898
02:29:35,216 --> 02:29:38,510
It's dangerous to drive alone
through all that riffraff.

1899
02:29:38,761 --> 02:29:40,178
Don't worry about me.

1900
02:29:40,388 --> 02:29:43,723
I can shoot straight,
if I don't have to shoot too far.

1901
02:29:50,856 --> 02:29:52,482
What a woman!

1902
02:30:27,101 --> 02:30:28,268
Give me a quarter.

1903
02:30:28,686 --> 02:30:30,061
Let go of my horse!

1904
02:30:32,398 --> 02:30:33,898
Hold this horse.

1905
02:30:39,947 --> 02:30:41,614
- Let go!
- Give me that gun.

1906
02:30:44,535 --> 02:30:46,828
Help! Help!

1907
02:30:49,206 --> 02:30:50,457
Help!

1908
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:04,721
Help!

1909
02:31:24,492 --> 02:31:25,492
Miss Scarlett!

1910
02:31:43,427 --> 02:31:44,469
Wait!

1911
02:31:44,887 --> 02:31:46,679
Miss Scarlett, wait!

1912
02:31:46,889 --> 02:31:48,264
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

1913
02:31:48,599 --> 02:31:50,183
It's Sam!
- Big Sam?

1914
02:31:50,851 --> 02:31:51,935
Miss Scarlett, wait!

1915
02:31:54,772 --> 02:31:56,481
Sam! Sam!

1916
02:31:56,690 --> 02:31:59,818
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?

1917
02:32:00,486 --> 02:32:04,405
Don't you cry. Big Sam will get
you out of this in a jiffy.

1918
02:32:05,199 --> 02:32:06,908
Horse, make tracks!

1919
02:32:10,329 --> 02:32:12,539
Get to Tara as quick
as you can and stay there.

1920
02:32:12,832 --> 02:32:15,291
I will. I's had enough
of them Carpetbaggers.

1921
02:32:15,543 --> 02:32:17,544
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.

1922
02:32:17,837 --> 02:32:19,420
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.

1923
02:32:19,672 --> 02:32:22,715
Change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's.

1924
02:32:23,008 --> 02:32:24,676
I've got to go
to a political meeting.

1925
02:32:24,927 --> 02:32:29,556
How can you go to a political meeting
after what I've been through?

1926
02:32:29,807 --> 02:32:32,559
Oh, sugar.
You're more scared than hurt.

1927
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,477
Nobody cares about me.

1928
02:32:34,728 --> 02:32:37,730
You all act as though
it were nothing at all.

1929
02:32:58,752 --> 02:33:01,337
The men talk
about protecting our women...

1930
02:33:01,589 --> 02:33:05,758
...and then after what happened to me,
Frank went to a political meeting.

1931
02:33:09,555 --> 02:33:12,473
And if it won't pain you too much,
India Wilkes...

1932
02:33:12,683 --> 02:33:16,728
...tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?

1933
02:33:16,937 --> 02:33:18,271
It won't pain me.

1934
02:33:18,564 --> 02:33:21,065
What happened today
was just what you deserved.

1935
02:33:21,275 --> 02:33:23,234
With any justice,
you'd have gotten worse.

1936
02:33:23,485 --> 02:33:26,487
India, hush up.
- Let her talk. She's always hated me.

1937
02:33:26,739 --> 02:33:30,283
Ever since I took Charles away,
though she won't admit it.

1938
02:33:30,576 --> 02:33:33,536
If she thought anybody'd notice,
she'd walk the street naked.

1939
02:33:33,746 --> 02:33:35,788
I do hate you!

1940
02:33:36,248 --> 02:33:39,459
You've done all you could to lower
the prestige of decent people.

1941
02:33:39,627 --> 02:33:41,461
Now you've endangered
the lives of our men...

1942
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:43,338
- ... because they've got to-
India!

1943
02:33:43,505 --> 02:33:47,258
We'd better not say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much.

1944
02:33:47,468 --> 02:33:49,969
What's going on
that I don't know about?

1945
02:33:50,429 --> 02:33:51,638
Shh!

1946
02:33:55,809 --> 02:33:58,978
Somebody's coming up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.

1947
02:34:00,439 --> 02:34:03,149
Will you hand me the pistol,
Mrs. Meade?

1948
02:34:09,406 --> 02:34:11,074
Whoever it is...

1949
02:34:11,617 --> 02:34:13,326
...we know nothing.

1950
02:34:16,789 --> 02:34:20,041
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.

1951
02:34:20,292 --> 02:34:22,335
Don't tell him.
He's a Yankee spy.

1952
02:34:22,586 --> 02:34:24,170
Quickly. There may be time.

1953
02:34:25,172 --> 02:34:27,590
- How'd you know?
- I played poker with Yankees.

1954
02:34:27,841 --> 02:34:30,677
They knew there'd be trouble.
They sent the cavalry out.

1955
02:34:30,928 --> 02:34:32,762
Your men are walking
into a trap.

1956
02:34:33,013 --> 02:34:35,848
Don't tell him.
He's trying to trap you.

1957
02:34:38,477 --> 02:34:41,521
Out the Decatur road.
The old Sullivan plantation.

1958
02:34:41,772 --> 02:34:43,314
They're meeting in the cellar.

1959
02:34:43,524 --> 02:34:45,066
I'll do what I can.

1960
02:34:49,697 --> 02:34:52,740
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.

1961
02:34:52,908 --> 02:34:54,659
We thought it best not to tell you.

1962
02:34:54,868 --> 02:34:58,705
The men have gone to clean out
the woods where you were attacked.

1963
02:34:58,998 --> 02:35:02,166
It's what many of our Southern men
have had to do to protect us.

1964
02:35:02,376 --> 02:35:06,963
And if they're captured, they'll be
hanged. And it will be your fault.

1965
02:35:07,214 --> 02:35:08,965
Another word and you leave, India.

1966
02:35:09,216 --> 02:35:11,175
Scarlett did what she had to do.

1967
02:35:11,385 --> 02:35:14,220
Our men are doing
what they think they have to do.

1968
02:35:14,847 --> 02:35:16,139
Frank...

1969
02:35:16,557 --> 02:35:18,224
...and Ashley.

1970
02:35:20,185 --> 02:35:22,603
Oh, it isn't possible.

1971
02:35:25,399 --> 02:35:27,859
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.

1972
02:35:28,068 --> 02:35:30,111
We're sewing, we're sewing!

1973
02:35:34,491 --> 02:35:35,533
Open the door.

1974
02:35:46,003 --> 02:35:47,837
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.

1975
02:35:50,257 --> 02:35:51,758
Who is Mrs. Wilkes?

1976
02:35:51,925 --> 02:35:53,676
I am Mrs. Wilkes.

1977
02:35:53,886 --> 02:35:57,180
- I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
- He's not here.

1978
02:35:57,765 --> 02:36:00,767
- Are you sure?
- Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!

1979
02:36:01,018 --> 02:36:03,269
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.

1980
02:36:03,437 --> 02:36:05,772
If you give me your word,
I won't search the house.

1981
02:36:06,148 --> 02:36:09,942
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting
at Mr. Kennedy's store.

1982
02:36:10,152 --> 02:36:14,405
He's not at the store. There's no
meeting tonight, no political meeting.

1983
02:36:14,782 --> 02:36:17,867
We'll wait outside till
he and his friends return.

1984
02:36:18,911 --> 02:36:21,746
Surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.

1985
02:36:27,544 --> 02:36:29,962
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.

1986
02:36:30,255 --> 02:36:32,799
And I'll read aloud.

1987
02:36:36,095 --> 02:36:39,972
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield.

1988
02:36:42,309 --> 02:36:43,726
Chapter One.

1989
02:36:43,936 --> 02:36:44,977
I am born.

1990
02:36:49,566 --> 02:36:53,945
To begin my life with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born... "

1991
02:36:54,238 --> 02:36:56,489
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.

1992
02:36:56,782 --> 02:36:58,741
I pass over all that happened
at school...

1993
02:36:58,951 --> 02:37:02,995
...until the anniversary
of my birthday came round in March.

1994
02:37:03,414 --> 02:37:06,958
Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever, I remember nothing.

1995
02:37:07,334 --> 02:37:09,502
He was going away
at the end of the half-year...

1996
02:37:09,795 --> 02:37:14,173
...if not sooner, and was more
spirited and independent than before.

1997
02:37:16,802 --> 02:37:19,345
But beyond this,
I remember nothing.

1998
02:37:19,638 --> 02:37:20,847
The great-"

1999
02:37:23,225 --> 02:37:24,517
"I remember nothing. "

2000
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:31,441
Melly, they're drunk!

2001
02:37:31,942 --> 02:37:35,778
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.

2002
02:37:38,866 --> 02:37:41,284
- You stupid fool!
- Shh!

2003
02:37:42,536 --> 02:37:43,786
Quiet!

2004
02:37:44,496 --> 02:37:46,497
Will you shut up, for the love of-

2005
02:37:46,665 --> 02:37:47,748
Hello, Melly.

2006
02:37:47,958 --> 02:37:52,378
So you've got my husband
intoxicated again. Well, bring him in.

2007
02:37:52,629 --> 02:37:54,881
I'm sorry,
your husband's under arrest.

2008
02:37:55,132 --> 02:37:59,635
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta,
you must arrest a good many Yankees.

2009
02:37:59,845 --> 02:38:03,389
Bring him in, Captain Butler,
if you can walk yourself.

2010
02:38:04,516 --> 02:38:06,058
- Wait.
- I wanna tell you a story.

2011
02:38:06,351 --> 02:38:07,685
Listen, doctor, I-

2012
02:38:07,895 --> 02:38:09,854
Put him down in that chair.

2013
02:38:13,233 --> 02:38:15,651
Now, captain,
please leave my house...

2014
02:38:15,861 --> 02:38:18,404
...and try to remember
not to come here again.

2015
02:38:18,655 --> 02:38:21,491
That's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home...

2016
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:24,368
...and not leaving him
in this shameful condition.

2017
02:38:24,578 --> 02:38:26,287
Now, boys, all together-

2018
02:38:26,497 --> 02:38:28,331
Dr. Meade!

2019
02:38:28,665 --> 02:38:30,833
I'm astonished at you!

2020
02:38:36,924 --> 02:38:38,049
Oh, Ashley!

2021
02:38:38,300 --> 02:38:40,510
How can you do this to me?

2022
02:38:41,386 --> 02:38:43,846
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.

2023
02:38:44,223 --> 02:38:46,724
Take him to the bedroom.
Lay him out on the bed.

2024
02:38:46,934 --> 02:38:49,519
- Don't touch him. He's under arrest.
- Now, Tom.

2025
02:38:49,770 --> 02:38:53,439
What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.

2026
02:38:53,732 --> 02:38:56,108
I've seen you drunker.
And you've seen me-

2027
02:38:56,401 --> 02:38:59,820
He can lie in the gutter for all I care.
I'm not a policeman.

2028
02:39:00,072 --> 02:39:04,367
He led a raid on that Shantytown
where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.

2029
02:39:04,785 --> 02:39:07,620
A lot of shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.

2030
02:39:07,871 --> 02:39:11,582
It's time you rebels learned you can't
take the law into your own hands.

2031
02:39:12,042 --> 02:39:13,876
What are you laughing at?

2032
02:39:15,295 --> 02:39:17,880
This isn't your night to teach
that lesson.

2033
02:39:18,131 --> 02:39:20,967
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir.

2034
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:23,052
With you, Rhett?

2035
02:39:23,554 --> 02:39:24,929
Where?

2036
02:39:28,642 --> 02:39:30,977
I don't like to say
in the presence of ladies.

2037
02:39:31,562 --> 02:39:32,645
You'd better say.

2038
02:39:33,355 --> 02:39:35,314
Come out on the porch
and I'll tell you.

2039
02:39:35,482 --> 02:39:39,318
Speak out. I think I have a right
to know where my husband's been.

2040
02:39:41,655 --> 02:39:43,072
Well, ma'am...

2041
02:39:43,282 --> 02:39:45,992
...we dropped in on a friend of mine...

2042
02:39:46,285 --> 02:39:47,868
...and the captain's.

2043
02:39:48,078 --> 02:39:49,412
A Mrs. Belle Watling.

2044
02:39:50,664 --> 02:39:55,418
We played cards
and drank champagne, and, well...

2045
02:39:55,669 --> 02:39:59,297
Now you've done it. Did you have
to show me up in front of my wife?

2046
02:40:00,757 --> 02:40:02,508
Now, I hope you're satisfied.

2047
02:40:02,759 --> 02:40:05,761
These ladies won't be speaking
with their husbands.

2048
02:40:06,346 --> 02:40:09,473
Well, Rhett, I had no idea.

2049
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:15,980
Look here, will you take an oath that
they were with you tonight at Belle's?

2050
02:40:16,398 --> 02:40:19,275
Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.

2051
02:40:19,526 --> 02:40:21,694
Will you give me your word,
as a gentleman?

2052
02:40:21,945 --> 02:40:23,154
As a gentleman?

2053
02:40:23,405 --> 02:40:25,406
Why, certainly, Tom.

2054
02:40:27,367 --> 02:40:31,162
Well, if I've made a mistake,
I'm sorry.

2055
02:40:31,955 --> 02:40:34,540
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.

2056
02:40:36,043 --> 02:40:37,877
If you'll leave us in peace.

2057
02:40:38,211 --> 02:40:40,713
Well, I say I'm sorry.

2058
02:40:41,965 --> 02:40:43,382
Well, I am sorry.

2059
02:40:43,634 --> 02:40:45,217
Come on, sergeant.

2060
02:40:51,933 --> 02:40:54,393
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.

2061
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:56,896
- Oh!
- Ashley!

2062
02:40:57,147 --> 02:40:59,398
He's all right.
It's only in the shoulder.

2063
02:40:59,650 --> 02:41:02,026
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.

2064
02:41:02,235 --> 02:41:04,195
I think I can walk.

2065
02:41:04,571 --> 02:41:06,405
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?

2066
02:41:06,657 --> 02:41:07,948
In here.

2067
02:41:09,368 --> 02:41:10,910
Mammy, I want hot water.

2068
02:41:11,328 --> 02:41:12,745
And lint for bandages.

2069
02:41:12,954 --> 02:41:15,665
What can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.

2070
02:41:15,916 --> 02:41:19,001
Were you really there?
What did it look like?

2071
02:41:19,252 --> 02:41:23,172
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

2072
02:41:23,423 --> 02:41:26,509
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself.

2073
02:41:28,553 --> 02:41:31,847
Captain Butler, tell me what happened,
all that happened.

2074
02:41:32,099 --> 02:41:33,766
I was too late.

2075
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:37,561
When I got to the Sullivan place,
there had already been a skirmish.

2076
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:40,690
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2077
02:41:40,899 --> 02:41:45,069
I had to prove they'd been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2078
02:41:45,362 --> 02:41:48,447
- So I took them to Belle's.
- And she took them in?

2079
02:41:48,699 --> 02:41:51,242
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.

2080
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:53,202
Oh, I'm sorry-

2081
02:41:53,412 --> 02:41:56,956
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi.

2082
02:42:00,085 --> 02:42:03,629
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster.

2083
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:07,383
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.

2084
02:42:08,885 --> 02:42:12,805
And now I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.

2085
02:42:17,811 --> 02:42:19,395
Oh, Ashley...

2086
02:42:20,939 --> 02:42:22,606
Ashley...

2087
02:42:24,067 --> 02:42:27,319
Have you no interest in what's
become of your own husband?

2088
02:42:30,282 --> 02:42:32,616
Did Frank go with you
to Belle Watling's?

2089
02:42:32,826 --> 02:42:34,285
No.

2090
02:42:34,578 --> 02:42:35,619
Well, where is he?

2091
02:42:36,621 --> 02:42:39,290
He's lying out on Decatur Road...

2092
02:42:39,583 --> 02:42:41,584
...shot through the head.

2093
02:42:42,169 --> 02:42:43,669
He's dead.

2094
02:42:53,513 --> 02:42:54,764
Who is it?

2095
02:42:55,015 --> 02:42:56,182
It's Mrs. Watling.

2096
02:42:56,349 --> 02:42:59,185
Oh, Mrs. Watling.
Won't you come in the house?

2097
02:42:59,478 --> 02:43:02,354
Oh, no, I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilkes.

2098
02:43:02,606 --> 02:43:05,149
You come in and sit a minute with me.

2099
02:43:12,949 --> 02:43:16,702
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?

2100
02:43:16,995 --> 02:43:19,997
I got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me.

2101
02:43:20,207 --> 02:43:23,375
Why, Mrs. Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.

2102
02:43:23,668 --> 02:43:27,671
I came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustn't think of any such thing.

2103
02:43:27,881 --> 02:43:29,548
Why, I'm...

2104
02:43:29,841 --> 02:43:31,217
Well, you're...

2105
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:33,093
It wouldn't be fitting at all.

2106
02:43:33,303 --> 02:43:37,097
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husband's life?

2107
02:43:37,349 --> 02:43:42,228
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been
a lady nice to me like you was.

2108
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:45,189
I mean, about the money
for the hospital.

2109
02:43:45,398 --> 02:43:47,066
I don't forget a kindness.

2110
02:43:47,567 --> 02:43:50,402
I thought about you being widowed
with a little boy...

2111
02:43:50,695 --> 02:43:52,696
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.

2112
02:43:52,906 --> 02:43:56,242
He's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.

2113
02:43:56,701 --> 02:43:59,245
I got a boy myself, so I...

2114
02:43:59,663 --> 02:44:02,206
You have? Does he live-?

2115
02:44:02,415 --> 02:44:05,000
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.

2116
02:44:05,418 --> 02:44:07,127
He ain't never been here.

2117
02:44:07,379 --> 02:44:09,380
He's off at school.

2118
02:44:09,756 --> 02:44:12,258
I ain't seen him since he was little.

2119
02:44:14,845 --> 02:44:18,889
Anyways, if it had been that
Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself...

2120
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:22,351
...I wouldn't have lifted a finger,
no matter what Rhett said.

2121
02:44:22,602 --> 02:44:24,436
She's a mighty cold woman...

2122
02:44:24,688 --> 02:44:27,106
...prancing about Atlanta by herself.

2123
02:44:27,274 --> 02:44:30,025
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him.

2124
02:44:30,277 --> 02:44:33,571
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law.

2125
02:44:36,575 --> 02:44:38,701
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.

2126
02:44:38,952 --> 02:44:41,287
I forgot how you liked her.

2127
02:44:41,788 --> 02:44:46,292
She just ain't in the same class with you,
and I can't help it if I think so.

2128
02:44:46,793 --> 02:44:49,670
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.

2129
02:44:49,921 --> 02:44:53,632
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stay any longer.

2130
02:44:53,884 --> 02:44:56,093
That wouldn't do you no good.

2131
02:44:56,469 --> 02:44:59,805
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me
on the street...

2132
02:45:00,056 --> 02:45:02,308
...you don't have to speak to me.

2133
02:45:02,559 --> 02:45:04,226
I'll understand.

2134
02:45:04,477 --> 02:45:06,729
I should be proud to speak to you.

2135
02:45:06,938 --> 02:45:09,440
Proud to be under obligation to you.

2136
02:45:09,691 --> 02:45:11,233
I hope we meet again.

2137
02:45:11,484 --> 02:45:14,570
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting.

2138
02:45:15,947 --> 02:45:19,241
- Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
- Good night, Mrs. Watling.

2139
02:45:24,205 --> 02:45:26,123
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.

2140
02:45:26,333 --> 02:45:29,001
She's brokenhearted about her husband.

2141
02:46:12,879 --> 02:46:14,505
Great balls of fire!

2142
02:46:14,756 --> 02:46:16,173
It's Rhett.

2143
02:46:41,491 --> 02:46:45,995
Captain Butler's here.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.

2144
02:46:46,246 --> 02:46:49,748
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.

2145
02:47:19,529 --> 02:47:21,030
She says she's coming.

2146
02:47:21,197 --> 02:47:23,365
I don't know why she's coming,
but she's coming.

2147
02:47:23,616 --> 02:47:24,950
You don't like me, Mammy.

2148
02:47:25,243 --> 02:47:28,328
Don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.

2149
02:47:40,592 --> 02:47:42,551
It's no good, Scarlett.

2150
02:47:42,802 --> 02:47:45,220
- What?
- The cologne.

2151
02:47:46,097 --> 02:47:47,639
I don't know what you mean.

2152
02:47:47,891 --> 02:47:51,935
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.

2153
02:47:52,145 --> 02:47:55,439
Well, what if I have?
Is that any of your affair?

2154
02:47:57,108 --> 02:47:58,650
Don't drink alone.

2155
02:47:58,943 --> 02:48:02,863
People always find out,
and it ruins a reputation.

2156
02:48:08,328 --> 02:48:11,497
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.

2157
02:48:11,664 --> 02:48:14,625
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.

2158
02:48:14,876 --> 02:48:17,377
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid.

2159
02:48:17,629 --> 02:48:19,129
I'm afraid now.

2160
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:21,340
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.

2161
02:48:23,343 --> 02:48:26,095
You look pretty healthy.
And maybe there isn't any hell.

2162
02:48:26,304 --> 02:48:30,265
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.

2163
02:48:30,475 --> 02:48:33,644
Far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood.

2164
02:48:34,187 --> 02:48:37,773
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you.

2165
02:48:38,441 --> 02:48:40,943
I ought never to have married Frank.

2166
02:48:41,194 --> 02:48:44,363
He was Suellen's beau,
and he loved her, not me.

2167
02:48:44,614 --> 02:48:47,616
And I made him miserable,
and I killed him.

2168
02:48:47,867 --> 02:48:50,285
Yes, I did. I killed him.

2169
02:48:51,704 --> 02:48:53,831
Rhett, for the first time...

2170
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:57,793
...I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done.

2171
02:48:58,503 --> 02:49:00,879
Here. Dry your eyes.

2172
02:49:01,631 --> 02:49:04,508
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.

2173
02:49:04,717 --> 02:49:07,386
You're like the thief
who isn't sorry he stole...

2174
02:49:07,554 --> 02:49:09,930
...but he's terribly sorry
he's going to jail.

2175
02:49:10,181 --> 02:49:12,933
I'm glad Mother's dead.

2176
02:49:13,184 --> 02:49:16,562
I'm glad she's dead
so she can't see me.

2177
02:49:16,729 --> 02:49:20,524
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind...

2178
02:49:20,733 --> 02:49:24,069
...and sadly, I've turned out
disappointing.

2179
02:49:25,155 --> 02:49:29,700
You know, Scarlett, I think
you're on the verge of a crying jag.

2180
02:49:36,666 --> 02:49:39,751
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.

2181
02:49:40,003 --> 02:49:42,004
Say it, then, and get out!

2182
02:49:43,006 --> 02:49:46,550
- What is it?
- I can't go on any longer without you.

2183
02:49:46,718 --> 02:49:50,762
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man
to come here at a time-

2184
02:49:51,014 --> 02:49:53,724
I made up my mind you were
the only woman for me...

2185
02:49:53,975 --> 02:49:55,392
...the first day I saw you.

2186
02:49:55,602 --> 02:49:57,603
Now you have a mill
and Frank's money...

2187
02:49:57,896 --> 02:50:00,105
...and won't come to me
as you did to the jail.

2188
02:50:00,356 --> 02:50:04,735
- So I see I shall have to marry you.
- I never heard of such bad taste.

2189
02:50:04,944 --> 02:50:07,070
Would you be convinced
if I fell to my knees?

2190
02:50:07,447 --> 02:50:09,031
Turn me loose and get out.

2191
02:50:09,282 --> 02:50:12,242
Forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments...

2192
02:50:12,493 --> 02:50:14,995
...my dear Scarlett-
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2193
02:50:15,246 --> 02:50:18,207
But you must have noticed
that for some time...

2194
02:50:18,458 --> 02:50:21,752
...the friendship I've felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2195
02:50:22,003 --> 02:50:26,215
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred...

2196
02:50:26,424 --> 02:50:28,550
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

2197
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:31,637
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

2198
02:50:31,930 --> 02:50:33,931
This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...

2199
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:37,142
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

2200
02:50:37,310 --> 02:50:40,646
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

2201
02:50:40,897 --> 02:50:43,899
You're coarse and you're conceited.

2202
02:50:44,108 --> 02:50:47,069
And I think this conversation's
gone far enough.

2203
02:50:47,612 --> 02:50:50,447
Besides, I shall never marry again.

2204
02:50:51,074 --> 02:50:53,909
Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.

2205
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:56,161
You? You?

2206
02:50:56,663 --> 02:50:58,288
I don't love you.

2207
02:50:58,539 --> 02:51:01,458
And I don't like being married.

2208
02:51:01,668 --> 02:51:03,919
Ever think of marrying
just for fun?

2209
02:51:04,170 --> 02:51:05,587
Marriage, fun?

2210
02:51:05,797 --> 02:51:08,507
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Fun for men, you mean.

2211
02:51:08,758 --> 02:51:10,300
Do you want them to hear you?

2212
02:51:10,551 --> 02:51:12,803
You've been married
to a boy and an old man.

2213
02:51:13,054 --> 02:51:16,682
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

2214
02:51:16,933 --> 02:51:19,142
You're a fool, Rhett Butler...

2215
02:51:19,352 --> 02:51:22,479
...when you know I shall always love
another man.

2216
02:51:22,772 --> 02:51:24,982
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.

2217
02:51:25,191 --> 02:51:27,067
No more of that talk.

2218
02:51:32,448 --> 02:51:33,782
Don't. I shall faint.

2219
02:51:34,033 --> 02:51:36,702
I want you to faint.
This is what you're meant for.

2220
02:51:36,953 --> 02:51:39,496
None of those fools
have kissed you like this.

2221
02:51:39,706 --> 02:51:43,125
Your Charles or your Frank
or your stupid Ashley.

2222
02:51:50,883 --> 02:51:53,969
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.

2223
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,637
Yes.

2224
02:51:57,390 --> 02:52:00,058
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?

2225
02:52:00,226 --> 02:52:01,518
No.

2226
02:52:01,728 --> 02:52:04,229
Look at me,
and try to tell me the truth.

2227
02:52:04,480 --> 02:52:06,898
Did you say yes because of my money?

2228
02:52:07,191 --> 02:52:10,068
Well, yes, partly.

2229
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:12,321
Partly?

2230
02:52:12,739 --> 02:52:15,240
Well, you know, Rhett,
money does help.

2231
02:52:15,533 --> 02:52:18,618
- And, of course, I am fond of you.
- Fond of me?

2232
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:22,331
If I said I was madly in love
with you, you'd know I was lying.

2233
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:26,209
- You say we have a lot in common-
- Yes, you're right, my dear.

2234
02:52:26,419 --> 02:52:28,587
I'm not in love
any more than you are.

2235
02:52:28,755 --> 02:52:31,548
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.

2236
02:52:31,758 --> 02:52:33,592
What kind of ring would you like?

2237
02:52:33,843 --> 02:52:36,762
A diamond ring,
and do buy a great big one.

2238
02:52:37,013 --> 02:52:40,057
You'll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

2239
02:52:40,266 --> 02:52:43,935
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon.

2240
02:52:44,187 --> 02:52:47,606
- That'd be heavenly.
- I'll buy your trousseau for you too.

2241
02:52:47,857 --> 02:52:49,941
How wonderful...

2242
02:52:50,234 --> 02:52:52,611
...but you won't tell anybody,
will you?

2243
02:52:52,862 --> 02:52:55,280
Still the little hypocrite.

2244
02:52:57,241 --> 02:52:59,034
Won't you kiss me goodbye?

2245
02:52:59,285 --> 02:53:01,787
You've had enough kissing
for one afternoon.

2246
02:53:02,038 --> 02:53:05,415
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.

2247
02:53:05,666 --> 02:53:07,584
But I will come back.

2248
02:53:21,974 --> 02:53:23,892
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

2249
02:53:24,143 --> 02:53:26,770
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

2250
02:53:28,064 --> 02:53:30,148
I can keep the lumber business too?

2251
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:32,818
Yes, of course you can,
if it amuses you.

2252
02:53:33,069 --> 02:53:37,197
Now that you're so rich, you can tell
everybody to go to the devil.

2253
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:40,492
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.

2254
02:53:57,802 --> 02:54:01,346
Don't scrape the plate.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.

2255
02:54:01,514 --> 02:54:05,434
Oh, Rhett, can I have
a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?

2256
02:54:05,685 --> 02:54:08,728
If you don't stop being a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy.

2257
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:10,605
And I'll divorce you.

2258
02:54:11,315 --> 02:54:13,733
It'd be nice if you bought
something for Mammy.

2259
02:54:13,985 --> 02:54:17,487
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

2260
02:54:17,738 --> 02:54:19,156
Mules? Why mules?

2261
02:54:19,365 --> 02:54:23,952
She said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses...

2262
02:54:24,203 --> 02:54:27,873
...but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn't fool anybody.

2263
02:54:28,166 --> 02:54:31,668
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul.

2264
02:54:31,878 --> 02:54:35,797
And one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have.

2265
02:54:36,382 --> 02:54:39,968
- I won't give her a thing.
- Then I'll take her a petticoat.

2266
02:54:40,178 --> 02:54:42,304
My mammy said
when she went to heaven...

2267
02:54:42,472 --> 02:54:46,558
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it'd stand by itself...

2268
02:54:46,809 --> 02:54:49,769
...and so rustley the Lord would say
it's made of angels' wings.

2269
02:54:49,979 --> 02:54:52,814
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.

2270
02:54:53,065 --> 02:54:56,651
That may be. But I'm making
the gesture just the same.

2271
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:02,908
Wake up. Wake up!

2272
02:55:04,410 --> 02:55:06,870
You were having another nightmare.

2273
02:55:07,413 --> 02:55:08,872
Oh, Rhett.

2274
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:13,168
Rhett, I was so cold
and hungry and so tired.

2275
02:55:13,419 --> 02:55:17,923
I couldn't find it. I ran through
the mist and I couldn't find it.

2276
02:55:18,216 --> 02:55:20,842
- Find what, honey?
- I don't know.

2277
02:55:21,052 --> 02:55:23,929
I always dream the same dream,
and I never know.

2278
02:55:24,180 --> 02:55:26,181
It seems to be hidden in the mist.

2279
02:55:26,432 --> 02:55:27,933
Darling...

2280
02:55:28,601 --> 02:55:33,563
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I found it, and that I'm safe?

2281
02:55:34,065 --> 02:55:36,066
Dreams don't work that way.

2282
02:55:36,317 --> 02:55:38,568
But when you get used
to being safe and warm...

2283
02:55:38,778 --> 02:55:40,904
...you'll stop dreaming that dream.

2284
02:55:41,113 --> 02:55:44,908
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe.

2285
02:55:46,285 --> 02:55:50,872
Rhett, would you do something for me
if I asked you?

2286
02:55:51,123 --> 02:55:52,958
You know I would.

2287
02:55:53,584 --> 02:55:55,710
Will you take me away from here?

2288
02:55:56,128 --> 02:55:59,631
- Don't you like New Orleans?
- I love New Orleans...

2289
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:02,467
...but I want to go home
and visit Tara.

2290
02:56:02,718 --> 02:56:04,844
Will you take me to Tara?

2291
02:56:05,096 --> 02:56:07,889
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.

2292
02:56:08,641 --> 02:56:10,475
We'll go tomorrow.

2293
02:56:12,979 --> 02:56:15,647
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara.

2294
02:56:15,898 --> 02:56:17,649
You're part of it
and it's part of you.

2295
02:56:17,942 --> 02:56:21,570
I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war.

2296
02:56:21,821 --> 02:56:22,988
Would you?

2297
02:56:23,364 --> 02:56:26,366
Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want.

2298
02:56:26,617 --> 02:56:28,910
Make it as fine a plantation
as it ever was.

2299
02:56:29,078 --> 02:56:30,829
Oh, Rhett!

2300
02:56:31,163 --> 02:56:32,789
Rhett, you are good to me.

2301
02:56:32,999 --> 02:56:35,166
Can we still have our big new house
in Atlanta?

2302
02:56:35,459 --> 02:56:38,169
Yes. And it can be
as ornate as you want.

2303
02:56:38,421 --> 02:56:40,672
Marble terraces,
stained-glass windows.

2304
02:56:40,965 --> 02:56:42,632
Won't everyone be jealous!

2305
02:56:42,883 --> 02:56:46,970
I want everybody who's been mean
to me to be pea-green with envy.

2306
02:56:47,847 --> 02:56:49,681
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful...

2307
02:56:49,974 --> 02:56:52,183
...building that new house
just to show off!

2308
02:56:52,393 --> 02:56:55,103
And even taking our servants!

2309
02:56:55,354 --> 02:56:58,481
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her.

2310
02:56:58,691 --> 02:57:01,526
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara, always.

2311
02:57:01,819 --> 02:57:03,653
Yes, and what good is Tara?

2312
02:57:03,904 --> 02:57:08,450
She's had three husbands,
and I'll be an old maid!

2313
02:57:10,411 --> 02:57:12,662
Great Jehoshaphat!

2314
02:57:13,122 --> 02:57:14,873
Great Jehoshaphat!

2315
02:57:15,333 --> 02:57:18,043
Lordy, we sure is rich now.

2316
02:57:19,003 --> 02:57:21,504
That's ridiculous!
Why can't I go in?

2317
02:57:21,672 --> 02:57:24,299
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like.

2318
02:57:24,508 --> 02:57:28,219
You control yourself.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.

2319
02:57:28,846 --> 02:57:31,640
I'd like to apologize
about its not being a boy.

2320
02:57:31,891 --> 02:57:33,933
Oh, hush your mouth.
Who wants a boy?

2321
02:57:34,185 --> 02:57:37,187
Boys aren't any use.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?

2322
02:57:38,064 --> 02:57:39,898
Have a drink of sherry.

2323
02:57:40,066 --> 02:57:42,442
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?

2324
02:57:42,693 --> 02:57:44,736
She sure is.

2325
02:57:45,029 --> 02:57:46,571
You ever see a prettier one?

2326
02:57:46,822 --> 02:57:51,201
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that
pretty when she come, but not quite.

2327
02:57:51,452 --> 02:57:52,869
Have another glass.

2328
02:57:55,414 --> 02:57:57,040
Mammy?

2329
02:57:57,249 --> 02:57:59,084
What's that rustling noise I hear?

2330
02:57:59,377 --> 02:58:03,421
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my
red silk petticoat you done give me.

2331
02:58:03,589 --> 02:58:07,717
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.

2332
02:58:08,552 --> 02:58:11,012
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.

2333
02:58:11,222 --> 02:58:13,264
Yea, Lordy!

2334
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:21,106
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.

2335
02:58:21,482 --> 02:58:23,733
Yes, sir. Too long.

2336
02:58:23,943 --> 02:58:25,944
No more mule in horse's harness?

2337
02:58:26,195 --> 02:58:29,197
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett
was bad telling you about that.

2338
02:58:29,448 --> 02:58:32,075
You ain't holding that
against old Mammy, is you?

2339
02:58:32,493 --> 02:58:33,993
I don't hold it against you.

2340
02:58:34,245 --> 02:58:36,454
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass.

2341
02:58:36,622 --> 02:58:38,123
Here, take the whole bottle.

2342
02:58:38,290 --> 02:58:41,459
Dr. Meade says you can go in now,
Captain Butler.

2343
02:58:44,630 --> 02:58:46,715
This sure is a happy day to me.

2344
02:58:46,966 --> 02:58:50,009
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls.

2345
02:58:50,219 --> 02:58:52,137
And it sure is a happy day.

2346
02:58:52,388 --> 02:58:57,308
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days
are when babies come. I wish-

2347
02:58:57,643 --> 02:59:00,812
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?

2348
02:59:01,105 --> 02:59:03,148
Miss Scarlett done told me
if it was a girl...

2349
02:59:03,441 --> 02:59:07,318
...she was going to name it
Eugenia Victoria.

2350
02:59:07,486 --> 02:59:11,114
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.

2351
02:59:11,323 --> 02:59:13,825
The most beautiful baby ever.

2352
02:59:14,410 --> 02:59:16,119
Yes...

2353
02:59:17,580 --> 02:59:20,290
Do you know that this is
your birthday?

2354
02:59:20,541 --> 02:59:23,001
That you're a week old today?

2355
02:59:23,294 --> 02:59:27,046
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony,
the likes of which...

2356
02:59:27,256 --> 02:59:29,007
...this town has never seen.

2357
02:59:29,258 --> 02:59:32,761
Yes, I'm going to send her to
the best schools in Charleston.

2358
02:59:33,012 --> 02:59:37,557
Yes, and her will be received by
the best families in the South.

2359
02:59:37,767 --> 02:59:40,059
And when it comes time
for her to marry...

2360
02:59:40,311 --> 02:59:43,855
...well, she'll be a little princess.

2361
02:59:44,106 --> 02:59:46,149
Certainly making a fool of yourself.

2362
02:59:46,358 --> 02:59:47,567
Why shouldn't I?

2363
02:59:48,694 --> 02:59:52,572
She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.

2364
02:59:53,032 --> 02:59:54,574
Great balls of fire!

2365
02:59:54,825 --> 02:59:56,659
I had the baby, didn't I?

2366
02:59:57,203 --> 02:59:59,704
It's Melanie. May I come in?
- Come in.

2367
03:00:00,039 --> 03:00:04,459
Yes, come in and look at
my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.

2368
03:00:05,795 --> 03:00:08,379
Most babies have blue eyes
when they're born.

2369
03:00:08,672 --> 03:00:11,466
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

2370
03:00:11,675 --> 03:00:14,803
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they'll stay blue.

2371
03:00:15,054 --> 03:00:17,597
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.

2372
03:00:17,973 --> 03:00:19,974
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.

2373
03:00:20,476 --> 03:00:22,393
"Bonnie Blue Butler. "

2374
03:00:30,402 --> 03:00:32,195
Try again, Mammy.

2375
03:00:39,703 --> 03:00:40,995
Twenty inches.

2376
03:00:41,247 --> 03:00:44,707
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

2377
03:00:44,917 --> 03:00:47,252
You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.

2378
03:00:47,503 --> 03:00:48,878
You done had a baby.

2379
03:00:49,129 --> 03:00:51,923
And you ain't never gonna be
no 181/2 inches again.

2380
03:00:52,174 --> 03:00:54,092
There ain't nothing to do about it.

2381
03:00:55,177 --> 03:00:57,053
There is something to do about it.

2382
03:00:57,263 --> 03:01:00,557
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

2383
03:01:01,058 --> 03:01:03,434
I just won't have any more babies.

2384
03:01:03,936 --> 03:01:07,438
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'd be wanting a son next year.

2385
03:01:07,731 --> 03:01:10,400
Tell Captain Butler I decided
not to go out.

2386
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:12,443
I'll have supper in my room.

2387
03:01:33,048 --> 03:01:34,757
I got your message.

2388
03:01:34,967 --> 03:01:37,677
I'll have them bring
my supper up here too.

2389
03:01:43,684 --> 03:01:45,393
No objections to that, I hope?

2390
03:01:45,603 --> 03:01:46,811
No.

2391
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,981
Yes.

2392
03:01:51,066 --> 03:01:53,943
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

2393
03:01:55,988 --> 03:01:57,113
Rhett...

2394
03:01:57,948 --> 03:02:00,408
Yes?
- You see...

2395
03:02:00,618 --> 03:02:02,827
Well, I've decided...

2396
03:02:04,496 --> 03:02:07,415
Well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

2397
03:02:19,637 --> 03:02:23,181
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

2398
03:02:23,432 --> 03:02:26,309
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20.

2399
03:02:26,518 --> 03:02:28,353
No, but you know what I...

2400
03:02:28,812 --> 03:02:30,229
Do you know what I mean?

2401
03:02:30,481 --> 03:02:34,359
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

2402
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:36,861
You're low enough to think of that.

2403
03:02:37,154 --> 03:02:39,656
If you had any chivalry in you,
or were nice...

2404
03:02:39,865 --> 03:02:44,202
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't
have any more children and he...

2405
03:02:45,829 --> 03:02:48,373
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon.

2406
03:02:48,624 --> 03:02:50,458
What has that got to do with it?

2407
03:02:51,877 --> 03:02:55,254
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.

2408
03:02:55,506 --> 03:02:58,383
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

2409
03:02:58,884 --> 03:03:02,053
- You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
- Sorry for me?

2410
03:03:02,304 --> 03:03:05,515
Yes, sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands...

2411
03:03:05,683 --> 03:03:08,226
...and reach out for something
that'll never make you happy.

2412
03:03:08,394 --> 03:03:10,019
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2413
03:03:10,187 --> 03:03:14,482
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious Ashley...

2414
03:03:14,733 --> 03:03:16,734
...do you think you'd be happy?

2415
03:03:17,319 --> 03:03:20,905
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

2416
03:03:21,156 --> 03:03:23,992
...any more than you understand
anything, except money.

2417
03:03:24,493 --> 03:03:26,077
Never mind about that. I want-

2418
03:03:26,370 --> 03:03:30,498
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.

2419
03:03:30,749 --> 03:03:32,000
You don't care?

2420
03:03:32,376 --> 03:03:34,585
The world is full
of many things and people...

2421
03:03:34,837 --> 03:03:38,423
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.

2422
03:03:38,674 --> 03:03:39,882
Well, that's fine.

2423
03:03:40,092 --> 03:03:43,678
But I warn you, in case you change
your mind, I intend to lock my door.

2424
03:03:43,887 --> 03:03:45,013
Why bother?

2425
03:03:45,264 --> 03:03:48,433
If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out.

2426
03:04:05,951 --> 03:04:07,618
I knew most women were cheats...

2427
03:04:07,911 --> 03:04:10,121
...hypocritical and hard,
but this one...

2428
03:04:10,414 --> 03:04:12,623
- It ain't no use.
- What do you mean?

2429
03:04:12,916 --> 03:04:14,751
I mean you're poisoned with her.

2430
03:04:14,960 --> 03:04:18,463
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.

2431
03:04:18,714 --> 03:04:23,051
- It pleasures me none to say it.
- Maybe so, but I'm through with her.

2432
03:04:23,302 --> 03:04:27,221
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.

2433
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:34,979
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.

2434
03:04:35,147 --> 03:04:36,981
And a very nice one.

2435
03:04:37,983 --> 03:04:38,983
Yes, Rhett?

2436
03:04:39,234 --> 03:04:42,653
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and...

2437
03:04:42,863 --> 03:04:45,656
You're both hardheaded businesswomen,
and successful.

2438
03:04:46,366 --> 03:04:48,493
But you've got a heart, Belle.

2439
03:04:49,995 --> 03:04:51,829
And you're honest.

2440
03:04:54,083 --> 03:04:55,249
Goodbye, Rhett.

2441
03:04:56,794 --> 03:04:58,086
Goodbye, Belle.

2442
03:05:13,685 --> 03:05:16,020
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.

2443
03:05:16,188 --> 03:05:18,189
Look at those hands. And that seat!

2444
03:05:18,482 --> 03:05:19,816
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

2445
03:05:20,025 --> 03:05:22,693
Why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants-

2446
03:05:22,903 --> 03:05:25,863
- Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
Captain Butler.

2447
03:05:26,031 --> 03:05:27,156
Good morning, Scarlett.

2448
03:05:27,324 --> 03:05:30,034
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes.

2449
03:05:30,285 --> 03:05:32,829
If you'd thought of your position,
you wouldn't have to.

2450
03:05:33,038 --> 03:05:38,126
But as it is, we're going to cultivate
every female dragon of the Old Guard-

2451
03:05:38,335 --> 03:05:41,462
- Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
Captain Butler.

2452
03:05:41,713 --> 03:05:43,673
Good morning, Scarlett.

2453
03:05:43,924 --> 03:05:47,051
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable.

2454
03:05:47,302 --> 03:05:49,387
Money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

2455
03:05:49,638 --> 03:05:51,722
I'll admit I've been at fault too.

2456
03:05:51,974 --> 03:05:54,058
Bonnie will have a place
among decent people.

2457
03:05:54,351 --> 03:05:58,563
Even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat-

2458
03:05:58,856 --> 03:06:00,648
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

2459
03:06:00,858 --> 03:06:04,402
Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

2460
03:06:09,825 --> 03:06:12,743
Mrs. Merriwether, I have
great regard for your knowledge.

2461
03:06:13,036 --> 03:06:15,580
- Could you give me some advice?
- Why, certainly.

2462
03:06:15,747 --> 03:06:17,999
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.

2463
03:06:18,250 --> 03:06:20,918
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

2464
03:06:21,086 --> 03:06:23,838
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.

2465
03:06:24,089 --> 03:06:26,591
- I tried putting soap on her nails.
Soap? Bah!

2466
03:06:26,842 --> 03:06:30,386
Put quinine on her thumb and
she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

2467
03:06:30,596 --> 03:06:33,222
Quinine! I never would have
thought of it.

2468
03:06:33,473 --> 03:06:35,391
I can't thank you enough.

2469
03:06:35,601 --> 03:06:38,102
You've taken a great load off my mind.

2470
03:06:38,353 --> 03:06:39,604
Good morning.

2471
03:06:42,441 --> 03:06:45,401
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

2472
03:06:45,611 --> 03:06:48,279
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...

2473
03:06:48,572 --> 03:06:52,575
...there's a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much.

2474
03:06:52,784 --> 03:06:54,785
But of course there is.

2475
03:06:55,037 --> 03:06:59,248
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...

2476
03:06:59,458 --> 03:07:03,252
...that he was honored for his
services at the Battle of Franklin.

2477
03:07:03,503 --> 03:07:05,963
No, and did I tell you
that Captain Butler made...

2478
03:07:06,215 --> 03:07:10,509
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...

2479
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:13,012
- ... of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
- No!

2480
03:07:14,139 --> 03:07:17,808
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

2481
03:07:18,101 --> 03:07:22,230
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was
my idea to give a party for Bonnie.

2482
03:07:22,481 --> 03:07:26,150
Why, Caroline Meade,
how can you say a thing like that?

2483
03:07:32,908 --> 03:07:36,327
Watch Daddy put your pony
over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!

2484
03:07:39,122 --> 03:07:41,290
Daddy, let me! Let me!

2485
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:42,750
All right, darling.

2486
03:07:43,001 --> 03:07:44,669
Put her on, Pork.

2487
03:07:47,631 --> 03:07:48,798
Up we go!

2488
03:07:49,049 --> 03:07:50,132
Oh, there!

2489
03:07:50,759 --> 03:07:53,135
Lordy mercy!
There he goes again.

2490
03:07:53,345 --> 03:07:56,347
Grip tightly with your legs.
Lean forward and go with him.

2491
03:07:56,598 --> 03:07:59,517
Hold your reins properly
in a firm hand. Up!

2492
03:08:00,602 --> 03:08:02,853
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.

2493
03:08:03,146 --> 03:08:05,773
When you're older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

2494
03:08:06,024 --> 03:08:10,152
You'll be the best horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.

2495
03:08:10,696 --> 03:08:12,280
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!

2496
03:08:13,115 --> 03:08:14,156
Mr. Rhett!

2497
03:08:15,200 --> 03:08:17,535
Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?

2498
03:08:17,786 --> 03:08:20,288
Mr. Rhett, I done told you
and told you...

2499
03:08:20,539 --> 03:08:24,458
...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride
astraddle with her dress flying up.

2500
03:08:25,043 --> 03:08:27,211
All right. I'll teach her
to ride sidesaddle.

2501
03:08:27,462 --> 03:08:30,506
And I'll buy her a blue velvet
riding habit. She'll love that.

2502
03:08:30,799 --> 03:08:33,092
A nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear.

2503
03:08:33,343 --> 03:08:35,594
Oh, now, Mammy,
be reasonable.

2504
03:08:35,804 --> 03:08:38,723
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...

2505
03:08:40,100 --> 03:08:42,685
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.

2506
03:08:43,979 --> 03:08:45,604
It ain't fittin'.

2507
03:08:55,407 --> 03:08:59,243
Why, Scarlett, what are you
doing downtown at this time of day?

2508
03:08:59,411 --> 03:09:00,411
Well, Ashley, I just-

2509
03:09:00,662 --> 03:09:03,914
Why aren't you helping Melly
with my surprise birthday party?

2510
03:09:04,207 --> 03:09:07,710
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't
supposed to know anything about that.

2511
03:09:07,919 --> 03:09:10,629
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.

2512
03:09:10,881 --> 03:09:12,089
I won't let on.

2513
03:09:12,257 --> 03:09:14,717
I'll be the most surprised man
in Atlanta.

2514
03:09:14,885 --> 03:09:17,219
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books...

2515
03:09:17,387 --> 03:09:19,930
...so you can see how bad
a businessman I am.

2516
03:09:20,182 --> 03:09:23,768
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet...

2517
03:09:24,061 --> 03:09:26,937
...all the figures I ever knew
go right out of my head.

2518
03:09:27,189 --> 03:09:30,441
Figures are well lost when
the bonnet's as pretty as that.

2519
03:09:30,734 --> 03:09:34,445
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.

2520
03:09:34,696 --> 03:09:38,783
You haven't changed a bit since
our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...

2521
03:09:39,076 --> 03:09:42,536
...where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaus.

2522
03:09:44,081 --> 03:09:46,457
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

2523
03:09:47,125 --> 03:09:51,087
Nothing's turned out as I expected,
Ashley. Nothing.

2524
03:09:51,755 --> 03:09:55,883
Yes, we've traveled a long road
since the old days, haven't we?

2525
03:09:56,093 --> 03:09:57,718
Oh, the lazy days...

2526
03:09:57,969 --> 03:10:00,888
...the warm, still,
country twilight...

2527
03:10:01,390 --> 03:10:04,475
...the high, soft Negro laughter
from the quarters...

2528
03:10:05,310 --> 03:10:09,480
...the golden warmth and security
of those days.

2529
03:10:10,816 --> 03:10:12,775
Don't look back, Ashley.

2530
03:10:12,984 --> 03:10:14,819
Don't look back.

2531
03:10:16,196 --> 03:10:18,614
It drags at your heart till...

2532
03:10:18,907 --> 03:10:21,242
...you can't do anything
but look back.

2533
03:10:26,081 --> 03:10:28,416
I didn't mean to make you sad,
my dear.

2534
03:10:29,418 --> 03:10:33,212
I never want you to be anything
but completely happy.

2535
03:10:52,858 --> 03:10:54,191
Oh, Ashley!

2536
03:10:56,445 --> 03:10:59,280
- Who is it?
Only your husband.

2537
03:10:59,865 --> 03:11:01,365
Come in.

2538
03:11:01,950 --> 03:11:05,327
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary?

2539
03:11:06,163 --> 03:11:08,247
You're not ready for Melanie's party.

2540
03:11:08,457 --> 03:11:09,748
I've got a headache, Rhett.

2541
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:13,461
You go without me
and make my excuses to Melanie.

2542
03:11:14,504 --> 03:11:17,256
What a white-livered
little coward you are!

2543
03:11:17,507 --> 03:11:20,468
Get up! You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry.

2544
03:11:20,677 --> 03:11:22,261
- Has India dared-?
- Yes, India has.

2545
03:11:22,512 --> 03:11:25,806
- Everyone in town knows the story.
- Kill them for spreading lies.

2546
03:11:26,057 --> 03:11:28,684
I don't kill people who tell the truth.

2547
03:11:28,894 --> 03:11:29,977
No time to argue.

2548
03:11:30,228 --> 03:11:33,481
I won't go! I can't go until
this misunderstanding clears up.

2549
03:11:33,732 --> 03:11:37,359
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly
ordering you out of her house.

2550
03:11:37,569 --> 03:11:41,197
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so. I can't go.

2551
03:11:41,406 --> 03:11:44,867
If you don't show your face tonight,
you'll never be able to again.

2552
03:11:45,076 --> 03:11:47,661
I don't care, but you won't ruin
Bonnie's chances.

2553
03:11:47,913 --> 03:11:50,789
You're going to that party,
for her sake. Get dressed.

2554
03:12:04,804 --> 03:12:08,516
Wear that. Nothing modest
or matronly will do for this occasion.

2555
03:12:08,725 --> 03:12:12,686
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.

2556
03:12:19,069 --> 03:12:21,612
For he's a jolly good fellow

2557
03:12:21,905 --> 03:12:24,073
For he's a jolly good fellow

2558
03:12:24,324 --> 03:12:27,284
For he's a jolly good fellow

2559
03:12:27,452 --> 03:12:29,620
Which nobody can deny

2560
03:12:29,871 --> 03:12:32,081
Which nobody can deny

2561
03:12:32,332 --> 03:12:34,416
Which nobody can deny

2562
03:12:38,630 --> 03:12:40,881
- Good night, Scarlett.
- But, Rhett-

2563
03:12:41,132 --> 03:12:43,968
You're going into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry.

2564
03:12:44,261 --> 03:12:45,761
Don't leave me. Don't.

2565
03:12:45,971 --> 03:12:47,721
You're not afraid?

2566
03:13:13,873 --> 03:13:16,083
What a lovely dress, darling.

2567
03:13:16,334 --> 03:13:19,003
India wasn't able to come.
Will you be an angel?

2568
03:13:19,296 --> 03:13:23,173
I do need you to help me
receive my guests.

2569
03:13:25,635 --> 03:13:27,136
Mrs. Meade...

2570
03:13:27,429 --> 03:13:29,638
...here's our darling Scarlett.

2571
03:13:30,974 --> 03:13:33,142
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

2572
03:13:33,476 --> 03:13:35,603
- Why, Scarlett.
- Good evening.

2573
03:13:38,898 --> 03:13:42,776
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch?

2574
03:13:49,993 --> 03:13:52,828
Did you have a good time
at Miss Melly's party?

2575
03:13:53,038 --> 03:13:55,706
Yes. Now, Mammy,
be sure and leave word.

2576
03:13:55,999 --> 03:13:59,335
If Captain Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep.

2577
03:13:59,544 --> 03:14:00,669
Yes'm.

2578
03:14:29,991 --> 03:14:32,201
Come in, Mrs. Butler.

2579
03:14:40,752 --> 03:14:42,211
Come here.

2580
03:14:57,686 --> 03:14:59,103
Sit down.

2581
03:15:01,564 --> 03:15:05,067
No reason you shouldn't
have a nightcap, even if I am here.

2582
03:15:05,276 --> 03:15:07,236
I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise-

2583
03:15:07,487 --> 03:15:09,571
You heard nothing of the kind.

2584
03:15:09,781 --> 03:15:12,449
You wouldn't have come
if you thought I was here.

2585
03:15:12,701 --> 03:15:14,785
- You must need a drink badly.
- I do not.

2586
03:15:14,994 --> 03:15:17,621
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.

2587
03:15:17,914 --> 03:15:21,208
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink.

2588
03:15:21,418 --> 03:15:24,294
Do you think I care
if you like your brandy?

2589
03:15:30,885 --> 03:15:33,762
- You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
- I'm very drunk...

2590
03:15:34,013 --> 03:15:37,725
...and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over.

2591
03:15:37,976 --> 03:15:39,810
But you're not going to bed.

2592
03:15:40,061 --> 03:15:41,645
Not yet.

2593
03:15:41,938 --> 03:15:43,313
Sit down.

2594
03:15:46,317 --> 03:15:49,153
So she stood by you, did she?

2595
03:15:49,446 --> 03:15:53,407
How's it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins?

2596
03:15:54,784 --> 03:15:57,745
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley.

2597
03:15:57,996 --> 03:16:00,998
You're wondering if she did it
just to save face.

2598
03:16:01,166 --> 03:16:04,793
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it,
even if it saved your hide-

2599
03:16:05,044 --> 03:16:07,671
- I will not listen.
- Yes, you'll listen.

2600
03:16:08,173 --> 03:16:11,258
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.

2601
03:16:11,509 --> 03:16:16,638
She has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves.

2602
03:16:16,931 --> 03:16:18,974
And she loves you.

2603
03:16:19,184 --> 03:16:22,186
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know.

2604
03:16:23,188 --> 03:16:26,690
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.

2605
03:16:26,983 --> 03:16:30,444
- As it is, though-
- You get out of that chair once more...

2606
03:16:34,199 --> 03:16:39,369
Of course, the comic figure in all this
is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.

2607
03:16:39,871 --> 03:16:43,373
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...

2608
03:16:43,583 --> 03:16:46,502
...and won't be unfaithful to her
technically.

2609
03:16:47,378 --> 03:16:50,672
- Why doesn't he make up his mind?
- Rhett, you-

2610
03:16:53,676 --> 03:16:56,386
Observe my hands, my dear.

2611
03:16:57,096 --> 03:16:59,848
I could tear you to pieces with them.

2612
03:17:00,225 --> 03:17:04,311
And I'd do it if it'd take
Ashley out of your mind forever.

2613
03:17:04,854 --> 03:17:06,313
But it wouldn't.

2614
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:11,610
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever, this way.

2615
03:17:12,237 --> 03:17:14,655
I'll put my hands so.

2616
03:17:15,073 --> 03:17:17,991
One on each side of your head.

2617
03:17:18,243 --> 03:17:22,830
And I'll smash your skull
between them like a walnut.

2618
03:17:23,081 --> 03:17:25,249
And that'll block him out.

2619
03:17:26,626 --> 03:17:29,878
Take your hands off me,
you drunken fool!

2620
03:17:34,676 --> 03:17:38,220
You know, I've always admired
your spirit, my dear.

2621
03:17:38,763 --> 03:17:41,598
Never more than now,
when you're cornered.

2622
03:17:42,267 --> 03:17:43,433
I'm not cornered.

2623
03:17:43,685 --> 03:17:46,353
You'll never corner me or frighten me.

2624
03:17:46,604 --> 03:17:49,940
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else.

2625
03:17:50,191 --> 03:17:53,235
You're jealous of something
you can't understand.

2626
03:17:53,444 --> 03:17:54,695
Good night.

2627
03:17:56,447 --> 03:17:57,781
Jealous, am I?

2628
03:17:58,032 --> 03:18:00,200
Yes, I suppose I am.

2629
03:18:00,451 --> 03:18:03,787
Even though I know you've been
faithful to me all along.

2630
03:18:04,038 --> 03:18:05,163
How do I know?

2631
03:18:05,415 --> 03:18:08,876
Because I know Ashley Wilkes
and his honorable breed.

2632
03:18:09,085 --> 03:18:10,752
They're gentlemen.

2633
03:18:10,962 --> 03:18:14,298
That's more than I can say
for you or for me.

2634
03:18:14,591 --> 03:18:18,760
We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?

2635
03:18:27,729 --> 03:18:29,938
It's not that easy, Scarlett.

2636
03:18:34,068 --> 03:18:37,988
You turn me out while you chase Ashley,
while you dream of Ashley.

2637
03:18:38,239 --> 03:18:40,991
This is one night
you're not turning me out.

2638
03:19:08,728 --> 03:19:10,729
How are you feeling this morning?

2639
03:19:10,980 --> 03:19:13,732
Well, this misery in my back...

2640
03:19:13,942 --> 03:19:15,609
...ain't so good.

2641
03:19:17,946 --> 03:19:20,238
You act mighty happy this morning.

2642
03:19:20,490 --> 03:19:22,699
I am, Mammy. I am.

2643
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:34,169
Oh, she wept with delight
When he gave her a smile

2644
03:19:34,462 --> 03:19:39,341
And trembled with fear at his frown

2645
03:19:55,900 --> 03:19:57,317
Hello.

2646
03:19:58,277 --> 03:19:59,653
I,...

2647
03:19:59,821 --> 03:20:03,073
I'd like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night.

2648
03:20:03,658 --> 03:20:04,825
Oh, but, Rhett.

2649
03:20:05,326 --> 03:20:07,411
I was very drunk...

2650
03:20:07,745 --> 03:20:10,330
...and quite swept off my feet
by your charms.

2651
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:15,836
You needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you do surprises me.

2652
03:20:16,379 --> 03:20:20,590
I've been thinking, and I believe
it would be better for both of us...

2653
03:20:20,842 --> 03:20:23,593
...if we admitted we made a mistake
and got a divorce.

2654
03:20:23,886 --> 03:20:25,262
- A divorce?
- Yes.

2655
03:20:25,513 --> 03:20:27,931
There's no point in holding on
to each other.

2656
03:20:28,224 --> 03:20:30,559
I'll provide for you.
You've plenty of grounds.

2657
03:20:30,810 --> 03:20:33,437
Just give me Bonnie,
and you can say what you please.

2658
03:20:33,688 --> 03:20:37,941
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of
disgracing the family with a divorce.

2659
03:20:38,609 --> 03:20:41,028
You'd disgrace it
if Ashley were free.

2660
03:20:41,279 --> 03:20:44,573
Makes my head spin to think
how quickly you'd divorce me.

2661
03:20:45,033 --> 03:20:46,074
Wouldn't you?

2662
03:20:48,119 --> 03:20:49,870
Answer me. Wouldn't you?

2663
03:20:50,538 --> 03:20:52,456
Please go now and leave me alone.

2664
03:20:54,292 --> 03:20:56,460
I'm going. That's what I came
to tell you.

2665
03:20:57,587 --> 03:20:59,963
I'm going on a very extended trip
to London.

2666
03:21:00,256 --> 03:21:01,965
- And I'm leaving today.
- Oh.

2667
03:21:02,341 --> 03:21:06,386
I'm taking Bonnie with me.
Please get her duds packed right away.

2668
03:21:06,637 --> 03:21:09,056
You'll never take my child
out of this house.

2669
03:21:09,265 --> 03:21:13,060
She's my child too. You're mistaken
if you think I'm leaving her here...

2670
03:21:13,311 --> 03:21:15,937
...with a mother who doesn't
consider her reputation.

2671
03:21:16,147 --> 03:21:17,856
You're a fine one to talk.

2672
03:21:18,066 --> 03:21:22,486
You think I'll let her out when you'll
have her around people like Belle?

2673
03:21:23,404 --> 03:21:25,947
If you were a man,
I'd break your neck for that.

2674
03:21:26,157 --> 03:21:28,158
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.

2675
03:21:28,409 --> 03:21:31,078
As for you giving yourself airs
about motherhood...

2676
03:21:31,329 --> 03:21:33,371
...a cat's a better mother
than you are.

2677
03:21:33,623 --> 03:21:36,500
Have her things packed for me
in an hour, or I warn you...

2678
03:21:36,751 --> 03:21:40,504
...I've always thought a lashing with
a whip would benefit you immensely.

2679
03:21:46,094 --> 03:21:47,385
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.

2680
03:21:48,346 --> 03:21:50,680
- Hello, Uncle Rhett.
- Hello, Beau.

2681
03:21:50,932 --> 03:21:55,977
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.

2682
03:21:56,187 --> 03:21:59,856
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little Bonnie in.

2683
03:22:00,108 --> 03:22:02,025
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.

2684
03:22:04,153 --> 03:22:08,949
Bonnie, I'm going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland.

2685
03:22:09,367 --> 03:22:11,118
Where? Where?

2686
03:22:11,369 --> 03:22:14,704
I'll show you the Tower of London,
where the little princes were...

2687
03:22:14,997 --> 03:22:16,832
...and London Bridge.

2688
03:22:17,041 --> 03:22:20,669
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?

2689
03:22:21,796 --> 03:22:24,422
Well, it will
if you want it to, darling.

2690
03:22:26,717 --> 03:22:29,970
Daddy, dark!

2691
03:22:30,221 --> 03:22:31,721
Dark!

2692
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:34,182
Bonnie! Bonnie!

2693
03:22:34,976 --> 03:22:38,311
It's all right, Bonnie.
Who put out that light? Nurse!

2694
03:22:40,481 --> 03:22:43,567
Daddy, dark!
Yes, yes, yes...

2695
03:22:43,818 --> 03:22:45,735
What's the matter with my Bonnie?

2696
03:22:45,987 --> 03:22:47,529
A bear!

2697
03:22:47,738 --> 03:22:50,031
Oh, a bear? A big bear?

2698
03:22:50,241 --> 03:22:51,575
Dreadful big!

2699
03:22:51,742 --> 03:22:53,869
And he sat on my chest!

2700
03:22:54,078 --> 03:22:57,497
I'll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back.

2701
03:23:11,762 --> 03:23:13,972
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.

2702
03:23:16,601 --> 03:23:19,394
I told you never to leave
this child alone in the dark.

2703
03:23:19,604 --> 03:23:23,231
Children are often afraid of the dark,
but they get over it.

2704
03:23:23,441 --> 03:23:25,066
Let her scream for a night-

2705
03:23:25,276 --> 03:23:26,484
Let her scream?

2706
03:23:26,694 --> 03:23:29,029
Either you're a fool
or an inhuman woman.

2707
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:31,740
If you want her to grow up cowardly-

2708
03:23:31,991 --> 03:23:35,368
Cowardly? There isn't
a cowardly bone in her body.

2709
03:23:35,620 --> 03:23:37,245
You're discharged.

2710
03:23:37,496 --> 03:23:39,206
As you say, sir.

2711
03:23:55,640 --> 03:23:57,140
Where's Mother?

2712
03:23:59,977 --> 03:24:01,144
Bonnie...

2713
03:24:03,731 --> 03:24:05,732
Aren't you happy here
in London with me?

2714
03:24:06,484 --> 03:24:09,527
I wanna go home.

2715
03:24:21,165 --> 03:24:25,669
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!

2716
03:24:25,836 --> 03:24:26,920
Hello, Mammy!

2717
03:24:27,171 --> 03:24:28,964
Honey child!

2718
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:34,678
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
They's back!

2719
03:24:34,845 --> 03:24:36,930
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.

2720
03:24:37,181 --> 03:24:39,683
Darling baby!
You glad to be home?

2721
03:24:39,976 --> 03:24:41,851
Daddy gave me a kitten.

2722
03:24:42,103 --> 03:24:46,022
But London's a horrid place.

2723
03:24:46,190 --> 03:24:49,359
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.

2724
03:24:49,610 --> 03:24:51,820
You go out and see your pony.

2725
03:25:00,538 --> 03:25:02,539
Where's my pony?

2726
03:25:03,207 --> 03:25:05,166
I want to go out and see my pony.

2727
03:25:05,710 --> 03:25:07,377
You run along with Mammy.

2728
03:25:07,628 --> 03:25:12,132
Come on, honey child.
Mammy sure missed you, honey.

2729
03:25:13,217 --> 03:25:15,468
Mrs. Butler, I believe.

2730
03:25:15,845 --> 03:25:18,179
Mammy said you'd come back.

2731
03:25:18,514 --> 03:25:19,806
Only to bring Bonnie.

2732
03:25:20,224 --> 03:25:24,227
Apparently any mother,
even a bad one, is better than none.

2733
03:25:24,395 --> 03:25:26,021
You mean you're going away again?

2734
03:25:26,605 --> 03:25:29,232
What perception, Mrs. Butler.
Right away.

2735
03:25:29,734 --> 03:25:32,819
- In fact, I left my bags at the station.
- Oh.

2736
03:25:33,904 --> 03:25:36,990
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?

2737
03:25:37,241 --> 03:25:40,327
Or can this wanness mean
you've been missing me?

2738
03:25:40,578 --> 03:25:41,995
If I'm pale, it's your fault.

2739
03:25:42,246 --> 03:25:45,498
Not because I've been
missing you, but because...

2740
03:25:49,003 --> 03:25:51,338
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.

2741
03:25:51,839 --> 03:25:54,591
It's because I'm going to have a baby.

2742
03:26:00,056 --> 03:26:03,224
Indeed. And who's the happy father?

2743
03:26:04,101 --> 03:26:07,270
You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.

2744
03:26:07,563 --> 03:26:10,273
No woman would want the child
of a cad like you.

2745
03:26:10,524 --> 03:26:13,234
I wish it were anybody's
child but yours!

2746
03:26:14,445 --> 03:26:17,405
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.

2747
03:26:31,587 --> 03:26:33,254
Is she better?

2748
03:26:37,176 --> 03:26:38,385
Has she asked for me?

2749
03:26:38,636 --> 03:26:41,596
Don't you understand?
She's delirious.

2750
03:26:42,431 --> 03:26:45,058
Rhett...

2751
03:26:45,309 --> 03:26:47,268
I want Rhett!

2752
03:26:51,190 --> 03:26:54,484
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?

2753
03:26:54,777 --> 03:26:59,322
It's no use. It's no use!

2754
03:27:20,803 --> 03:27:22,846
Dr. Meade's left.

2755
03:27:23,347 --> 03:27:26,850
- Scarlett's dead.
- Oh, no, she's much better.

2756
03:27:27,017 --> 03:27:28,935
Really she is.

2757
03:27:45,244 --> 03:27:48,121
There, there, Captain Butler,
you're beside yourself.

2758
03:27:48,330 --> 03:27:51,291
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you.

2759
03:27:51,500 --> 03:27:53,543
She never wanted this baby.

2760
03:27:53,794 --> 03:27:56,463
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.

2761
03:27:56,672 --> 03:27:59,382
You do, but she doesn't.
Not my children.

2762
03:27:59,550 --> 03:28:01,551
She told me she didn't want any more.

2763
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:05,054
I wanted to hurt her because
she'd hurt me. And I did.

2764
03:28:05,306 --> 03:28:08,391
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fair to-

2765
03:28:08,642 --> 03:28:11,311
I didn't know about this baby
until she fell.

2766
03:28:11,562 --> 03:28:14,272
If I'd only known,
I'd have come straight home.

2767
03:28:14,482 --> 03:28:16,399
Well, of course you would.

2768
03:28:16,650 --> 03:28:20,069
And then when she told me
there on the steps, what did I do?

2769
03:28:20,404 --> 03:28:22,906
What did I say?
I laughed and I said-

2770
03:28:23,157 --> 03:28:26,075
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.

2771
03:28:26,285 --> 03:28:29,204
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.

2772
03:28:29,413 --> 03:28:33,374
She's never cared for me. I tried
to make her care, but I couldn't.

2773
03:28:34,919 --> 03:28:36,252
You're so wrong.

2774
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:40,882
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.

2775
03:28:41,425 --> 03:28:45,428
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.

2776
03:28:45,596 --> 03:28:49,599
She will. You must be patient.

2777
03:28:51,060 --> 03:28:56,189
No, it's not possible. If you
only knew who she really loved-

2778
03:28:57,316 --> 03:28:59,025
You wouldn't believe it.

2779
03:29:01,946 --> 03:29:04,364
Surely you haven't
listened to idle gossip.

2780
03:29:04,615 --> 03:29:08,201
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.

2781
03:29:09,119 --> 03:29:13,831
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,
and there can be other babies.

2782
03:29:14,708 --> 03:29:17,377
She couldn't even if she wanted to.

2783
03:29:17,628 --> 03:29:21,256
But of course she could!
I'm going to.

2784
03:29:24,552 --> 03:29:27,845
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

2785
03:29:28,097 --> 03:29:31,057
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.

2786
03:29:31,308 --> 03:29:36,145
And when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.

2787
03:29:37,898 --> 03:29:41,568
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

2788
03:29:41,819 --> 03:29:44,737
I pray God things go well
with you, Miss Melly.

2789
03:29:44,989 --> 03:29:49,284
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

2790
03:29:49,994 --> 03:29:52,161
From my heart, I thank you.

2791
03:29:58,627 --> 03:30:01,963
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

2792
03:30:02,172 --> 03:30:03,673
Thank you, Mammy.

2793
03:30:10,764 --> 03:30:12,849
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

2794
03:30:13,017 --> 03:30:15,685
...hoping our life together
has another chance.

2795
03:30:15,936 --> 03:30:19,939
Our life together? When did we
ever have a life together?

2796
03:30:21,191 --> 03:30:22,984
Yes, you're right.

2797
03:30:23,193 --> 03:30:27,030
But I'm sure if we could only
try again, we could be happy.

2798
03:30:27,323 --> 03:30:29,198
What is there
to make us happy now?

2799
03:30:30,534 --> 03:30:33,494
Well, there's Bonnie...

2800
03:30:33,912 --> 03:30:35,705
...and I love you, Scarlett.

2801
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:37,707
When did you discover that?

2802
03:30:37,958 --> 03:30:42,045
I've always loved you, but you've
never given me a chance to show it.

2803
03:30:43,922 --> 03:30:46,215
And just what do you want me to do?

2804
03:30:47,301 --> 03:30:51,220
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.

2805
03:30:51,472 --> 03:30:53,556
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.

2806
03:30:53,807 --> 03:30:56,476
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.

2807
03:30:56,727 --> 03:30:59,228
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.

2808
03:30:59,730 --> 03:31:03,232
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.

2809
03:31:03,484 --> 03:31:06,027
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!

2810
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:08,237
I am thinking of you.

2811
03:31:08,822 --> 03:31:11,532
And I'm thinking that, well...

2812
03:31:12,076 --> 03:31:15,161
...maybe the mill's taking you
away from me and Bonnie.

2813
03:31:15,913 --> 03:31:18,539
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.

2814
03:31:18,749 --> 03:31:21,501
- You're taking her away from me.
- But she loves you.

2815
03:31:21,752 --> 03:31:25,421
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that-

2816
03:31:25,589 --> 03:31:28,591
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.

2817
03:31:28,759 --> 03:31:30,259
We're watching, darling.

2818
03:31:30,678 --> 03:31:32,345
You're mighty pretty, precious.

2819
03:31:32,596 --> 03:31:34,097
So are you.

2820
03:31:34,348 --> 03:31:37,266
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.

2821
03:31:37,518 --> 03:31:40,228
I don't think you ought
to do much jumping yet.

2822
03:31:40,437 --> 03:31:42,480
You just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

2823
03:31:42,940 --> 03:31:44,190
I will so jump.

2824
03:31:44,400 --> 03:31:47,110
I can jump better than ever,
because I've grown.

2825
03:31:47,403 --> 03:31:48,778
I moved the bar higher.

2826
03:31:49,029 --> 03:31:50,571
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

2827
03:31:50,781 --> 03:31:52,532
No, Bonnie, you can't.

2828
03:31:52,741 --> 03:31:54,867
If you fall off,
don't cry and blame me!

2829
03:31:55,869 --> 03:31:58,788
Rhett, stop her.

2830
03:31:59,415 --> 03:32:00,456
Bonnie!

2831
03:32:01,125 --> 03:32:02,291
Bonnie!

2832
03:32:03,627 --> 03:32:05,628
She's just like Pa.

2833
03:32:08,632 --> 03:32:10,633
Just like Pa...!

2834
03:32:11,468 --> 03:32:13,469
Bonnie! Bonnie!

2835
03:32:21,145 --> 03:32:22,270
Bonnie!

2836
03:32:22,980 --> 03:32:24,313
Bonnie!

2837
03:32:40,956 --> 03:32:44,625
Lordy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you's come.

2838
03:32:44,793 --> 03:32:49,255
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.

2839
03:32:49,506 --> 03:32:51,424
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

2840
03:32:51,675 --> 03:32:54,761
Miss Melly, this here's
done broke her heart.

2841
03:32:55,012 --> 03:32:57,346
I didn't fetch you
on Miss Scarlett's account.

2842
03:32:57,639 --> 03:33:02,769
What that child got to stand, the good
Lord give her strength to stand.

2843
03:33:03,270 --> 03:33:06,105
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

2844
03:33:09,109 --> 03:33:11,778
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

2845
03:33:12,029 --> 03:33:13,446
Oh, no, Mammy, no.

2846
03:33:13,697 --> 03:33:18,201
I ain't never seen no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

2847
03:33:18,452 --> 03:33:20,703
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...

2848
03:33:20,954 --> 03:33:25,333
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony.

2849
03:33:25,584 --> 03:33:28,836
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.

2850
03:33:29,087 --> 03:33:30,630
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

2851
03:33:30,881 --> 03:33:35,510
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump.

2852
03:33:35,719 --> 03:33:38,554
She said, "You give me my baby
what you killed. "

2853
03:33:38,806 --> 03:33:42,892
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.

2854
03:33:43,185 --> 03:33:47,021
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

2855
03:33:47,231 --> 03:33:50,107
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

2856
03:33:52,653 --> 03:33:54,487
And then that night...

2857
03:33:55,572 --> 03:33:59,242
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.

2858
03:34:00,369 --> 03:34:03,746
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.

2859
03:34:04,039 --> 03:34:06,207
And that's where he's been
for two whole days.

2860
03:34:06,375 --> 03:34:08,417
Oh, Mammy!

2861
03:34:08,752 --> 03:34:12,421
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted
through the door and said:

2862
03:34:12,714 --> 03:34:14,423
"The funeral's set for tomorrow. "

2863
03:34:14,675 --> 03:34:17,343
He says, "You try that,
and I kills you tomorrow.

2864
03:34:17,719 --> 03:34:22,723
Do you think I's gonna put my child
in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

2865
03:34:22,891 --> 03:34:24,100
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

2866
03:34:24,268 --> 03:34:27,436
- He has lost his mind!
- Yes'm, that's the God's truth.

2867
03:34:27,688 --> 03:34:31,607
He ain't gonna let us bury
that child. You gotta help us.

2868
03:34:31,775 --> 03:34:33,276
Oh, but I can't intrude.

2869
03:34:33,569 --> 03:34:35,361
If you can't help us, who can?

2870
03:34:35,612 --> 03:34:39,115
Mr. Rhett always set great store
by your opinion.

2871
03:34:40,868 --> 03:34:42,869
Please, Miss Melly.

2872
03:34:43,745 --> 03:34:46,789
I'll do what I can, Mammy.

2873
03:34:52,671 --> 03:34:54,797
Get away from that door
and leave us alone.

2874
03:34:55,048 --> 03:34:57,049
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.

2875
03:34:57,301 --> 03:35:00,970
Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.

2876
03:35:21,992 --> 03:35:26,746
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett
in this hour of his grief.

2877
03:35:36,673 --> 03:35:38,007
Mammy...

2878
03:35:38,759 --> 03:35:41,844
I want you to make a good deal
of strong coffee...

2879
03:35:42,095 --> 03:35:45,681
...and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.

2880
03:35:45,849 --> 03:35:47,183
But...

2881
03:35:47,351 --> 03:35:51,854
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral
to take place tomorrow morning.

2882
03:35:52,147 --> 03:35:56,859
Hallelujah! I expect the angels
fights on your side, Miss Melly.

2883
03:35:58,153 --> 03:36:01,447
Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

2884
03:36:01,865 --> 03:36:04,158
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.

2885
03:36:05,035 --> 03:36:09,038
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.
And try...

2886
03:36:09,289 --> 03:36:11,290
Try to get me home.

2887
03:36:12,376 --> 03:36:14,335
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

2888
03:36:21,802 --> 03:36:24,011
Where is my mother going away to?

2889
03:36:24,262 --> 03:36:27,556
And why can't I go along, please?

2890
03:36:27,766 --> 03:36:32,144
We can't always go along, Beau,
as much as we may want to.

2891
03:36:32,813 --> 03:36:34,897
You're going back to bed now.

2892
03:36:35,774 --> 03:36:39,276
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.

2893
03:36:39,528 --> 03:36:42,363
She hasn't your strength.
She's never had any.

2894
03:36:42,572 --> 03:36:46,075
- She's never had anything but heart.
- You knew that too?

2895
03:36:46,368 --> 03:36:49,286
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.

2896
03:36:49,913 --> 03:36:51,580
It isn't really morning yet.

2897
03:36:58,171 --> 03:36:59,714
You may come in now, Scarlett.

2898
03:36:59,923 --> 03:37:03,676
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.
I've been waiting here two days.

2899
03:37:03,927 --> 03:37:06,929
I've got to tell her
that I was wrong about something.

2900
03:37:07,180 --> 03:37:10,725
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.

2901
03:37:13,854 --> 03:37:17,106
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience...

2902
03:37:17,357 --> 03:37:21,569
...telling her things that make
no difference now. You understand?

2903
03:37:35,751 --> 03:37:37,626
It's me, Melly.

2904
03:37:38,837 --> 03:37:40,629
Promise me?

2905
03:37:40,922 --> 03:37:42,423
Anything.

2906
03:37:43,133 --> 03:37:45,634
Look after my little son.

2907
03:37:46,470 --> 03:37:50,931
I gave him to you once before.
Remember?

2908
03:37:52,059 --> 03:37:53,726
The day he was born.

2909
03:37:53,977 --> 03:37:57,980
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.

2910
03:37:58,231 --> 03:38:00,983
Promise me... college.

2911
03:38:01,151 --> 03:38:05,362
Yes, and Europe, and a pony.
Whatever he wants, but...

2912
03:38:06,573 --> 03:38:07,990
...oh, Melly, do try.

2913
03:38:08,241 --> 03:38:10,159
Ashley...

2914
03:38:11,161 --> 03:38:12,870
Ashley and you...

2915
03:38:15,165 --> 03:38:18,375
What about Ashley, Melly?

2916
03:38:19,169 --> 03:38:22,129
Look after him for me...

2917
03:38:22,339 --> 03:38:26,300
...just as you looked after me...

2918
03:38:27,511 --> 03:38:28,677
...for him.

2919
03:38:30,597 --> 03:38:32,264
I will, Melly.

2920
03:38:33,141 --> 03:38:35,184
Look after him...

2921
03:38:35,644 --> 03:38:39,522
...but never let him know.

2922
03:38:48,615 --> 03:38:50,407
Good night.

2923
03:38:51,535 --> 03:38:53,994
Promise?

2924
03:38:54,204 --> 03:38:56,288
What else, Melly?

2925
03:38:56,540 --> 03:38:58,707
Captain Butler.

2926
03:38:59,709 --> 03:39:03,212
- Be kind to him.
- Rhett?

2927
03:39:03,839 --> 03:39:06,882
He loves you so.

2928
03:39:09,970 --> 03:39:11,887
Yes, Melly.

2929
03:39:13,974 --> 03:39:15,850
Goodbye.

2930
03:39:16,643 --> 03:39:17,935
Goodbye.

2931
03:39:33,869 --> 03:39:36,078
You ladies may come in now.

2932
03:39:38,582 --> 03:39:39,874
Rhett...

2933
03:39:41,459 --> 03:39:42,751
Ashley!

2934
03:39:43,587 --> 03:39:46,922
I don't know where
the mate to this is.

2935
03:39:47,090 --> 03:39:49,592
She must've put it away.

2936
03:39:50,552 --> 03:39:55,097
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!

2937
03:39:56,766 --> 03:39:59,226
I'm so frightened!

2938
03:40:03,481 --> 03:40:07,776
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her. I can't!

2939
03:40:08,862 --> 03:40:12,990
Everything I ever had
is going with her.

2940
03:40:13,533 --> 03:40:15,117
Oh, Ashley...

2941
03:40:16,203 --> 03:40:18,787
You really love her, don't you?

2942
03:40:19,039 --> 03:40:24,126
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.

2943
03:40:24,544 --> 03:40:27,796
Dreams. Always dreams with you.
Never common sense.

2944
03:40:28,089 --> 03:40:31,300
Scarlett, if you knew what
I've gone through!

2945
03:40:31,968 --> 03:40:35,971
Ashley, you should've told me years
ago that you loved her and not me.

2946
03:40:36,223 --> 03:40:39,266
And not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.

2947
03:40:39,476 --> 03:40:43,229
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...

2948
03:40:43,438 --> 03:40:46,774
...to show me that I could never
mean any more to you...

2949
03:40:47,025 --> 03:40:49,485
...than this Watling woman
does to Rhett.

2950
03:40:51,446 --> 03:40:56,325
And I've loved something
that doesn't really exist.

2951
03:40:58,536 --> 03:41:00,120
But somehow...

2952
03:41:01,164 --> 03:41:02,831
...I don't care.

2953
03:41:04,084 --> 03:41:06,168
Somehow, it doesn't matter.

2954
03:41:07,921 --> 03:41:10,339
It doesn't matter one bit.

2955
03:41:13,051 --> 03:41:14,343
Oh, Ashley...

2956
03:41:14,594 --> 03:41:16,428
Ashley, forgive me.

2957
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:20,182
Don't cry. She mustn't see
you've been crying.

2958
03:41:20,433 --> 03:41:21,558
Ashley!

2959
03:41:24,938 --> 03:41:26,188
Melly!

2960
03:41:28,149 --> 03:41:29,566
Melly!

2961
03:41:33,989 --> 03:41:36,532
Rhett! Rhett!

2962
03:41:39,369 --> 03:41:41,203
Rhett, where are you?

2963
03:41:45,166 --> 03:41:47,209
Rhett, wait for me!

2964
03:41:51,715 --> 03:41:53,716
Rhett, wait for me!

2965
03:41:56,011 --> 03:41:57,136
Rhett!

2966
03:41:59,139 --> 03:42:00,472
Rhett!

2967
03:42:02,100 --> 03:42:03,892
Rhett!

2968
03:42:07,897 --> 03:42:09,064
Rhett!

2969
03:42:09,482 --> 03:42:10,607
Rhett!

2970
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:13,736
Rhett!

2971
03:42:17,032 --> 03:42:18,240
Rhett!

2972
03:42:20,493 --> 03:42:21,618
Rhett!

2973
03:42:24,831 --> 03:42:26,248
Come in.

2974
03:42:33,923 --> 03:42:35,257
Rhett...

2975
03:42:35,633 --> 03:42:38,135
Melanie, she's...?

2976
03:42:40,930 --> 03:42:42,514
Well, God rest her.

2977
03:42:42,932 --> 03:42:46,268
She was the only completely
kind person I ever knew.

2978
03:42:46,728 --> 03:42:50,439
A great lady. A very great lady.

2979
03:42:52,776 --> 03:42:56,695
So she's dead. That makes it
nice for you, doesn't it?

2980
03:42:56,946 --> 03:43:01,700
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.

2981
03:43:01,951 --> 03:43:04,036
No, I don't know that I do.

2982
03:43:04,287 --> 03:43:06,955
It's to your credit that
you could appreciate her.

2983
03:43:07,207 --> 03:43:11,710
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

2984
03:43:11,920 --> 03:43:16,131
- Why, her last words were about you.
- What did she say?

2985
03:43:16,383 --> 03:43:19,676
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...

2986
03:43:19,928 --> 03:43:21,929
...he loves you so. "

2987
03:43:26,768 --> 03:43:29,645
Did she say anything else?
She said...

2988
03:43:30,063 --> 03:43:33,399
She asked me to look after Ashley too.

2989
03:43:34,734 --> 03:43:38,195
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

2990
03:43:40,281 --> 03:43:41,949
What do you mean?

2991
03:43:44,327 --> 03:43:45,953
What are you doing?

2992
03:43:46,162 --> 03:43:47,788
I'm leaving you, my dear.

2993
03:43:47,997 --> 03:43:53,001
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

2994
03:43:54,963 --> 03:43:57,005
Oh, no!

2995
03:43:57,257 --> 03:43:59,508
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.

2996
03:43:59,801 --> 03:44:00,968
I don't want a divorce.

2997
03:44:01,219 --> 03:44:04,263
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,
when I knew I loved you...

2998
03:44:04,514 --> 03:44:07,349
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!

2999
03:44:07,642 --> 03:44:09,017
Please don't go on with this.

3000
03:44:09,269 --> 03:44:12,938
Leave us some dignity out
of our marriage. Spare us this last.

3001
03:44:13,189 --> 03:44:17,734
This last? Do listen to me! I must
have loved you for years, only...

3002
03:44:17,986 --> 03:44:19,862
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.

3003
03:44:20,155 --> 03:44:24,700
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.

3004
03:44:24,951 --> 03:44:28,120
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?

3005
03:44:28,705 --> 03:44:31,165
I never really loved Ashley.

3006
03:44:31,374 --> 03:44:34,877
You certainly gave a good imitation
of it, up to this morning.

3007
03:44:36,004 --> 03:44:38,464
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.

3008
03:44:38,673 --> 03:44:41,633
If you'd met me halfway, even
when I came back from London.

3009
03:44:41,885 --> 03:44:45,387
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

3010
03:44:45,638 --> 03:44:48,515
Then when you were sick,
and it was all my fault.

3011
03:44:48,766 --> 03:44:51,393
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.

3012
03:44:51,686 --> 03:44:54,646
I wanted you. I wanted you
desperately...

3013
03:44:54,856 --> 03:44:57,065
...but I didn't think you wanted me.

3014
03:44:57,317 --> 03:45:00,152
It seems we've been
at cross purposes, doesn't it?

3015
03:45:00,403 --> 03:45:02,237
But it's no use now.

3016
03:45:02,489 --> 03:45:05,908
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3017
03:45:06,159 --> 03:45:09,244
I liked to think that Bonnie
was you, a little girl again.

3018
03:45:09,496 --> 03:45:12,247
Before the war and poverty
had done things to you.

3019
03:45:12,499 --> 03:45:14,166
She was so like you.

3020
03:45:14,375 --> 03:45:17,586
And I could pet her and spoil her,
as I wanted to spoil you.

3021
03:45:19,297 --> 03:45:22,049
But when she went, she took everything.

3022
03:45:23,176 --> 03:45:26,345
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.

3023
03:45:26,596 --> 03:45:29,348
I'm so sorry for everything.

3024
03:45:30,016 --> 03:45:32,267
My darling, you're such a child.

3025
03:45:32,519 --> 03:45:37,439
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3026
03:45:39,234 --> 03:45:41,610
Here, take my handkerchief.

3027
03:45:41,861 --> 03:45:46,240
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.

3028
03:45:50,370 --> 03:45:52,913
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?

3029
03:45:53,122 --> 03:45:55,624
I'm going to Charleston,
back where I belong.

3030
03:45:55,917 --> 03:45:58,126
Please. Please take me with you.

3031
03:45:58,336 --> 03:46:01,213
No. I'm through
with everything here.

3032
03:46:01,756 --> 03:46:04,132
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...

3033
03:46:04,425 --> 03:46:08,136
...there isn't something left
in life of charm and grace.

3034
03:46:08,388 --> 03:46:10,138
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No!

3035
03:46:10,390 --> 03:46:14,309
- I only know that I love you!
- That's your misfortune.

3036
03:46:14,644 --> 03:46:16,270
Oh, Rhett!

3037
03:46:20,984 --> 03:46:22,401
Rhett!

3038
03:46:24,654 --> 03:46:26,071
Rhett! Rhett!

3039
03:46:28,408 --> 03:46:33,370
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3040
03:46:33,621 --> 03:46:36,665
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

3041
03:46:49,929 --> 03:46:52,973
I can't let him go. I can't!

3042
03:46:53,266 --> 03:46:56,310
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3043
03:46:57,520 --> 03:47:02,524
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.

3044
03:47:03,484 --> 03:47:05,861
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3045
03:47:20,043 --> 03:47:22,836
But I must think about it!

3046
03:47:23,046 --> 03:47:25,297
I must think about it.

3047
03:47:26,007 --> 03:47:28,216
What is there to do?

3048
03:47:29,135 --> 03:47:31,553
What is there that matters?

3049
03:47:34,057 --> 03:47:38,143
You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?

3050
03:47:38,394 --> 03:47:42,814
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.

3051
03:47:43,066 --> 03:47:46,693
Something you love more than
me, though you may not know it. Tara.

3052
03:47:46,944 --> 03:47:50,364
It's this from which you get
your strength, the red earth of Tara.

3053
03:47:50,573 --> 03:47:54,242
Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.

3054
03:47:54,535 --> 03:47:57,579
Something you love more
than me, though you may not know it.

3055
03:47:57,872 --> 03:48:00,248
- from which you get
your strength. Tara.

3056
03:48:00,458 --> 03:48:02,376
Land's the only thing that matters.

3057
03:48:02,543 --> 03:48:03,752
Something you love more.

3058
03:48:04,003 --> 03:48:06,088
- the red earth of Tara.
Tara!

3059
03:48:06,255 --> 03:48:07,756
Tara!
Tara!

3060
03:48:10,218 --> 03:48:11,760
Tara!

3061
03:48:12,762 --> 03:48:14,262
Home.

3062
03:48:15,181 --> 03:48:17,015
I'll go home.

3063
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:20,602
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.

3064
03:48:20,853 --> 03:48:25,982
After all, tomorrow is another day!
