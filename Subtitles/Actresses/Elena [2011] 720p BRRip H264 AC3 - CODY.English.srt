1
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,665
ELENA

2
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,082
Get up.

3
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,124
– Good morning.
– Morning.

4
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,207
If they don't look after themselves,
they'll pile on the weight

5
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,249
and have lots of other
illnesses to deal with.

6
00:08:55,375 --> 00:09:01,290
So take a good hard
look at your lifestyle.

7
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,499
Adjust your tastes.

8
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,915
The easy way to eat healthily
is to eat salads!

9
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,415
Bon appetit.

10
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,832
The porridge is perfect.

11
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,749
What have you got planned today?

12
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,040
I've got to go pick up
my pension at the bank,

13
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,082
then I'm going to see Sergei.

14
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:11,957
He should be coming here.
He needs the money, not you.

15
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,790
It's not about the money.

16
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,040
That's exactly what it's about.

17
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,540
What are you always
traipsing over there for?

18
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,124
He should drag himself
over here. He's a big boy.

19
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,582
Just drop it.

20
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,915
I don't tell you, how
to treat your daughter.

21
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,749
Dropped.

22
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,457
I hope you're not staying over?

23
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,957
No.

24
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,165
– Good morning.
– Hello.

25
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,499
There you are.

26
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,290
See you later.

27
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,415
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,165
Today we've got a fine selection

29
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,957
of glossy magazines

30
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,624
for the lovely ladies,
also crosswords,

31
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,332
adult magazines and today's press.

32
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,665
No sense in a boring ride;
just stop me as I come by.

33
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,915
1, 425 roubles.

34
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,874
Nadya! Come take care of this.

35
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,665
– Hello.
– Hello.

36
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:05,249
Is someone gonna get
that? Sasha! Are you deaf?

37
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,249
Whatever…

38
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,374
– Oh, Sasha. Hi.
– Hi.

39
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,665
Where're you going?
Take these to the kitchen.

40
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,457
– Hi, Ma. Come on in.
– Hey.

41
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,874
You need a trim!

42
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:13,124
Right, here's the money.

43
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,499
Thanks.

44
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,915
Hi, Tanya.

45
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,332
Here he comes, here he comes!

46
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,415
Oh, look who's here?

47
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,582
– Tanya, I brought some money.
– Elena, thank you.

48
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,374
Give it here.

49
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,582
Can't see through you, woman.

50
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,540
Tanya, put on the kettle.

51
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,040
Just a sec.

52
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,707
– Where are you off to?
– Gonna see Vitya.

53
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,040
Your Vitya isn't going anywhere.

54
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,290
– Back in a sec.
– I know your 'sec'.

55
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,915
He needs these disks now.

56
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,540
You two are going to wind up
in prison or in the army. Got it?

57
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,499
You want me to sit
here like an idiot?

58
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,999
Not like an idiot, like
someone with a future.

59
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,540
Or don't you care about that?

60
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,790
OK, whatever…

61
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,665
Don't 'whatever' me!
Take out the rubbish.

62
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,374
Gimme a sec!

63
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,249
– What 'sec'?
– Nothing.

64
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,415
– What did you say?
– Nothing.

65
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,582
Go drink tea with your grandmother.

66
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:53,332
Well how am I supposed
to talk to him?

67
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,249
I'll talk to him.

68
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,624
I'm coming, Dad. Can't get
past this stupid level!

69
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,457
Just a sec.

70
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,249
– Lemme.
– Dad!

71
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,749
Watch and learn.

72
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,290
Elena, I'll be right back.

73
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,457
Tanya, coming.

74
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,249
Sergei.

75
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,332
I'm talking to my son. Hold on.

76
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,207
Go talk with your mother.

77
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,915
I said, hold on.

78
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,082
Ma, have you talked
with him about Sasha?

79
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,957
Not yet. But I will.

80
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,582
What are you dragging it out for?

81
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,457
We have to know if we
have the money or not.

82
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,124
You know how he feels about that
sort of things. I haven't forgotten.

83
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,457
He knows Sasha.

84
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,207
They're even friends, sort of.

85
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,124
We're family after all.

86
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:38,082
He's a friend to everyone,
but friends with no one.

87
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,207
He's just a tightass.

88
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,290
Come on, Sergei, stop it.

89
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,165
If it wasn't for him, we
wouldn't have what we do.

90
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:54,082
Mam,
and what have we got, exactly?

91
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,540
We have to get Sasha
off the draftees list.

92
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,582
He's gotta know what's next for him
– university, or fuck…

93
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,332
… where are they
fighting now – Ossetia?

94
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,832
Right, Tanya?

95
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,165
– More tea, Elena?
– Thanks.

96
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,790
– Sasha, when's the football?
– At nine.

97
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,124
We wouldn't be so worried,

98
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,082
but we'll need money
to talk to the right people

99
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,124
at school and university
before the 20th.

100
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,124
I'll talk to him, I promise.

101
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:24,332
If you're watching this
and you want to meet up,

102
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:29,207
I'd be glad to, because…

103
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,707
I want you to know that I'm here.

104
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,999
It looked like he didn't try.

105
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,790
It's pretty disappointing.

106
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,624
It's not the first time…
He's disappointed, too.

107
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,457
What's there to be disappointed
about? He chose to run like that.

108
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,124
But on the other hand, 09: 80…

109
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,457
It's good, but he
should be running faster…

110
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:56,457
I'm looking for my two brothers.

111
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,874
My parents split up in 1960.

112
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,165
I didn't know I had a dad,

113
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:11,124
until he wrote to me. I was 13.

114
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:16,499
He said, that I have two brothers.

115
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,915
I've been looking for them for years.

116
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,749
If only they knew I existed.

117
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,915
Finding them is, like, my life's work.

118
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,290
It's a typical Soviet strategy:

119
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,040
pile the pressure on,

120
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,415
hoping that he'll…

121
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,707
Maybe he'll get there
by the end of the season.

122
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,832
He's already performing differently,

123
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,415
but you can't see
it in the results yet.

124
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,207
Good morning.

125
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,165
I read your note. I understand,
of course, that Sasha

126
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,415
won't get in anywhere
on his own, will he?

127
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,374
I'm afraid not.

128
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,290
Why not serve in the army,
then? Best school there is.

129
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,624
Volodya, you know what it's
like in the army these days!

130
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:36,082
Why am I supposed
to support your son's family?

131
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,457
Why should I be burdened with paying

132
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,040
for someone's – effectively

133
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,665
a stranger's – education?

134
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:50,040
I live with you, not
with your relatives.

135
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,249
You know how I feel about this.

136
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,957
And your Sergei still
hasn't returned the money,

137
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,332
he borrowed from me three years
ago, if you haven't forgotten.

138
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:04,040
I remember. But you know about
Sergei's situation right now.

139
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:11,874
I know your Sergei
and his 'situation'.

140
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:16,332
His whole life is one big 'situation'.

141
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:22,207
I refuse to indulge him anymore.
Let this be a lesson for him.

142
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,415
You don't force lessons
like that on your daughter.

143
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,665
And I'm sure, you never did.

144
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,915
Elena, we're talking about your son.

145
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,999
It's like you're not listening.

146
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:39,374
He needs to get his ass up
off the couch and find a job.

147
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,040
Feed his family.

148
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:47,790
If we were talking about
the boy's health – God forbid –

149
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:51,540
the money would be
on the table tomorrow.

150
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:54,415
But we are talking about his health!

151
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:59,874
If you had a grandson, there's no way
you'd let him serve in the army.

152
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:04,165
Sasha just needs
help. Give him a chance.

153
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:09,957
Leave my daughter out of this!
Why did you bring her up?

154
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:16,707
It's not my fault,

155
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,624
I did everything in my power,

156
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,832
but unfortunately she turned
out just like her mother,

157
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,582
only interested in life's pleasures.

158
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,249
A goddamn hedonist!

159
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,290
I don't know, what that word means.

160
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,332
Do you know the word 'selfish'?

161
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,415
Volodya, you'll help
Sasha though, won't you?

162
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,290
I don't know. Need to think about it.

163
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,707
I hope, you aren't pulling money
off your credit card for them.

164
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,957
I can account
for every rouble, if you want.

165
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,999
No, no need for that.

166
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,332
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

167
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,499
OK.

168
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:11,040
When do they need the money?

169
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,207
No later than the 20th.

170
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,040
I'll give you my answer in a week.

171
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,415
Make me a coffee, please.

172
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,124
What have you got planned for today?

173
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,749
House cleaning.

174
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,999
I'm going to the gym.

175
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,415
I know.

176
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,082
Come on you.

177
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,249
Let's go, come on.

178
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,790
Elena!

179
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,040
Bring me my things.

180
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,499
Coming.

181
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,582
Good afternoon.

182
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,207
Enjoy Fitness, this is Irina speaking.

183
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,540
Just one moment, I'll put
you through to the manager.

184
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:26,957
Here you go. Enjoy your workout.

185
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,790
– Good afternoon.
– Hello.

186
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:34,915
Your towel.

187
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,582
Anton!

188
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,540
Put them down there.

189
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,499
This is for you, this is for me.

190
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,707
– Thank you.
– Thank you.

191
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,499
– Bye.
– Bye.

192
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,957
Hello.

193
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,874
Yes, speaking.

194
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,915
– Hello.
– Good afternoon.

195
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,582
Remember, this is how we met.

196
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:54,249
Of course.

197
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,957
What year was that?

198
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,457
It'll be 10 years in December.

199
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:15,165
I would give everything to wake up
not here and now, but there and then.

200
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:23,665
No matter how you look at it, appendicitis
is still better, than a heart attack.

201
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,999
That was hardly appendicitis.
More like peritonitis.

202
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:33,040
A born nurse.

203
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,332
Of course, it was better.

204
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:40,124
If only because you
were looking after me.

205
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:48,082
Though the girls here aren't bad.

206
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,415
Go on, keep talking,

207
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:53,165
I'll cut off your oxygen,
we'll see what happens then.

208
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,040
You'd do it too.

209
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,749
– Did you talk to the doctor?
– Not yet.

210
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,915
All he does is try to keep me calm,

211
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,540
tells me they won't
keep me much longer.

212
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,749
So, it's not that bad.

213
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,040
Or the other way around.

214
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:36,415
Elena, please, call Katya.

215
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,249
Yes, of course.

216
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:53,999
Hello, Katya, this is Elena.

217
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,624
Yes, hello.

218
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,540
I'm sorry to say I have some bad news.

219
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:04,082
Your Dad's in the hospital;
he's had a heart attack.

220
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:08,249
He wants to see you.
You will come, won't you?

221
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,499
Can't today. Tomorrow.

222
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:16,915
Well, alright. I'd like
to meet you first to talk.

223
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,207
Is that really necessary?

224
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,957
Yes, I think it is.

225
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,874
Fine, where?

226
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,707
Wherever's best for you.

227
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,124
Hello, Elena.

228
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,582
Hello, Katya. Do you want anything?

229
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,124
I'll do without.

230
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:59,874
What I wanted to say is this:
your Dad had a heart attack.

231
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,374
I got that part.

232
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:02,999
He's very weak.

233
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,915
– He's conscious, though?
– Yes, conscious, thank God.

234
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,207
He's probably felt his way
through all the nurses already.

235
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:16,249
– Katya!
– Yes, Elena?

236
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:20,582
I want to ask you to go easy on him.

237
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,749
Right now he needs rest.

238
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:28,582
He needs your love.
Show him, that you love him.

239
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,832
You see each other so rarely,

240
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:35,124
which I don't understand
at all, but that's your business.

241
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:36,999
Indeed, it is.

242
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:42,499
Katya, you never call him.
You should…

243
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:44,124
Maybe this attack…

244
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,249
Right, the prodigal daughter's fault.

245
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,540
In part, I'm sure that's true.

246
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,749
Listen, Elena.

247
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,624
You're playing the role
of the worried wife.

248
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:56,665
You do it very well, congratulations.

249
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,332
So that's that. Finished?

250
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,874
I love Volodya.

251
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,040
Sure, to death do you part.
I don't doubt it.

252
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,707
Like a true nurse,
you're trying to cure me,

253
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,374
but I'm fine, I don't
need your treatment.

254
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,540
I am what I am.

255
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,957
Are you not at all
sorry for your father?

256
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:28,249
I understand that's
a rhetorical question,

257
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,124
but as far as you're concerned,

258
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,874
I don't give a flying fuck.

259
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,874
Oh, my Lord.

260
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,040
What room is he in?

261
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:42,040
Maybe it's not such a good
idea for you to see him today.

262
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,790
Another time. When he's better…

263
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,582
Well that's interesting.
Why call me yesterday,

264
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,332
and not when he's better?

265
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,082
Your father asked me to.

266
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,540
What room is Dad in?

267
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,540
– Excuse me.
– Hello.

268
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,874
Could you tell me…

269
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,165
Please, cover your head
in the house of the Lord.

270
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,582
I wanted to ask which saint
I should light a candle to?

271
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,374
For health, or for
one who has passed on?

272
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,540
My husband's in hospital.

273
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,415
A prayer for health, then.

274
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,915
Write his name on a slip of paper,

275
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,124
and the priest will pray
for his health during service.

276
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,457
And place a candle in
front of Saint Nicholas

277
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,457
and Mother of God.

278
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,749
And while you're lighting it,

279
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:33,415
ask the Lord to bring
him health and assistance.

280
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,124
Could you tell me

281
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,499
where those icons are?

282
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,415
Straight ahead and
to the right of the altar.

283
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:42,874
Thank you.

284
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,040
I barely see you, Katya.

285
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,665
You can barely see me 'cos
I'm standing against the sun.

286
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,707
I didn't mean it in that sense.

287
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:12,415
Dad, you know that nothing
like sense even exists.

288
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,665
Looking at you, sometimes I
think, that might even be true.

289
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,915
So, it's OK that you barely see me.

290
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,790
I was never your reason to live.

291
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,832
And 'thank God', as they say.

292
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,499
You're wrong about that.

293
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:42,249
Money, Dad, has always been
your only reason for living.

294
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:46,540
What are you, tallying up my life?

295
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,707
Money's important to you, too.

296
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,957
Not that important.

297
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:56,790
Maybe that's because you've
never earned any yourself.

298
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,665
Maybe that's because you spoiled me,

299
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,207
gave me everything on a plate.

300
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,665
Sounds like a complaint.

301
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,415
Come on, Dad, you know I adore you.

302
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,374
Keep it coming, please.

303
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,207
I don't know, why I do this.

304
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,540
You don't know, what
you're paying for?

305
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,124
What I've been paying
through the nose for.

306
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:22,499
Well, just don't start
sniffling on me, OK?

307
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:26,040
You've always loved those word games.

308
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,290
Games help

309
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:31,332
children come to terms with
the cruel laws of reality.

310
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,249
– Children?
– Nope.

311
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,499
Not going to happen.

312
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,790
I'm not pregnant,
if that's what you were asking.

313
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:44,957
Too bad. It'd sort you out.

314
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,707
I'm sorted.

315
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,415
Alcohol and drugs
only on the weekends.

316
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,332
It's clean living now.

317
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,957
Of all the pleasures I'm still
getting sex and food under control,

318
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,249
but I'm working on myself, trust me.

319
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,040
What, are you going
to smoke in here?

320
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,290
Why not?

321
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:04,457
– It's a hospital, Katya.
– So what?

322
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,665
You paid for the big suite,
you can do whatever you like.

323
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,290
Are you serious?

324
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:13,040
Fine, I'll go smoke,
where I'm allowed to.

325
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,374
Hold on.

326
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,832
What now?

327
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,749
Where does all this come from?

328
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:28,457
Where do you think?
Genes, Dad, heritage.

329
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:34,332
Rotten seed. We're all
bad seeds. Subhuman.

330
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:39,249
Go on and have some babies.
Maybe they'll turn out different.

331
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:45,957
Different from everyone else?

332
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,749
There's no such thing as 'different'.

333
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,665
And I don't feel like
experimenting in that area:

334
00:49:52,791 --> 00:50:00,332
it's painful, and
expensive, and pointless.

335
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:03,249
What is it with you and 'pointless'?

336
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:11,290
Dumb excuses. You're just trying
to avoid being responsible.

337
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:17,207
Dad, it's irresponsible
to produce offsprings

338
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,790
that – you know – are going to be

339
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,665
sick and doomed, since the
parents are just as sick and doomed.

340
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,582
And only because cosi fan tutte;

341
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:33,332
because there is some apparently
'higher meaning' to it all,

342
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,415
which is not ours to comprehend.

343
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:40,165
After all we are merely the
executors of this higher purpose.

344
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,207
Shit's gotta be tasty,

345
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:45,332
millions of flies can't be wrong.

346
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,749
And, anyway, the world will end soon
enough, in case you haven't heard.

347
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,124
You know, it's strange,
but listening to you,

348
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,082
I feel a lot better.

349
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,832
See, that's exactly why you breed:

350
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,415
to suck the life from your children.

351
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,915
And then you're surprised:
"Where does all this come from?"

352
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:11,124
Katya, you're such a twit sometimes.

353
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,874
Thanks.

354
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,165
I love you very much.

355
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,332
Can we do without that?

356
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,374
What one won't do for money!

357
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:31,082
See. Now, at last

358
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,249
you're starting to see the point.

359
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,665
Just don't loose sight of it yourself.

360
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,499
Parasite.

361
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,624
Oh? I thought, it was a heart attack.

362
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,540
Get over here, let me give you a kiss.

363
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:07,124
Dialling mama? Go on, give her a ring.

364
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:23,874
Let's see, what's
going on in the kitchen.

365
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,832
Have a look outside, and
see what's there.

366
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,249
See, if there are any sparrows about…

367
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,832
Needs to boil some more. Right…

368
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,124
Where are those sparrows at?

369
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,415
Bless you.

370
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,540
Above all, observe the
medication schedule closely.

371
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,624
Next, diet is critical.

372
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:10,332
And take it easy, nothing stressful.

373
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:15,207
Plus, I would recommend
hiring a qualified caretaker.

374
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,499
I worked in a hospital,

375
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,624
looking after patients for years.

376
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,749
So the better.

377
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:21,832
See you around, doctor.

378
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:23,915
You too. Take care of yourself.

379
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:25,124
All the best.

380
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,165
So long.

381
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,415
I think, we're seeing our refs…

382
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:28,082
I'm not talking about today's refs,

383
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:31,707
but all this talk about
referee's mistakes,

384
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,915
it's making them hedge their bets.

385
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:36,124
If we filed the tapes of this show
and watched them in 5 years' time…

386
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:42,915
The country would be shocked
at the way it's all repeating.

387
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,832
You'll pay for what you have done.

388
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,707
You won't get away with it, either.

389
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:52,374
But I wish you, our
audience, all the best.

390
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,957
Goodbye.

391
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,540
Elena.

392
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:16,040
I have something…
I need to tell you.

393
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,624
Your pills.

394
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:36,624
In short, I've
decided to write a will.

395
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,957
Volodya, I'm sorry, but this
makes me really uncomfortable.

396
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:43,040
Elena, this is important.

397
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,874
I need to be straight with you.

398
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,874
It's the right thing
to do, and after all,

399
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:53,457
everyone's thinking about what'll
happen after I'm gone, right?

400
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,999
No, it's not like that.

401
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,915
All the same, it's
a talk we need to have.

402
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,790
Fair enough.

403
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:04,624
Except for you and my daughter,

404
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,499
I don't have anyone
else in this world.

405
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:12,290
After I die, my daughter will
inherit almost everything.

406
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:18,874
And you, as my spouse,
will receive a life-annuity,

407
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:24,332
monthly payments. And I'm confident

408
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:29,082
they will be more than enough.

409
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,207
That's it, really.

410
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:38,040
I built up to this for so long,
and fired it all out in 10 seconds.

411
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:43,499
Is there… something
you want to say?

412
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:49,540
Yes… there is.

413
00:57:51,708 --> 00:58:00,707
It's not about what you were saying,
but it seems like the right time.

414
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,790
What is it?

415
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:06,832
– The thing.
– What thing?

416
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,832
The thing with Sasha.

417
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:21,165
I think that his father,

418
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,540
your son, should be
taking care of his own son.

419
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,999
Volodya…

420
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:33,249
What were they thinking
when they had him?

421
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,457
It was an accident.

422
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,790
Both times? Don't make me laugh.

423
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,582
It's no laughing matter.

424
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:46,124
It just happened, like
it does with everybody.

425
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,582
First one kid by
accident, then another.

426
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,874
And now I'm supposed to feed them?

427
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:58,082
Elena, it's not the money
that bothers me.

428
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:00,124
Of course, not.

429
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:03,540
You're giving all of it to
your thoughtless daughter.

430
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,665
Here we go again!

431
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:10,332
First of all, not all of it.

432
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:15,249
And second of all, you don't know
her. She's actually quite sensible.

433
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:17,624
Thoughtless and derailed.

434
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,707
I don't want to hear it.

435
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,790
And apparently infertile, too.

436
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:25,915
Nonsense!

437
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,207
She's just… different.
She's not like you and me.

438
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:34,207
Of course, she's nothing
like my son and his children!

439
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,915
You said it.

440
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,957
Dear God…

441
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,665
… what gives you the right?

442
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,415
What?

443
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,374
What right do you have
to think you're special?

444
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,207
Why?

445
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:57,290
Just because you have
more money? More things?

446
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:01,165
All that can change.

447
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,957
What exactly can change?

448
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,207
"… and the last shall be the first".

449
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:10,499
Ah, heard that one.

450
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,582
Biblical fairy-tales
for poor foolish people.

451
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,082
Equality and fraternity

452
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:25,874
are only to be found in
your Heavenly Kingdom, Elena.

453
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,415
Well, you probably have a lot to do.

454
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:35,457
Yes, quite a lot.

455
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,957
Do you want anything?

456
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:42,915
I only want for you
to have understood me.

457
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,165
I did.

458
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:49,582
Elena, let's deal
with this like adults.

459
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,540
We are adults. We'll get through it.

460
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,040
And I'm glad, you understand.

461
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:59,124
Can you, please, bring
me a pen and paper.

462
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,124
The lawyer is coming tomorrow,

463
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,415
and I want to sketch
out a draft of the will.

464
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,457
Sergei, hi.

465
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,999
Fine, thanks.

466
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,457
Better, but still weak.

467
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,165
Listen…

468
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:14,540
… I talked to him about Sasha.

469
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:18,499
I'm afraid, we'll have to
deal with this on our own.

470
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,540
Yes, that's it.

471
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:26,290
He says, it's your job, as a father,
to deal with the problem.

472
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,707
Stop it.

473
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,165
Stop, would you?

474
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,582
I'm upset myself.

475
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,999
But I think, there's some
truth to what he says.

476
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:41,457
We'll figure it out ourselves.

477
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,249
We'll think of something.

478
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,874
I'll call later, OK?

479
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:55,540
Shit. The Tightass!

480
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:12,374
Tanya, where's my beer?

481
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,415
Did you get the baby's formula?

482
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,457
There was a damn bottle in here.

483
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,290
Did you finish your homework?

484
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,499
Yeah.

485
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,415
Did you do you homework?

486
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,082
I did it already!

487
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,582
What a mess in here.

488
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:14,290
I can't concentrate, it
all just comes out wrong.

489
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,999
Medicine first.

490
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,790
He's through! He shoots!

491
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,332
Many of you are probably wondering

492
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,415
if everything here
is strictly above board…

493
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,665
Elena!

494
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:14,582
I've had enough. Thanks.

495
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,165
Do you want to take a nap?

496
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,999
Think I will.

497
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,165
I can't believe it.

498
01:15:57,291 --> 01:16:00,415
You really weren't warned,
no one told you to abstain?

499
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:03,707
Drugs like this are strictly
prohibited after a heart attack.

500
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:07,874
I'm telling you, I didn't
even know that he had it.

501
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,999
Like little kids, I swear.

502
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:16,082
Dumb teenagers have more sense.

503
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:20,915
You could be a bit more tactful.

504
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,582
How much more tactful?

505
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:48,040
Dear friends, relatives and
colleagues of the deceased,

506
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:50,540
it's time to say farewell…

507
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,082
Final farewells.

508
01:20:56,041 --> 01:21:00,915
Sausage number 4 is the best,
though it's too salty for me.

509
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:05,332
I think, the one
closest to milk sausage

510
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,790
is number 4.

511
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:10,207
It's got some sausage taste,

512
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:11,749
unlike number 3…

513
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,915
Well, tastes differ…

514
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,790
I vote for number 3.

515
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:18,915
Please.

516
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,790
Our jurors here are regular shoppers.

517
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:25,457
They can only vote for one sausage.

518
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:28,040
All of the labels
have been covered up.

519
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,749
I voted for the sixth,
it was pretty edible,

520
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,124
I mean you don't even
notice the bread-rusk,

521
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,624
there's no starch, and
there's no taste of cardboard.

522
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,832
So it's an OK sausage.

523
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,582
This one's too moist, too watery.

524
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,165
Cook it a little more.

525
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:46,957
It's a sign,
that it wasn't made right.

526
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:49,707
Sausage just shouldn't be like that.

527
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,999
The contest will continue
in the laboratory,

528
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,832
where the winner will be chosen.

529
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,499
I liked number 6, I'm not sure…

530
01:21:57,666 --> 01:22:01,540
I'm not sure about number
1, I don't know, who made it,

531
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,040
or what they made it from,

532
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,665
but I'd never buy a sausage
that looked like that.

533
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:08,665
Number five is a waste,

534
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:13,957
don't spend your money

535
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:16,040
on plastic like that.

536
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:06,332
Hello. Yes. Thank you.
I'll be right down.

537
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,290
– Hello.
– Good afternoon.

538
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:41,332
Well, he sensed his
demise ahead of time.

539
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,499
As his personal attorney,

540
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:46,957
I know, how he wished
to dispose of his property.

541
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,290
He himself requested that
I visit him in the hospital,

542
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:52,124
and we discussed the matter.

543
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,832
Alas, we failed to document
his wishes in writing,

544
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:56,874
as required by law.

545
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,832
I am, therefore, forced
to acknowledge the following:

546
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:05,374
he did not leave a will.

547
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,832
So the principle of legal
succession enters into force.

548
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:15,249
First of all, I would like
to advise, that he left no debts.

549
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,165
Otherwise, you would be liable

550
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:21,290
to creditors for his debts.

551
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:25,707
Further, it is my duty
to inform you, that under the law

552
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:29,957
should one spouse die,
the surviving spouse

553
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:33,707
has the right to a portion
of the property

554
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:38,290
acquired during the marriage.

555
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:41,707
That is, to their share of the
property, held in common by the spouses

556
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:47,624
during the marriage, on an equal
basis along with the other heirs.

557
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:50,582
This portion is included
in the inheritance,

558
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:54,540
along with the personal
property of the deceased.

559
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:55,832
However,

560
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,874
in this case, during the time

561
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:01,040
that you were formally married,

562
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:04,124
which was just over two years,

563
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:07,165
no common property was acquired.

564
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:12,290
Therefore, there can be no
talk of a spousal share here.

565
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:17,499
You will inherit a portion of
the property of the deceased

566
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:19,582
on an equal basis with Katya.

567
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:22,040
Since, to the best of my
knowledge, there are no other heirs

568
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:25,374
besides the two of you,
the entire estate

569
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:30,624
will be equally divided between you.

570
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:34,915
If anything is unclear

571
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,207
or you have any questions,
I can explain further.

572
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,332
I know that my father

573
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:45,499
always kept a sizeable amount
of cash in his home safe.

574
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:46,624
What happens to that?

575
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,457
I already checked, there's nothing.

576
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,082
Right.

577
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,457
Believe me, Katya.

578
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:53,999
Of course. Anything else?

579
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,457
We've only started.

580
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:57,790
I've described the overall situation.

581
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:01,290
Let's look at the details.

582
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:05,832
If you like, we can take a break.

583
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,874
No need, let's go on.

584
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,124
Right, Elena?

585
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,999
Yes, let's go on.

586
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,082
OK. Let's get started.

587
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,207
So, how shall we carve up Dad's pad?

588
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,082
We'll be carving according to the law.

589
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,040
That's that.

590
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:50,832
Mama.

591
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,249
We should drink to this!

592
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:00,665
I agree.

593
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:03,540
– Have we got anything?
– Of course, we do.

594
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,290
Well, come on then!

595
01:31:15,041 --> 01:31:17,665
Don't cry, mama'll be right back.

596
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,499
You know what?

597
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,165
Let's drink to Volodya.

598
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,332
He did

599
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:48,082
at least one decent thing in his life.

600
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:52,999
Better still, to Sasha.

601
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:57,207
Sasha! Sash!

602
01:31:57,416 --> 01:32:00,332
– What?
– Don't you 'what' me. Get in here.

603
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:11,874
College boy. Sit down. Here. You're
going to college for sure now.

604
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,999
What the hell.

605
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:17,040
What? I've got it under control.
The kid's 17 already.

606
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:19,790
What, is this real?

607
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:22,624
Never seen anything like
that, huh? Put it down.

608
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,207
Damn!

609
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,999
Well, come on.

610
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,124
To new life.

611
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:35,249
Mama. We have a surprise for
you! We're pregnant again!

612
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,915
Are you serious? Really?!

613
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:43,374
Goodness, that's wonderful!

614
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,082
– If it's a boy, I'll call him Volodya.
– Oh, please.

615
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:49,207
– Why not?
– Well, I hope, it's a girl.

616
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:50,499
Yeah, a girl would be better.

617
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,082
A girl would be better.

618
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:55,082
Yeah?

619
01:32:55,791 --> 01:32:57,457
Here.

620
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:02,832
Hey, go easy!

621
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:05,582
Cut it out, woman,
you're pissing me off.

622
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,415
Game over.

623
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,499
Probably just the circuit breaker.

624
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:11,624
What's with you?

625
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,999
Mama, you're going to break my arm.

626
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:15,665
Give him to me.

627
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:17,249
Let me go have a look.

628
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:24,124
Easy, little one, easy…

629
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:36,832
Looks like the whole building's out.

630
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,165
The whole world!

631
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,582
The assholes.

632
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:43,707
– Hey, Aleskei.
– Hey.

633
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:51,124
– What's up with it?
– Fuck knows.

634
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:56,832
The whole block's been cut off,

635
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:02,415
I guess. They'll probably
turn it back on soon.

636
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,665
Assholes, second time this month.

637
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,749
OK, Sergey. Take care.

638
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,790
Hi!

639
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,749
Hey, you lot.

640
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,624
– Where are you off to?
– For a walk.

641
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,582
Be home by 11.

642
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,457
Tanya, have we got candles?

643
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:20,249
Why would we have candles?

644
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,999
Vitya, Lesha, you there?

645
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,124
Hey, guys.

646
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,040
What took you so long?

647
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:37,540
My grandma was getting on my case.

648
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:41,332
Thought, you chickened out.
Almost went without you.

649
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:42,915
You should have then. Shut it.

650
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:46,082
Whatever, chill out. Here, juice up.

651
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,790
Hey, leave some for us.

652
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,624
– Are they there?
– Yeah.

653
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,832
– Then let's go.
– All right.

654
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,957
Yuri, hurry the fuck up!

655
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,707
Fuck off, fucker!

656
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,082
Die, fucker!

657
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:25,582
You cunt!

658
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,915
Dima, let's go!

659
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,207
Mama!

660
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:04,790
Quiet!

661
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:16,499
Mama, what do we need this crap for?

662
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,790
If we put a wall in here,

663
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,374
a door over here, then
Sasha can have his own room.

664
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:23,749
We still haven't decided
anything with Katya.

665
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,749
We'll work something out.

666
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:26,999
I doubt it.

667
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:28,665
We will, I'm telling you.

668
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:43,457
Ma, have we got any beer?

669
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:45,415
Look in the fridge.

670
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:56,124
Even the upcoming
Olympics has not broken

671
01:39:56,208 --> 01:39:58,582
the stagnation in Sochi…

672
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,582
I'm worried, waiting for his decision.

673
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:08,832
I think, it doesn't
matter whose prize you are.

674
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:15,540
I like the fact, that he
leads an interesting life,

675
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:18,665
full of adventurism and activity.

676
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:21,457
He's got kind eyes.

677
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,290
I'm worried about Yulia,

678
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:28,749
she's got that child…

679
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:31,582
Choose Katya or Dasha,
there's no difference,

680
01:40:31,666 --> 01:40:33,957
whichever one takes your fancy.

681
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:38,499
You're cool,

682
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:42,790
you were better than all of them.
Don't listen to anything they say.

683
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:44,165
Is he asleep?

684
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:49,874
Elena, this is amazing!

685
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:52,790
Tea anyone?

686
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:55,124
I think, there's about a 98%
chance he'll come into my room.

687
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,374
Let me help you.

688
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:58,832
I'll even leave with him.

689
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:01,249
Tanya, bring me some nuts.

690
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:06,207
My god, come over here, come to me.

691
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:09,957
He can't even speak,
he's overwhelmed…

692
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:12,582
Come here! Come on!

693
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:14,999
Today I feel like I'm 90 years old,

694
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:16,874
and I want to give you a hard time,

695
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,540
because you're all younger than me.

696
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:25,499
I think that you're
empty-headed bimbos.

697
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:30,582
Keep it in perspective, otherwise you'll
be sitting here until your pension.

698
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:33,249
She wants a lot, but giving…

699
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,915
She doesn't know, what
she's going to give yet.

700
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:38,165
Zhenya, what did you think of Lena?

701
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:39,624
I don't know what to tell you…

702
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:46,040
Basically, there's nothing I can say.

703
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:15,832
