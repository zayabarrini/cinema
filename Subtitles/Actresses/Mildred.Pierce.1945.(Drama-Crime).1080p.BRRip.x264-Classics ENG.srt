1
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,089
Mildred.

2
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,926
What's on your mind, lady?

3
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,761
You know what I think?

4
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,432
I think maybe you had an idea
you'd take a swim. That's what I think.

5
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,808
Leave me alone.

6
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,979
If you take a swim,
I'd have to take a swim. Is that fair?

7
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,708
Just because you feel like bumping
yourself off, I gotta get pneumonia.

8
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,234
Never thought about that, did ya?

9
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,778
Okay, think about it.

10
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:59,782
Go on, beat it now. Go on home
before we both take a swim.

11
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,648
Hey, Mildred.

12
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,318
What are you doing around
this pigeon perch? Slumming?

13
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,445
- What?
- You sick or somethin'?

14
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,074
No, I don't think so.

15
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:45,495
Well, if you're feeling weak, come inside
and have a drink on the house, for free.

16
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,081
Come on.

17
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,085
You know, buying this joint was
the smartest move I ever made.

18
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:57,256
♪ You must have been a beautiful baby ♪

19
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,218
- Give us a couple drinks, will ya, Tony?
- Yes, sir.

20
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,847
♪ When you were only startin'
to go to kindergarten ♪

21
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,184
♪ I'll bet you drove the little girls wild ♪

22
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:13,731
I hope you're not sore at me about
this afternoon. Strictly business, see?

23
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:18,027
I mean, it might just as well have been
you selling me out. You can't expect that...

24
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,698
What are you looking at me like that for?

25
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,993
You can talk your way out of anything,
can't you, Wally? You're good at that.

26
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,828
In my business you have to be.

27
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,624
Only, right now I'd rather
talk myself into something.

28
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,126
Know what I mean?

29
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,128
- Still trying, huh?
- It's a habit.

30
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,130
I've been trying once a week
since we were kids.

31
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,549
- Twice a week.
- Okay, twice.

32
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,300
Anyhow, I'm still drawing blanks.

33
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,346
Hey, you never used to
drink it straight like that.

34
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,849
I've learned how these last few months.

35
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,560
- I've learned a lot of things.
- Like, for instance?

36
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:53,855
Like, for instance, that's rotten liquor.

37
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:57,025
There's better stuff to drink
at the beach house, Wally.

38
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,819
Is that a dare?

39
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,362
Could be.

40
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,867
All right, I'll take it.

41
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,661
You know I like good stuff.

42
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,747
Maybe this is my lucky day.

43
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,457
Maybe.

44
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,637
- Come in.
- How about your husband?

45
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:30,141
Is he, uh, getting broad-minded
all of a sudden?

46
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,354
- Monte isn't here.
- Oh?

47
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,274
Besides, you can talk your way
out of anything, can't you?

48
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,193
Oh, I get by all right.

49
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,279
- You keep sayin' that.
- Do I?

50
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,994
- Nervous, Wally?
- No, no. Cold.

51
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:51,788
Temporarily.

52
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,878
- Isn't this more comfortable?
- Yeah, yeah, I guess so, but...

53
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,255
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

54
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,217
- You don't seem very happy here.
- Oh, I'm happy. Believe me.

55
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,385
Inside, my heart is singing.

56
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,180
- That's pretty corny, Wally.
- Yeah, well, I'm a corny guy.

57
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,057
But I'm smart too.

58
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,313
- I wonder about things.
- What things?

59
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,941
Well, for instance, I wonder why
you brought me here tonight.

60
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,694
I mean, all of a sudden, voom!
Husband gone, soft lights, quiet room.

61
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,322
Opportunity. Why?

62
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,409
- Maybe I find you irresistible, Wally.
- Yeah?

63
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,995
You make me shiver, Mildred.
You always have.

64
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,790
You make love so nicely, Wally.
You always have.

65
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,627
You know, Mildred, all my life
when I've wanted something I've gone after it.

66
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,462
I get it too.

67
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,340
May take me a little time, okay,
but I get what I want.

68
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,925
Do you?

69
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,344
- Must be nice.
- Yeah.

70
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,804
It is.

71
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,225
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, what's the score?

72
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,811
I feel sticky.

73
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,815
- I think I'd better change my dress.
- Yeah? Yeah, sure, Mildred. It's a good idea.

74
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,276
I'll, uh... I'll only be a minute.

75
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,698
Leave the door open so we can talk.

76
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,867
- I like to hear you talk.
- Yeah?

77
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,952
So do I.

78
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,038
Somethin' about the sound of my own voice
that fascinates me.

79
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:20,031
I'm glad you didn't get sore at me,
the way I took you over the hurdles, Mildred.

80
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,564
I didn't mean to cut up your business the way
I did. I just got started and couldn't stop.

81
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,590
I can't help myself.

82
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:29,073
I see an angle, right away I start cuttin'
myself a piece of throat. It's an instinct.

83
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,848
With me bein' smart's a disease.
Know what I mean?

84
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,310
Hmm?

85
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,230
Hey, Mildred.

86
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,649
Hurry up.
You know I don't like to drink alone.

87
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,152
Hey, say something.

88
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,905
This one-sided conversation
is beginning to bore me.

89
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,247
Huh?

90
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,420
Say, uh, Mildred.

91
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,924
Mildred.

92
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,135
Hey, come on, Mildred.
Don't play any games.

93
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,222
I'm a nice guy up to a certain point,
but don't get me sore.

94
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,557
Mildred.

95
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,489
Hey!

96
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,366
Hey, what's the matter?

97
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,244
What kind of a business is this anyway?

98
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,875
Mildred!

99
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,882
Mildred!

100
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,462
Hit that house with the light.

101
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,552
Hey! Stop, you!

102
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,555
Okay, okay.

103
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,645
What's the hurry, pal?

104
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,523
- No gun.
- Better take a look in that house.

105
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:32,735
This guy came through that window
like he was shot out of a cannon.

106
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:37,114
- Get that coming out of the window?
- No. I cut myself shaving.

107
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,866
All right, get goin', smart guy.

108
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,661
- You need some fixin'.
- Oh, brother. I'm so smart it's a disease.

109
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,413
All right, go ahead.

110
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,669
What were you doin' in that house, pal?
Picking up a few souvenirs, maybe?

111
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,421
No, pal. Nothing petty.

112
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,423
- This is a pretty big night for you.
- Yeah?

113
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,301
Yeah. Lots of excitement.
There's a stiff in there.

114
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,512
Is that so?

115
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,240
And I suppose you were runnin'
right down to the station to report it.

116
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

117
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,809
Hey!

118
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,572
- He says there's a dead guy in the house.
- You never saw a deader.

119
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,313
- Better call headquarters.
- Yep.

120
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,111
Car 93 calling KQVB.

121
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,030
Car 93 calling KQVB.

122
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,138
Mother, where have you been?
What's happened? They won't tell me anything.

123
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,224
- Who won't tell you anything? Who's they?
- These men.

124
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,645
- Mrs. Beragon?
- Yes.

125
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,188
We're from headquarters.

126
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,626
The inspector would like to have you come down
and have a talk with him, if it's convenient.

127
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,110
Why? What's the matter?

128
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,446
I'm sorry, lady.
We only ask the questions.

129
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,739
Besides, we don't rightly know
what the trouble is.

130
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,843
It's probably just something
about the car or something.

131
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,493
At this time of night?

132
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,474
It's all right, darling.
Whatever it is, I'll take care of it.

133
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,126
You're not to think about it at all.
Now go to bed, please.

134
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,462
- Mother...
- Please go on.

135
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,218
- Can't you tell me what's happened?
- We'd better go.

136
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,978
What's wrong? What's the matter?

137
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,039
I didn't want to say anything
in front of your daughter.

138
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,065
It's your husband. He's been murdered.

139
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,776
Murdered?

140
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,566
Hiya, Joe. What you got?

141
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,568
This is Mrs. Pierce. I mean Beragon.

142
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,279
Which is it, Pierce or Beragon?
Make up your mind.

143
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:25,032
- Mildred Pierce Beragon.
- Okay. Wheel her in.

144
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,038
Right over there, please.

145
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,083
Mrs. Beragon just came in.

146
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,919
Sit down. He'll be right with you.

147
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,763
Look, I bruise easy.

148
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,473
- Ida, what are you...
- No talking.

149
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,144
Yeah?

150
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,105
Ida Corwin.

151
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,737
Well, what is this, a class reunion?

152
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,281
Looks like it.

153
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,327
I'll have a tough time
talkin' my way out of this.

154
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,413
- Keep movin'.
- All right, all right.

155
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,756
Hi, Ed.

156
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,885
- Charley, what's the good word?
- My feet hurt. That's the good word.

157
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,264
You got me cryin'. How about a nice,
juicy item for the morning edition?

158
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,057
Nope. Not today.

159
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:35,603
- What's she in for?
- Parking gum under her seat in the movie.

160
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,564
- Satisfied?
- Okay, Charley, okay.

161
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:49,241
- I'm sorry, Mildred. I just couldn't help it.
- No talking.

162
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,120
Take a seat.

163
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,584
Do you know that guy?

164
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,170
Yes. We were married once.

165
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,097
Paper, lady?

166
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,683
No, thank you.

167
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,751
Yeah?

168
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,294
Okay.

169
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,965
He wants you now. Now you can talk.

170
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,646
- Inspector Peterson, Mrs. Beragon.
- How do you do, Mrs. Beragon?

171
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,148
- How do you do?
- Won't you sit down?

172
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,653
Sorry about your husband.
It must be a shock to you.

173
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,489
Well, I...

174
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:15,369
I'm afraid I don't
quite know how to begin.

175
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,582
You see, the fact of the matter is,
Mrs. Beragon, we don't need you.

176
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,835
You don't need me?

177
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,921
I don't know how to apologize
for bringing you down here for nothing,

178
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,591
but, you understand, we had to be sure.

179
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,260
Well, now we are sure.

180
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,638
You aren't going to to ask me questions?
I thought you would ask me questions.

181
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,265
I know, Mrs. Beragon.

182
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,309
Everybody thinks that detectives
do nothing but ask questions.

183
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,771
But detectives have souls
same as anyone else.

184
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,107
Cigarette?

185
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,652
- No, thank you.
- Go ahead. It's all right.

186
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,573
You know, Mrs. Beragon,
being a detective is like...

187
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,117
Well, like making an automobile.

188
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,828
You just take all the pieces
and put them together one by one.

189
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,122
First thing you know,
you got an automobile.

190
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,790
Or a murderer.

191
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,417
And we got him.

192
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,754
Oh, you're in the clear, Mrs. Beragon.
The case is on ice.

193
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,797
You can go now.

194
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,507
All right, men.

195
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,428
Could you...

196
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,890
- Would you tell me who...
- Who did it?

197
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,517
Sure. You're entitled to know.

198
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,781
No. No!

199
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,079
Yes. He did it.

200
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,248
Your first husband. Pierce.

201
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,417
No, Bert, I won't let you do this.

202
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,003
What about Wally Fay?
How do you know he didn't do it?

203
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,088
Fay had no motive. This man had.

204
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,966
You see, Mrs. Beragon,
we start out with nothing.

205
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,427
Just a corpse,
if you'll pardon the expression.

206
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:59,223
Okay, we look at the corpse and we say,
"Why? What was the reason?"

207
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,852
And when we find the reason,
we find the man that made the corpse.

208
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,063
In this case, him.

209
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,358
Come on.

210
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,907
But I tell you he didn't do it.
I know he didn't.

211
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,367
Do you?

212
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,328
The murder was committed with this.

213
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,330
Do you know who it belongs to?

214
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,707
No. I don't know.

215
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,211
We do. It belongs to Pierce.
That's fact number one.

216
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,047
Fact number two —
he doesn't deny killing Beragon.

217
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,049
Seems to think it was a good idea.

218
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,343
And if there's one thing
we know from experience,

219
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:41,974
it's that an innocent man always
denies the crime, loud and often.

220
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,559
Pierce doesn't.

221
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,855
So, do you blame us for feeling
fairly confident that he's the man

222
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,190
who put four shots out of six
into Beragon?

223
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,360
But he didn't. He couldn't.
He's too gentle and kind.

224
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,029
Okay. He's kind and gentle.
He's wonderful.

225
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,992
But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,
why did you divorce him?

226
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,707
Because I was wrong.

227
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,087
It's taken me four years to find that out,
but now I know I was wrong.

228
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,174
Let's see. Four years ago he was
in the real estate business, wasn't he?

229
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,011
Yes. He and Wally Fay were partners.

230
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,265
For a long time they made good money.
They built a lot of houses.

231
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,893
Suddenly, everybody stopped buying.
The boom was over.

232
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,060
Yes?

233
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:31,189
Then one day they split up.
Wally was in and Bert was out.

234
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,692
<i>They weren't partners anymore.</i>

235
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,945
<i>That day when Bert came home
he was out of a job.</i>

236
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,157
- Why, here's the mail for you, Mr. Pierce.
- Thanks, Jack.

237
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,951
- Say, have you got a change of address card?
- Why, yes.

238
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,412
Thanks.

239
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,251
<i>We lived on Corvallis Street
where all the houses looked alike.</i>

240
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,879
<i>Ours was number 1143.</i>

241
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,089
<i>I was always in the kitchen.</i>

242
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,426
<i>I felt as though I'd been born
in a kitchen and lived there all my life,</i>

243
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,970
<i>except for the few hours
it took to get married.</i>

244
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,557
- That you, Bert?
- Yeah. Who else?

245
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,851
I thought it might be Mrs. Whitley
calling for her cake.

246
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,020
Well, it isn't.

247
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,230
<i>I married Bert when I was 17.</i>

248
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:16,568
<i>I never knew any other kind of life.
Just cooking and washing and having children.</i>

249
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,904
<i>Two girls, Veda and Kay.</i>

250
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,827
I pressed your other pair of pants.

251
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,097
I thought you might want to see McLary
about that salesman's job.

252
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,667
It might be nice, Mildred, if you
left me alone once for just five minutes.

253
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,669
When the time comes I'll get a job.

254
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,296
I know you will, Bert.
I was just trying to help.

255
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,804
- Good afternoon. Package from E. Langlin.
- Oh.

256
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,559
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,522
- What's that?
- It's a dress.

258
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,940
- For Veda?
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,192
I thought so. Where'd you get the money?

260
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,463
Baking cakes and making pies for the neighbors.
That's where I got it. I earned it.

261
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,407
That's right. Throw it up to me
that I can't support my own family.

262
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,210
I'm sorry, Bert, but I don't say half as much
as most women would say

263
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,161
with nothing but bills
staring them in the face.

264
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,454
Go ahead. Keep it up.

265
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,933
Maybe you wouldn't have so many bills
if you didn't try to bring up those kids

266
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,542
like their old man was a millionaire.

267
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,419
No wonder they're so fresh and stuck-up.

268
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,712
That Veda.

269
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,714
I'm so fed up
with the way she high-hats me

270
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,359
that one of these days I'm gonna cut loose
and slap her right in the face.

271
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,802
Bert, if you ever dare touch Veda, I'll...

272
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,392
All right, all right.

273
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:34,104
Trouble is, you're trying to buy love
from those kids and it won't work.

274
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,166
I'm no bargain, but I make enough to get by.
But no, that isn't good enough.

275
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,484
Veda has to have a piano and lessons
and fancy dresses

276
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,128
so she can sit up on a platform,
smirking her way through a piece

277
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,114
any five-year-old with talent could play.

278
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,491
Veda has talent.
Just ask any of the neighbors.

279
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,661
Yeah? She plays the piano like I shoot pool.

280
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,582
And Kay, a nice, normal little kid
who wants to skip rope and play baseball.

281
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,584
But she's got to take ballet lessons.

282
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,479
She's going to become a ballet dancer
so you can feel proud of yourself.

283
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,130
All right. What of it?

284
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,632
What if I do want them
to amount to something?

285
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,111
I'll do anything for those kids.
Do you understand? Anything.

286
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,554
Yeah? Well, you can't
do their crying for them.

287
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,974
I'll do that too. They'll never do
any crying, if I can help it.

288
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:14,061
There's something wrong, Mildred.
I don't know what. I'm not smart that way.

289
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,147
But I know it isn't right to —

290
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,152
Hello?

291
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,446
<i>- I just wanted to know if —</i>
- Yes?

292
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,698
Yes, he is.

293
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,576
- Who's calling?
<i>- I'm Mrs. Biederhof.</i>

294
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,119
Just a moment.

295
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,539
It's for you. Mrs. Biederhof.

296
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,960
Maggie, I can't talk to you now.
I told you not to —

297
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,805
<i>- I tried to call you at the office.</i>
- I can't talk to you now. Later.

298
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,550
So the noble Mr. Pierce
can't talk right now.

299
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,237
He's too busy telling his wife
that what's wrong with their married life

300
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,180
is the way she treats the children.

301
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,182
Maggie means nothing to me. You know that.

302
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,184
I wish I could believe it.

303
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,705
You'd better run down there and apologize,
or she won't play gin rummy with you anymore.

304
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,409
- It is gin rummy, isn't it?
- Now, look, Mildred. Don't go too far.

305
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:04,111
- One of these days I'll call your bluff.
- Oh, no, you're not calling me. I'm calling you.

306
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,547
You might as well get this straight
right now, once and for all.

307
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,741
Those kids come first in this house,
before either one of us.

308
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,037
Maybe that's right, maybe it's wrong,
but that's the way it is.

309
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,124
I'm determined to do
the best I can for them.

310
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,376
If I can't do it with you,
I'll do it without you.

311
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,522
Now we're getting to the point. You're looking
for an excuse to heave me out on my ear.

312
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,106
- I didn't say that.
- Well, I'm fed up.

313
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,091
Let's see you get along
without me for a while.

314
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,093
When you want me,
you know where to find me.

315
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,095
Bert.

316
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,098
You go down to that woman's house again
and you're never coming back here.

317
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,641
I go where I want to go.

318
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,186
Then pack up, Bert.

319
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,689
All right, I will.

320
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,902
The, uh, kids haven't come home yet, huh?

321
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,155
No, not yet.

322
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:53,869
I, uh... I don't want you to tell them
I said good-bye or anything like that.

323
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,663
- You can just say —
- I know. I'll take care of it.

324
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,124
Okay, then. I'll leave it to you.

325
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,753
Good-bye, Mildred.

326
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,633
Go on, Bert.
There's nothing more to say. Just go on.

327
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,352
One, two, three, hike!

328
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,104
Pass it! Pass it!

329
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,732
Come on! Pass it!

330
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,986
Kay, for goodness' sake!

331
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,447
- Oh, what's eatin' you?
- You're coming home with me.

332
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,367
Oh, I ain't done nothing.
You never let anybody have fun.

333
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,161
Look at your clothes.

334
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:39,364
Honest, Kay, I think you ought to take
a little more pride in the way you look.

335
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,959
- You act like a peasant.
- Aw, pretzels! What do I care?

336
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,546
You'll care someday, Miss Smarty.
Wait till you get interested in boys.

337
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,174
I got over that when I was eight.

338
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,278
- Come on. You'd better hurry up.
- Oh, all right.

339
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,699
All right. I'll try, I'll try.

340
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,201
- Hello, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

341
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,929
- Good afternoon, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

342
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,705
- Who is the cake for?
- Eddie Whitley. It's his birthday.

343
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,251
- Oh, that goon.
- Ah. How'd the lesson go today, Veda?

344
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,253
- Oh, I'm learning a new piece.
- Are you?

345
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,297
<i>"Waltz Brilliant."</i>
That means "brilliant waltz."

346
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,342
- Does it really?
- Mm-hmm.

347
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,803
I saw Father go out.

348
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,346
Did you?

349
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,349
Why don't you play your new piece
for me, Veda? I'd love to hear it.

350
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,892
Oh, all right.

351
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,352
When do we eat?

352
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,521
Now, you stop that,
or you'll spoil your dinner.

353
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,856
- Okay.
- Look at your clothes.

354
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,067
I know, I know. I should have been a boy.

355
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,379
Come on. Bring me those dishes
off the sink, will you, darling?

356
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,613
Okay.

357
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,119
- Father had a suitcase with him.
- Did he?

358
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,955
- That's a lovely piece, Veda.
- Where was he going?

359
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,749
- I don't know.
- How long will he be gone?

360
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,835
That's hard to say.

361
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:10,005
- Don't stop playing, darling.
- Is he coming back?

362
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,215
Has he gone for good?

363
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,638
You might as well know it now,
both of you.

364
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,016
Your father and I
have decided to separate.

365
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,186
You mean, Dad's not coming home anymore?
Doesn't he like us?

366
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,273
It has nothing to do with you, honey.

367
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,358
It just couldn't be helped.

368
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,319
We'll have to get along by ourselves now.

369
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,447
What did you and Father quarrel about?

370
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,533
I can't tell you now.
Some day I will, but not now.

371
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:42,704
If you mean Mrs. Biederhof, Mother,
I must say my sympathy is all with you.

372
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,289
She's distinctly middle-class.

373
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,416
Please, Veda. It wasn't Mrs. Biederhof.

374
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,917
It was just little things.

375
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,629
- Mostly about your dress.
- My dress? It came?

376
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,341
- Yes, it's upstairs in your room.
- Oh, come on!

377
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,217
Oh, okay.

378
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,056
You oughta do something
about your sit-down.

379
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,516
- What's wrong with it?
- Sticks out.

380
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,185
It's the dress.

381
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,605
It's awful cheap material.
I can tell by the smell.

382
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,940
What do you expect?
Want it inlaid with gold?

383
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:14,110
Well, it seems to me if you're buying
anything, it should be the best.

384
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,820
This is definitely not the best.

385
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,074
Oh, quit. You're breakin' my heart.

386
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,742
Oh, it's impossible.

387
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,036
Look at it. Ruffles.

388
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,081
Oh, I wouldn't be seen dead in this rag.

389
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,832
It's horrible.

390
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,919
How could she have bought me such a thing?

391
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:38,968
<i>It didn't take me long that night
to figure out that I was dead broke.</i>

392
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,055
<i>And with Bert gone it looked
as though I'd stay broke.</i>

393
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,307
<i>I felt all alone.</i>

394
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,684
<i>For the first time in my life I was lonely.</i>

395
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:51,147
<i>There was so much to remind me of Bert
and how things used to be with us,</i>

396
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,192
<i>and what great hopes we had.</i>

397
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,711
- Hi, Mildred.
- Oh, hello, Wally.

398
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,089
- Bert around?
- Not right now, he isn't.

399
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,298
Well, I'll see him Monday.

400
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,152
He left things in a mess at the office.
I thought he could help straighten them out.

401
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,761
Ask him to drop over, will you?

402
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,473
If it's important, you'd better find him
yourself. He isn't living here anymore.

403
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:26,933
Hmm?

404
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,728
- You mean you've busted up?
- Something like that.

405
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,439
For good?

406
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,482
As far as I know.

407
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,318
If you don't know,
I don't know who does know.

408
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,947
- You here all alone?
- No, I have the children.

409
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,450
Ah. Bert must be crazy.

410
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:47,370
You know, I, uh — I never did mind
being around you, Mildred.

411
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,914
You don't by any chance
hear opportunity knocking, do you?

412
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,292
Me? I'm conscientious.

413
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,880
Not too much ice in that drink
you're about to make for me.

414
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,965
- Oh. You moving in?
- Maybe.

415
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,302
Anyhow, I'm not gonna cry my eyes out
about you and Bert splitting up.

416
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,888
I like the idea. Makes me feel good.

417
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,808
Wish it made me feel good too.

418
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,228
- I like Scotch.
- I know what you like.

419
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,856
With soda.

420
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,043
You know, I've always been a little soft
in the head where you're concerned.

421
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,986
- You surprise me.
- No, this is on the level.

422
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,990
Bert's gone? Okay.
I figure maybe there's a chance for me now.

423
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:26,493
You know, I wouldn't drop dead
at the idea of marrying you.

424
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,869
Quit kidding, will you?

425
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,592
No, I figured maybe one of these days
you might have a weak moment.

426
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,791
If I do, I'll send you a telegram, collect.

427
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,086
Uh, easy on the ice for this, will you?

428
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,588
No soda?

429
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,590
Sorry. Bert never had it around.

430
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,342
We'll take care of that.

431
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:45,220
- Say when.
- Not for me. I'm not used to it.

432
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,597
We'll take care of that too.

433
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,599
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

434
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,311
You gotta be educated, Mildred.
You just joined the biggest army in the world.

435
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,606
The great American institution that never
gets mentioned on the Fourth of July —

436
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,234
a grass widow
with two children to support.

437
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:04,113
Why don't you make an effort to grow up?

438
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,997
- Why don't you make an effort to forget Bert?
- Maybe I don't want to.

439
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,576
But you'll be lonesome, Mildred.

440
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,638
You're not the kind of a woman
to get along by herself.

441
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,997
- Well, I can try.
- Oh, come on. Get wise.

442
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,167
Wally, you should be kept on a leash.
Now, why can't you be friendly?

443
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,586
- But I am being friendly.
- No, I mean it.

444
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,382
- Friendship's much more lasting than love.
- Yeah, but it isn't as entertaining.

445
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,135
Cut it out, Wally. You make me feel
just like little Red Riding Hood.

446
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,720
And I'm the big bad wolf, huh?

447
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:31,391
Nah, Mildred, you get me wrong.
I'm a romantic guy, but I'm no wolf.

448
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,142
Then quit howling.

449
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:37,230
I know you romantic guys. One crack about
the beautiful moon and you're off to the races.

450
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,775
- Especially when it looks like a sure thing.
- Here we go again.

451
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,027
Did I do somethin' wrong?

452
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,697
You'd better go, Wally.

453
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,199
- No dice, huh?
- Good night.

454
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,951
Well, no dice, no dice.

455
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,497
You can't shoot a guy for trying.
I just thought maybe that...

456
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,041
Oh, Mildred, I was only kidding.

457
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,211
I wouldn't pull any cheap trick
like that on you. You know that.

458
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,088
- Yes, I know.
- Why, I —

459
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,718
- I said good night, Wally.
- Okay, okay.

460
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,971
- Round one goes to Mildred Pierce.
- There won't be any round two.

461
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:13,558
- We live in hope. I'll keep on trying.
- I know. Once a week.

462
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,143
Twice a week.

463
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,817
Veda! You're awake?

464
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,861
- Yes, Mother.
- Shh.

465
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,738
You'll wake Kay.

466
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,948
No. She's tired out.

467
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,367
- She cried herself to sleep.
- Poor darling.

468
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,870
- Was it about her father?
- Yes.

469
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,456
Is he going to marry Mrs. Biederhof?

470
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,418
- I don't know.
- I do.

471
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,796
I do know that you should be asleep.

472
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,383
- I've been thinking.
- What about?

473
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,802
I heard you and Wally talking.

474
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,971
Well.

475
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,183
- You could marry him if you wanted to.
- But I'm not in love with him.

476
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,227
But if you married him, maybe we
could have a maid like we used to,

477
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,731
and a limousine, and maybe a new house.

478
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,026
I don't like this house, Mother.

479
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,197
Neither do I, but that's no reason for me
to marry a man I'm not in love with.

480
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,366
Why not?

481
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:17,246
Veda, does a new house mean so much
to you that you would trade me for it?

482
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,291
I didn't mean it, Mother.

483
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,670
I don't care what we have,
as long as we're together.

484
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,422
It's just that there's so many things that I —

485
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,467
that we should have, and haven't got.

486
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,177
I know, darling.

487
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,887
I know.

488
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,264
I want you to have nice things.

489
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,016
And you will have.

490
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,351
Wait and see.

491
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,812
I'll get you everything. Anything you want.

492
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,522
I promise.

493
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,732
How?

494
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,943
I don't know.

495
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,195
But I will. I promise.

496
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,365
You darling.

497
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,826
- Come on. Go to sleep.
- All right.

498
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,371
- Happy dreams, sweet.
- Thank you.

499
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,039
I love you, Veda.

500
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,875
I love you, Mother. Really, I do.

501
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,795
But let's not be sticky about it.

502
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,301
Good night.

503
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,394
<i>I had to get a job. Any kind.</i>

504
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:25,440
<i>I had no experience in the business world,
but I had to get a job.</i>

505
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,024
<i>I walked my legs off.</i>

506
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,485
<i>Getting a job wasn't as easy as I thought.</i>

507
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:33,948
<i>Days seemed like weeks, and always,
everywhere I went I heard the same thing.</i>

508
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,242
Sorry. We need people with experience.

509
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,454
<i>I was tired and sick at heart
when I saw the restaurant,</i>

510
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,790
<i>and I decided to go in for a cup of tea.</i>

511
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,963
Good afternoon.

512
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,261
Sit here?

513
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,139
Menu.

514
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:03,853
Clear the dirty dishes off number three.
Pick up your feet, for crying out loud.

515
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,855
Roast chicken is very nice.

516
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,858
No, thank you.
I'll just have tea and toast.

517
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,235
I didn't take your rotten tip.
I got tips of my own.

518
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,905
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, she's been lifting tips.

519
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,990
- Oh, I have not!
- I caught her red-handed.

520
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,635
- I said, go into the kitchen. Get going.
- She took a tip off my table too.

521
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,579
- You keep out of this.
- How about some service?

522
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,061
- I'll have someone take care of you right away.
- I hope so.

523
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,626
You mind your own business!

524
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:31,005
Sorry to leave you like that,
but we're so shorthanded, and now this.

525
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,340
Let's see. You wanted tea?

526
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,091
- No, I want a job.
- What?

527
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:37,970
Well, you seem to need help,
and I want a job.

528
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,848
Did you ever work in a restaurant before?

529
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,518
No.

530
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,771
Follow me.

531
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,711
- Kind of a nervous gal, aren't you?
- I'm just a little over-anxious, I guess.

532
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:55,446
Well, you want to watch that.
It's tough on dishes.

533
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,383
Personally, I don't think
you're the type for the work,

534
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,660
but against my better judgment
I'll give you a trial.

535
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,078
You'll need white shoes.

536
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,331
Ask for nurses' regulation
in any of the stores. 2.95.

537
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,501
We furnish your uniform,
but it comes off your first check. 3.95.

538
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,503
You get it at cost. And keep it laundered.

539
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,506
If you don't suit us,
we charge you 25 cents on the uniform.

540
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,508
That comes off your check too.

541
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,510
Keep your own tips.

542
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,637
Here. Have your tea.

543
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,013
Thank you.

544
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,807
- What's your name?
- Ida.

545
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,226
- What's yours?
- Mildred Pierce.

546
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,938
Chef's salad! Hold the mayonnaise!

547
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,773
Soup. Hold potatoes.

548
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,942
Two chops. One medium, one rare.
Lamb plate.

549
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,838
- Two chicken dinners. One without gravy.
- Two chickens. Hold one gravy.

550
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:37,780
You can't say "without."
You gotta say "hold."

551
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,825
<i>I learned the restaurant business.
I learned it the hard way.</i>

552
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,035
<i>In three weeks I was a good waitress.</i>

553
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,037
- One chicken. Hold veg.
- Chicken! Hold veg!

554
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,306
- Steak, medium.
- Steak, medium!

555
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,625
- Club san. Roast beef. Hold one. Combin salad.
- Combin salad.

556
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,962
<i>In six weeks I felt as though
I'd worked in a restaurant all my life.</i>

557
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:56,090
<i>And in three months I was one of
the best waitresses in the place.</i>

558
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,301
<i>I took tips and was glad to get them.</i>

559
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,887
<i>And at home
I baked pies for the restaurant.</i>

560
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,514
Those'll be done
in another couple of minutes.

561
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:08,019
Let's see, now, we have a dozen peach,
a dozen berry, a dozen pumpkin, a dozen cherry.

562
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,563
And after we finish the apple
we can quit for the night.

563
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:14,066
I don't know how you keep it up,
Mrs. Pierce. Honest, I don't.

564
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,988
Now, I sleep all mornin', but you go down
to that restaurant and work and work.

565
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,325
Just like you been sleepin' all night,
only you ain't.

566
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,826
Keeps me thin.

567
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,120
- Beg pardon?
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,289
Don't do nothin' for me.

569
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:32,543
<i>I was doing all right.
I was doing fine.</i>

570
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:35,546
<i>I was able to afford an expensive
singing teacher for Veda.</i>

571
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,549
<i>And a good dancing school for Kay.</i>

572
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:43,346
<i>Only one thing worried me — that someday
Veda would find out that I was a waitress.</i>

573
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,097
Good afternoon, Mrs. Pierce.

574
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,434
- Everything go all right?
- Oh, I had a busy day today.

575
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,936
That's good.

576
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,148
- Where did you get that uniform?
- Miss Veda gave it to me.

577
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,652
She makes me wear it in case
I have to answer the doorbell.

578
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,612
Miss Veda gave it to you?

579
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:03,366
I told her you wouldn't like it, Mrs. Pierce.
I told her right off.

580
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,161
But she hollered and went on so
that I put it on just to keep her quiet.

589
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,938
- What have you got on your face, darling?
- It's just some lipstick, Mother.

590
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,314
- Lottie!
- Yes, Mrs. Pierce?

591
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:39,068
Will you take Kay upstairs and wash all that goo
off her face and give her a good scrubbing.

592
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,821
But my face don't need scrubbing.
I washed it this morning.

593
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:44,665
- Go on, hurry up. Go on.
- It can stand a little more soap and water.

594
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,084
- Veda.
- Yes, Mother. What is it?

595
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,294
Where did you find the uniform
you gave Lottie?

596
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,378
- I was looking for a handkerchief.
- In my closet?

597
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,715
I looked everywhere else.

598
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,026
Your handkerchiefs are in your own top drawer
where they always are.

599
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,969
What were you doing snooping
around my closet?

600
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,098
Really, Mother, it seems you're making quite
a fuss about something which doesn't matter.

601
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,308
If you bought the uniform for Lottie,

602
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:14,311
and I certainly can't imagine
who else you could have bought it for,

603
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,771
then why shouldn't she wear it?

604
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:20,026
You've been snooping around ever since
I got this job, trying to find out what it is.

605
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,445
And now you know. You know, don't you?

606
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:23,988
Know what?

607
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,032
Know what, Mother?

608
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:29,618
You knew when you gave that uniform
to Lottie that it was mine, didn't you?

609
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,037
- Your uniform?
- Yes.

610
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,039
I'm waiting tables in a downtown restaurant.

611
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,750
My mother, a waitress.

612
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,419
I took the only job I could get
so you and your sister could eat

613
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,480
and have a place to sleep
and some clothes on your backs.

614
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,798
Aren't the pies bad enough?
Did you have to degrade us?

615
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,027
- Veda, don't talk like that.
- I'm really not surprised.

616
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:49,263
You've never spoken of your people,
who you came from, so perhaps it's natural.

617
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,431
Maybe that's why Father —

618
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,610
Oh, I'm sorry I did that.

619
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,112
I'd have rather cut off my hand.

620
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:10,534
I'd never have taken the job
if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together.

621
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,830
And, besides, I wanted to learn
the business the best way possible.

622
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,333
What kind of business?

623
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,502
The restaurant business.

624
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,796
I'm planning on opening a place of my own.

625
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,381
There's money in a restaurant
if it's run right.

626
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,426
You mean... You mean we'll be rich?

627
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,304
Well, some people
have gotten rich that way.

628
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,432
<i>I didn't know what to do next,
but suddenly it hit me.</i>

629
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,226
<i>Why not open a restaurant?</i>

630
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,479
In the seventh, give me five
across the board on Materialize.

631
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,064
Hello, Mildred. Grab a seat.

632
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:43,150
What? Yeah, I know it's a dog,
but I happen to like red horses.

633
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,361
Call me back, will you?

634
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,988
- Well, well, well.
- Hello, Wally. It's good to see you again.

635
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:50,366
Nice to see you.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

636
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,285
I, uh — I haven't seen
enough of you lately.

637
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,662
This is all business, Wally.

638
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:57,724
You know, you keep on refusing me,
I'm gonna start thinking you're stubborn.

639
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,834
- Laugh?
- No.

640
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,794
No laugh, huh? What's all this?

641
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,005
I'm going to open a restaurant.

642
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,299
- You are?
- Yes, Wally, and you're going to help me.

643
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,052
- I am? I mean, am I?
- Oh, please, Wally.

644
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,389
I guess I am, Mildred.
What's the score?

645
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,391
Well, I found the location I want.

646
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,911
It's an old house that hasn't been lived in
for years from the look of it.

647
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,938
It's right on a busy intersection,
which means it's good for drive-in trade.

648
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:25,818
I clocked an average of 500 cars an hour.
Do you realize what that means, Wally?

649
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,879
And there isn't another restaurant
within five miles.

650
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,239
It listens good. What's the address?

651
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,658
35904 Glenoaks Boulevard.

652
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,785
- 35904 Glenoaks Boulevard?
- Mm-hmm.

653
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,913
- Who owns it?
- I don't know, but there's a "for sale" sign on it.

654
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:40,583
- Well, let's see.
- I need your help in getting this place.

655
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,979
You know what the angles are and I don't.
I want that house. Please get it for me, Wally.

656
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:47,673
All right, wait a minute. 35907... 35904.

657
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,675
There we are.

658
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,260
Well, it's listed at 10,000.

659
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,322
That means they'll take eight or less
because they're anxious to move the property.

660
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,891
And it's owned by the Beragon estate.
Beragon.

661
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:59,268
- Do you know them?
- No. Some wealthy Pasadena family.

662
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,270
Got a lot of property around here.

663
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,689
"Beragon Manor. Beragon estate."
There we are.

664
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,525
Well, what do you know.

665
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,361
What is it? Well, tell me!

666
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:12,489
The Beragons have already lost two pieces
of property because of back taxes.

667
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:13,991
Sounds as if they're broke.

668
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,577
Using your gams all day
hasn't hurt 'em a bit.

669
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,746
Hello! Hello. Mr. Beragon, please.

670
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,956
Now watch your Uncle Wally go to work.

671
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:25,461
How do you do, sir?
This is Wallace Fay of Fay Real Estate.

672
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:28,672
I've been looking forward to the pleasure
of calling you for some time.

673
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,756
It's regarding your property
on Glenoaks Boulevard.

674
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,261
I, uh... I believe I've succeeded
in interesting a client of mine

675
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:36,013
in the possibility of a purchase.

676
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,850
- Well, uh, how about, uh...
- This afternoon.

677
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,102
Yeah, how about this afternoon?

678
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:44,271
Good. We'll be right down.

679
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:45,731
Fay is the name.

680
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,109
No, Fay. That's right. Good-bye.

681
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,779
- Well?
- He's sweating blood already. Let's go.

682
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:55,074
And remember, let me do all the talking.

683
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:58,702
- Oh, Wally, you're wonderful.
- Ah-ah! This is all business, remember?

684
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,756
Yep, this is it.

685
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:27,022
Will you wait here, please?

686
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,375
Uh, Mr. Beragon, my name is Wallace Fay.
I've talked to you on the telephone.

687
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,877
This is, uh, Mrs. Pierce,
the client that I talked about.

688
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,761
- How do you do, Mr. Beragon?
- How do you do?

689
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,923
Would you like a drink?

690
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,717
I'm trapped. You've talked me into it.

691
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,510
Mrs. Pierce?

692
00:43:57,011 --> 00:44:00,282
As I see it, Mrs. Pierce wants to buy the house,
but she doesn't want to pay for it.

693
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,767
Well, that's about it, Mr. Beragon.
Mrs. Pierce needs a little time to get started.

694
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:07,455
But once the restaurant is successful, she'll
be in a position to buy the property outright.

695
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,565
I see. Very unusual proposition.

696
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,734
How long do you think
you would need, Mrs. Pierce?

697
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:15,362
- I should say it would take her about a year.
- Do you think you can make 10,000 clear?

698
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:17,114
- Yes. I have it all —
- Look.

699
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,509
If the place is successful at all,
it'll be very successful.

700
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,870
If it isn't, you'll get your property back
in much better condition than it is now.

701
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:25,539
What do you say?
It's a gamble, but you can't lose much.

702
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,000
I like to gamble, Mr. Fay,
but I have to be sure of my odds,

703
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,835
and the odds are against me.

704
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:33,464
- No, I'm afraid I'm not interested.
- Oh, please, Mr. Beragon, listen to me.

705
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:35,341
This is a gamble for me too.

706
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:38,802
I'm putting every cent I have into this place,
and, believe me, I haven't much.

707
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:40,929
I can't afford to lose anymore than you.

708
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:45,017
I've got all the information. I know exactly what
it will cost and how much I can expect to make.

709
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,519
I know I can do it. I know I can.

710
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,856
Very well. It's a deal.

711
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,899
That's great. I'll draw up the papers tonight.
One more thing, Mr. Beragon.

712
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,945
We'll need a pre-dated transfer of ownership,
if that's all right with you.

713
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,673
- You want the transfer immediately?
- Yeah.

714
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,634
We'll give you a note to cover the purchase,
you give us the deed. It's very simple.

715
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,702
You take care of the details.

716
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:07,081
Well, Mrs. Pierce, how does it feel
to be the owner of a white elephant?

717
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:09,083
Oh, it feels wonderful!

718
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,836
Hey, how about Uncle Wally here?

719
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,590
- Nice guy, you know.
- Very. Good-looking too.

720
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,009
- Maybe. But no brains.
- What do you mean?

721
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:22,405
Didn't you hear me conning him out of the deed
to the property without puttin' down a cent?

722
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:25,182
- Sure, but...
- You leave the angles to your Uncle Wally.

723
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,476
There's one other thing
that's gotta be taken care of.

724
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,521
What's that? Oh, sorry.
I don't feel romantic this afternoon, Wally.

725
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,524
No, nothin' like that.
It's kinda serious though.

726
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,566
- It's about Bert.
- What's on your mind?

727
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,986
You're not gonna like this, Mildred,
but you're gonna have to get a divorce.

728
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,299
- That is, if you want to open that restaurant.
- Well, what's that got to do with it?

729
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:44,243
Well, in California they got a thing
called a community property law.

730
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:47,079
- Half of what Bert owns belongs to you.
- What's half of nothing?

731
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,873
Well, it works two ways.
Half of what you own belongs to Bert.

732
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,500
You open that restaurant and voom,

733
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,521
all of Bert's creditors'll be hangin' around
with their hands out sayin' "gimme."

734
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:56,463
- Is a divorce the only answer?
- Uh-huh. Why?

735
00:45:56,547 --> 00:45:59,776
- It takes a year to get a divorce in California.
- You're not getting cold feet, are you?

736
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,321
- No, but if it takes a year, why bother to get it?
- It takes a year for it to become final.

737
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:06,890
Once it's entered, the creditors can't touch you.
Your worries are over.

738
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,892
Well, I'll be seeing Bert next week.

739
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:11,579
He's coming down to take the children
to Arrowhead for the weekend.

740
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,165
- Maybe I'll talk to him then. I'll think about it.
- There's nothing to think about.

741
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,650
- No divorce, no restaurant.
- I'll think about it, Wally.

742
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,903
Well, I'd have to know
a little more about it.

743
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:21,905
Divorce is a pretty serious step.

744
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:23,407
- Hello, Dad!
- Hello, dear.

745
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,825
We'll be down in a minute.

746
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:27,661
Mom, Veda wants to know
where her new bathing suit is.

747
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,330
- It's in the top drawer of her dresser.
- Okay!

748
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:34,251
She says it's in
the upper drawer of the dresser.

749
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:38,714
Here.

750
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:43,510
I wonder if there are many boys
up at Arrowhead.

751
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:46,638
If there are, they're sure to find you.
Don't worry.

752
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:48,849
Don't you think I hate this
as much as you do?

753
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:52,227
But it's got to be for the children's sake.
I have to think of their future.

754
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:54,229
- Of Veda, you mean.
- All right, of Veda.

755
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:57,983
- Well, what about Kay?
- Oh, Kay doesn't need so much thinking about.

756
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:00,569
Kay's twice the girl that Veda is
and always will be.

757
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,321
She thinks you're wonderful.

758
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:04,531
Maybe that's why I keep
trying to please Veda.

759
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:07,376
- You'll always get kicked around, Mildred.
- Well, you ought to know.

760
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:10,078
I've made up my mind. I want a divorce.

761
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:12,849
I want to know more about this deal
of Wally Fay's, a whole lot more.

762
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,310
- What have you got to do with that?
- You're my wife, aren't you?

763
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:19,046
Yes, but you certainly seem to forget about it,
especially when it comes to Maggie Biederhof.

764
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:21,632
Well, what about you and Wally Fay?

765
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:23,967
Oh, you should know better than that.

766
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,385
Bert, listen.

767
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:28,055
I've put everything I've got
into this new restaurant.

768
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,390
I've worked with painters,
carpenters and electricians,

769
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:33,352
and suddenly everything is
beginning to take shape.

770
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:36,271
I've worked hard and long,
and I'm going to get that divorce.

771
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:39,191
Yeah, yeah, you want me to poke you
in the nose in front of witnesses

772
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:42,110
so that you can get up in court
and claim I was guilty of cruelty.

773
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,654
No, Mildred. No divorce.

774
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:48,075
I'm going to file papers
and there's very little you can do about it.

775
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,536
- I don't need your permission.
- No?

776
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:54,414
Well, file away. I'll fight you all the way
down the line, you and Wally Fay.

777
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,083
And what's more, I'm —

778
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,086
- Make sure.
- Oh, you don't have to worry about me.

779
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:01,089
- Well, that was quick.
- Daddy, we're all ready.

780
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:04,007
- My, how nice you look. Hello, Veda.
- Hello, Father.

781
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,277
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Good-bye, darling.

782
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,886
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Let's get started.

783
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,514
Have fun. Be careful swimming.
That water's awfully cold.

784
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,640
- Oh!
- Bye!

785
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,892
- Bye!
- Bye!

786
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:17,145
Dad, on the way,
can we stop and have a hamburger?

787
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,356
I guess so. We'll have to hurry though.

788
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:41,962
It's moments like this that make me happy
that nylons are out for the duration.

789
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:44,423
Well, if it isn't our silent partner.

790
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:48,302
I decided I'd been silent long enough.
I came by to check up on my investment.

791
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:50,387
- Well, how do you like it?
- Delightful.

792
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,557
Are you sure you're here to
check on your investment?

793
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,808
Oh, absolutely.

794
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,102
Well, then you'd better have
a look at your investment.

795
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,520
Over there's the counter.

796
00:48:58,604 --> 00:49:01,165
Here we're going to put one table
and over here we're going to put four tables.

797
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,793
You must see the booths.
We have ten booths, four people to a booth.

798
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,737
- That makes 40 people. We can expect to feed —
- That's very ingenious.

799
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,323
Look, today's a holiday.
Why don't you get out of here?

800
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:11,533
I'd love to, but I'm awfully busy.

801
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,994
- Isn't the bar beautiful?
- A bar. That's a novelty.

802
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:16,455
I've got one at the beach house.
Come down and see my ocean.

803
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,601
I've seen one, and if you've seen one ocean,
you've seen them all, I always say.

804
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:23,295
Why should people come to my place
to eat and go someplace else to drink?

805
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:25,356
- That's why I put the bar in.
- That's very logical.

806
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,007
But to get back to my ocean,

807
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,777
why don't you and I go down and have a swim
and forget all about our investment?

808
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:32,721
Oh, I'd love to, but uh-uh.
Got to much work to do.

809
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,139
Oh, come on.

810
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,766
Better look out. I might say yes.

811
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:38,310
You know what might be
a highly original thing for you to do?

812
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,937
- No. What?
- Just say yes, right away like that.

813
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,774
Uh, no. No, I shouldn't.

814
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:47,611
As you grow older you'll find that the only
things you regret are the things you didn't do.

815
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:48,987
I hope you're right.

816
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:53,241
Why don't I pick you up at the corner
of Colorado and Brand in say, uh, 30 minutes.

817
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,951
No, I really can't.

818
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,914
How about it?

819
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,916
All right. You win.

820
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,339
There you are. Just help yourself.

821
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:10,926
If you don't find what you want,
just let me know. We aim to please.

822
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:13,804
Are you hoarding bathing suits?

823
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,474
- They belong to my sisters.
- There's nothing like having a large family.

824
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:21,645
- Yell if you need help with the zipper.
- Thank you, but I won't need any help.

825
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,230
How do you like your drink?

826
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:24,940
Oh, harmless.

827
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,951
- I like your ocean.
- I borrowed it from the navy especially for you.

828
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,619
You have a wonderful view.

829
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,622
Well, I wouldn't say that.

830
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:43,667
- I hope the suit fits better than the robe.
- It does.

831
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,754
- Do you live here all the year round?
- No. We have the family mansion in Pasadena.

832
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:50,882
Complete with iron deer, a ghost
and a greenhouse with no flowers.

833
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:52,259
I come here in the spring.

834
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:54,761
- Oh, it must be lovely here.
- Yes, but lonely.

835
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:57,281
You know, Mildred, in the spring
a young man's fancy lightly turns

836
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:59,516
to what he's been
thinking about all winter.

837
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,060
It's a good thing
California winters are so short.

838
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:07,065
No whistle?

839
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:09,109
I'd need a police siren.

840
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:12,195
- Oh, here we go.
- Go? Go where?

841
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:16,032
- Swimming. Isn't that why we're here?
- Suppose it is.

842
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,743
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Come on!

843
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:18,910
Hold it!

844
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,679
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

845
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:40,682
- You drink too much.
- I know. I do too much of everything.

846
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,976
- I'm spoiled.
- Too many sisters.

847
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,229
- They all seem to be my size too.
- Yes. I like them your size.

848
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,191
- To brotherly love.
- Thank you, Mr. Beragon.

849
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,485
Monte Beragon.

850
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,528
That's a very unusual name. Spanish?

851
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,989
Mostly. Maybe a little Italian thrown in.

852
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,492
But my mother
is a real, dyed-in-the-wool Yankee.

853
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:01,620
That's why I'm such a self-controlled
and dignified young fellow.

854
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:04,706
And just what do you do, Mr. Beragon?

855
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,709
I loaf. Oh, in a decorative
and highly charming manner.

856
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,212
Is that all?

857
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,506
With me, loafing is a science.

858
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:17,093
You're very beautiful like that.

859
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,721
I'll bet you say that to all your sisters.

860
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:22,182
- Shall I tell your fortune?
- Can you?

861
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:25,519
Oh, we Beragons come from
a long line of teacup readers.

862
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:29,397
I'm not very impressionable, Mildred.

863
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,775
I lost my awe of women at an early age.

864
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,277
But ever since that first day
you came here,

865
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,697
I thought of nothing but what
I'd say to you when we met again.

866
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:39,324
And now I can't say anything.

867
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:43,161
You take my breath away.

868
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:44,746
Do I?

869
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,998
I like you, Monte.

870
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:48,458
You make me feel...

871
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,337
Oh, I don't know. Warm.

872
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,131
And wanted? Beautiful?

873
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,424
Yes.

874
00:52:56,508 --> 00:53:00,929
When I'm close to you like this, there's
a sound in the air like the beating of wings.

875
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,765
- You know what it is?
- No. What?

876
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,977
My heart, beating like a schoolboy's.

877
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,313
Is it?

878
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:12,399
I thought it was mine.

879
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:17,904
The record.

880
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,157
Monte, the record.

881
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,461
Is he there yet? That's good.

882
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:35,964
Yeah, I think I have everything we need.

883
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,967
Yeah, yeah. I called everywhere.
I'll wait another five minutes.

884
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,595
Wait a minute. I think she's coming now.

885
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,561
- Is that a promise?
- I don't know.

886
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,730
- Thursday? Friday?
- Make it Wednesday.

887
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,692
- Good. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

888
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,825
- Where have you been?
- Bert, what are you doing here?

889
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,370
I've been looking all over for you. Nobody
knew where you were. I've been nearly nuts.

890
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:10,248
- What is it?
- It's Kay. She's sick.

891
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:13,335
We came down from Arrowhead
80 miles an hour, but...

892
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,503
Well, it... it's pneumonia.

893
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:17,047
Oh, no.

894
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:19,883
She isn't here.

895
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,970
She isn't here?

896
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:26,890
- Where is she?
- Mrs. Biederhof's.

897
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:33,146
I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I sent for Dr. Gale.

898
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,190
It's all right, Bert. Just hurry.

899
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,548
Mommy.

900
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:03,718
Yes, darling, Mommy's here.

901
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,476
More oxygen.

902
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:28,743
I hope it was all right to bring her here
instead of the hospital, Doctor.

903
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:32,163
- But I thought it would save time.
- You did the right thing.

904
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,083
Yes, thank you.

905
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,293
Thank you very much, Mrs. Biederhof.

906
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,180
- Nurse.
- Yes, Doctor?

907
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:50,724
One more cc.

908
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,313
Hurry up, Nurse.

909
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:11,870
I'm sorry, I — I couldn't save her.

910
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:48,239
I'm — I'm sorry, Mildred.

911
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,533
We did everything in our power.

912
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:55,038
I — I brought her into the world.

913
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,417
It seems hard that I was the one to...

914
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,212
I'll fix you a nice, hot cup of tea.

915
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,101
I'll never forget it.

916
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,978
Never, as long as I live.

917
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,565
She said, "Mommy."

918
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,069
And that was all.

919
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,448
Oh, I loved her so much.

920
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:32,325
Oh, Mother.

921
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:37,956
Please, God,
don't ever let anything happen to Veda.

922
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,128
<i>After that, there was only
one thing on my mind:</i>

923
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:45,380
<i>to open the restaurant
and make it successful.</i>

924
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:52,428
Short stack. Easy on the butter.

925
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:54,639
Adam and Eve on a raft. Hit me hard.

926
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,183
- We enjoyed it.
- It was delicious. Everything delicious.

927
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,912
- We come again tomorrow night, Mama.
- See you tomorrow. Good night.

928
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:02,939
Four, two. Half-and-half. Punch 20.

929
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,543
Too bad you had to stand so long.
There'll be something in a minute.

930
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,878
I'm so sorry I've kept you waiting.
Right this way, please.

931
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:11,364
- I didn't think chicken was that good.
- I'm so glad you liked it. Great.

932
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,247
We've been jammed
ever since the doors opened.

933
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:16,327
Here you are, right here. I'll take these,
Arline. You take the orders.

934
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:17,888
- We have wonderful fried chicken.
- Thank you.

935
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:20,331
- I think I'll have chicken.
- I hope you like it.

936
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:26,004
Pick up something. Never make a trip
in or out with an empty tray like that.

937
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,464
Oh, Ida, it looks like we're in.

938
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:30,884
That's what it says here.
Isn't that a lovely noise?

939
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,903
Oh, I don't know
what I would have done without you.

940
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,971
Probably had a nervous breakdown.

941
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,158
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Sawyer. How are you?
- Hello, Mildred.

942
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:38,534
- Hello, Mr. Sawyer.
- Good evening, Mildred.

943
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,537
I'm so glad you could come. Suzanne,
a booth for Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer, please.

944
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:42,830
- I'll see you later.
- Thank you.

945
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:45,190
- Congratulations, Mother. It's wonderful.
- Thank you.

946
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:47,293
- How'd you like to sell your share?
- No, thank you.

947
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:50,028
- I know a good thing when I see it.
- So do I, and I can see it.

948
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:52,840
This is some mob. Those postcards
you sent out certainly did the trick.

949
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,657
- Yeah.
- Say, kid, keep my seat warm.

950
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:57,327
And get me another drink.
I want to talk to your mother a minute.

951
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,205
- What do you want to talk to me about?
- Well, uh, it's about Bert.

952
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,207
- He's coming over here tonight.
- He is?

953
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,335
Yeah. He said he wanted to see you.
I think it's about the divorce.

954
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,962
- What about it?
- He just said he wanted to see you.

955
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:11,299
- Help me, Wally, will you? Thank you so much.
- All right, sure, sure, sure.

956
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:13,760
Excuse me. I'm awfully sorry.

957
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:16,262
- You big pheasant!
- Why don't you look where you're going?

958
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,473
Excuse me for living, mister.
I'm a little excited.

959
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:22,310
- What is this?
- We're swamped. You've got to help us.

960
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,519
Who, me? I'm an executive.

961
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,456
You're now vice president
in charge of the potatoes.

962
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,649
- Will you put them in the hot fat?
- All right.

963
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,859
- Thanks, go on.
- You look very pretty, Mr. Fay.

964
00:59:29,943 --> 00:59:31,945
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

965
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,280
- Lamb plate.
- Lamb.

966
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:37,242
- Number nine, over in two.
- "J" and "B" on the side.

967
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:38,493
Scramble two with.

968
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:41,162
Hey, what do you know?
Beragon just came in.

969
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,790
Did he? That's funny.
He didn't say he was coming.

970
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,893
What do you mean, he didn't say?
You been seeing him?

971
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:49,796
- Uh, Wally, don't let the potatoes burn.
- All right, I'm just asking a question.

972
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:53,132
Dorothy, don't ever go in like that.
Put some more potatoes on.

973
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,801
You'll never make any money that way.

974
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:57,363
It's all right. As long as
the customers are satisfied. Hurry up now.

975
00:59:57,387 --> 01:00:00,473
This is just like my wedding night.
So exciting.

976
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:05,621
Will you please see
that Mrs. Pierce gets these flowers?

977
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,563
Can I tell her your name,
or is it a secret?

978
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,875
Just tell her they came
from an old gypsy fortune-teller.

979
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:13,653
Oh. Well, sit down and read a teacup
and I'll see if she's busy.

980
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,284
Hey, Mildred. Real, live orchids.

981
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,451
- For me?
- Uh-huh.

982
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:23,121
Orchids? Say, what is this?
Who are they from?

983
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,249
From an old gypsy fortune-teller
with beautiful brown eyes.

984
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:27,749
Beg pardon?

985
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,632
Put them in the icebox for me,
will you, Wally?

986
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:32,046
- Here, muscles.
- Salisbury rare.

987
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:38,553
Two blue plates, one with,
one without. Hold the potatoes.

988
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:39,679
Two plates.

989
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:45,476
Could you put it on this table, please?

990
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:49,022
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this table was taken.

991
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:51,774
Oh, it's quite all right.
We're so crowded tonight.

992
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:54,485
- Do sit down, Mr. Beragon, please.
- Oh, thank you.

993
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:56,487
- May I have a dry martini, please?
- Yes, sir.

994
01:00:56,863 --> 01:01:00,158
- So you know me?
- Oh, everyone knows <i>the</i> Monte Beragon.

995
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:03,077
You play polo, go yachting,
are an excellent hunter

996
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:06,331
and are seen with the most
attractive debutantes in California.

997
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:08,708
- I read the society section.
- So I gather.

998
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,336
- Maybe I should introduce myself.
- Oh, no. Don't tell me.

999
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:13,713
- Your hand, please.
- Can you tell from my hand?

1000
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:17,800
I wouldn't want this to get around, but
I come from a long line of fortune-tellers.

1001
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:20,219
- Oh?
- Oh, yes. Hmm.

1002
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:21,346
What does it say?

1003
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:23,890
It says that you are very much indeed
like your mother.

1004
01:01:23,973 --> 01:01:26,351
- Yes?
- And it says that her name is, uh, Bierce.

1005
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,519
Uh, no. Uh, F... Pierce!

1006
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:31,856
- How wonderful!
- And it says that your name is Veda.

1007
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:36,277
- Where does it say "Veda"?
- Oh, that line right there. Unmistakable.

1008
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:40,782
- Well, if it isn't gypsy Beragon.
- The very same.

1009
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:43,177
What do you say? Looks like
a pretty good investment after all, huh?

1010
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:45,346
Anything you did to this white elephant
would be an improvement.

1011
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,706
Smile when you say that, stranger.
A third of this joint belongs to me.

1012
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,167
- Congratulations.
- I've got another business proposition.

1013
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,920
- You know that orange grove you got —
- Save it until later.

1014
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:56,422
- Well, here's to success.
- Yeah.

1015
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:57,506
Thanks.

1016
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:58,674
Four, two. Half-and-Half.

1017
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,718
Two specials. One Grade A. One black.

1018
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:02,428
Hot stuff, comin' through.

1019
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,564
That's a wonderful piece.

1020
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:15,733
Beragon, all you need now
is a pair of bobby socks.

1021
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:18,778
Maybe Veda'll lend me a pair.

1022
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,573
Oh!

1023
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:27,954
Well, the last customer
just folded his tent.

1024
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:30,248
That's good.
We've only got one chicken left.

1025
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,582
Put my initials on that.

1026
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:35,211
Oh, I'm so tired, I don't know whether
I'm walking on my feet or my ankles.

1027
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:38,840
- You must be dead.
- Well, if I am, just bury me with this.

1028
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:42,218
- ♪ Please think of me ♪
- I wish I felt the way they do.

1029
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:45,054
♪ No other one ♪

1030
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:47,698
- ♪ Can make me happy ♪
- You've got a nice voice, you know that?

1031
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,104
Hi, Mildred.
Congratulations. You're a success.

1032
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,873
Your daughter and I
have been getting acquainted.

1033
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,024
Mr. Beragon has promised
to take me to the races.

1034
01:02:57,108 --> 01:02:59,068
- Only if your mother comes along.
- I'd love to.

1035
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:01,279
- Wally, do me a favor.
- Anything.

1036
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:02,989
- Take Veda home.
- What?

1037
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,615
Anyone would think I was a child.

1038
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,427
You are.
And besides, it's past your bedtime.

1039
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:10,663
Well, it's not way past my bedtime.
Besides, I want to take you home.

1040
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:13,791
Wally, look. I've got to close up.
I'll go home with Ida. Please, come on.

1041
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,085
Okay, okay. Sure is a big night for me.

1042
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:19,172
I come out looking for an evening
of fun and laughter, what do I get?

1043
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:22,008
Dishpan hands
and a date with a Girl Scout.

1044
01:03:22,091 --> 01:03:24,236
- Good night, darling. Happy dreams.
- Good night, Mother.

1045
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,180
Good night, Mr. Beragon.
Thank you for everything.

1046
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:30,433
- I trust that we may meet again very soon.
- Oh, I hope so.

1047
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,276
Thank you for a divine evening, Mrs. Pierce.

1048
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,313
I trust that I might see you again
in the not-too-distant future.

1049
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,565
- Good night. Come on, small fry.
- Oh, I'm coming.

1050
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,984
Come on. Never mind. Hurry up.

1051
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:41,944
For heaven's sake.

1052
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:48,493
- Leave something on me. I might catch cold.
- I was just thinking.

1053
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:51,120
Not about you. Come on.

1054
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:53,664
That's a very cute youngster of yours.

1055
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:56,000
- Yes, isn't she?
- I thought you had two.

1056
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,338
- Kay died.
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.

1057
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:02,981
- You should have let me know.
- Please, let's not talk about it.

1058
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:05,152
You've had your tough breaks,
but you're on your way now.

1059
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,970
- You're going to make a go of this place.
- I hope so.

1060
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:11,557
- Don't you ever do anything but work?
- Somebody's got to.

1061
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:15,186
I know, but not all the time.
There's a time for work and a time for —

1062
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:18,189
Nine and eight are 17.
Seventeen...

1063
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,399
Oh, Monte, don't. Not here.

1064
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:24,070
Why not? I've been waiting all evening.
A lifetime.

1065
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:42,004
- I —
- I didn't mean to bust in like this.

1066
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:43,589
That's all right.

1067
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:47,635
This is, uh, my husband.
Mr. Beragon, Monte Beragon.

1068
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,720
I've heard a lot of things about you,
Mr. Beragon.

1069
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:50,930
Nice things, I hope.

1070
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,224
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to Mildred.

1071
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:55,685
Yes, of course. What is it, Bert?

1072
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:58,229
This'll only take a minute. It's-It's —

1073
01:04:59,188 --> 01:05:01,816
It's funny.
This is harder to say than I thought.

1074
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:05,778
It's about the divorce, Mildred.
You can have it.

1075
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:09,407
When I walked out on you, I told you
to see if you could get along without me.

1076
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,117
I didn't think you could.

1077
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,705
When you asked me for a divorce, I still
didn't think you could make a go of it alone.

1078
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:20,376
But now I know better. You're doing
all right, Mildred. You're doing fine.

1079
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:25,047
- I never thought it would end like this.
- Who knows how anything is going to end?

1080
01:05:25,131 --> 01:05:28,175
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, I'm sorry too.

1081
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:32,847
Well, that's that. That's what I came
to say, and now that I've said it,

1082
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:36,601
I just want you to know
that I wish you all the luck in the world.

1083
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,978
Thank you, Bert. Thank you.

1084
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:41,314
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1085
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:43,149
This calls for a drink.

1086
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:47,153
In the Beragon family,
there is an old Spanish proverb.

1087
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:49,947
"One man's poison is another man's meat."

1088
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:52,158
Bert!

1089
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:09,467
I was in love with him, and I knew it
for the first time that night.

1090
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,762
But now he's dead, and I'm not sorry.
He wasn't worth it.

1091
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:17,433
That may be. Whoever killed him
evidently agreed with you.

1092
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,477
But you still haven't given us
one good reason

1093
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,729
why your first husband
wasn't the murderer.

1094
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,649
In fact, you've given us
a very good reason why he was.

1095
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:28,861
Now look at it our way.
One, Beragon was killed with Pierce's gun.

1096
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:32,907
Two, Pierce cannot account for
his movements at the time of the murder.

1097
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,034
Three, he had a motive.

1098
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:38,162
You've just given it to us, Mrs. Beragon.
Jealousy.

1099
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:42,208
This report just came in.
Thought you'd want to see it.

1100
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,293
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

1101
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,674
- Is he sure?
- You know Charley.

1102
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:51,759
He don't like to make mistakes.

1103
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:53,886
Just a minute.

1104
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:58,974
Mrs. Beragon, we have some information
here which puzzles us a little.

1105
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,727
For instance, your business manager.

1106
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:06,148
- Right away.
- Okay.

1107
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:08,192
Ida Corwin.

1108
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:12,113
She tells us that you called her
at approximately 11:45 in the evening

1109
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,073
and asked where Mr. Beragon was.

1110
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,992
You seemed quite upset at the time,
according to her statement.

1111
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,786
Well, it was just a business matter.

1112
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,514
Then there was nothing wrong
when you called?

1113
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,498
- No.
- Um...

1114
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,251
Mrs. Beragon,
occasionally we run across a witness

1115
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:28,879
who refuses to tell us what we want
to know except under pressure.

1116
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:33,676
Like Wally Fay, for example.
Why did you take him to the beach house?

1117
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,929
- Did you know Beragon was lying there dead?
- No, I didn't.

1118
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:41,058
Then you were at the beach house this evening.
Why didn't you tell us that before?

1119
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:43,477
- Well, I —
- And why did you run away from the house?

1120
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:46,063
Wasn't it because
you knew Beragon was there, dead?

1121
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:47,732
- No, I —
- And if you did know,

1122
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:51,360
why were you trying
to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?

1123
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:55,030
I think you'd better tell us the truth now.

1124
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,619
I did it. I killed him.

1125
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,413
But why?

1126
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,459
Your restaurant was a success.
You were in love with Beragon.

1127
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,003
What happened to all that?

1128
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:13,507
The restaurant was a greater success
than I knew that night.

1129
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:15,384
Profits were enormous.

1130
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:19,096
In a few months I opened up another place,
and then I started a chain.

1131
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,724
<i>In three years,
I'd built up five restaurants.</i>

1132
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:25,394
<i>Everywhere you went, I had a restaurant.
They made money.</i>

1133
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:28,230
<i>Everything I touched turned into money,
and I needed it.</i>

1134
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:30,649
<i>I needed it for Veda.</i>

1135
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:38,199
<i>She was becoming a young lady
with expensive tastes.</i>

1136
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:40,701
<i>Veda was growing up.</i>

1137
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:03,307
That Ted Forrester is nice looking,
isn't he? Veda likes him.

1138
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,726
Who wouldn't? He has a million dollars.

1139
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,269
What's the matter, Monte?

1140
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,772
Nothing.
I've just run out of jokes, I guess.

1141
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:13,442
- What is it? Tell me.
- I've had a little bad luck lately.

1142
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:16,111
I won't be able to afford
many more evenings like this.

1143
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,699
- Do you need money?
- No, no. It isn't anything like that.

1144
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:22,493
I think you do.

1145
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:25,371
Mildred, please don't do that.

1146
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:28,624
You've been awfully good to us, Monte.
Take it, please.

1147
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,127
All right, if you say so.
But I'll pay it back.

1148
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:35,089
I want it distinctly understood
that it's only a loan.

1149
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:38,133
Anything you say,
just as long as we're friends.

1150
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,473
<i>That's how it began.</i>

1151
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:47,643
<i>At first it bothered Monte
to take money from me.</i>

1152
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:49,728
<i>Then it became a habit with him.</i>

1153
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:54,567
There's a total here
of $1,480.29 in six months.

1154
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:56,610
- What's the big idea?
- We owe him a great deal.

1155
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:59,488
The restaurant was paid for a year ago.
You don't owe him a cent.

1156
01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:02,532
I promised to manage this business for you,
and I've done all right so far.

1157
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:05,661
But keeping Monte Beragon in monogrammed
shirts is not my idea of business.

1158
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:06,787
- No?
- No.

1159
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,808
I made this business for you with my own
hands. I chiseled Monte out of the deed.

1160
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:12,310
I got the banks to give you credit.
Believe me, that wasn't easy.

1161
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:14,646
I've conned everybody
till they're blue in the face and for what?

1162
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,982
- So you could have a lapdog named Beragon?
- Take it easy.

1163
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:18,859
When you walked out on Bert,
it was okay with me.

1164
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,593
I was glad to see you gettin' some sense.

1165
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:23,238
But now you're fallin' for a worse foul ball
than Bert ever thought of being.

1166
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:25,139
- That's none of your business.
- I say it is.

1167
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:27,367
I'm not the type
that likes to be left out in the cold.

1168
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,870
I helped you so I could be around
when you changed your mind about me.

1169
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:31,374
- Maybe I was wrong.
- Maybe you were.

1170
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:34,523
You're makin' a mistake. This Beragon is
no good. He'll bleed you dry.

1171
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:36,817
Suppose I'm in love with him.

1172
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:42,156
Uh-huh.

1173
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:43,991
Okay.

1174
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:48,037
- I guess now I know where I stand.
- That's right. Now you know.

1175
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,670
- I hate all women.
- My, my.

1176
01:10:56,754 --> 01:10:58,505
Thank goodness you're not one.

1177
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:03,427
Laughing Boy seems slightly burned
at the edges. What's eating him?

1178
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,137
A small, green-eyed monster.

1179
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:07,806
Jealous? Doesn't sound like Wally.
No profit in it.

1180
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:10,059
And there's a boy that loves a dollar.

1181
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:12,269
I just told him
I was in love with Monte Beragon.

1182
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:13,562
Are you?

1183
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:17,650
I thought I was once, but not now.

1184
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,902
- Good.
- What's that?

1185
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:24,156
- Little $1,800 birthday present for Miss Veda.
- Oh, the car! It's here. Where is it?

1186
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,117
It's that shiny thing
a block and a half long.

1187
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:32,891
- Do you think she'll like it?
- If she doesn't,

1188
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:34,917
she ought to have
her head examined for holes.

1189
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,252
Here, you have to sign this, in blood.

1190
01:11:39,088 --> 01:11:42,466
- I know it isn't any of my business —
- If it's about Monte, I agree with you.

1191
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:45,678
- It's Veda. She's been borrowing money.
- From whom?

1192
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:48,055
Anybody who'd give her any.
Waitresses mostly.

1193
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,099
Hasn't she paid them back?

1194
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:53,268
They're afraid to say anything
or turn her down. You know how it is.

1195
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,398
Tell them to come to me.
I'll see that they're paid back.

1196
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,316
I'm sorry I had to tell you, Mildred.

1197
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,986
I don't blame her so much.
A couple of times Monte was with her.

1198
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:05,447
Did you, uh, bring the Laguna Beach
and Los Feliz statements with you?

1199
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:07,032
Yeah, they're over here.

1200
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,786
- Hello, everybody. Ida.
- Hello.

1201
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:13,122
- Hello, Mother, darling.
- Hello, Veda. Hello, Monte.

1202
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:15,791
Hello. I hope we aren't interrupting
a big business conference.

1203
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:16,959
Just a teeny one.

1204
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:19,253
Oh, I wish I could get
that interested in work.

1205
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,256
You were probably frightened by a callus
at an early age.

1206
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:24,425
- Here, I'll take that.
- Thank you.

1207
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,926
There's one missing.

1208
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:29,138
You're sitting
on the Laguna Beach statement.

1209
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:33,058
That's what I like about you, Ida.
You're so delightfully provincial.

1210
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:34,768
I like you too.

1211
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:37,521
Don't look now, junior,
but you're standing under a brick wall.

1212
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:40,774
- I don't get it.
- You will, when it falls on you.

1213
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:46,947
When did you start smoking?

1214
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:48,657
Oh, just the other day.

1215
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:53,704
Monte gave me this for my birthday,
and I couldn't hurt him by not using it.

1216
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:57,166
I mean, that would have been
dreadfully <i>recherché, n'est-ce pas</i>?

1217
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,836
Yes, I suppose so.

1218
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:05,007
Here's something for your birthday too.
I hope you like it, darling.

1219
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,800
- Mother! A car?
- Mm-hmm.

1220
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:08,802
- Where is it?
- Look out the window.

1221
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:17,144
- Oh, Mother, it's beautiful!
- Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

1222
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,438
How about me, young lady?
After all, I picked it out.

1223
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:22,524
Monte, it's the nicest present I ever got.

1224
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:26,070
You're sweet, really you are.
Let's go for a drive.

1225
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:28,882
- Nothing I'd like better.
- Monte, do you mind? I'd like to talk to you.

1226
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,366
Why, not at all.
Run along and dent your fenders.

1227
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,285
- All right.
- See you later at the club.

1228
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,703
- Mm-hmm.
- Be careful, darling.

1229
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:36,997
- I will. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

1230
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:48,841
Bye!

1231
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:08,153
- What's the matter?
- I want you to do me a favor.

1232
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,739
- Sure. What?
- Stay away from Veda.

1233
01:14:10,823 --> 01:14:13,463
Why? What's the matter with me?
Have I suddenly sprouted two heads?

1234
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:15,494
I just don't want you
to take her out so much.

1235
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:16,703
- Oh.
- And it isn't funny.

1236
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:19,498
She's only 17 years old
and spoiled rotten.

1237
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:22,584
- What has that got to do with me?
- Look, Monte, I've worked long and hard

1238
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:24,878
trying to give Veda
the things I never had.

1239
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:27,398
I've done without a lot of things,
including happiness sometimes,

1240
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,299
because I wanted her to have everything.

1241
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:33,345
Now I'm losing her.
She's drifting away from me.

1242
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,282
She hardly speaks to me anymore
except to ask for money

1243
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:39,059
or poke fun at me in French
because I work for a living.

1244
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:42,187
- All kids are thoughtless at her age.
- Perhaps, but I still don't like it.

1245
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:44,591
I blame it on the way she's been living.
I blame it on you.

1246
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,192
I don't think
you understand Veda very well.

1247
01:14:47,276 --> 01:14:50,654
She's not like you.
You'll never make a waitress out of her.

1248
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:55,701
You look down on me because I work
for a living, don't you? You always have.

1249
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:59,538
All right, I work. I cook food and sell it
and make a profit on it.

1250
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:02,416
Which, I might point out,
you're not too proud to share with me.

1251
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:04,501
Yes, I take money from you, Mildred.

1252
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:08,964
But not enough to make me like kitchens
or cooks. They smell of grease.

1253
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,759
I don't notice you shrinking away from a $50
bill because it happens to smell of grease.

1254
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:15,387
- Take it easy.
- There's no point in going on like this.

1255
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,389
You're interfering with my life
and my business,

1256
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:20,832
and worst of all, you're interfering with
my plans for Veda and I won't stand for it.

1257
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:25,564
I always knew that someday we'd come to
this particular moment in the scheme of things.

1258
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:30,485
You want Veda and your business and a nice,
quiet life, and the price of all that is me.

1259
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:34,364
You can go back to making your pies now,
Mildred. We're through.

1260
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:38,035
Wait a minute, Monte. I forgot something.

1261
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:47,419
You've been very good to us.

1262
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,713
I know you've had expenses
taking Veda out.

1263
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,757
I don't know how much we owe you, but...

1264
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,427
if that isn't enough you can let me know.

1265
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:00,515
Thank you. I've always wondered
how it felt to take a tip.

1266
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:02,142
Well, now you know.

1267
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,479
You can mark our account "paid in full."

1268
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,369
I'd like some of that.

1269
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:23,038
You gotta work for it, kid.
Keep your motor running.

1270
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,998
- Bring me three glasses, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1271
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:28,335
- Hey, this is beginning to look serious.
- It is.

1272
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:30,337
- Huh?
- Yes, we finally made up our minds.

1273
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,715
So? Well, this calls for a celebration.
Congratulations, Romeo.

1274
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,134
- You've been swell to us, Mr. Fay.
- Oh, forget it, kid.

1275
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,112
I get a kick out of doing things
for other people.

1276
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:40,138
- Don't I, Veda?
- Absolutely.

1277
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:43,022
Looks like we never serve champagne
in this joint. Or place. Excuse me.

1278
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,686
Kids, try this on for size.

1279
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:48,647
This is some of our very best,
reserved for special customers.

1280
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,942
California, '42.

1281
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:56,446
Well, here's to, uh...
Here's to true love.

1282
01:16:57,531 --> 01:16:59,157
To true love.

1283
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:10,210
The receipts of the establishment at Arcadia
have dropped roughly seven percent

1284
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:11,729
- during the last month.
- Say, Mildred.

1285
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:12,939
- Nearly eight percent —
- Yes?

1286
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:15,465
There's a Mrs. Forrester waiting
in the patio to see you.

1287
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:17,968
- Oh. What about?
- Veda.

1288
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:20,554
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

1289
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:23,056
You always interrupt.

1290
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,309
It's only because
I want to be alone with you.

1291
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:28,603
Come here and let me bite you,
you darling boy.

1292
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,358
- Mrs. Pierce?
- Yes.

1293
01:17:33,442 --> 01:17:34,901
I'm Mrs. Forrester, Ted's mother.

1294
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:36,737
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Forrester?

1295
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,674
Won't you come over here and sit down?
I think it'd be more comfortable for you.

1296
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:43,285
Thank you. I've been looking forward
so much to meeting you, Mrs. Pierce.

1297
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:46,288
I'm sure we're going to work out
our little problem splendidly.

1298
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:49,082
- Little problem?
- Uh, Veda hasn't told you?

1299
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,959
Told me what?

1300
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:54,254
Your daughter has
somehow got the idea that —

1301
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,300
Well, I understand it, of course.
Any girl wants to get married.

1302
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:02,429
But Ted had no such thing in mind.
I want that made clear.

1303
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,806
You mean they're engaged,
Veda and your son?

1304
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:07,893
Yes. But I'm quite sure
you'll agree with me, Mrs. Pierce,

1305
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:12,356
that any discussion of marriage
between them would be most undesirable.

1306
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:15,692
Why should Veda want to marry your son
if he doesn't want to marry her?

1307
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:19,363
I'm not a mind reader, Mrs. Pierce.
But let me tell you one thing.

1308
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:23,450
If you or this girl or anybody employs any
more tricks trying to blackmail my son —

1309
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,077
Trying to what?

1310
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,829
Understand me, Mrs. Pierce.
I shall prevent this marriage.

1311
01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:30,123
I shall prevent it in any way that I can.

1312
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:32,542
I don't think you need worry,
Mrs. Forrester.

1313
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:35,504
Having you in my family is
a pretty dismal prospect.

1314
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:36,880
Good afternoon.

1315
01:18:46,598 --> 01:18:48,767
- Veda, I want to talk to you.
- Hi, Mildred.

1316
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,811
- Hello, Wally.
- What about?

1317
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:54,564
- Mrs. Forrester came to see me today.
- Oh.

1318
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:56,149
Wally, do you mind? This is private.

1319
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,360
That's all right, Mother.
Wally knows about it.

1320
01:18:58,443 --> 01:19:00,779
He knows
that you and Ted want to get married?

1321
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,948
Want to get married?

1322
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:07,661
We are married.
We were married on my birthday.

1323
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,579
I'm sorry, but it's done.

1324
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:11,748
You see, Mildred,
Veda was trying to spare you.

1325
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:15,127
She wanted to make things easier for you,
so she asked me to help.

1326
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:19,047
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to so many times.

1327
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,968
But you seemed so far away,
I couldn't somehow.

1328
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,469
I was afraid.

1329
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:29,099
- Afraid of your own mother?
- Oh, Mother, I've been so miserable.

1330
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:33,186
I made a mistake
and I didn't know how to tell you.

1331
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,648
Oh, darling.

1332
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:39,317
Don't you love Ted?

1333
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,780
No, Mother.

1334
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:48,535
I'm sorry about that, Veda.

1335
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:51,913
But maybe we don't belong
in a family like that anyway.

1336
01:19:51,997 --> 01:19:54,666
That's right, Mildred.
Veda doesn't love this boy.

1337
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:58,587
So she made a mistake. The only thing
to do is to settle the case out of court.

1338
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,631
That's the clean, quick way
to handle the situation.

1339
01:20:01,715 --> 01:20:03,550
All right.

1340
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:07,429
"And I hereby, of my own free will,
renounce all right and title

1341
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:10,140
that I or my heirs and assignees may have

1342
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:14,060
to any monies or estate,
real or otherwise,

1343
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:17,314
which will accrue or evolve
to Theodore Ellison Forrester

1344
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:21,067
in exchange for considerations
of value received."

1345
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,653
Are you agreeable to this waiver?

1346
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:25,798
Please, why can't we stay married?
I don't see why —

1347
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,658
- Theodore, be good enough to keep quiet.
- Yes, Mother.

1348
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:30,785
I think we can assume
that the waiver is acceptable.

1349
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:32,996
- Will you sign this, please?
- Yeah, sure. Glad to.

1350
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:38,293
My client feels, and I am in complete
accord with her, that she has been irrep —

1351
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:40,754
- Uh...
- Irreparably?

1352
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:44,049
Unduly damaged.

1353
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:47,111
Therefore, there's one more little formality
I think we should discuss first.

1354
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:49,262
- What's that, Mr. Fay?
- The financial settlement.

1355
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:51,806
You see, my client would like $10,000.

1356
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:56,645
I think I'm safe in observing that
almost anyone would like $10,000, Mr. Fay,

1357
01:20:56,728 --> 01:20:57,979
but, uh...

1358
01:20:58,063 --> 01:20:59,439
"But, uh"?

1359
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:03,026
We see no necessity
for a financial settlement of any kind.

1360
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:04,736
- You don't, huh?
- No.

1361
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,447
- You will.
- I doubt it.

1362
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:09,324
I don't understand all this.

1363
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:12,244
As far as I know, there's no need
for a financial settlement.

1364
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:14,746
- The only thing we're interested in is —
- Please, Mother.

1365
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,209
I need the money.
I have to think of the future.

1366
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,627
That's right.

1367
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,504
- I'm going to have a baby.
- What?

1368
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:24,172
- What?
- What?

1369
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,132
Veda.

1370
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:30,720
So you see,
$10,000 is not entirely unreasonable.

1371
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:32,180
This is moral blackmail, sir.

1372
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:36,059
- That's no way to talk about a baby.
- I won't pay it.

1373
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,603
Oh, yes, you will, Mrs. Forrester.
Ask your lawyer.

1374
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:39,813
Yes?

1375
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,441
- Yes.
- I guess that's about all.

1376
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:48,863
You can make out the check to Mrs. Forrest —
to, uh, Miss Veda Pierce.

1377
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,701
Well, that's that.

1378
01:21:55,954 --> 01:22:00,542
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry for the boy. He seemed very nice.

1379
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,544
Oh, Ted's all right, really.

1380
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:07,591
Did you see the look on his face
when we told him he was going to be a father?

1381
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:12,304
- I wish you wouldn't joke about it.
- Mother, you're a scream, really you are.

1382
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:14,889
The next thing I know,
you'll be knitting little garments.

1383
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:17,392
I don't see anything so ridiculous
about that.

1384
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:19,936
If I were you,
I'd save myself the trouble.

1385
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:30,822
- You're not going to have a baby?
- At this stage, it's a matter of opinion.

1386
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:33,408
And in my opinion,
I'm going to have a baby.

1387
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:35,243
I can always be mistaken.

1388
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:38,330
How could you do such a thing?
How could you?

1389
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:41,082
- I got the money, didn't I?
- Oh, I see.

1390
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:44,794
I'll have to give Wally part of it to keep
him quiet, but there's enough left for me.

1391
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:47,839
Money. That's what you live for, isn't it?

1392
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:50,592
You'd do anything for money, wouldn't you?
Even blackmail.

1393
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:53,136
- Oh, grow up.
- I've never denied you anything.

1394
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:55,639
Anything money could buy, I've given you.

1395
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:57,515
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1396
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:59,785
All right, from now on,
things are going to be different.

1397
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:03,355
I'll say they're going to be different.
Why do you think I went to all this trouble?

1398
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:06,399
- Why do you think I want money so badly?
- All right, why?

1399
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:10,070
- Are you sure you want to know?
- Yes.

1400
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:12,030
Then I'll tell you.

1401
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:15,825
- With this money, I can get away from you.
- Veda.

1402
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:18,495
From you and your chickens
and your pies and your kitchens

1403
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,497
and everything that smells of grease.

1404
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,166
I can get away from this shack
with its cheap furniture

1405
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:24,751
and this town and its dollar days

1406
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,962
and its women that wear uniforms
and its men that wear overalls.

1407
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:31,883
I think I'm really seeing you for the first time
in my life, and you're cheap and horrible.

1408
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:34,779
You think just because you made
a little money, you can get a new hairdo

1409
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:38,556
and some expensive clothes and
turn yourself into a lady, but you can't.

1410
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,267
Because you'll never be anything
but a common frump,

1411
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:45,021
whose father lived over a grocery store
and whose mother took in washing.

1412
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:48,191
With this money, I can get away
from every rotten, stinking thing

1413
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,735
that makes me think of this place or you!

1414
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,613
Veda!

1415
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:57,510
- Give me that check.
- Not on your life!

1416
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:58,993
I said, give it to me!

1417
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:10,547
Get out, Veda.

1418
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:13,466
Get your things out
of this house right now

1419
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,844
before I throw them into the street
and you with them.

1420
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:18,138
Get out before I kill you.

1421
01:24:32,986 --> 01:24:35,488
<i>I went away for a while. I traveled.</i>

1422
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:37,449
<i>But not far enough.</i>

1423
01:24:37,532 --> 01:24:39,492
<i>Something kept pulling me back.</i>

1424
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:43,496
<i>Finally, I gave in. I went home.</i>

1425
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:52,547
Why, Mrs. Pierce!
This is a day for rejoicing.

1426
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,799
- It certainly is.
- Hello, Lottie. How are you?

1427
01:24:54,883 --> 01:24:56,676
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1428
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,471
- You've been away so long.
- Yes, I've been to Mexico.

1429
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:00,847
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

1430
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,348
Oh, it's nice to have you back.

1431
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:04,992
I don't know what we would have done
if you'd stayed away longer.

1432
01:25:05,018 --> 01:25:08,605
- Thank you. It's nice to see you too.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

1433
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:11,208
- Welcome home, Mrs. Pierce.
- Thank you, Gene. Hi, Ida.

1434
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,818
- Well, well. Long time no see.
- How are you?

1435
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:15,862
- How was Mexico?
- Crowded. How's business?

1436
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,781
Crowded. Want your desk back?

1437
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:19,991
No, thanks. On you, it looks good.

1438
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:24,454
You know, I like Mexico.
It's so... Mexican. Thanks.

1439
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:25,580
Here.

1440
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,417
You're in great shape.

1441
01:25:30,043 --> 01:25:31,961
Nothing like a nice, long rest, is there?

1442
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:35,799
- Got a drink handy?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1443
01:25:35,882 --> 01:25:39,093
Hey, Gene, crack open the safe
and get out some of that good bourbon.

1444
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:41,387
You never used to drink during the day.

1445
01:25:41,471 --> 01:25:45,225
Never used to drink at all. It's just
a little habit I picked up from men.

1446
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:49,604
Oh, men. I never yet met one of them
who didn't have the instincts of a heel.

1447
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:52,690
Sometimes,
I wish I could get along without 'em.

1448
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:54,526
You've never been married, have you, Ida?

1449
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:57,946
No, when men get around me,
they get allergic to wedding rings.

1450
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:00,323
You know, big sister type.

1451
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:04,035
Good old Ida.
You can talk it over with her, man-to-man.

1452
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,871
Getting awfully tired
of men talking to me man-to-man.

1453
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:08,623
I think I'll have a drink myself.

1454
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:12,293
- I'll take mine straight.
- Well, if you can take it, I can.

1455
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:20,260
- Seen anyone I know lately?
- You mean Veda.

1456
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:23,471
I wondered how long it would take you
to get around to that.

1457
01:26:23,555 --> 01:26:26,891
Yes, I mean Veda. Have you seen her, Ida?
Is she all right?

1458
01:26:26,975 --> 01:26:29,018
Why don't you forget about her?

1459
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:31,437
I can't. I've tried, but I can't.

1460
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:34,148
Well, "try, try again." That's my motto.

1461
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:38,611
You don't know what it's like
being a mother, Ida. Veda's a part of me.

1462
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:42,699
Maybe she didn't turn out as well
as I hoped she would when she was born,

1463
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:45,118
but she's still my daughter
and I can't forget that.

1464
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:47,287
I went away to try.

1465
01:26:47,996 --> 01:26:50,999
I was so mixed up, I didn't know
where I was or what I wanted.

1466
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,042
But now I know.

1467
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:57,505
Now I'm sure of one thing at least.
I want my daughter back.

1468
01:26:58,381 --> 01:27:02,093
Personally, Veda's convinced me
that alligators have the right idea.

1469
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:05,305
They eat their young.

1470
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:09,392
I'm feeling slightly drunk.

1471
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,145
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. Is Mildred there?</i>

1472
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,105
- Yes. Who is it?
<i>- This is Bert.</i>

1473
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:16,149
Hold on. It's Bert.

1474
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:19,110
He's been calling every day
on the hour for a month.

1475
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:23,299
- Hello, Bert. How are you?
<i>- How are you? Just get in?</i>

1476
01:27:23,323 --> 01:27:25,700
I'm fine.
Yes, I just got back this morning.

1477
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:26,823
<i>- How about dinner?</i>
- What?

1478
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:28,908
<i>- How about dinner tomorrow night?</i>
- Tomorrow night?

1479
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:31,473
<i>- Don't you want to?</i>
- Of course I want to have dinner with you.

1480
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:33,434
But what about Mrs. Biederhof?
Maybe she wouldn't like —

1481
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:34,584
<i>She's married.</i>

1482
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,836
- She is?
<i>- Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.</i>

1483
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,589
Oh, okay.
You pick me up at the house at 7:30.

1484
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:40,798
<i>- Swell.</i>
- Good-bye.

1485
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:43,676
Imagine that.
Somebody married Mrs. Biederhof.

1486
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,679
Well, that's a novelty.
Remind me to bake a cake.

1487
01:27:46,763 --> 01:27:50,183
- How's Bert?
- Huh? Oh, he's fine. He's working now.

1488
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:53,102
- No kidding!
- Mm-hmm. He has a job with Condor Aircraft.

1489
01:27:53,186 --> 01:27:56,064
Wow, the manpower shortage
must be worse than we think.

1490
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,691
To the men we have loved.

1491
01:27:59,776 --> 01:28:01,152
The stinkers.

1492
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:11,371
I never did like this place.
Does Wally still own it?

1493
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:12,454
Yeah.

1494
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,208
- Two rum collins, please.
- Yes, sir.

1495
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,044
I still don't know
why you insisted on coming here.

1496
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:20,964
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Now I'm not so sure.

Mildred.

1512
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:30,199
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Mildred.

1513
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:32,326
- Here to see me?
- I'm going to take Veda home.

1514
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,537
Yeah? Veda know about that?

1515
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,956
No. I want you to help me, Wally.

1516
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,959
Not me. She's your daughter.
I've never been a father.

1517
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:42,462
But Veda's been here
for about a month now.

1518
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:45,548
I think I know the best way to handle her.
Let me give you a little advice.

1519
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,634
If you want her to do anything for you,
just hit her on the head first.

1520
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:56,476
I'm tellin' ya. What could he say?
I mean, he was floored.

1521
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:59,979
"Are you kiddin'?" he says.
"No," I says, "and what's more —"

1522
01:30:00,063 --> 01:30:01,731
The powder room's down the hall.

1523
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,067
It's all right, Miriam. She's my mother.

1524
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:07,445
No kiddin'?
I didn't know you had a mother.

1525
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:09,113
Everybody has a mother.

1526
01:30:09,197 --> 01:30:11,282
Oh, yeah. I guess you're right.

1527
01:30:11,783 --> 01:30:15,369
- This is Miriam Ellis, Mother. She sings.
- That's what they tell me anyhow, Mrs. Pierce.

1528
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:18,039
- I'm glad to know you.
- Oh, it's mutual, I'm sure.

1529
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:20,291
I guess this calls
for a medium-class celebration.

1530
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:23,127
Maybe I'd better send out for a beer.
It's full of vitamins.

1531
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:25,546
- None for me, thank you.
- What can I do for you, Mother?

1532
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:28,049
- I want to talk to you, Veda.
- Go ahead.

1533
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,342
Well...

1534
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:32,595
- Why don't you go see if Wally wants you?
- Oh, he won't.

1535
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:36,349
Oh, pardon me, I'm sure.

1536
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:38,768
Won't you sit down, Mother?

1537
01:30:41,813 --> 01:30:43,022
Well?

1538
01:30:43,106 --> 01:30:46,609
I want you to come home, Veda. You don't
belong here. This isn't your kind of life.

1539
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:49,570
No? What is my kind of life, Mother?

1540
01:30:50,113 --> 01:30:53,241
Well, I don't know.
Whatever makes you happy, I guess.

1541
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:55,159
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

1542
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:58,246
- You think I was happy in Glendale?
- Are you happy here?

1543
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:01,874
When I first came here,
I used to cry occasionally.

1544
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,377
- But I've gotten over that.
- You're very fortunate.

1545
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,420
I'm sorry, Mother.
I know I've made you unhappy —

1546
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:08,840
Veda, it isn't easy for me to beg like this.

1547
01:31:08,923 --> 01:31:11,384
- But won't you please come home?
- No, Mother.

1548
01:31:11,467 --> 01:31:15,221
You must think I'm on a string.
"Go away, Veda." "Come back, Veda."

1549
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:18,266
It isn't that easy. I'm free now.

1550
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:21,060
No one tells me
what to do and what not to do.

1551
01:31:21,144 --> 01:31:23,563
I do what I think best,
and I like it that way.

1552
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:26,941
I've had the house redecorated.
All new furniture.

1553
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:29,443
Even a new piano. You'd like it, I know.

1554
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:31,737
You still don't understand, do you?

1555
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:34,323
You think new curtains are enough
to make me happy.

1556
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:37,243
No, I want more than that.

1557
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:40,746
I want the kind of life that Monte taught me,
and you won't give it to me.

1558
01:31:41,455 --> 01:31:43,135
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused,

1559
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:45,543
but if I went home
it would start all over again.

1560
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:48,254
You know that. You know how I am.

1561
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:51,632
The way you want to live
isn't good enough for me.

1562
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,928
If I could give you
the kind of life Monte taught you,

1563
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:57,722
would you be willing to come home then?

1564
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:00,600
But you couldn't, could you, Mother?

1565
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:06,063
Sorry to interrupt, but you can
powder your nose just so long.

1566
01:32:06,147 --> 01:32:08,750
Then people begin to look at you funny.
Anyhow, your number's comin' up.

1567
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:12,028
All right. Sorry, Mother.
I'm on next. I have to change.

1568
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:16,282
Do you mind?

1569
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:19,535
Not at all, but...
when will I see you again, Veda?

1570
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:22,121
Just drop around. I'll be here. Bye!

1571
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:24,415
Good-bye.

1572
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:35,718
Well, so much for the upstairs.
It's a little gloomy, isn't it?

1573
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:39,805
Not quite so bad down here, with the
possible exception of the entrance hall.

1574
01:32:40,306 --> 01:32:43,851
As you can see, the pride of the Beragons
isn't exactly rolling in wealth.

1575
01:32:45,102 --> 01:32:47,188
- You're not exhausted?
- No, not at all.

1576
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:50,191
Look, you can't be really serious
about buying this place.

1577
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:53,319
- You're not a very good salesman, you know.
- No, I suppose I'm not.

1578
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:57,114
In here used to be the sitting room.
It still is. I do all my sitting here.

1579
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,284
- Becoming quite an expert at it.
- Do you live here all alone?

1580
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:02,137
Oh, yes.
They're complete living quarters here.

1581
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:04,956
Somebody has to be on the premises
to show the place.

1582
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:06,624
- Won't you sit down?
- Yes, thank you.

1583
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:08,834
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Please.

1584
01:33:10,044 --> 01:33:14,799
I have the heel of a bottle, no ice or seltzer.
Sorry I can't be more hospitable.

1585
01:33:14,882 --> 01:33:16,926
Oh, that's all right.
I prefer it straight.

1586
01:33:17,885 --> 01:33:20,638
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, I prefer it straight.

1587
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:21,847
Oh.

1588
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:23,891
Say when.

1589
01:33:23,975 --> 01:33:25,643
Oh, when!

1590
01:33:25,726 --> 01:33:28,938
- What happened to your orange grove?
- Sold for taxes like everything else.

1591
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:32,566
- The beach house too? Oh, it was beautiful.
- No, not the beach house.

1592
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:36,195
I have an uncle who has a little money,
and he wouldn't let me sell the beach house.

1593
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:38,197
He's hoping to foreclose on it instead.

1594
01:33:38,281 --> 01:33:40,366
Mmm. Sounds like a nice uncle.

1595
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:44,662
Now, Mildred, what do you want?

1596
01:33:45,788 --> 01:33:47,790
- Well, I don't understand.
- Oh, yes, you do.

1597
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:51,877
You don't really want to buy this
antiquated tomb. You'd be out of your mind.

1598
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:56,090
Oh, I don't know.
It isn't such a bad house.

1599
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:57,717
A little remodeling would do wonders.

1600
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,554
Take off some of that gingerbread
and redecorate the inside and —

1601
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:06,392
My businesslike air
isn't fooling you much, is it?

1602
01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:07,560
No.

1603
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:12,273
No, I remember too well. I remember
how it was with us once, and so do you.

1604
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:14,817
It isn't something
either of us can forget.

1605
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:17,445
- You haven't forgotten, Monte?
- Not for an hour.

1606
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:19,572
Even this doesn't help.

1607
01:34:19,655 --> 01:34:22,908
- Then you can do me a great kindness.
- If I can.

1608
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,119
Ask me to marry you.

1609
01:34:27,747 --> 01:34:28,831
Why?

1610
01:34:30,124 --> 01:34:33,502
Well, I must say,
your attitude isn't exactly enthusiastic.

1611
01:34:33,586 --> 01:34:35,746
You went to considerable trouble
to get rid of me once,

1612
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:39,342
so naturally I'm a little startled
by your proposal of marriage.

1613
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:41,135
This is so sudden, Mildred.

1614
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,181
I have my own personal reason
for wanting to marry you.

1615
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:47,600
- A reason named Veda, I think.
- Why should it be?

1616
01:34:47,683 --> 01:34:50,978
Because your reason for doing anything
is usually Veda.

1617
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:56,317
Well, whether it is or isn't,
what's your answer?

1618
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,071
I can't afford you, Mildred.
You have money and I haven't.

1619
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:03,949
All I have is pride and a name,
and I can't sell either.

1620
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:06,660
- I see.
- I'm not enjoying this, Mildred.

1621
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:10,122
Things are very different now
from the way they were in the beginning.

1622
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:14,210
- I know. I haven't forgotten.
- Neither have I.

1623
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:17,046
I want you to love me again
the way you did then.

1624
01:35:17,129 --> 01:35:19,465
I need that more than anything else.
I'm lost without it.

1625
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:23,552
I told you that day I knew you were
the only woman in the world for me.

1626
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:25,846
I loved you then, Mildred,
and I love you now.

1627
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,366
- Well, then why?
- I can't marry you.

1628
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:30,351
I won't go on taking tips from you
as I used to.

1629
01:35:31,185 --> 01:35:33,479
Of course,
if I owned a share in your business...

1630
01:35:35,564 --> 01:35:39,235
Oh, I see. I think I understand now.

1631
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:43,531
How much of a share
would your pride require, Monte?

1632
01:35:43,614 --> 01:35:46,075
Please don't put it that way.
You know it hurts me to do this.

1633
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:48,318
- I'm only doing it because I —
- How much of a share?

1634
01:35:50,037 --> 01:35:51,414
One third.

1635
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,126
All right.

1636
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:57,336
Sold.

1637
01:35:58,295 --> 01:35:59,713
One Beragon.

1638
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:18,941
- Hello, Lottie.
- Why, Mr. Pierce!

1639
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:21,610
Is Mrs. Pierce —
Uh, Mrs. Beragon, is she in?

1640
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:24,238
She's in there.
I mean, uh...

1641
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:27,032
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

1642
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:30,327
- It's nice to see you again, Mr. Pierce.
- It's nice to see you, Lottie.

1643
01:36:30,411 --> 01:36:33,497
It's been such a long, long time.
Follow me.

1644
01:36:34,123 --> 01:36:37,001
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm supposed to announce everybody.

1645
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:39,170
You stay there. Pardon, please.

1646
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:40,963
Please pardon.

1647
01:36:44,592 --> 01:36:47,011
Mr. Albert Pierce.

1648
01:36:50,556 --> 01:36:52,933
- Lottie, not so loud.
- No?

1649
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:55,519
Hello, Bert. It's nice to see you.

1650
01:36:55,603 --> 01:36:58,606
Thanks, Mildred. I was just driving by
and thought I'd drop in to say hello.

1651
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:02,067
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, of course not. Come in, sit down.

1652
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:03,628
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

1653
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:05,946
My hours are too long.
I can't do it these days.

1654
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,364
Let's sit over here.

1655
01:37:07,448 --> 01:37:11,076
- My, this is quite a nifty place.
- Yes, we just finished redecorating.

1656
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,871
- You didn't come to the wedding.
- I read about it.

1657
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:17,541
It was very informal. Just Monte's family
and a few of his friends.

1658
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:20,669
Mildred, I probably have
a lot of nerve to ask you this,

1659
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:23,339
but do you really love this guy?

1660
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:26,759
- I married him, didn't I?
- That doesn't answer my question.

1661
01:37:27,551 --> 01:37:30,387
- Monte's okay.
- That still doesn't answer me.

1662
01:37:30,888 --> 01:37:32,765
Are you in love with this guy?

1663
01:37:35,017 --> 01:37:36,268
No, Bert.

1664
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,480
I'm not exactly in love with him.

1665
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:41,899
Monte and I understand each other.

1666
01:37:42,608 --> 01:37:47,363
I thought too if I moved away from
that other house and fixed this place up...

1667
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:49,698
- I thought maybe —
- That Veda would come back.

1668
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:52,535
Thought that was why.

1669
01:37:53,327 --> 01:37:56,288
I know you think I'm a fool, Bert,
but I can't help it.

1670
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:59,833
I'd do anything — anything —
to get her back.

1671
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:02,503
After all, I couldn't leave her
where she was, now could I?

1672
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:03,963
No, I guess not.

1673
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:06,549
Anyhow, that's all I wanted to know.

1674
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:09,760
I guess we'll always fight about her.

1675
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:14,640
Mildred, I brought you a wedding present.

1676
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,433
- A wedding present?
- Mm-hmm.

1677
01:38:16,809 --> 01:38:18,435
Take a look out that window.

1678
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:38,163
Bert, did you ask her to come with you?

1679
01:38:38,247 --> 01:38:39,957
No. No, she called me up.

1680
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:43,335
She tried to pretend it was for something else,
but I got the truth out of her.

1681
01:38:43,419 --> 01:38:45,379
She wanted to come home, Mildred.

1682
01:38:45,462 --> 01:38:48,507
Tell her to come in.

1683
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:15,951
Veda.

1684
01:39:16,994 --> 01:39:18,203
Mother.

1685
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:31,592
Oh, I wanted to come home weeks ago.

1686
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:34,762
And when it was Christmas, I —
I couldn't stay away.

1687
01:39:34,845 --> 01:39:36,513
Oh, I'm so glad, darling.

1688
01:39:36,597 --> 01:39:38,891
Oh, I'll change, Mother. I promise.

1689
01:39:39,475 --> 01:39:41,644
I'll never say mean things to you again.

1690
01:39:41,727 --> 01:39:43,520
I said mean things too.

1691
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:49,485
Mother, this is a beautiful place.

1692
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:52,571
Oh, Bert! I forgot to thank your father.

1693
01:39:55,324 --> 01:39:57,785
- Bert, I'm very grateful.
- Oh, that's all right, Mildred.

1694
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,203
I'm off. Good-bye.

1695
01:39:59,286 --> 01:40:02,581
I don't believe it.
I simply don't believe it.

1696
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,627
Well, well. The prodigal returneth.
We'll have the fatted calf for dinner.

1697
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:09,046
- Hello, Monte.
- Hey.

1698
01:40:09,129 --> 01:40:12,633
- Tears of joy at seeing me again, I trust?
- Of course.

1699
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:16,470
You look lovely, prodigal.
It's about time you came to see us.

1700
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:20,808
Veda's come home, Monte.
She's going to stay with us.

1701
01:40:20,891 --> 01:40:23,686
- That is, if Monte doesn't mind.
- Oh, I think it's wonderful.

1702
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:26,063
Just don't call me Father.

1703
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:29,566
- Blow, darling. Come on.
- Make a wish, Veda.

1704
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:32,194
You can do better than that.

1705
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:35,447
Come on. Three's all you get.
Three's all you get.

1706
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:39,159
- Happy birthday, Veda!
- Happy birthday, Veda!

1707
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:46,917
Eloise, be careful
how you pour that champagne.

1708
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,128
That's Père et Fils, 1927.

1709
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:53,006
- Is that better than '28?
- Well, it's the newest we could get.

1710
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:57,219
Jacques, isn't this a beautiful night?
I just love parties, don't you?

1711
01:40:57,302 --> 01:41:00,097
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you kindly.

1712
01:41:04,184 --> 01:41:06,103
Yes? Hello?

1713
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:10,691
Oh. This is the Beragon residence.
Who shall I say is calling?

1714
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:14,069
Oh, yes. Yes, Miss Mildred. I'll call her.

1715
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:18,115
Business is business, Mr. Jones.
Business is business.

1716
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:21,577
Hello? Hello, Ida? This is Mildred.

1717
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,955
- Yes, how's the party going?
- Fine. Veda just cut the cake.

1718
01:41:25,038 --> 01:41:27,058
You get your clients
to agree to a little more time.

1719
01:41:27,082 --> 01:41:28,250
Out of the question.

1720
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:31,336
No, I just wanted to let you know
I'll be delayed here a little longer.

1721
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:35,090
What's going on there? Are you in trouble?
You sound so funny.

1722
01:41:35,174 --> 01:41:39,386
No, I'll — I'll tell you about it later.
Keep the party going for me, will you?

1723
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:42,389
Okay, Mildred,
but get here as soon as you can.

1724
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:45,434
- Was that Mother?
- Yes. She's at the office.

1725
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:47,436
There's something going on. I'm worried.

1726
01:41:47,519 --> 01:41:49,438
I think she's in some sort
of business trouble.

1727
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,732
Well, it happens in the best of families.

1728
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:54,818
Don't look now, but you've got
canary feathers all over your face.

1729
01:41:54,902 --> 01:41:57,571
Business and making money.
That's all Mother thinks about.

1730
01:41:57,654 --> 01:42:00,449
- How about that drink?
- Beauty calls. Excuse us.

1731
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:01,867
It's a pleasure.

1732
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:04,369
My clients demand an accounting.

1733
01:42:04,453 --> 01:42:07,080
Now, you must satisfy your creditors
or show cause

1734
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:11,126
why control of Mildred's Incorporated
should not be taken away from you.

1735
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:15,964
If you resist, your creditors force you
into bankruptcy. It's as simple as that.

1736
01:42:16,048 --> 01:42:17,883
Can they do it?

1737
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:21,595
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Beragon.
- Yes, so am I.

1738
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:26,451
Well, I've gone over everything, and I haven't
a cent of ready cash in any of the restaurants.

1739
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:27,726
So I guess that's that.

1740
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:31,313
I was hoping you could scrape up enough
dough to get yourself out of this mess.

1741
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:34,459
- Anyway, you can still manage the business.
- That's very nice of you, Wally.

1742
01:42:34,483 --> 01:42:37,128
Stealing the business out from under me
and then letting me run it for you.

1743
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:40,256
Listen, I'm not getting any bang out of
doing this to you. I haven't any choice.

1744
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,824
You've been bleeding this business dry

1745
01:42:41,907 --> 01:42:44,159
so you can live the way you have
since Veda came home.

1746
01:42:44,243 --> 01:42:46,411
- I know, I know.
- Okay, you let a few bills go by.

1747
01:42:46,495 --> 01:42:48,473
Then a few more.
Pretty soon you're in real trouble.

1748
01:42:48,497 --> 01:42:50,874
Now the creditors want your hide
and I can't stop 'em.

1749
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,678
Another month like this,
and we'd all be out in the cold. As it is —

1750
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:57,422
- As it is, only I am. Isn't that it?
- I'm sorry. It looks that way.

1751
01:42:57,506 --> 01:42:59,818
You'd still be all right
if Monte hadn't forced the situation.

1752
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:03,512
- Monte. What's he got to do with this?
- I thought you knew. This was his idea.

1753
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:06,598
He wants to sell his share, and
I gotta go along with him or I'm out too.

1754
01:43:06,682 --> 01:43:08,016
Didn't you know?

1755
01:43:08,976 --> 01:43:10,185
No.

1756
01:43:11,436 --> 01:43:12,938
You married him. I didn't.

1757
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:14,565
Good night, Mrs. Beragon.

1758
01:43:18,735 --> 01:43:22,781
I'm sorry this has happened.
But if I do say it, as perhaps I shouldn't,

1759
01:43:22,865 --> 01:43:28,078
I think Mr. Beragon acted badly.
Very badly indeed.

1760
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:30,998
- Good night, Mrs. Beragon.
- Good night, Jones.

1761
01:43:49,308 --> 01:43:51,768
Hello, Ida, this is Mildred again.
I want to speak with Monte.

1762
01:43:51,852 --> 01:43:53,312
He isn't here, Mildred.

1763
01:43:53,395 --> 01:43:56,690
He drove off about 20 minutes ago
just after the party broke up.

1764
01:43:57,941 --> 01:43:59,318
I see.

1765
01:44:00,944 --> 01:44:02,821
<i>Mildred. Mildred!</i>

1766
01:44:28,722 --> 01:44:32,434
I went to the house, and Monte was alone.
And I killed him.

1767
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:34,144
You're lying, Mrs. Beragon.

1768
01:44:34,227 --> 01:44:36,563
We know you weren't alone
in the house with him.

1769
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:39,858
We've proof of that,
and various other things.

1770
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:43,236
Okay, now. Yes.

1771
01:44:44,363 --> 01:44:47,407
You see, Mrs. Beragon, we've had
a slant on you from the beginning.

1772
01:44:47,491 --> 01:44:50,452
You were the key,
and we had to put the pressure on you.

1773
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:54,581
Well, the key turned, the door opened,
and there was the murderer.

1774
01:44:57,459 --> 01:45:00,837
We picked her up at the airport. They
grabbed her off a plane headed for Arizona.

1775
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:02,339
She didn't like it much.

1776
01:45:03,131 --> 01:45:04,299
I don't understand.

1777
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:06,927
You will. We know all about it.
Your mother told us everything.

1778
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,345
Why did you kill him?

1779
01:45:09,221 --> 01:45:11,056
You promised not to tell. You promised!

1780
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:13,159
- You said you'd help me get away.
- Veda, don't say anything more!

1781
01:45:13,183 --> 01:45:15,602
Too late, Mrs. Beragon.
That's all we needed.

1782
01:45:15,686 --> 01:45:19,189
You left the party at approximately 11:15
with Beragon.

1783
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:21,441
Your mother left her office at 11:45.

1784
01:45:21,525 --> 01:45:24,736
You were already at the beach house
when she got there shortly after midnight.

1785
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,530
Isn't that right, Mrs. Beragon?

1786
01:45:31,576 --> 01:45:33,203
Yes.

1787
01:45:34,538 --> 01:45:37,165
I didn't know Veda was there
when I came in.

1788
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:41,336
<i>I expected Monte to be alone.</i>

1789
01:46:13,577 --> 01:46:16,663
We weren't expecting you, Mildred,
obviously.

1790
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:20,000
It's just as well you know.

1791
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,753
I'm glad you know.

1792
01:46:24,046 --> 01:46:26,089
How long has this been going on?

1793
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,092
Since I came home and even before.

1794
01:46:29,843 --> 01:46:32,012
He never loved you. It's always been me.

1795
01:46:32,804 --> 01:46:36,558
I've got what I wanted.
Monte's going to divorce you and marry me.

1796
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:39,102
No, Veda.

1797
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:43,023
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1798
01:46:50,155 --> 01:46:51,239
Mildred.

1799
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:55,702
Use your head. This won't solve anything.

1800
01:47:07,798 --> 01:47:10,884
Just where did you get the idea
I'm going to marry you?

1801
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:13,011
- Monte, don't joke like that.
- I'm not joking.

1802
01:47:13,095 --> 01:47:15,889
If you think I'm going to marry you,
you're very much mistaken.

1803
01:47:18,225 --> 01:47:21,144
Monte, listen to me! You told me over
and over again that you loved me!

1804
01:47:21,228 --> 01:47:23,855
- Did I? Then I must have been drinking.
- Monte, listen to me!

1805
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:27,339
You don't really think I could be in love
with a rotten little tramp like you, do you?

1806
01:47:53,176 --> 01:47:54,427
Mildred.

1807
01:47:59,349 --> 01:48:00,684
Veda, what's happened?

1808
01:48:01,726 --> 01:48:03,061
It's Monte!

1809
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:05,522
He's dead!

1810
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:12,154
He said horrible things.

1811
01:48:12,237 --> 01:48:16,074
He didn't want me around anymore.
He told me to get out.

1812
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:20,162
And then he laughed at me.
He wouldn't stop laughing.

1813
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:24,207
I told him I'd kill him.
He said I didn't have guts enough.

1814
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,545
I didn't mean to do it.
I didn't mean to, I tell you!

1815
01:48:28,628 --> 01:48:31,506
But the gun kept going off
over and over again.

1816
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:37,762
Then he was lying there, looking at me.
Just looking at me.

1817
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,223
You've got to help me!

1818
01:48:40,307 --> 01:48:45,228
Give me money to get away, and time.
I've got to get away before they find him!

1819
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:49,566
I can't get you out of this, Veda.

1820
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:54,529
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

1821
01:48:57,574 --> 01:48:59,701
<i>- Number, please.</i>
- Give me the police department.

1822
01:48:59,784 --> 01:49:02,162
No! No, Mother.

1823
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:04,623
Think what will happen if they find me.

1824
01:49:04,706 --> 01:49:06,208
Think what will happen.

1825
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:09,836
- I don't care anymore, Veda.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1826
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,381
Give me another chance.
It's your fault as much as mine.

1827
01:49:14,966 --> 01:49:16,903
<i>- Santa Monica Police Department.</i>
- You've got to help me.

1828
01:49:16,927 --> 01:49:18,720
<i>- O'Grady speaking.</i>
- Help me, Mother.

1829
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:20,096
- Just this once.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1830
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:22,557
I'll change. I promise I will.
I'll be different!

1831
01:49:22,641 --> 01:49:25,268
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Just give me another chance.

1832
01:49:25,352 --> 01:49:27,270
It's your fault I'm the way I am!

1833
01:49:27,354 --> 01:49:29,773
<i>- Santa Monica Police Department.</i>
- Help me.

1834
01:49:30,315 --> 01:49:31,524
<i>Hello!</i>

1835
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:43,703
I thought maybe, in a way,
it was my fault.

1836
01:49:43,787 --> 01:49:46,456
So I tried to help her.

1837
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:48,792
I wanted to take the blame for it.

1838
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:51,044
Not this time, Mrs. Beragon.

1839
01:49:51,127 --> 01:49:53,797
This time your daughter pays
for her own mistake.

1840
01:49:54,631 --> 01:49:56,091
Okay, book her.

1841
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:03,348
Darling, I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

1842
01:50:05,016 --> 01:50:07,560
Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get by.

1843
01:50:09,646 --> 01:50:11,564
See that those others are released.

1844
01:50:15,694 --> 01:50:17,862
We need some fresh air in here.

1845
01:50:20,573 --> 01:50:22,450
Looks like a nice morning.

1846
01:50:23,076 --> 01:50:26,496
You can go now.
We'll call you when we want you.

1847
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:30,875
You know, Mrs. Beragon, there are times
when I regret being a policeman.
