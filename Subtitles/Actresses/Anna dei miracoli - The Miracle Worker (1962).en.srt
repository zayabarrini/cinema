1
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,068
She'll live.

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,994
I can tell you now, I thought she wouldn't.

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,251
I brought up two of them.
This is my wife's first.

4
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,087
She isn't battle scarred yet.

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,801
Doctor, will my girl be all right?

6
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,430
By morning she'll be knocking down
Captain Keller's fences again.

7
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,228
Is there nothing we should do?

8
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,231
Put up stronger fencing, huh?

9
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,858
Just let her get well.

10
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,902
She knows how better than we do.

11
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,532
These things come and go in infants.
Never know why.

12
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,326
Call it acute congestion
of the stomach and brain.

13
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,245
I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,581
The main thing is, the fever's gone.

15
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,959
-I never saw a baby with more vitality.
-That's the truth.

16
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,263
Hush.

17
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,766
Don't you cry now.

18
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,061
You've been trouble enough.

19
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:49,108
"Call it acute congestion," indeed.

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,321
I don't see what's so cute about
a congestion just 'cause it's yours.

21
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,913
We'll have your father
run an editorial in his paper.

22
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,916
The wonders of modern medicine.

23
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,127
They don't know what they're curing
even when they cure it.

24
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,548
Men. Men and their battle scars.

25
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,968
We women have...

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,100
Helen?

27
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,531
Captain!

28
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,953
Captain! Will you come?

29
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,747
Katie! What is it? What's happened?

30
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,544
Katie, what is it? What's wrong?

31
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,504
Look. She can't see.

32
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,549
Look at her eyes! She can't see.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,175
Helen!

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,805
Or hear. When I screamed, she didn't blink!
Not an eyelash!

35
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,435
She can't hear you!

36
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,139
I told you to let her be!

37
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,627
Arthur, something ought to be
done for that child.

38
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,921
A refreshing suggestion. What?

39
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,300
Why, this very famous
Perkins School in Boston.

40
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,844
Why, they're just supposed to do wonders.

41
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,096
Child's been to specialists everywhere.

42
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,307
They couldn't help her in Baltimore
or Washington, could they?

43
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,185
I think the Captain will write
to the Perkins School soon.

44
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,812
Katie, how many times
can you let them break your heart?

45
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,565
Any number of times,
as long as there's the least chance

46
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,609
for her to see or to hear.

47
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,278
-What, child?
-There isn't! Now I must finish here.

48
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,282
With your permission, Captain,
I would like to write to the Perkins School.

49
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,370
-I said no, Katie.
-Writing does no harm, Arthur.

50
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,164
Only a little, bitty letter
to see if they can help her.

51
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,918
-They can't.
-We won't know till after you write.

52
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,127
They can't.

53
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,302
I might as well try to work
in a hen yard as this house.

54
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,429
You really ought to put her away, Father.

55
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,057
-What?
-Some asylum. It's the kindest thing.

56
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,809
She is your sister, James.

57
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,229
Half-sister and half mentally defective.

58
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,565
She can't even keep herself clean.
It's not pleasant to see her about.

59
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,237
Do you dare complain of what you can see?

60
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,780
This discussion's at an end!

61
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,074
The house is at sixes and sevens
morning and night over the child.

62
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,660
I want some peace here! I don't care how.

63
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,747
One way we won't have it is rushing
around to see each new quack.

64
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,333
-I'm as sensible to this affliction...
-Helen!

65
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,668
My buttons.

66
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,104
Eyes.

67
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,233
She wants the doll to have eyes.

68
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,457
My goodness me, I'm not decent.

69
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,709
She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev.

70
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,961
I'll sew 'em on again.

71
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,761
It's worth a couple of buttons, Kate. Look.

72
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,307
This child has more sense
than all these men Kellers,

73
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,851
if there's ever any way
to reach that mind of hers.

74
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,941
You're not to do such things!
How can I make you understand?

75
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,779
How can I get it into your head, my darling?

76
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,157
Some way of teaching her an iota
of discipline has to be found.

77
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,951
How can you discipline an afflicted child?
Is it her fault?

78
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,787
-I didn't say it was her fault.
-Then whose? I don't know what to do.

79
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,540
How can I teach her?
Beat her till she's black and blue?

80
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,668
It's not safe to let her run around loose.
We must confine her.

81
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,422
Where? In a cage? She's a growing child.
She has to be able to live.

82
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,966
Answer me one thing. Is it fair to the baby?

83
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,636
Are you willing to put her away?

84
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,930
Now what?

85
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,934
She wants to talk like...

86
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,853
Be like you and me.

87
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,159
Every day she slips further away.

88
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,624
I don't know how to call her back.

89
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,585
I've a mind to write to Boston myself.

90
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,672
If that school can't help her,

91
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,591
maybe they'll send somebody who can.

92
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,387
I'll write to Perkins.

93
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,194
It will no doubt be difficult for you there.

94
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,534
This is my last time to counsel you, Annie.

95
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,245
You do lack some,
and by some, I mean all...

96
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,622
What? Tact.

97
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,749
Or talent to bend to others.

98
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,711
And what has saved you
on more than one occasion at Perkins

99
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,714
is that there was nowhere to expel you to.

100
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,967
-Your eyes hurt?
-My ears, Mr. Anagnos.

101
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,637
Nowhere but back to that dreadful place
where you grew up learning to be saucy!

102
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,557
Annie, I know
how unhappy it was for you there.

103
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,352
But that battle is dead and done with.
Why not let it stay buried?

104
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,147
-God must owe me a resurrection.
-What?

105
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,817
-He keeps digging up that battle.
-That is not a proper thing to say.

106
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,363
Be humble. You'll need their affection
working with this child.

107
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,368
A gift, with our affection.

108
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,879
Dear Mr. Anagnos.

109
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,553
Well, what should I say?

110
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,599
I'm an ignorant, opinionated girl,
and everything I am I owe to you.

111
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,685
That is only half true, Annie.

112
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,437
Which half?

113
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,149
Good-bye. Good-bye.

114
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
I won't give them any trouble.

115
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,323
I'll be so ladylike,
they won't notice I've come.

116
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,120
Where are we goin', Annie?

117
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,457
-Jimmy.
-Where are we goin'?

118
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,295
-I said, I'm taking care of you.
-Where are we goin'?

119
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,714
Annie Sullivan, aged nine, virtually blind.

120
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,758
James Sullivan, aged seven.

121
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,218
What's the matter with your leg, sonny?

122
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,054
It's his hip, mister. He was born that way.

123
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,182
Can't he walk without that crutch?

124
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,058
Girl goes to the women's ward,
boy to the men's.

125
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,604
Annie! Don't let them take me!

126
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,169
Tuscumbia!

127
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,177
-Miss Sullivan?
-Here!

128
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,387
At last.
I've been on trains for so many days,

129
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,640
I thought they must be backing up
every time I dozed off.

130
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,435
-I'm James Keller.
-James. I had a brother Jimmy.

131
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,730
-Are you Helen's?
-I'm only half a brother.

132
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,317
-You're to be her governess?
-Well, try.

133
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:26,114
You look like half a governess.
You have a trunk?

134
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,616
Yes.

135
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,420
Mrs. Keller.

136
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,737
We've met every train for two days.

137
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,534
You didn't bring Helen.
I was hoping you would.

138
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,327
No, she's home.

139
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,790
You live far from town, Mrs. Keller?

140
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,959
Only a mile.

141
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,795
Well, I suppose I could wait one more mile.

142
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,131
But don't be surprised
if I get out and push the horse.

143
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,482
-Welcome to Ivy Green, Miss Sullivan.
-My husband Captain Keller.

144
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,902
-Captain, how do you?
-Pleasure to see you.

145
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,030
-I trust you had an agreeable journey.
-I had several.

146
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,491
-Where would you like the trunk?
-Where Miss Sullivan can get at it.

147
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,660
-Yes, please. Where's Helen?
-And the suitcase.

148
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,038
I'll take the suitcase, thanks.
I've got something for Helen.

149
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,082
-When do I see her?
-There. There's Helen.

150
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,946
She's very rough, Katie.

151
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,907
I like her, Captain.

152
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,201
How old is she?

153
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,245
Well, she's not in her teens, you know.

154
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:46,166
Why does she wear those glasses?
I like to see a person's eyes.

155
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,545
-For the sun. She was blind.
-Blind?

156
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:55,217
She had nine operations on her eyes,
one just before she left.

157
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:59,513
Blind? Good heavens, they expect
one blind child to teach another?

158
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,807
How long did she teach there?

159
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,684
She was a pupil.

160
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:09,439
-This is her first position?
-She was valedictorian.

161
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,192
Here a houseful of grownups
can't cope with the child.

162
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,736
How can an inexperienced,
half-blind Yankee schoolgirl manage?

163
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,280
Great improvement.
Now we have two of them to look after.

164
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,075
-You be quiet.
-I was agreeing with you!

165
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,576
You talk too much.

166
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,499
-Nothing I say is right.
-Why say anything?

167
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,560
All the trouble I went to,
and that's how I look?

168
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,293
Oh, no, not the drawers!

169
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,256
All right, Miss O'Sullivan,
let's begin, with doll.

170
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,592
D.

171
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,227
O.

172
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,067
L.

173
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,865
L.

174
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,955
Doll.

175
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,790
You spell pretty well.

176
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,924
Finding out if she's ticklish? She is.

177
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,013
-What is it, a game?
-An alphabet.

178
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,058
-Alphabet?
-For the deaf.

179
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,049
How bright she is.

180
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,510
You think she knows what she's doing?

181
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,735
She's a monkey. She imitates everything.

182
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,863
Yes, she's a bright little monkey, all right.

183
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,702
All right.

184
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,504
-She wants her doll back.
-When she spells it.

185
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,299
-She doesn't know the thing has a name.
-Of course not.

186
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,261
Who expects her to now?
All I want is her fingers to learn the letters.

187
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,930
It won't mean anything to her.

188
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,725
She doesn't like that alphabet.
You invent it yourself?

189
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,854
Spanish monks under a vow of silence,
which I wish you'd take.

190
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,246
C.

191
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,999
A.

192
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,627
K.

193
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,129
E.

194
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,266
You do as my fingers do.
Never mind what it means.

195
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,817
Now...

196
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,823
D.

197
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,120
O.

198
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,998
L.

199
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,046
L.

200
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,176
Think it over.

201
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:09,549
Imitate now. Understand later.
End of the first lesson.

202
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,847
You little wretch.
Nobody's taught you any manners.

203
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,692
Helen, let me out!

204
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,506
Don't worry, they'll find you.
You're not lost,

205
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,132
only out of place.

206
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,224
Toothless!

207
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,562
-Where's Miss Sullivan?
-She's locked in her room.

208
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,064
-Locked in her...
-What on Earth?

209
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,316
Helen locked her in
and made off with the key.

210
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,777
And you sit here and say nothing?

211
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,530
Everyone's been telling me
not to say anything.

212
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,282
-Viney, look out front for Helen.
-She's out by the pump.

213
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,993
Out!

214
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,788
-Miss Sullivan!
-Yes, Captain Keller.

215
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:26,834
-Is there no key on your side?
-If there were, I wouldn't be in here.

216
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,462
Helen took it.
The only thing on my side is me.

217
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,466
Not in the house 10 minutes.
I don't see how you managed it.

218
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,886
And even I'm not on my side.

219
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
-Viney!
-Yes, Captain Keller.

220
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,766
Put that meat back in the oven!

221
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,436
She has no key.

222
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,814
Nonsense! She must have the key.
You search in her pockets?

223
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,400
-Yes. She doesn't have it.
-She must have the key!

224
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,363
-Take that ladder back!
-Certainly.

225
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,115
-She could've hidden the key.
-Where?

226
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,534
Anywhere.
Under a stone, in the flower beds...

227
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,996
I can't plough up the entire grounds
to find a missing key!

228
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,080
-Jimmy!
-Sir?

229
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,666
-Bring me a ladder!
-Certainly.

230
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,922
-What's the baby doing up?
-Captain woke her with his hollering.

231
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,510
Get back to your work!

232
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,475
Miss Sullivan!

233
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,020
Yes, Captain Keller?

234
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:30,023
-Come out of your window onto the roof.
-You have a ladder. How thoughtful.

235
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,941
Come down.

236
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,193
-I don't see how I can.
-I intend to carry you.

237
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,487
That's chivalrous of you, but I prefer to...

238
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,950
Follow instructions! I will not have
you tumbling out of our windows.

239
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,578
I hope this is not a sample
of what we may expect from you

240
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,872
in the way of simplifying
the work of looking after Helen.

241
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,459
I'm perfectly able to go down a ladder
under my own steam.

242
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,171
I doubt it. Simply hold onto my neck.

243
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,135
My neck, Miss Sullivan!

244
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,222
-I'm sorry to inconvenience you.
-No inconvenience.

245
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,225
I'll have that door taken down,
the lock replaced

246
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,227
in case we can't find that key.

247
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,271
-I'll look everywhere.
-Thank you.

248
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,149
Do not look in any rooms
that can be locked.

249
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,109
There!

250
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,989
Go! What are you lookin' at here?
Nothing here for you to look at!

251
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:25,745
Now, would it be possible for us
to have dinner like other people?

252
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,874
Viney, serve dinner.
I'll put the baby to sleep.

253
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:38,591
You might as well leave the L-A-D-D-E-R.

254
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,964
You devil.

255
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,228
You think I am so easily gotten rid of?

256
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,565
You've got a thing or two to learn first.

257
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:39,694
I've got nothing else to do
and nowhere to go.

258
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,830
Discipline her

259
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,710
without breaking...

260
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,768
Ink.

261
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,070
Ink.

262
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,490
It has a name.

263
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,888
Down, under, up.

264
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,973
And be careful of the needle.

265
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,192
Fine. You keep out of the ink,
and perhaps I can keep out the soup.

266
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,495
All right, all right. Let's try temperance.

267
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,841
Bad girl.

268
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,630
Good girl.

269
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,591
Very good girl.

270
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,089
What are you saying to her?

271
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,300
I was just making conversation.

272
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,720
Saying it was a sewing card.

273
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,139
Does that mean that to her?

274
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:41,519
No. She won't spelling is
till she knows what a word is.

275
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,483
The Captain says
it's like spelling to a fence post.

276
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,404
Does he, now?

277
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,072
-Is it?
-No.

278
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,200
It's how I watch you talk to the baby.

279
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,119
-The baby.
-Any baby.

280
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:02,498
It's gibberish. Grown-up gibberish.
Baby-talk gibberish.

281
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,794
Do they understand one word of it to start?

282
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:11,716
Somehow they begin to if they hear it.
I'm letting Helen hear it.

283
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:16,220
Other children are not impaired.

284
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,306
There's nothing impaired in that head.

285
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,392
It works like a mousetrap.

286
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,981
And when will she learn?

287
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,861
Maybe after a million words.

288
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:38,409
Perhaps you'd like to read Dr. Howe
on the question of words.

289
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,547
I should like also

290
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:55,885
to learn those letters, Miss Annie.

291
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,972
I'll teach them to you tomorrow morning.

292
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,391
That makes only a half a million each.

293
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,854
It's her bedtime.

294
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,069
I'm sorry!

295
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,622
Why does she get a reward
for stabbing me?

296
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,959
There are so many times
she simply cannot be compelled.

297
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,716
I'm the same way myself.

298
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,637
Good night.

299
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,254
No, but shouldn't we give
the devil his due, Father?

300
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:17,633
We lost the South two years earlier
when he outthought us behind Vicksburg.

301
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,969
Outthought is a peculiar word
for a butcher.

302
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,429
-Harness maker, wasn't he?
-I said butcher.

303
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,640
His only strength as a soldier was numbers.

304
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,059
Led them to slaughter with no more regard
than for so many sheep.

305
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,145
But even if in that sense he was a butcher...

306
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,147
And a drunk, half the war.

307
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,732
Agreed, Father.
If his own people said he was...

308
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,027
What is it you find
to admire in such a man?

309
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,947
-The drunkenness or the butchery?
-Neither, Father.

310
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,324
-Only the fact that he beat us.
-He didn't!

311
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:46,120
-Is it your contention we won the war?
-He didn't beat us at Vicksburg!

312
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,664
We lost Vicksburg by stupidity
verging on treason.

313
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:53,502
We lost Vicksburg because Grant was one
thing no Yankee general was before him.

314
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,713
-Drunk? I doubt it!
-Obstinate.

315
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,508
Obstinate! Could any of them
compare to old Stonewall?

316
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,635
He'd been there, we'd still have Vicksburg.

317
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,097
The butcher wouldn't give up. He tried
four ways of getting around Vicksburg.

318
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,349
He wouldn't have got around
if we'd had a Southerner in command

319
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,519
instead of a half-breed Yankee
traitor like Pemberton!

320
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,980
If only we didn't have...
What's the matter there?

321
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:17,067
She's accustomed
to helping herself from our plates.

322
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,197
-I'm not accustomed to it.
-Of course not. Viney!

323
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,366
-Give her something to quiet her.
-Her table manners are the best she has.

324
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:28,162
Let her this time. It's the only way
we get any adult conversation.

325
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,915
-I'll get you another plate.
-I have a plate, thank you.

326
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,293
Viney!
I'm afraid what Captain Keller says is true.

327
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,421
-She'll persist in this till...
-Nothing's wrong with the plate.

328
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,673
-I intend to keep it.
-You see why they took Vicksburg?

329
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,510
One plate or another is hardly a matter
to struggle with a deprived child about.

330
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,471
I'd sooner have a more heroic issue myself.

331
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,349
I really must insist that you...
Now she's hurt herself.

332
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,518
-No, she hasn't.
-Will you please let her hands go?

333
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,270
You don't know the child well enough.

334
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,273
I know an ordinary tantrum well enough
when I see one and a badly spoiled child.

335
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,650
Here, here.

336
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,611
You'd have more understanding
of your pupil if you had some pity in you.

337
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,323
Pity! For this tyrant?
The whole house turns on her whims.

338
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,660
Is there anything she wants
she doesn't get? I'll tell you what I pity.

339
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,662
That the sun won't rise and set for her
all her life,

340
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,247
and every day you're telling her it will!

341
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,874
What good will your pity do
when you're under the strawberries?

342
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:18,128
-For the love of heaven, will you...
-I don't think it serves to lose our...

343
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,882
It's less trouble to feel sorry for her
than it is to teach her anything.

344
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,761
-You haven't taught her anything yet.
-I'll begin if you'll leave the room.

345
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,388
-Leave?
-Everyone, please.

346
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,306
You're here as a paid teacher,
nothing more.

347
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,185
I can't un-teach her six years of pity
if you can't stand up to one tantrum.

348
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,728
Old Stonewall, indeed!

349
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,232
-Mrs. Keller, you promised me help.
-Indeed, I...

350
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,819
-Then leave me alone with her now!
-Katie, come outside at once, please!

351
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,196
-Heaven's sakes!
-Out, please.

352
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,368
If it takes all summer, General!

353
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,331
I've got a half-mind to ship her back
to Boston before the week is out.

354
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,250
-You can inform her so for me.
-Aye, Captain.

355
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,003
She's a hireling. Unless there's an apology

356
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,922
and complete change of manner,
she goes back on the next train.

357
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,341
-Will you make that quite clear?
-Where will you be

358
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,052
while I am making it quite clear?

359
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,929
At the office.

360
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:19,690
Will you? I thought what she said
was exceptionally intelligent.

361
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,193
-I've been saying it for years.
-To his face?

362
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,657
Or will you take it, Jimmy, as a flag?

363
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,278
Good girl.

364
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,464
I don't see how you can wait
out here a minute longer, Kate.

365
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,425
This could go on all afternoon too.

366
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,054
I'll tell the Captain you called.

367
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:23,149
Give me her, Miss Kate.
I'll sneak her in back to her crib.

368
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,573
-This child never gives me any worry.
-Oh, yes.

369
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:33,118
This one's the angel of the family.
No question about that.

370
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:47,007
-What happened?
-She ate from her own plate.

371
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:51,928
She ate with a spoon, herself.
And she folded her napkin.

372
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,141
Folded her napkin?

373
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,312
The room's a wreck,
but her napkin is folded.

374
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,899
I'll be in my room, Mrs. Keller.

375
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,360
Don't be long, Miss Annie.
Dinner'll be ready right away.

376
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,797
Folded her napkin.

377
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,678
My Helen folded her napkin.

378
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,557
There is too! There is too!

379
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,268
-There is not!
-There is too!

380
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,647
What kind of lies
are you tellin' the ignorant girl?

381
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,941
There's a school that teaches blind
that's worse than her!

382
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,193
To what? See with her nose?

383
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:34,447
-To read and write!
-How can they if they can't see?

384
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,783
You crazy old loon!

385
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,418
You're not going to school, are ya, Annie?

386
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,045
-When I grow up.
-You ain't either, Annie.

387
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,132
You're going to stay here, take care of me.

388
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,009
I'm going to school when I grow up.

389
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,679
You said we'd be together
forever and ever and ever.

390
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,932
I'm going to school when I grow up!
Now leave me be!

391
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,953
"Can nothing be done
to disinter this human soul?

392
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,879
"A whole neighborhood
would rush to save this woman

393
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,049
"if she were buried alive
by the caving in of a pit

394
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:40,055
"and labor with zeal until she were dug out.

395
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:44,142
"Now, if there were one
who had as much patience as zeal,

396
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,395
"he might awaken her."

397
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,408
-They're all here.
-Talk to them.

398
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,702
-You can get out.
-Talk to them.

399
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,789
They're the ones.
All the investigators is here.

400
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,042
-That's Mr. Sanborn.
-He's the commissioner, honey.

401
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,669
-Talk to him.
-You might get out.

402
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,299
Mr. Sanborn, I want to go to school.

403
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:29,187
"Might awaken her to a consciousness
of her immortal nature.

404
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,148
"The chance is small indeed.

405
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,776
"But with a smaller chance,
they would've dug desperately

406
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,778
"for her in the pit.

407
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,866
"Is the life of the soul less important
than that of the body?"

408
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,805
Let alone the person
who's to pay for the broken dishware.

409
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,850
From the moment she stepped off the train,
she's been nothing but a burden.

410
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:52,937
Incompetent, impertinent,
ineffectual, immodest and...

411
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,274
-She folded her napkin, Captain.
-She what?

412
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,403
Not ineffectual. Helen did fold her napkin.

413
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,657
What in heaven's name is so extraordinary
about folding a napkin?

414
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,535
It's more than you did, Captain.

415
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:12,665
Today she scuttled any chance she had
of getting along with the child.

416
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,127
If you can see any point or purpose
in her staying on, it's more than I can.

417
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,588
-What do you wish me to do?
-I want you to give her notice.

418
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,634
I can't.

419
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,053
Then if you won't, I must.

420
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,080
-Miss Sullivan.
-Captain Keller.

421
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,040
I thought we should have a talk.

422
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:57,377
Yes, I... Well, come in.

423
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:02,131
Miss Sullivan, I've decided...
I've decided I'm not satisfied.

424
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,592
-In fact, am deeply dissatisfied.
-Excuse me?

425
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,469
Is that house by the bridge ever used?

426
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,012
In hunting season.

427
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,808
If you give me your attention,
Miss Sullivan.

428
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,562
I've tried to make allowances because
you come from a part of the country

429
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,273
where people...

430
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,151
Women, I should say, come from,

431
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,529
for whom allowances must be made.

432
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,031
I have decided nevertheless...

433
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,205
I find it difficult
to talk through those glasses.

434
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,918
Why do you wear them?

435
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,879
Sun's been down for an hour.

436
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,716
Any kind of light hurts my eyes.

437
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,805
Put them on, Miss Sullivan.

438
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,559
I've decided

439
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,479
to give you another chance.

440
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,733
-To do what?
-To remain in our employ.

441
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,569
But on two conditions.
I'm not accustomed to rudeness.

442
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,322
If you want to stay,
there must be a radical change of manner.

443
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:10,074
-Whose?
-Yours, young lady. Isn't it obvious?

444
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,161
You must persuade me that the slightest
hope of your teaching a child

445
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:16,456
who flees from you like the plague
to anyone she can find.

446
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,375
There isn't. It's hopeless here.

447
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,171
-Do I understand...
-If we agree it's hopeless...

448
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:26,090
Miss Annie, I'm not agreed.

449
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,427
She did fold her napkin.

450
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,095
She learns.

451
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,264
She learns!

452
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:37,685
Do you know she began talking
when she was six months old?

453
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,521
She could say "water."

454
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,691
But not really. "Wa-wa."

455
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,033
But she meant "water."

456
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,827
She knew what it meant,
and at only six months old.

457
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,455
I never saw a child so bright or outgoing.

458
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,506
It's still in her somewhere.

459
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,809
Please, Annie, put up with her, and with us.

460
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,310
Us?

461
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,647
Please?

462
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,818
Like the lost lamb in the parable,

463
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,778
I love her all the more.

464
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,491
Mrs. Keller.

465
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:37,286
I don't think Helen's worst handicap
is deafness or blindness.

466
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,830
I think it's your love.

467
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,582
And pity.

468
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,461
You're so sorry for her,
you've kept her like a pet.

469
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,463
Even a dog you housebreak.

470
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,345
It's useless for me to try to teach her
language or anything else here.

471
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,973
Miss Annie,

472
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:01,436
before you came, we spoke
of putting her in an asylum.

473
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:05,022
What kind of asylum?

474
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,777
For mental defectives.

475
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,826
I visited there. I can't tell you what I saw.

476
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,329
People like animals with

477
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,833
rats in the halls, and...

478
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,296
What else have we to do if you give up?

479
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,299
Give up?

480
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,636
-You said it was hopeless.
-Here.

481
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:39,348
Give up. Why I only today
saw what was to be done to begin.

482
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,269
-I want complete charge of her.
-You already have that.

483
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,854
No, I mean day and night.

484
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,107
-She has to be dependent on me.
-For what?

485
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,609
Everything.

486
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,946
The food she eats,
the clothes she wears, fresh air.

487
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,325
Yes, the air she breathes.

488
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,995
Whatever her body needs is a primer
to teach her out of.

489
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,705
It's the only way.

490
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,666
The one who lets her have it should be
her teacher, not anyone who loves her.

491
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,461
-But if she runs from you to us...
-Yes.

492
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,506
That's the point.

493
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,133
I'll have to live with her somewhere else.

494
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,054
For how long?

495
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,765
Until she learns to listen to
and depend on me.

496
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,476
-I packed half my things already.
-Miss Sullivan...

497
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,269
It meets your conditions.

498
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,855
It's the one way
I can get back in touch with Helen.

499
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,608
I don't see how I can be rude to you
if you're not around to interfere.

500
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,485
And what is your intention if I say no?

501
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,197
Pack the other half for home
and abandon your charge to...

502
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,198
The asylum?

503
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:41,077
I grew up in such an asylum.
The State Almshouse.

504
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:45,623
My brother Jimmy and I used to play
with the rats because we didn't have toys.

505
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,504
Maybe you'd like to know what Helen
will find there not on visiting days.

506
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,550
One ward was full of the old women,
crippled, blind, most of them dying,

507
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,135
but even if what they had was catching,
there was nowhere to move them.

508
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,137
That's where they put us.

509
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,848
There were other ones across the hall,
prostitutes mostly,

510
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,725
with TB and epileptic fits

511
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,645
and a couple of the kind
who keep after other girls,

512
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,855
especially young ones.

513
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,568
And some insane. Some just had the DTs.

514
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,237
The youngest were in another ward
to have babies they didn't want.

515
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,114
They started at 13, 14.

516
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,992
They'd leave afterwards, but the babies
stayed, and we played with them too.

517
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,036
A lot of them had sores all over
from diseases you weren't to mention.

518
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,330
Not many lived.

519
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,001
The first year we had 80. 70 died.

520
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:34,005
The room where Jimmy and I played was
where they kept bodies before burial.

521
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,841
No. It made me strong.

522
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,182
But I don't think
you need to send Helen there.

523
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,642
She's strong enough.

524
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,228
Miss Annie.

525
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,945
Where would you take Helen?

526
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,453
-Italy.
-What?

527
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:11,167
You can't have everything.
How would your little house do?

528
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:17,256
Furnish it. Bring Helen there after a ride
so she wouldn't recognize it.

529
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,134
And you can see her every day
if she doesn't know.

530
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:24,639
Well?

531
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,351
-Is that all?
-That's all.

532
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,354
Captain, with your permission...

533
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,692
That boy Percy could sleep there,
run errands.

534
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,944
We could let Percy sleep there
I think, Captain.

535
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:42,323
-And move in some furniture.
-That bedstead in the barn...

536
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,700
I've not yet consented to Percy
or to the house

537
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,578
or to the proposal
or to Miss Sullivan staying on here!

538
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,080
When I...

539
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,584
Very well.
I consent to everything, for two weeks.

540
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,336
I'll give you two weeks in that place.

541
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,881
And it'll be a miracle
if you can get that child to tolerate you.

542
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,341
Two weeks.

543
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,802
Miss Annie, can you accomplish
anything in two weeks?

544
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:06,430
Anything or not, two weeks
and the child comes back to us.

545
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,975
Make up your mind, Miss Sullivan.
Yes or no?

546
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,062
Two weeks.

547
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,567
I'll get her to tolerate me.

548
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,371
A. It's the first of many.

549
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,500
Twenty-six.

550
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,264
-Does she know where she is?
-No.

551
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:33,058
For all she knows,
she could be in another town.

552
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:55,915
-That's a sign for me.
-Yes, I know. In two weeks.

553
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:59,168
Miss Annie, I... Please be good to her.

554
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,046
These two weeks,
try to be very good to her.

555
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,214
I will.

556
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,746
Two weeks.

557
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,126
What did I get into now?

558
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,319
Jimmy!

559
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,570
Yes?

560
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,381
You called me?

561
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,562
-What are you doing here?
-Taking a turn around. Everything okay?

562
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,693
Just a dream?

563
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,116
How old was he? The other Jimmy?

564
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,577
Helen's age.

565
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,290
How did he die?

566
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,417
He had a tubercular hip.

567
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,087
Oh, we were a pair, all right.

568
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,841
Me blind and him on a crutch.

569
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:18,135
When did he die?

570
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,765
Eleven years ago this May.

571
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,770
-You've had no one to dream of since?
-No, one's enough.

572
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,690
You don't let go of things easily, do you?

573
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,904
You'd be quite a handsome girl
if it weren't for your eyes.

574
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,199
-No one's told you?
-Everyone.

575
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,744
You'd be quite a gentlemen
if it wasn't for your manners.

576
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:49,083
You wouldn't say that to me
if you didn't have your glasses on.

577
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:56,590
How will you win her hand now,
in this place?

578
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,176
I lost my temper, and here we are.

579
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:04,014
I'm counting on her.
That little head is dying to know.

580
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,225
-Know what?
-Anything.

581
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:10,604
Every crumb in God's creation.
I'll have to use that appetite too.

582
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,148
-Maybe she'll teach you.
-Of course.

583
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,441
That she isn't.

584
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,654
That there's such a thing
as dullness of heart.

585
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,989
Acceptance and letting go.

586
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,451
Sooner or later we all give up, don't we?

587
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,495
Maybe you all do.

588
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,164
It's my idea of the original sin.

589
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,457
-What is?
-Giving up!

590
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,584
You won't open her.

591
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,880
Why can't you let her be and have
some pity on her for being what she is?

592
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,385
If I ever once thought like that, I'd be dead.

593
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,887
You will be.

594
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,014
Why trouble?

595
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,767
Or will you teach me?

596
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,711
No pity. I won't have it.

597
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,174
On either of us.

598
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,597
I will touch you.

599
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,642
But how?

600
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,270
How do I?

601
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:40,277
Percy, get up. Get out of bed
and come in here. I need you.

602
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,496
Percy, you awake?

603
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,789
No.

604
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:57,377
How would you like to play
a nice game with Helen?

605
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,553
Touch her hand.

606
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,943
Let me go! Let me go!

607
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,324
She's trying to talk. She's gonna hit me.

608
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,953
She can talk. If she only knew.

609
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,830
I'll show you how she makes letters.

610
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,083
C.

611
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,843
She's mad at me. She won't play.
But she knows lots of letters.

612
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,179
This is A.

613
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,473
C.

614
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,352
A.

615
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,654
C.

616
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:19,418
C-A-K-E.

617
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:22,170
She spells "cake," she gets cake.

618
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,923
She doesn't know yet it means this.
Isn't that funny?

619
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,176
She knows how to spell it,
but doesn't know she knows.

620
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,639
All right.

621
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,392
If she won't play it with me,
I'll play it with you.

622
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,519
-Would you like to learn a new word?
-No!

623
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,772
M-I-L-K.

624
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,450
M.

625
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,664
I. That's an easy one. Just the little finger.

626
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:27,194
Oh, why should I talk to you?
I'm teaching a new word to Percy.

627
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:45,170
You're jealous, are you?

628
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:49,466
All right.

629
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,250
Good.

630
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,170
So I'm finally back
to where I can touch you.

631
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,798
Touch and go.

632
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,884
Well, no love lost,

633
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,803
but here we go.

634
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:56,199
You can go to bed now.
You've earned your sleep.

635
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,744
Thank you.

636
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,210
Now all I have to teach you is

637
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,255
one word,

638
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,635
everything.

639
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,704
Hush, little baby. Don't say a word.

640
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:27,624
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

641
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:37,133
If that mockingbird don't sing

642
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:42,013
Mama's gonna buy you

643
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,433
A diamond ring

644
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:52,607
If that diamond ring

645
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,360
Turns brass

646
01:16:56,696 --> 01:17:00,115
Mama's gonna buy you

647
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:04,035
A looking glass

648
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:11,376
If that looking glass

649
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:15,255
Gets broke

650
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,675
Mama's gonna buy you

651
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:22,762
A billy goat

652
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:29,519
If that billy goat

653
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,384
On my way to the office.
Thought I'd look in on your progress.

654
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,552
She's tolerating me and I'm tolerating her.

655
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,598
-What's wrong?
-A difference of opinion.

656
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:51,226
I think she should dress herself.
She thinks she shouldn't.

657
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,186
-This her breakfast?
-Yes.

658
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,606
-She wouldn't eat?
-She'd love to eat it.

659
01:18:56,607 --> 01:19:00,694
-It's almost 10:00. Why not feed her?
-She knows I will when she dresses.

660
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:04,072
-She's thinking it over.
-You intend to starve her into obeying?

661
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,533
She won't starve. She'll learn.

662
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:09,119
All's fair in love and war.
You've never cut supplies?

663
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,080
-This is hardly a war.
-Well, it's not love.

664
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,165
A siege is a siege.

665
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,127
Miss Sullivan, do you like the child?

666
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,421
Do you?

667
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:35,937
I'm beginning to.

668
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,032
Beads.

669
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,910
Has a name.

670
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,832
Tree. It has a name.

671
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,380
Tree.

672
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:07,594
Bird. It has a name. Yes.

673
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,763
No!

674
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,477
W-A-T-E-R.

675
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,895
Water.

676
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:55,016
W-A-T-E-R.

677
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,601
Water.

678
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,225
"Disinter..."

679
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,894
"Disinterested."

680
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,025
Where's "discipline"?

681
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:50,405
What a dictionary. You have to know
how to spell it before you can look it up.

682
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,575
"Disinter."

683
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,703
"Disciple."

684
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:00,957
"Discipline."

685
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,759
You're not to overwork your eyes.

686
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,929
Whatever I spell to Helen
I'd better spell right.

687
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,245
You've taught her so much this week.

688
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,372
Not enough. Obedience isn't enough.

689
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,836
Well, she learned two nouns
this morning, "key" and "water."

690
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:48,963
-But not...
-No.

691
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,507
Not that they mean things.
It's still a finger game to her.

692
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:55,011
No meaning. But she will.

693
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:03,269
Might I...
Might I take her for one walk this evening?

694
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:09,776
Shall we play our finger game?

695
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:13,613
-Next week seems so...
-Spell it.

696
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,740
-So far off.
-Spell it.

697
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,869
If she ever learns, you'll have a lot
to tell each other. Start now.

698
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,839
Yes, crochet.

699
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,175
C-R-O-S-H...

700
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,347
C-R-O-S...

701
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,770
Sewing.

702
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:51,734
It has a name, and sewing isn't it.

703
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,573
E-G-G.

704
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:02,912
Egg.

705
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:08,418
It has a name.
The name stands for the thing.

706
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:11,838
Oh, it's so simple.

707
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,717
Simple as birth to explain.

708
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:21,431
Helen, the chick has to
come out of its shell sometime.

709
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:33,526
You come out too.

710
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,601
Thimble.

711
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,523
No, not cake. Thimble.

712
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,276
T-R-E-E.

713
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,988
W-A-T...

714
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,826
M-I-L...

715
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:26,537
Good girl.

716
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,958
D-O-L-L.

717
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:49,644
"And every day more and more inadequate.

718
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:52,313
"My letters must show that...

719
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,608
"I need a teacher as much as Helen."

720
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,570
I need help too.

721
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:06,494
Who?

722
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:11,707
In all the world there isn't a soul
who can tell me how to reach you.

723
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,256
How do I reach you?

724
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,717
Doesn't she need affection too?

725
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,721
She never shows me she needs it.

726
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:29,559
-She won't have any caressing.
-What would another week accomplish?

727
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,310
We are more than satisfied.

728
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:35,314
You taught her things to do, to behave.
So manageable.

729
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,066
-Cleaner.
-Cleaner?

730
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:39,485
Well, we say cleanliness
is next to Godliness.

731
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,279
It's next to nothing.

732
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,699
Give me more time alone with her.

733
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,658
Look.

734
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,620
What is she spelling?

735
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,082
Water?

736
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:55,835
Teaching a dog to spell?

737
01:26:56,086 --> 01:27:00,423
The dog doesn't know what she means
any more than she knows what you mean.

738
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:02,967
I think you ask too much from her
and yourself.

739
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:07,305
God may have not meant
Helen to have the eyes you speak of.

740
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:10,266
I mean her to.

741
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,393
What is it to you?

742
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:23,029
-Half a week.
-An agreement is an agreement.

743
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,906
Mrs. Keller...

744
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,867
I want her back.

745
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,456
I'll send Viney over to help you pack.

746
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,043
Not until 6:00. I have her until 6:00.

747
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,839
6:00.

748
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:43,674
Come, Katie.

749
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,726
Yes, what is it to me? They're satisfied.

750
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,605
Give them back their child
and their dog, both housebroken.

751
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,523
Everyone's satisfied but me.

752
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,568
And you.

753
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,120
Reach.

754
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,998
I wanted to teach you

755
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,461
everything the earth is full of, Helen,

756
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:23,839
everything that's on it is ours for a wink,
and it's gone.

757
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:27,385
And what we are on it.

758
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,096
A light we bring to it
and leave behind in words.

759
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:34,976
You can see 5,000 years back
in the light of words.

760
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,187
Everything we feel,

761
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,648
think,

762
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:43,025
know and share in words,

763
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:49,073
so not a soul is in darkness
or done with even in the grave.

764
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,536
I know.

765
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:59,834
I know, one word
and I can put the world in your hand.

766
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:03,713
And whatever it is to me, I won't take less.

767
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,382
How?

768
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,719
How do I tell you that

769
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:15,099
this means a word

770
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,728
and the word means this thing, wool.

771
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:21,564
Or this?

772
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,527
This. W-O-O-L

773
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,654
means this thing.

774
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,992
Dress.

775
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,120
F-A-C-E! Face!

776
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:52,303
M-O-T-H-E-R.

777
01:29:56,141 --> 01:30:00,102
M-O-T-H-E-R.

778
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,979
Mother.

779
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,731
Let her come.

780
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,217
Come in.

781
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,513
Miss Annie, your first month's salary.

782
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,016
With many more to come, I trust.

783
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,643
It doesn't repay our debt
for what you've done.

784
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:09,398
I taught her one thing,
"No. Don't do this, don't do that..."

785
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,025
That's more than we could do...

786
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,486
I wanted to teach her what language is.

787
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,238
I know that without it,
to do nothing but obey is no gift.

788
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:19,200
Obedience without understanding
is a blindness too.

789
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,494
Is that all I wished on her?

790
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:22,745
No.

791
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:25,831
I don't know what else to do.

792
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:30,419
Simply keep doing what I've done
and have faith that inside she's...

793
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:32,630
That inside it's waiting?

794
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:35,508
Like water underground.

795
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,593
You can help.

796
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,261
How?

797
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,348
The world is not an easy place for anyone.

798
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:44,975
I don't want her just to obey,

799
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:49,230
but to let her have her way
in everything is a lie, to her.

800
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:55,569
And I don't even love her.

801
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,325
She's not my child.

802
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:13,128
You've got to stand
between that lie and her.

803
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:15,965
Agreed.

804
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,219
Won't you come now to supper?

805
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,140
Yes.

806
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:31,272
I used to wonder how I could earn a living.

807
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,691
Oh, you do.

808
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,111
I really do.

809
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:40,155
Now the question is, can I survive it?

810
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:14,523
Keys.

811
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,984
Yes, I'll keep the keys.

812
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:20,404
I think we've had enough
of locked doors too.

813
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,335
Will you say the grace, Jimmy?

814
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:39,757
And Jacob was left alone
and wrestled with an angel

815
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,467
till the breaking of the day.

816
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:45,220
And the hollow of Jacob's thigh
was out of joint as he wrestled with him.

817
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:48,557
And the angel said,
"Let me go, for the day breaketh."

818
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:52,770
And Jacob said, "I will not let thee go,
except thou bless me." Amen.

819
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,272
Oh, you angel.

820
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:58,108
That's a very strange grace, James.

821
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,361
It's from the Good Book, isn't it?

822
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,488
Of course it is. Didn't you know?

823
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:05,032
-Yes, I knew.
-Then why ask?

824
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,826
I meant it is from the Good Book,
and therefore a fitting grace.

825
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,162
Well, I don't know about that.

826
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:13,540
There's an awful lot of things in the
Good Book that I don't want to hear

827
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,668
just before eating.

828
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:18,420
Fitting in the sense that
Jacob's thigh was out of joint,

829
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,089
and so is this piggy.

830
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,800
-James, I declare.
-Pickles, Aunt Ev?

831
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:25,678
I should say so.
You know my opinion of your pickles.

832
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,431
This is the end of them.
I didn't put up nearly enough last summer.

833
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,891
This year I intend to.

834
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:34,603
Reverend looked into the office today to
complain his hens have stopped laying.

835
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:37,481
Poor fellow. He was out of joint. All he...

836
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,234
-I've always suspected those hens.
-Why?

837
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:41,860
I think they're Papists.

838
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:46,240
Please.
Now you're pulling my lower extremity.

839
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:50,869
The first thing you know,
we'll be having another one of our...

840
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,921
-It's a very special day.
-It will be, when I give into that.

841
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:03,215
Please, I've hardly had a chance
to welcome her home.

842
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:05,884
-Captain Keller.
-Katie, we had a little talk.

843
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:08,846
-She feels we indulge Helen...
-It's only a napkin.

844
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:11,765
-It's nothing breakable.
-And everything she's learned is.

845
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:17,354
Mrs. Keller, I don't think
we ought to play tug-of-war for her.

846
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,356
Give her to me or keep her from kicking.

847
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,360
-What do you wish to do?
-Let me take her from the table.

848
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,863
Oh, let her stay.
My goodness, she's only a child.

849
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:28,907
-And ask outsiders not to interfere.
-Outsiders?

850
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,576
I'm her aunt.

851
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:34,288
Will this once hurt so much, Miss Annie? I...

852
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,999
I've made
all of Helen's favorite foods tonight.

853
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:40,419
It's a homecoming party, Miss Annie.

854
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,804
-She's testing you, you realize.
-She's testing you.

855
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,766
Jimmy, be quiet.
Now she's home, naturally she...

856
01:36:53,767 --> 01:36:56,560
She wants to see what'll happen
at your hands.

857
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,354
-I said it was my main worry.
-She's not kicking now.

858
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,482
And not learning not to.

859
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,986
She'll live up to just what
you demand of her, and no more.

860
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:08,322
She's testing you! I have an opinion!

861
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:11,283
-No one's interested in hearing it.
-I'm interested.

862
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:13,702
Of course she's testing me.

863
01:37:14,037 --> 01:37:17,581
Let me keep her to what she's learned
and she'll go on learning from me.

864
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:19,875
Take her out of my hands,
and it all comes apart.

865
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,966
Be bountiful. It's at her expense.

866
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:33,972
Please pass me more of her favorite foods.

867
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,194
Take her.

868
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,696
Thank you.

869
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,616
I'm afraid you're the difficulty, Miss Annie.

870
01:37:52,826 --> 01:37:55,994
I'll keep her to what she's learned.
You're quite right here.

871
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:58,372
I don't see that we need
to send her from the table.

872
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:01,667
After all, you're the guest of honor.
Bring her plate back.

873
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:06,296
-If she was a seeing child, you...
-But she's not.

874
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:11,134
I think some compromise is called for.
Bring her plate.

875
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:13,804
Please!

876
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:23,564
Occasionally, another hand
can smooth things out.

877
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,275
There.

878
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:28,527
Now, should we start all over?

879
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:34,950
I think we should start over...

880
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:40,205
Don't smooth anything else out for me.

881
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,165
Don't interfere in any way!

882
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,877
I treat her like a seeing child
because I ask her to see.

883
01:38:44,878 --> 01:38:48,088
I expect her to see! Don't undo what I do!

884
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,257
-Where are you taking her?
-To make her fill this pitcher again.

885
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:53,552
You let her speak to you like that?
A creature who works for you?

886
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:54,887
No, I don't!

887
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:58,015
-Let her go.
-What?

888
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:00,475
I said, let her go! She's right.

889
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:03,103
She's right. Kate's right...

890
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:05,022
I'm right and you're wrong.

891
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:07,858
Has it never occurred to you
that on one occasion

892
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,902
you might be consummately wrong?

893
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,411
All right.

894
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,787
Pump.

895
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,832
No, she's not here. Pump.

896
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,505
W-A-T-E-R. Water.

897
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:33,175
It has a name. W-A-T...

898
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,027
Yes.

899
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,594
Oh, my dear.

900
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,562
Ground.

901
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:21,825
Pump.

902
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:33,420
Tree.

903
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,301
Step.

904
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:42,637
Mrs. Keller! Mrs. Keller!

905
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:57,069
Mama. Papa. She knows!

906
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:30,602
Teacher.

907
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:47,369
Teacher.

908
01:43:27,827 --> 01:43:29,411
Teacher.

909
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:22,399
I...

910
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,610
...love...

911
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,574
Helen.
