(woman) He looks great.
That Al Conti is a genius.

I am a genius.

38
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,974
I am a genius!

39
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,227
So, how come you can't
keep track of your receipts?

40
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,064
How am I supposed to do your income
tax with this mess you've got here?

00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,985
Numbers, taxes, receipts...

42
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,113
I make 'em look better
than they did in real life.

43
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,241
I'm an artistic genius.

44
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,952
Then, how come
you've got butter on your tie?

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,789
- (grunts)
- Give it here!

46
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,125
You know what? I give you this.

47
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,252
You make good coffee.

48
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,214
You're a slob, but you make good coffee.

49
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,674
(man #2) Ah, red roses.

50
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,303
Very romantic, huh?

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:47,267
Ah, the guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

52
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,478
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money...

53
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,189
...on something that ends up as garbage.

54
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,608
I'm glad everybody ain't like you,
Loretta.

55
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,151
I'd be out of business.

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,487
What are you talking? I love flowers.

57
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,750
Thanks, Carmine.

58
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,591
Are you ready?

59
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,843
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

60
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,303
Very good, Mr. Johnny.

61
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,431
We will both have the Ticino salad.

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,268
And I'll have special fish.

63
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,646
No, it's oily fish tonight.
Not before the plane ride.

64
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,022
Maybe you're right.

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,818
OK, we'll have the manicotti, Bobo.

66
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,028
That'll give you a base
for your stomach.

67
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,322
You eat oily fish,
you go up in the air...

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,701
Halfway to Sicily,
you'll be green and sweating.

69
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,910
You look after me.

70
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,046
You'll ruin the evening...
Patricia, please, don't leave.

71
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,257
Do you think I'm a talking doll?!

72
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,428
I was just making a point about
the way you stated your aspirations...

73
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,014
You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

74
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,975
Kiss my aspirations? Very clever.

75
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,561
The height of cleverness!

76
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,730
(laughter)

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,399
Waiter.

78
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,777
Yes?

79
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,822
Would you do away
with any evidence of her...

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,324
...and bring me a big glass of vodka?

81
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,242
But absolutely.

82
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,624
A man who can't control his woman...
is funny.

83
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,627
- (giggles)
- She was too young for him.

84
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,213
What's up, Uncle Bobo?

85
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,924
Tonight Mr. Johnny's
gonna propose marriage.

86
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,385
- How do you know?
- He arranged it with me.

87
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,429
When he asks, he's gonna wave...

88
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,890
...and then I serve the champagne.

89
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,892
(sighs)

90
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,062
A good bachelor customer for 20 years.

91
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,191
Mille grazie.

92
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,494
- How's things, hey?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

93
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,829
No, no. I uh...

94
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,582
I wanna see the dessert cart.

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,708
Very good.

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,462
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

97
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,769
What's the matter with you?

98
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,107
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

99
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,402
- Have some dessert.
- No, I shouldn't.

100
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,196
- Will you marry me?
- What?

101
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,283
Will you marry me?

102
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,786
Bobo, take the cart away.

103
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,038
Very good, Miss Loretta.

104
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,041
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

105
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,921
All right. You know I was married
and that my husband died.

106
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,966
What you don't know is
I think he and I had bad luck.

107
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,136
- What do you mean?
- We got married at the City Hall.

108
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,264
- It gave bad luck the whole marriage.
- I don't understand.

109
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,185
Right from the start, we didn't do it
right. Could you kneel down?

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,605
- On the floor?
- Yeah, on the floor.

111
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,691
- This is a good suit!
- I know!

112
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,444
I helped you pick it out.
It had two pairs of pants!

113
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,365
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

114
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,590
She's got him on his knees!
He's ruining his suit.

115
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,721
Is that man praying?

116
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,266
- So...
- Where's the ring?

117
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,897
- The ring!
- A ring, that's right.

118
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,900
I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me, capisce?

119
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,280
- You could use your pinky ring.
- I like this ring!

120
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,700
You propose marriage to a woman, you
should offer her a ring of engagement.

121
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,462
Loretta...

122
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,840
Loretta Castorini Clark...

123
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,304
...on my knees,
in front of all of these people...

124
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,681
...will you marry me?

125
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,433
Yes, Johnny.

126
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:43,271
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri,
I will marry you. I will be your wife.

127
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,033
(cheering)

128
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,702
Salute, paesano!

129
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,624
Bobo!

130
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,002
- The check!
- Right away, Mr. Johnny.

131
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,808
What about the wedding?

132
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,437
My mother is dying.

133
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,984
When she's dead, I'll come back
and we'll get married.

134
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,277
How near death is she?

135
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,238
A week.

136
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,031
Two weeks... No more.

137
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,075
How about we set a date? A month?

138
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:42,664
Must it be so definite? Can't we just
say we'll be married when I get back?

139
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,416
Where? The City Hall? No.

140
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,460
My mother is dying.

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,754
I want a whole wedding,
or we'll have bad luck.

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,716
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

143
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,468
All right, all right. A month.

144
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,679
- A month from today.
- In a month.

145
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,140
- A month from today.
- Yes, from today.

146
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,976
- OK, OK.
- From today, right.

147
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,438
I'll take care of the whole thing.
All you gotta do is show up.

148
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,691
(car horn)

149
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:15,238
(PA) Departure for Paris,
please proceed to gate No.29.

150
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,576
Come on, andiamo.

151
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,412
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call from Mamma's.

152
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,123
OK. You made me very happy.

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,876
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

154
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,170
I want you to call uh...

155
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,341
Call this number. It's a business
number. You ask for Ronny.

156
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,135
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

157
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,597
- It's my younger brother.
- You've got a brother?

158
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,932
We haven't spoken in five years.

159
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,602
There was some bad blood.

160
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,812
I want you to invite him
to the wedding.

161
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,022
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

162
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,525
(PA) Flight 604 for Rome
with connections to Palermo

163
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,861
is now boarding at gate 43.

164
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,405
I gotta go.

165
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,074
Have you got your ticket?

166
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,122
OK. Here, I got you these.
Gum and cough drops.

167
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,416
Gum opens your ears when you chew.

168
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,834
I gotta go.

169
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,642
(PA) This is the last call
for flight No.604 for Rome...

170
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,233
You have someone on that plane?

171
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,734
Yeah. My fiancé.

172
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,947
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

173
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,240
I put a curse on that plane

174
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:45,203
that it's going to explode,
burn and fall into the sea.

175
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,790
50 years ago, she stole a man from me.

176
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,167
Si ha preso il mio uomo!

177
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,796
Today she tells me
that she never loved him...

178
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,632
...that she took him to be strong on me.

179
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,884
Now she's going back to Sicily.

180
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,011
Si torna in Sicilia.

181
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,933
I cursed her that the green Atlantic
water should swallow her up!

182
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,102
I don't believe in curses.

183
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,730
Neither do I.

184
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,922
- Mr. Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,677
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

186
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,220
The key's in it.

187
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,319
What do you mean?!
I've seen the way you look at her...

188
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,321
...and it isn't right!
- How do I look at her?

189
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,448
- Can I help you?
- A split of Mumm.

190
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,367
- So, how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf!

191
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,372
- Like a wolf, huh?
- Uh-huh. Like a wolf.

192
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,708
You've never seen a wolf in your life.

193
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,418
That's $11.99.

194
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,798
I've seen the wolf
in everybody I ever met...

195
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,383
...and I see a wolf in you.

196
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,093
Mm-hm.

197
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,097
- That makes $20. Have a nice night.
- You, too.

198
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,517
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

199
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,352
The girl I married.

200
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,979

201
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,773

Jo!

Why isn't he here telling me this?

243
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,860
He's flying to Sicily.
His mother's dying.

I don't like his face, Loretta.

When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What does he hide?

246
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,035
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

247
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,329
- I won't come.
- You've gotta give me away.

248
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,207
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

249
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,960
Maybe, if you gave me away

250
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,421
and I got married in a church
in a wedding dress...

251
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,590
...instead of at the City Hall
with strangers at the door...

252
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,427
...maybe I wouldn't have
had the bad luck I had.

253
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,221
Maybe.

254
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,267
Pop, I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

255
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,146
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

256
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,440
- He did?
- Yes.

257
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,109
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well...

258
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,404
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

259
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,115
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.

260
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,576
- It's a man's ring!
- It's temporary!

261
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,537
Everything is temporary!
That excuses nothing.

Yeah.

270
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,903
- Johnny Cammareri.
- I don't like him.

271
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,821
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

272
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,116
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- No.

273
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,829
Good. When you love 'em, they drive
you crazy cos they know they can.

274

- But you like him?
- Oh, yeah.

He's a sweet man, Ma.

276

00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,442
- Johnny!
- Johnny?

347
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,402
Operator?

348
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,364
- Op... Loretta?
- Yeah!

349
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,868
Yes. Sh sh sh! It's me.

350
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,454
I'm calling from the deathbed
of my mother.

351
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,706
Yeah. How was your plane ride?

352
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,210
The waitresses were very nice.

353
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,214
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

354
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,092
Quanto io devo aspettare?

355
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,720
Stai calma, stai calma, mammita!

356
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,224
I can't talk long.

357
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,851
Did you tell her we're getting married?

358
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,437
Oh, no, no. Not yet.

359
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,482
I'm waiting... I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

360
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,692
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

361
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,988
- Have you called my brother?
- No. I'm sorry, no, not yet. I forgot.

362
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,075
- Will you do it today?
- Yes. Yes.

363
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,078
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

364
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,289
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

365
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,709
Nothing can replace the family, Loretta.

366
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,546
I can see that now...

367
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,341
Loretta? Loretta, are you there?

368
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,886
- Loretta!
- OK, I'm sorry. I'll do it today.

369
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,097
And listen, Johnny, you know...

370
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,099
...call me after you tell her, OK?

371
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,976
All right, all right.

372
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,561
And uh...

373
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,939
Don't stand directly under the sun.
Use your hat.

374
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,692
I got my hat, all right, all right.

375
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,818
Bye.

376
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,528
All right, bye-bye.

377
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,614
What did I do with that card?

378
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,243
How's the mother?

379
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,204
She's dying.
But I could still hear her big mouth.

380
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,007
(sobs)

381
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,977
(Johnny wails)

382
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,937
He didn't tell her!

383
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,482
You know, the woman makes him crazy.

384
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,527
Now who are you calling? Uffa!

385
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,863
(phone rings)

386
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,616
Cammareri's.

387
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,827
Yeah, is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

388
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,204
Hold on.

389
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,456
Ronny! The phone!

390
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,583
Ronny!

391
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,168
Yeah, this is Ronny.

392
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,713
Yeah. Um...
I'm calling for your brother.

393
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,175
He's getting married
and would like it if you would come.

394
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,052
Why didn't he call himself?

395
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,388
- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.

396
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,432
Let me just come and talk...

397
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,267
...talk to you!

398
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,437
Animal! What an animal!

399
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,670
Thanks, Mrs. Fugacci.

400
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,171
There you go.

401
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,132
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

402
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,594
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

403
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,472
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

404
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,359
This way.

405
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,866
- Ronny!
- What?

406
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,412
- Somebody here to see Ronny.
- Ronny!

407
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,498
Ronny! Somebody wants to see you!

408
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,104
Have you come from my brother Johnny?

409
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,272
Yeah.

410
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Why?

411
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,359
Well, we're gonna get married.

412
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,241
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny.
- Yeah.

413
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,870
- Shall we go someplace to talk?
- I have no life.

414
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,747
Excuse me?

415
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,206
I have no life.

416
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,792
My brother Johnny took my life from me.

417
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,879
I... I don't understand you.

418
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,465
And now he's getting married.

419
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,675
He has his!

420
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,970
He's getting his.

421
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,139
And he wants me to come.

422
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,059
What is life?

423
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,647
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

424
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,567
And I bake bread... bread... bread!

425
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,071
And I sweat...
and shovel this stinking dough...

426
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,073
...in and out
of this hot hole in the wall...

427
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,160
...and I should be so happy!

428
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,578
Huh, sweetie?

429
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,289
You want me to come
to the wedding of my brother?

430
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,252
Where's my wedding?

431
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,923
Chrissy! Over by the wall!

432
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,299
Bring me the big knife.

433
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,760
- No, Ronny!
- Bring me the big knife!

434
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,512
I'm gonna cut my throat!

435
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,098
Maybe I should come back another time.

436
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,974
No, I want you to see this.

437
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,353
You can watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny...

438
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,356
...on his wedding day. OK?

439
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,316
Chrissy! Bring me the big knife!

440
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,068
I tell ya, I won't do it!

441
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,862
She won't do it.
Do you know about me?

442
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,823
- Oh, Mr. Cammareri...
- What?!

443
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,493
Do you know about me?

444
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,830
OK.

445
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,457
Nothing is anybody's fault.

446
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,669
But... things happen.

447
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,254
Look.

448
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,135
This wood is fake.

449
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,430
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married. And uh...

450
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,056
And Johnny came in here.

451
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,393
And he ordered bread from me.
And I said, "OK, some bread."

452
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,688
And I... I put my hand in the slicer...

453
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,150
...and it got caught
cos I wasn't paying attention.

454
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,153
The slicer chewed off my hand.

455
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,865
And it's funny, cos when
my fiancée found out about it...

456
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,325
When she found out
I had been maimed...

457
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,994
...she left me for another man.

458
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,622
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

459
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,416
Yes, that's it.

460
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,835
Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault.

461
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,591
I don't care!
I ain't no freakin' monument to justice!

462
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,676
I lost my hand!

463
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,595
I lost my bride!

464
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,264
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

465
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,435
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget?!

466
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,532
Is it just a matter of time...

467
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,703
...before a man opens his eyes...

468
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,955
...and gives up his one...

469
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,293
...dream...

470
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,755
...his one dream of happiness?

471
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,845
(Ronny) Maybe.

472
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,181
Maybe.

473
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,663
(Chrissy) This is the most
tormented man I have known.

474
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,957
I'm in love with this man.

475
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,042
But he doesn't know that.

476
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,669
Cos I never told him...

477
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,465
...cos he could never love anybody
since he lost his hand and his girl.

478
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,265
Where do you live?

479
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,936
Upstairs.

480
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,064
Can't we just talk?

481
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,092
What are we painting here?
The Sistine Chapel?

482
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,429
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

483
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,989
Well, Mr. Castorini, what do you think?

484
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,164
$10,800.

485
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,249
That seems like a lot.

486
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,131
Look.

487
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,383
There are three kinds of pipe.

488
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,678
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

489
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,597
And you can see where that's gotten you.

490
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,350
Then there's bronze...
which is very good.

491
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:21,521
Unless something goes wrong.
And something always goes wrong.

492
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,106
And then...

493
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,360
...there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

494
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,819
It costs money.

495
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,949
It costs money because it saves money.

496
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,826
(sighs)

497
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:39,539
I think we should follow
Mr. Castorini's advice, heart.

498
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,803
And then...

499
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,890
...there's copper,
which is the only pipe I use.

500
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,393
It costs money.

501
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,897
It costs money because it saves money.

502
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,482
And what did they say?

503
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,403
Well, uh... the man understood me.

504
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,322
The woman wanted to be cheap.

505
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,950
But the man saw I was right.

506
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,494
You have such a head for knowing.

507
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,413
You know everything.

508
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,255
I've brought you something.

509
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,258
It's a present.

510
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,598
Oh, Cosmo!

511
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,353
Oh, my God!

512
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,024
They're little birds and stars.

513
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,904
Birds fly to the stars, I guess. Huh?

- He knew my husband who died.

526

- A bus hit him.

527

- Instantaneous.

528
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,615

- Yesterday.

529
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,328
So, five years ago, you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

530

- No.

553

I got married when I was 28.

554

I met a man, I loved him, I married him.

555
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,939
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

556
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,483
Then he gets hit by a bus.

557
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,694
So what do I got?
I got no man, no baby, no nothing.

- Yeah.

has no words and uh...

567

That woman was a trap for you.

569

You couldn't get away,
so you chewed off your own foot.

That was the price of your freedom.

571

had to do between you and you.

know the big part of you is a wolf...

That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. OK?

will do if you slip up again.

- Telling you your life.

- No.

He's a fool.

Howl, howl!

- Oh, my God!
- What?

701
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,248
- What?!
- Take it easy.

702
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,376
- This time I wanted to do it right.
- Don't become excited.

703
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,088
I thought if I didn't go to the
City Hall, I wouldn't have bad luck.

704
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,841
- You make me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother!

705
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,926
All right, I'm guilty. I confess.

706
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,387
The wedding's in two weeks.
You're invited.

707
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,473
How come you didn't
be with your mother in Palermo?

708
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,058
She don't like me.

709
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,644
You don't get along with anybody,
do you?

710
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,648
- What did you do?
- What did I do?!

711
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,985
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible.

712
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,155
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

713
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,034
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

714
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,243
Oh, yes, you did.

715
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,706
You've got them bad eyes, like a gypsy.
Why didn't I see it yesterday?

716
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,584
Bad luck, that's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

717
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,379
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

718
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,048
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?

719
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,383
Last night never happened.
I'm gonna marry him.

720
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,970
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

721
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,348
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

722
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,892
I'm in love with you.

723
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,356
- Snap out of it!
- I can't.

724
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,191
Then I must never see you again...

725
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,570
...and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny.

726
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,864
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I will.

727
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,076
- I'm telling you, you can't!
- He wants me to come.

728
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,119
That's because he don't know, OK?

729
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,706
Now wait a minute, honey.
Listen, all right.

730
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,209
I won't come to the wedding
provided one thing.

731
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,295
- What?
- Come with me tonight to the opera.

732
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,256
- What are you talking about?!
- I love two things.

733
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,717
I love you and... and I love the opera.

734
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,346
If I can have the two things I love
together for one night...

735
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,723
...I would be satisfied to give up...

736
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,643
Oh, Christ, to give up
the rest of my life.

737
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,853
- All right, all right.
- All right.

738
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,021
All right!

739
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,023
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right, all right.

740
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,823
- Where's the Met?
- Well, you gotta...

741
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,891
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

742
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,269
It's two months since
my last confession.

743
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,771
What sins have you to confess?

744
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,940
Twice I took the Lord's name in vain...

745
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,942
...once I slept with
my fiancé's brother...

746
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,946
...and I bounced a check
at the liquor store, but by mistake.

747
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,656
Then it's not a sin.

748
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,616
But...

749
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,746
...what was that second thing you said,
Loretta?

750
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,874
You mean the one about
I slept with my fiancé's brother?

751
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,209
That's a pretty big sin.

752
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,087
- I know.
- You should think about this.

753
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,380
I know.

754
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,798
All right.

755
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,594
For your penance, say two rosaries.

756
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,014
Be careful, Loretta.

757
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,266
Reflect on your life.

758

Just like your father.

764
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,971
I lied to him.

765

01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,135
(woman) I really hate it
when you use that tone with me.

866
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,596
Like isn't it so amusing.

867
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,098
- But it is.
- Not to me!

868
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,602
This is my life, no matter
how comical it may seem to you.

869
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,938
I don't need some man watching
while I roll around in the mud.

870
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,983
I think you like to roll around in
the mud and I don't. That's fair...

871
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,447
(laughter)

872
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,831
Sorry about that, folks.

873
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,000
She's a very pretty mental patient.

874
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,627
(laughter)

875
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,672
No, don't...
No, no, no. Please, don't mind me.

876
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,258
Just do me a favor and clear her place.

877
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,136
Get rid of all evidence of her
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

878
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,013
Absolutely.

879
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,559
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

880
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,770
I'm not disturbed by you.

881
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,524
My lady friend has
a personality disorder.

882
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,692
She's just too young for you.

883
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,112
- Ah, thanks, comrade.
- It's nothing.

884
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,615
Too young?

885
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,700
I just got that.
You know how to hurt a guy.

886
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,744
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

887
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,082
I'm sorry. That was rude.

888
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:03,088
Would you like to join me for dinner?

889
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:06,925
Are you sure?

890
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,762
I'd be delighted.

891
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,683
I hate to eat alone. It's amazing
how often I end up doing just that.

892
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,236
Signora Castorini... your minestrone.

893
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,780
- Thanks, Bobo.
- Prego.

894
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,492
What do you do?

895
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,911
I'm a professor of communication at NYU.

896
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,956
- That woman was a student of yours?
- Sheila? Yeah, she was.

897
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,958
Is.

898
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,585
Was.

899
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,630
There's an old saying
my mother taught me.

900
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,299
Don't shit where you eat.

901
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,303
OK, I'll remember that.

902
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,807
- What do you do?
- I'm a housewife.

903
01:04:55,975 --> 01:05:00,812
- How come you're eating alone?
- I'm not eating alone.

904
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,483
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

905
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,529
Why do men chase women?

906
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,785
Nerves.

907
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,080
I think it's because they fear death.

908
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:26,129
Well, maybe.
Do you wanna know why I chase women?

909
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,006
I find women charming.

910
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,843
I teach these classes
I've taught for a million years.

911
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,388
The spontaneity went out of it for me
a long time ago.

912
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:39,434
At first, I was excited about something,
I wanted to share it. Now it's rote.

913
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,062
A multiplication table.

914
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,272
Except sometimes...

915
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,358
Sometimes, I'll be droning along...

916
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:51,071
...and I'll look up
and I'll see a fresh...

917
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,490
...beautiful young face.

918
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,200
And it's all new to her.

919
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:59,788
I'm just this great guy
who's brilliant and thinks out loud.

920
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,249
When that happens, when I look out
there among those chairs...

921
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,586
...and see a young woman's face...

922
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,546
...and see me in her eyes...

923
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,592
...me, the way I always wanted to be,
maybe once was...

924
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,928
...I ask her out for a date.

925
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,349
It doesn't last long.

926
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,351
A few weeks...

927
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,311
...a couple of precious months.

928
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:29,275
Then she catches on that I'm just
this burned-out old gasbag...

929
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,696
...and she's as fresh and bright...

930
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,408
...and full of promise
as moonlight in a martini.

931
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,247
(sighs)

932
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,876
And at that moment she stands up and
throws a glass of water in my face...

933
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:50,213
...or some action to that effect.
(laughs)

934
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,466
What you don't know
about women is a lot.

935
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,180
Well... that's not what I hear.

936
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,399
- Two white wines, please.
- Yes, sir.

937
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,119
(Ronny)
I'd like two glasses of champagne.

938
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:28,168
Canadian Club with ginger ale
and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.

939
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:31,254
- (Loretta) What's that?
- (Ronny) This was done by Marc Chagall.

940
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,506
As you can see, he was a great artist.

941
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,968
- It's kinda gaudy.
- He was having some fun.

942
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,637
They get some turnout for this stuff,
huh?

943
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,973
It's the best thing there is.

944
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:46,811
You know, I like parts of it,
but I just don't... really get it.

945
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,775
You haven't once said you like my dress.

946
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,652
I like your dress.

947
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,655
It's very bright. Oh...

948
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,667
Will you hold this? Thanks.

949
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,170
May I walk with you a ways?

950
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,672
Sure. Thanks.

951
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,719
- Do you live far from here?
- Just up there.

952
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,558
Piano. Tutti piani.

953
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,393
Andiamo.

954
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,606
Ah, che bella luna.

955
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:39,781
Andiamo vedere la luna.

956
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,335
Piano. Non tirare!

957
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,920
Piano!

958
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,133
- (cat yowls)
- Hey, piano, piano!

959
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,611
(gasps)

960
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,531
(dogs whine)

961
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,410
Ssh! Andiamo, andiamo!

962
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,292
- You knew that man?
- Yes.

01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,364
- Awful?
- Beautiful! Sad.

976
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,199
- She died.
- Yes.

977
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,952
I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think she would die.

978
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,705
- I knew she was sick, but...
- She had TB.

979
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,165
I know! She was coughing her brains out.

980
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,459
And still she had to keep singing.

981
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:42,797
Pop.

982
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,552
Pop, what are you doing here?

983
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,222
Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

984
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:55,226
- Mona?
- Excuse me!

985
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,733
- What did you do to your hair?
- I... had it done.

986
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:06,279
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

987
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,156
- Who's that? You're engaged.
- You're married.

988
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,700
You're my daughter.
Don't act like a puttana.

989
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,286
- And you're my father...
- All right.

990
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,080
I didn't see you here.

991
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,583
I don't know if I saw you here or what.

992
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,554
Let's get outta here.
I'll buy you a drink.

993
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,098
That woman was not my mother, OK?

994
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,602
That's my house.

995
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,313
- You mean the whole house?
- Yes.

996
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,441
My God! It's a mansion.

997
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,151
It's a house.

998
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,612
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.

999
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,907
What exactly does your husband do?

1000
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,325
He's a plumber.

1001
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,952
Well, that explains it, then.

1002
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,708
(sighs) Temperature's dropping.

1003
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,295
- I guess you can't invite me in.
- No.

1004
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,463
People home.

1005
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:08,132
No. I think the house is empty.

1006
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,469
I can't invite you in
because I'm married.

1007
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,554
Because I know who I am.

1008
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,227
- You're shivering.
- I'm a little cold.

1009
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:23,064
You're a little boy.
And you like to be bad.

1010
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:27,485
We could go to my apartment.
See how the other half lives.

1011
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,487
I'm too old for you.

1012
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,032
I'm too old for me.
That's my predicament.

1013
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,327
Goodnight.

1014
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,289
Goodnight.
Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?

1015
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,960
Sure.

1016
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,219
I'm freezing.

1017
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,640
Goodnight.

1018
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,725
(man) Anything else, folks?

1019
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,019
- Loretta?
- No.

1020
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,980
- I think that's it, Al.
- (man) See you, Al!

1021
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,699
- What do you wanna do now?
- I wanna go home.

1022
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,708
- Goodnight, Al.
- Take it easy, Ronny.

1023
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,255
God, it's cold.

1024
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,925
It smells like snow.

1025
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,220
You know, my mother guessed
my father was seeing somebody.

1026
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:20,681
That Mona, I mean,
she's some piece of cheap goods.

1027
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,934
Who am I to talk?

1028
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,938
- What's the matter?
- How can you ask me that?

1029
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,857
- You're making me feel guilty.
- You are guilty! I'm guilty.

1030
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,194
Of what?
Only God can point the finger, Loretta.

1031
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,198
- Yeah, well, I know what I know.
- And what do you know?

1032
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,118
OK, you tell me my life.
I'll tell you yours.

1033
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:46,040
I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.
That don't make you no lamb.

1034
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,334
You're gonna marry my brother.

1035
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,838
Why do you wanna sell your life short?

1036
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:58,094
Playing it safe's the most dangerous
thing a woman like you could do.

1037
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,972
I mean, you waited for
the right man the first time.

1038
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:05,059
- Why didn't you wait for him again?
- Because he didn't come.

1039
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,186
- I'm here.
- You're late.

1040
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,153
This is your place.
So this is where we were going.

1041
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,697
Yeah.

1042
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,657
You know, we had a deal.

1043
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,993
You said if I came with you
to the opera...

1044
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,371
...you'd leave me alone for ever.
And I came with you!

1045
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:30,418
I'm gonna marry your brother and you're
gonna leave me alone for ever, right?

1046
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,130
A person can see
where they've messed up in their life.

1047
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:38,593
They can change the way they do things.
They can even change their luck.

1048
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,638
So maybe my nature does draw me
to you. But I don't have to go with it.

1049
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:47,351
I can take hold of myself
and I can say yes to some things...

1050
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,563
...and no to other things
that will ruin everything.

1051
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,275
Otherwise, you know, what...

1052
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:58,154
What good is this stupid life
that God gave us? I mean, for what?

1053
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,324
Are you listening to me?!

1054
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,867
Yeah.

1055
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,581
Everything seems like nothing to me now.
I want you in my bed.

1056
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,542
I don't care if I burn in hell.

1057
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,295
I don't care if you burn in hell.

1058
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,589
The past and the future is...

1059
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:17,757
...a joke to me now.

1060
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:21,886
I see that they're nothing,
I see they ain't here.

1061
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,305
The only thing that's here...

1062
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,183
...is you... and me.

1063
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,976
- I wanna go home.
- No.

1064
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,353
- I'm gonna go home.
- No!

1065
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,897
- I'm freezing to death.
- Come upstairs.

1066
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,524
I don't care why you come.

1067
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,735
No, that's not what I mean.

1068
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,737
Loretta...

1069
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,198
...I love you.

1070
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,117
Not... not like they told you love is.

1071
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:49,205
I didn't know this either.
But love don't make things nice.

1072
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:53,125
It ruins everything.
It breaks your heart.

1073
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:58,005
It makes things a mess.
We aren't here to make things perfect.

1074
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,925
- The snowflakes are perfect...
- Oh!

1075
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,763
The stars are perfect.

1076
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,766
Not us. Not us!

1077
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,769
We are here to ruin ourselves...

1078
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,064
...and... and to break our hearts...

1079
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,983
...and love the wrong people.

1080
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,694
And die!

1081
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:23,114
I mean that the storybooks are bullshit!

1082
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,200
Now I want you
to come upstairs with me...

1083
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,578

19 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn.

1089
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,838
Got it.

1090
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,803
- (Johnny) Hold it!
- (tires screech)

1091
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,277
- How much?
- 25.

1092
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:27,780
- 25 dollars?
- Yeah.

1093
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,993
Hold it.

1094
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,169
Hey!

1095
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,304
(doorbell)

1096
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,603
Oh, hi. I'm sorry to call so late.

1097
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,480
Moving in?

1098
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,607
No, I came right from the airport.

1099
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,901
Come on in.

1100
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,614
(♪ "It Must Be Him" by Vicki Carr)

1101
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,119
Can you wake up Loretta?
I need to talk to her.

1102
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:20,666
She's not home yet. Take off your coat
and come through. I'll make you a drink.

1103
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:23,085
I wanna talk to you!

1104
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,679
Thank you. Where is she?

1105
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,891
Out. I don't know where.

1106
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,185
So. What are you doing here?

1107
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:42,313
You're supposed to be in Palermo.

1108
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,858
This is what I came to tell Loretta.
There's been a miracle.

1109
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,321
A miracle? Well, that's news.

1110
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,574
My mother's recovered.

1111
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,077
- You're kidding?
- Oh, no.

1112
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,665
The breath had almost totally left
her body. She was as white as snow.

1113
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,167
And then...

1114
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,253
...she completely
pulled back from death...

1115
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:10,549
...and stood up...
and put on her clothes...

1116
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,802
...and began to cook
for everyone in the house.

1117
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,056
The mourners, and me, and herself.

1118
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,850
She ate a meal that could choke a pig.

1119
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,186
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

1121
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,234
Hi, Pop.

1122
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:31,445
(mutters)

1123
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,782
Oh, my God.

1124
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,035
Is he all right?

1125
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:42,498
My father-in-law's got
this wrong idea in his head.

1126
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,460
Listen, Johnny.

1127
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,545
There's a question I want to ask.

1128
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:51,966
I want you to tell me the truth...
if you can.

1129
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,387
Why do men chase women?

1130
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,391
Well uh...

1131
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:04,895
There's the Bible story.

1132
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,481
God.

1133
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,193
God took a rib from Adam...
and made Eve.

1134
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,322
Now, maybe men chase women
to get the rib back.

1135
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,367
When God took the rib...

1136
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,911
...he left a big hole there.

1137
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,497
A place where
there used to be something.

1138
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,500
And the women have that.

1139
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,751
Now maybe...

1140
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:32,715
...just maybe
a man isn't complete as a man...

1141
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,009
...without a woman.

1142
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:41,724
Why would a man need
more than one woman?

1143
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,600
I don't know.

1144
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,062
Maybe because he fears death.

1145
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:51,108
That's it. That's the reason.

1146
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,068
- I don't know!
- No!

1147
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:56,697
That's it. No. Thank you.

01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,284

Hi.

1151
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,043
Hello, Mr. Castorini.

1152
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,213
Oh. Hi.

1153
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,798
Where you been?

1154
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:18,093
I don't know where I've been
and I don't know where I'm going.

1155
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,803
All right?

1156
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:23,724
You'll have your eyes opened for you,
my friend.

1157
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,518
- I have my eyes open.
- Oh, yeah?

1158
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:29,730
Well, stick around.
Don't go on any long trips.

1159
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:34,777
- I don't know what you mean.
- That's the point. I'll say no more.

1160
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,779
You haven't said anything.

1161
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,947
And that's all I'm saying.

1162
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:40,866
- Cosmo.
- What?

1163
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,577
I just want you to know,
no matter what you do...

1164
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,497
...you're gonna die,
just like everybody else.

1165
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,166
Thank you, Rose.

1166
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,418
You're welcome.

1167
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,338
I'm going to bed now.

1168
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:58,801
I'm going.

1169
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:00,677
Good.

1170
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:05,140
He doesn't like you.
But thank you for answering my question.

1171
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,851
- You don't know where Loretta is?
- No. No idea.

1172
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:11,897
Mrs. Castorini, will you tell Loretta
that I'll come by in the morning?

1173
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:15,317
- We... We need to talk.
- OK, I'll tell her. OK.

1174
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,693
Thank you.

- She was dying!

1199
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:32,371

There ain't supposed to be miracles.

1200

1204
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:49,221
Cover up that damn thing!
Put some make-up on it!

1205
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,849
All right! Ma, OK, fine!
But you gotta help me.

1206
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,059
- Hurry up...
- (doorbell)

1207
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,898
You get it.

1208
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,942
(Loretta) Answer the door!

1209
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,944
Mother?

1210
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,079
Hi. Is Loretta home?

1211
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,831
Come on in.

1212
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,749
(groans)

1213
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,883
It's not Johnny.

1214
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,177
Ronny!

1215
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:30,846
Is Johnny here?

1216
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,973
- No, but he's coming.
- (Ronny) Good.

1217
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,100
We can get this out on the table.

1218
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,145
Hi. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1219
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,522
I'm Rose Castorini.

1220
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:43,775
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1221
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:46,111
You got a lovebite on your neck.

1222
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,490
- Your mother's recovered from death.
- Oh, good.

1223
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,659
- We're not close. I'm not...
- Ouch!

1224
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:55,579
- You gotta leave.
- I want to meet the family.

1225
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:57,331
No. Really, you gotta get out of here.

1226
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,666
- Anyone want some oatmeal?
- No, Ma.

1227
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,002
Yes, Mrs. Castorini. I would love some.

1228
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,379
No, we don't want any oatmeal.

1229
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:05,714
Ma!

1230
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,716
That was a... This is a... Oh!

1231
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:11,136
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're welcome.

1232
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:14,014
- Hi.
- Hi.

1233
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,934
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1234
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,606
It's very good to meet you,
Mr. Castorini.

1235
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:28,028
I have a feeling
this is going to be just delicious.

1236
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:33,116
- You're Johnny's brother?
- Yeah.

1237
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:40,791
Don't look at me like that, OK?

1238
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:41,917
(coughing)

1239
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:43,335
Hi, Pop.

1240
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:48,465
Buongiorno.

1241
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,265
- What's the matter, Pop?
- I'm old.

1242
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:59,601
The old are not wanted.

1243
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,854
And if they say it, they have no weight.

1244
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,525
But, my son... I must speak.

1245
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:11,154
You must pay for the wedding
of your only daughter.

1246
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:15,283
You break your house through pride.

1247
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,993
There.

1248
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,497
- I... I've said it.
- It's OK, Pop.

1249
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,334
If she gets married...
I'll pay for the whole thing.

1250
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:26,837
Bravo. Bravo.

1251
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,506
Adesso, parla giusto. Bravo.

1252
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,050
Now you're talking. Bravo.

1253
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,512
Parlato bene. Ha fatto bene. Bravo.

1254
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,056
Let's eat.

1255
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:47,566
Have I been a good wife?

1256
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,069
Yeah.

1257
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:56,408
I want you to stop seeing her.

1258
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,187
OK.

1259
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,736
And go to confession.

1260
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:40,202
A man understands one day
that his life is built on nothing...

1261
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,788
...and that's a bad, crazy day.

1262
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:51,713
Your life is not built on nothing.

1263
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:56,593
Ti amo.

1264
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,516
Anch'io ti amo.

1265
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,120
(doorbell)

1266
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:25,956
- It's Johnny, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

1267
01:32:26,123 --> 01:32:28,833
- (Ronny) I should tell him.
- (Loretta) I will.

1268
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,210
What am I gonna tell him?

1269
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:34,673
Tell him the truth, Loretta.
They find out anyway.

1270
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,883
You're right, Papa.

1271
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,637
Ti amo, mio piccolo angelo.

1272
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:44,558
- (woman) Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1273
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,395
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1274
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,022
Why aren't you two at the store?

1275
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,984
Do you have something
you wanna tell us, honey?

1276
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:56,653
No.

1277
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,740
We just come from the bank.

1278
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:02,909
Yeah.

1279
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,413
Oh, my God!
I forgot to make the deposit!

1280
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:07,581
(Rita) Oh, she's got it.

1281
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,334
- I knew she had it!
- We didn't know what to think.

1282
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:13,545
You were so weird yesterday.

1283
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:17,132
And then we went to the bank
this morning, and no bag.

1284
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,009
We never suspected you.

1285
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,011
Listen, would anyone like some coffee?

1286
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:23,263
That's a good idea.

1287
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:27,142
- What's with this suspected?
- I'll tell you later.

1288
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,852
I forgot to make the deposit.

1289
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,062
Sit down. Have some coffee.

1290
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:47,787
- So what are we doing?
- Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri.

1291
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,042
My name's Ronny.

1292
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,085
Johnny's brother.

1293
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:58,173
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

1294
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:02,010
- Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother.
- Hi.

1295
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:17,692
Someone tell a joke.

1296
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,736
(Ronny laughs)

1297
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,322
(doorbell)

1298
01:34:25,576 --> 01:34:26,910
I'll get it.

1299
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,878
I thought Johnny was in Palermo.

1300
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:44,010
It's Johnny Cammareri!

1301
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,100
Loretta?

1302
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,271
Ronny!

1303
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:01,194
- Have you come to make peace with me?
- Yes.

1304
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,071
But...

1305
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,324
...you may not want to.

1306
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,159
Ronny, of course I want to.

1307
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:11,037
Johnny, your mother was dying.
How did she recover?

1308
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,749
I told her we were to be married
and she got well right away!

1309
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,918
- I'm sure she did!
- It was a miracle.

1310
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,837
(all murmur in agreement)

1311
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:21,297
Johnny, I have something
I have to tell you.

1312
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:24,843
And I have something to tell you.
But I must talk to you alone.

1313
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:27,846
No, I need my family around me now.

1314
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,100
Loretta...

1315
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:34,728
...I can't marry you.

1316
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:35,854
What?!

1317
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:39,941
- If I marry you, my mother will die!
- What do you mean? We're engaged!

1318
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:41,484
Loretta, what are you talking about?

1319
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,820
I'm talking about a promise!
He proposed!

1320
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,156
My mother was dying
and now she's not!

1321
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:49,576
You're 42 years old.
She's still running your life.

1322
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,661
And you don't love your mother!

1323
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,789
You are a big liar.
Because I have a ring right here.

1324
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:56,249
Oh, I must ask for that back.

1325
01:35:56,417 --> 01:36:01,504
- All right. The engagement is off!
- You will see this is the best thing.

1326
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:04,340
And you'll drop dead
and I'll mourn you in a red dress!

1327
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:06,134
- Loretta...
- What?

1328
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:09,721
- Will you marry me?
- What?!

1329
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:11,890
Where's the ring?

1330
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:14,976
Johnny.

1331
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:18,104
Can I borrow that ring?

1332
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,819
Thanks.

1333
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:35,663
Loretta Castorini...

1334
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:37,207
...will you marry me?

1335
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:42,796
Yes, Ronny. In front of all
these people, I'll marry you.

1336
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,298
- (Rose) Do you love him, Loretta?
- Ma, I love him awful.

1337
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,092
Oh, God. That's too bad.

1338
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,095
She loves me.

1339
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,938
What's the matter, Pop?

1340
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:02,148
I'm confused.

1341
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:03,733

1342
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,736
(excited chattering)

1343
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,535
To Loretta and Ronny!

1344
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,124
There we are! Thank you, thank you.

1345
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:25,046
(Cosmo) Come on, Raymond!

1346
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:27,590
Bevi.

1347
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:30,343
Come, come.
Your brother is here and...

1348
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,845
No, I don't want any.

1349
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:35,431
You are a part of the family.
Don't you realize? Come on, bevi!

1350
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,065
Everybody, come on! Glass in hand!

1351
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,610
Alla famiglia!

1352
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:50,655
To... to family!

1353
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:52,574
(all) To family!
