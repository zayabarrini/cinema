2
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:05,715
Okay, which one is he?

3
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,785
I don't know
if he's gonna be here or not.

4
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,486
- Are you kidding me?
- I think I should go.

5
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:25,602
Um, I should probably go.

6
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,872
Aw, but we didn't even make it
to the bed, freshie.

7
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,883
Oh, are you quarterback?

8
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,619
Hey um,
have you seen my brother?

9
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:43,653
Nah.

10
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,663
We didn't have to go,
I was just seeing what was up.

11
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,099
I just can't watch what
you're up to with that guy.

12
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,101
There was nothing to watch!

13
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:58,501
We were just hanging out.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,037
Man, he's like,
Justin like that guy

15
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:01,772
that'll give like everyone else
a bad name.

16
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:02,974
Oh, yeah.

17
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:06,043
Like remember when he told
Stephanie P that she should...

18
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,045
I don't...
I don't wanna say it actually.

19
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:08,980
He's just trying to get
in your pants,

20
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,048
- I can tell you that much.
- Ew, Adam!

21
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,149
Besides, you're...
you're too young

22
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:12,984
to be going to parties.

23
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:13,885
I don't know
what you're thinking.

24
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,120
Dude, you are nine months
older than me.

25
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,145
...opportunity.

26
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,113
Wardrobe infraction.

27
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,198
Can we speak alone?

28
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,732
Freshman.

29
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,733
Hey.

30
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,568
Uh, some of us are going
to Ethan's after school,

31
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,038
and you should totally come.

32
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:45,742
- Um, yeah, I can probably go.
- Dope.

33
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:46,609
See you there.

34
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,677
Cool.

35
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,149
What?

36
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:53,918
A sophomore, just like came...

37
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,753
Yeah, it was really cool.

38
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,221
- What?
- I know!

39
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:59,656
You're so close.

40
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,293
I just got him.

41
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,001
Damn it!

42
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:11,202
Got him, I got him.

43
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,966
Hey.

44
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,935
Does Adam know you're here?

45
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,837
Adam?

46
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:51,842
Adam, yeah no, um, I doubt it,
but I did see him this morning,

47
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,878
so that was...

48
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:58,149
Or no that was last night,
it was definitely last night.

49
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,217
Maybe it was yesterday.

50
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,286
I don't remember
maybe we should call him.

51
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,587
Yeah, um, I'm good.

52
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,259
Damn it!

53
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:13,730
What's up, Watson?

54
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,669
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah...

55
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:22,273
- We're neighbors.
- We're neighbors.

56
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,741
Cool.

57
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,676
Well, I was thinking,
because you're like,

58
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,146
the smartest girl
in the history class...

59
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,347
Um.

60
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,982
No, it really only seems
like that,

61
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,118
but it's just 'cause I'm like
one of the only freshmen,

62
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,922
I'm not that smart.

63
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,091
Yeah, well,
I think you're smart.

64
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:42,226
Dude!

65
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,929
- Don't you forget.
- Okay.

66
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,375
It seems like he was gonna
ask you to do

67
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,946
his homework, right?

68
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,982
Yeah, it totally did.

69
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:08,352
If I were you, I don't know I...
tell him you were blind

70
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,088
or something.

71
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,424
Yeah.

72
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,901
Actually though uh,
I have to get going,

73
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:26,036
but it was good talking to you.

74
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:31,175
Uh, can I come?

75
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,245
I have something to do later.

76
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:37,348
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:40,317
Uh, hey Justin,
I'm gonna get going,

78
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,154
I have something to do
for my mom, so...

79
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,687
Gotta help your mom.

80
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:50,895
Kidding, freshie, see ya later.

81
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:51,962
Okay.

82
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,355
- The leaves are like...
- You two...

83
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,423
- Sorry.
- Um.

84
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:20,958
No, no, you can go.

85
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,059
Shoot.

86
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:29,200
I was just gonna say,
leaves are like really cool.

87
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,100
Yeah.

88
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,979
So, um, what do you think
of high school so far?

89
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:44,448
Um, it's okay,
it's pretty much like

90
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,884
Hosford but bigger.

91
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:50,120
I have classes with my friends
which is nice.

92
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,056
I like my English class.

93
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,891
I don't like that
they are making me take

94
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:54,892
Spanish too,

95
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:59,129
but the counsellor says
I have to try, so...

96
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:01,298
What about you?

97
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,867
Uh, I don't know.
It's alright.

98
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,136
I'm kinda used to it by now.

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,404
I like drama.

100
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:09,907
Oh yeah, you're supposed to be
like...

101
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,245
I just mean to say,
you're supposed

102
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,479
to be really good.

103
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:17,147
Shit.

104
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,019
Hmm.

105
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:22,920
What?

106
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:25,889
I don't know, it's just...
it's just weird.

107
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,358
I don't think we have
ever really talked before.

108
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,027
I don't totally know you.

109
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,028
Oh.

110
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:40,904
Um, I have this thing,
in my room,

111
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,906
I don't know
if you'd want to see.

112
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,041
Really?

113
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,342
Yeah or not, I mean.

114
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:48,545
No, um, yeah,
yeah, that sounds good.

115
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,977
It's my little leaf collection.

116
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,214
Oh, wow.

117
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,549
Yeah.

118
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:28,218
I mean I'm kinda seeing
how shitty they look

119
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,087
after some time.

120
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,490
But you know,
once they were all bright

121
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:34,625
and beautifully colored.

122
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,195
Like this one, I don't know
it's probably from like

123
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,296
the fifth grade.

124
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,364
Really?

125
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,999
Yeah.

126
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,567
Wow.

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,338
So, now you know.

128
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:49,206
I like leaves, too.

129
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:21,672
Um, do you wanna smoke?

130
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,908
Oh, I...
I didn't realize you smoke.

131
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:28,412
Oh, yeah, I mean
I like to sometimes,

132
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:33,083
'cause just around people,
I don't know, I feel weird.

133
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:36,553
But like I only have
a little bit.

134
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:39,690
I got it
from my sister's friend.

135
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,427
Uh, I don't do it that often,
so...

136
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,162
I've only smoked like twice,

137
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:49,666
and once was today,
and one other time.

138
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,269
I don't really even know
if it counted.

139
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,308
Um, yeah actually I'll...
I'll take some more.

140
00:10:58,342 --> 00:10:59,510
Thanks.

141
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:00,677
Okay.

142
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,121
Okay.

143
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,508
Okay.

144
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,078
Would you like to do the honors?

145
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,147
Yeah, sure.

146
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,482
Okay.

147
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,305
Thank you.

148
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm... I'm good.

149
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,795
You guys look
pretty funny there.

150
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:28,699
Oh, yeah, that was like,
a year ago.

151
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:47,644
Wow.

152
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:52,616
I should've been nice to you

153
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:53,684
All this time

154
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:58,455
Um, I should probably go.

155
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,558
Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,861
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

157
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,752
Uh, I don't know I
mean, it's an amazing photo.

158
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:09,020
Yeah, what kinda class is that?

159
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,520
We just take fucking photos
you know,

160
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,756
it's kind of like
a college level class.

161
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:12,622
Like a college level class?

162
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:13,523
Yeah.

163
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,860
For a sophomore year,
it's pretty good.

164
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,661
Hey, so is it lasagne night
tonight?

165
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,432
Is it lasagne night tonight?

166
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,769
Okay, fine, don't tell me
if it's lasagne night.

167
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,805
Oh, um, I don't know.

168
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,372
Later.

169
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,374
I'm just not really sure.

170
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:48,658
Harper!

171
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,928
Harper! Harper!

172
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:52,629
It's trash night.

173
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:53,630
Yeah.

174
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,650
Hey.

175
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,287
Oh, hi.

176
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:24,594
Um.

177
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,731
So how are you?

178
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm... I'm good.

179
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,600
Uh, I was just, you know.

180
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,706
Uh, do you...?

181
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,042
Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,048
Umm...

183
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,817
What... what have you been up to?

184
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,985
Um, I mean, just like stuff.

185
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,988
Homework stuff,
basketball stuff.

186
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:53,124
What about you?

187
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,860
Yeah, you know like
theater things.

188
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,929
I had a rehearsal yesterday.

189
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,864
And that's about it.

190
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,465
Oh yeah, you're um,
you're playing Duke Fredrick

191
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,467
in <i>As You Like It</i>, right?

192
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,603
Yeah, yeah, I'm kind of excited,

193
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:09,639
'cause I didn't really have
any big parts last year.

194
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,375
Well, you're gonna be
really good.

195
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,710
I mean, that's just...
that's what everyone else

196
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,378
is saying.

197
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,019
So did you end up doing
Justin's homework?

198
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,754
What?

199
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,456
Oh, um, no actually.

200
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:30,627
He asked me about it yesterday,
but um, I just told him to ask

201
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,997
Mr. Summers for help,
think he might.

202
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,397
Really?

203
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,700
I mean, that's what he said.

204
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,502
I had Mr. Summers last year
and I really liked him.

205
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,906
- Oh really?
- Yeah...

206
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,875
I had him for English.

207
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,709
The triumph
of the South Atlantic system

208
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,079
changed the politics
of the empire.

209
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:51,115
British would pretend to rule
the colonies with a gentle hand

210
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,651
and the colonists were in
a position to challenge...

211
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,623
In England glorious
revolution strengthened the powers

212
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:02,525
of the colonists
at the expense of the Crown.

213
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,096
American representative
assemblies also wished to limit

214
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,431
the powers of the Crown,
grab the one control...

215
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,543
Um, is... is Adam home?

216
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:56,646
He... he has my math notes like,
so I came by to...

217
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,015
Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,749
Adam!

219
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,194
Um, you can just come in
actually.

220
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,966
- Oh!
- Um.

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,101
I... I forgot my...

222
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,003
I was just, uh...

223
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:57,041
Um, but I... I can get it.

224
00:20:57,074 --> 00:21:01,178
Or I can get it for you,
if you want.

225
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:02,113
Yeah.

226
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:06,050
Um, why... why were you out here
anyway?

227
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,652
Um, it's trash day, so.

228
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,329
What?

229
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:21,966
We should hang out sometime.

230
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:22,967
Okay.

231
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:28,571
Um, well,
I should probably go, so.

232
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:30,673
- Yeah.
- Um, okay.

233
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:37,882
Hey, um, did you come out here
just to see me?

234
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:42,286
Yeah.

235
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:44,789
Did you?

236
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,558
Yeah.

237
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:42,947
So um, what do you think
about politics?

238
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,148
What?

239
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:46,016
Sorry, I don't know.

240
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,151
No, no.

241
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:50,421
Um, let's see,

242
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,757
I don't know it's all pretty
crazy and terrible, right?

243
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:58,162
Like my dad, he says
it's a shitshow.

244
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:00,097
Mine, too.

245
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,367
I don't know for me,
I think it's more about like,

246
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,336
women's abortion rights.

247
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:08,839
Yeah?

248
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:12,109
Yeah, I mean not like for me
personally, necessarily.

249
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:14,111
I just think,

250
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:18,048
where I come from it's so much
more complicated.

251
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:21,452
And people die every single day
just trying to do it themselves,

252
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,756
so I just think that like...

253
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,925
I just think that sometimes
women deserve more

254
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,027
than they get.

255
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,961
Yeah.

256
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,234
Sorry, what part of India
are you from again?

257
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,336
Uh, Kanar.

258
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,571
In like this little village
actually.

259
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:46,076
So um, my birth mom, she had me
and the guy who was my dad

260
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,945
left right away, I guess.

261
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,849
And um, she couldn't afford
to keep me, so when I was 3

262
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:54,351
she moved me to an orphanage
in Delhi,

263
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:57,788
and so my parents now
Jocelyn and Bob,

264
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:01,091
uh, they found me through
an online program and here I am.

265
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:04,328
I remember the day you came.

266
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,728
No, you don't.

267
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:08,465
I was 3, so you would
have been 4.

268
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,134
- There's no way.
- Okay, yeah.

269
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:14,071
Maybe not, but I do remember
being really little

270
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:17,740
and playing with you, and...
oh and then I do remember

271
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:18,876
when Adam came, yeah.

272
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:19,709
Yeah, yeah,

273
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:22,513
no, you guys were 6
I remember that.

274
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,782
- Hey, you know what's crazy?
- What?

275
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:28,219
My parents just went to India
and Saint Paul

276
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,221
and got some children.

277
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:32,022
Yeah, I guess.

278
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,057
Yeah.

279
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:41,332
So, like do you ever think
about your family?

280
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:44,368
Like your old family?

281
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,537
Yeah, sometimes.

282
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,441
I mean, sometimes this lady
who says she's my cousin

283
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,509
sends me letters.

284
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:55,546
They're kind of funny
and kind of weird.

285
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,815
- Woah.
- Yeah, I don't know.

286
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:06,123
- Um...
- Well, it was fun hanging out.

287
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,294
- Yeah, yeah, um...
- I...

288
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:11,428
Are you going that way?

289
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:12,162
- Yeah.
- Okay.

290
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:13,897
I should probably cross it, so.

291
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,399
- I'll just...
- Yeah.

292
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:38,155
I almost told the guy
to step the fuck away

293
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:39,089
I was so pissed!

294
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:41,425
Mom, you can't talk to the mayor
like that.

295
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,193
It's not normal,
but in this case

296
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:44,962
he would've deserved it,
that piece of sh...

297
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:47,531
Oh, so how's school, Adam?

298
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:49,366
Um, it's okay.

299
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,567
I mean, you know
the treasurer and I have

300
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:54,004
a lot of good ideas, but I wish
she was vice president.

301
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,240
She's a lot easier to deal with
than Jonathan.

302
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:59,276
Well, you just need to give
Jonathan some time.

303
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,245
They elected him for a reason.

304
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,851
Harper, how are you doing?

305
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,487
What?

306
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,356
What do you think of the school,
sweetie?

307
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:15,092
- It's big, huh?
- Yeah!

308
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,594
It is big.

309
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:20,431
Um, it's pretty cool.

310
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,099
I like it.

311
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,935
I'm doing very good, thank you.

312
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:29,039
There's Mark.

313
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:31,642
You know, we really should
have him over soon.

314
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,510
Feel bad, it's been a while.

315
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:34,878
Yeah, me too, me too.

316
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:38,248
How's Tilly doing?

317
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,250
Does he ever talk about his mom?

318
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:42,319
Uh, not really.

319
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,988
- I... I think he's okay.
- Hmm.

320
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:48,225
It was really sad
watching her go like that.

321
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,295
I mean nobody should have to go
through something like that.

322
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,297
Especially not Tilly

323
00:27:03,474 --> 00:27:06,377
And they were sparkly
and gorgeous.

324
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:44,381
How was your day?

325
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:46,550
Are you dating Luna Douglas?

326
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,985
What?

327
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:48,952
No.

328
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:52,423
Um, do you like her, though?

329
00:27:52,456 --> 00:27:53,290
No, no, no.

330
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:56,693
We just hang out
with the same people.

331
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,329
So we're around each other
a lot.

332
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,131
She's nice.

333
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,433
Yeah.

334
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:06,069
Are you dating Joey Gomez?

335
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:06,970
What?

336
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:09,373
I mean that was in like
the sixth grade,

337
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:11,408
so it was a long time ago.

338
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,677
I guess I was going out
with Owen McDonald,

339
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,246
but whatever that's...

340
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:25,222
Hey, do we think anything about
um, about Adam?

341
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:26,957
Yeah, I do.

342
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:30,694
Me too.

343
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,330
I mean I don't know,
this is cool.

344
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,265
This is weird.

345
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:40,070
You know what I hate?

346
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,573
When I'm trying to perform
my summer dance routine

347
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:44,308
- and I go...
- Oh my God!

348
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:47,244
No one will ever let me
forget about that!

349
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,046
You guys chose the block party
to premiere

350
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,647
your world famous dance.

351
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:53,417
It would've been world famous,
it literally would have been!

352
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:57,054
- Who's playing Rosalind?
- Oh, um, my friend Luna.

353
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:02,693
Guys, how's school?

354
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,128
It's good, Mr. D.

355
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,331
- How are you?
- Oh good, good, good, good.

356
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:09,066
Make sure you try
some of the sauce, Bob.

357
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,034
- It's my grandma's recipe.
- Okay.

358
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:15,172
Mark, it is so nice of you
to have prepared all of this,

359
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:18,810
although when we said
we should have dinner,

360
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,377
we didn't mean that
you should have us like come...

361
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,311
Oh yeah.

362
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:22,045
No, no, no, no,
don't worry about it, I...

363
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,514
- I love cooking.
- Okay.

364
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:24,481
It's fine, yeah.

365
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,354
I do, Tilly.

366
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:33,557
Yeah, yeah, I mean we have like
frozen burritos

367
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,459
like every night.

368
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:40,697
Yeah.

369
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:43,300
Mark um...

370
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,435
Hey, uh, how's...
how's Carol doing?

371
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:46,737
Good, good, yeah.

372
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:49,774
I think she's not crazy about
being on the same campus as me,

373
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,676
but I told her that's
what you'd get for choosing

374
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,646
the old hippie school, right.

375
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,316
Yeah, I kinda wouldn't mind
going to an old hippie school.

376
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,518
Or at least I'm starting
to think that.

377
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,720
Last week I got in trouble,
because a teacher thought

378
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:05,556
my shorts weren't inappropriate.

379
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,592
What he was saying was just
shaming the way our bodies look

380
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,295
or the way our clothes fit.

381
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:14,866
It's just, isn't it society
that's telling us to wear

382
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,401
these clothes
just so we fit in?

383
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:22,339
I don't know,
it just kinda sucks.

384
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:23,206
Yeah.

385
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,074
Harper, I couldn't agree
with you more.

386
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,810
I was having
this exact conversation

387
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,344
with my students
just the other day,

388
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:29,246
- about that double standard.
- Oh.

389
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,216
It's... it's just so
backwards, you know, all of it.

390
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,620
And you two, it's time to start
standing up for women, okay.

391
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:39,289
It's not like it used to be,
at all.

392
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:40,892
It's not like uh,
"Oh, uh, happy to make

393
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,459
more money" or whatever, no.

394
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,729
You see something unfair,
you fucking change it.

395
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:47,531
You say something
and you change it.

396
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:50,868
Okay, so...

397
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,639
I went into professor mode
for a second there.

398
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:57,307
You did!

399
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,777
Okay, go to the one with
the pig, that's the wrong one.

400
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:00,778
This is like three summers ago.

401
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:02,546
Well, it's still funny, so.

402
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,647
- No way!
- This is...

403
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,248
- I love this one.
- That's mom's panda, show her.

404
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:06,183
- Mom!
- Mom, look, it's your panda!

405
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:07,150
Mom!

406
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,685
It's your child, the panda...

407
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:12,790
Thank you so much, thank you.

408
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:13,925
Yeah, it was nice, really nice.

409
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:15,559
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

410
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:16,693
- Thanks for dinner.
- Yeah.

411
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:19,529
- Bye.
- Adam, see ya.

412
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,164
- Bye.
- Bye.

413
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,639
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

414
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,543
So loved it.

415
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:35,545
That was good.

416
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,308
Hey.

417
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,945
Hey, so what do you wanna do?

418
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:12,215
Um, I don't know. I think...

419
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:13,951
It should be an adventure.

420
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,888
I think it should be a date.

421
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:25,495
- What?
- Nothing.

422
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,369
- What?
- Nothing.

423
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:49,847
Hey, can you believe that
I would never, ever,

424
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,882
ever wanna go...

425
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:52,482
Hmm?

426
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:53,316
To the moon.

427
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,087
- Why?
- 'Cause you can't breathe.

428
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,089
Like literally think about it.

429
00:33:58,122 --> 00:33:59,824
Well, I feel like you would have
some way to breathe

430
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:03,094
if you ended up finding a way
to get to the moon.

431
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,095
No, this is like you going.

432
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,763
Okay, okay, okay.

433
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:06,831
Continue.

434
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:08,900
Um, probably North Carolina.

435
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:15,705
No, no, no, no, no.

436
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,574
- I don't eat...
- What?

437
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:18,708
It's veggie.

438
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:19,977
Vegetable!

439
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:22,345
Okay.

440
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:23,781
I don't eat meat either.

441
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:24,916
Since when?

442
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,684
You know, I've been a vegetarian
since I was 8, right?

443
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,352
Yeah.

444
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:30,487
I remember we would always go
to the beach

445
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,924
and you'd make a really big deal
out of when my parents

446
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:35,625
made hot dogs.

447
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,695
But I don't know,
it's been like, a few years

448
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,932
after my mom got sick,
so she stopped eating,

449
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:43,500
so I stopped as well.

450
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:49,040
And then after... it just like,
seemed weird to go back.

451
00:34:53,044 --> 00:34:54,544
I'm sorry.

452
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:57,714
No, it's okay.

453
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,383
It's not.

454
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:06,523
Real emotional, huh.

455
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:07,959
Sorry.

456
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:08,893
Very sincere.

457
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:10,560
I'm sorry, Tilly!

458
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:27,845
Well, um,
I think that was a success.

459
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:31,048
A success?

460
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:35,619
Um, what do you wanna do now?

461
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:40,523
I mean, we should probably keep
hanging out, right.

462
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:44,061
I think my dad might have
a late class, um,

463
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,063
would you wanna come over?

464
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:47,832
I mean I should probably
text him,

465
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:52,702
but what do your parents think
if you're galloping around town?

466
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,906
You mean gallivanting?

467
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,941
But no, yeah, they're cool
with it.

468
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:57,875
They trust us.

469
00:35:57,909 --> 00:35:59,542
They're trying to be
so progressive that

470
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,579
I have nothing to rebel against,
so.

471
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:10,788
Um, but actually,
I'll them I'm going to Zoey's.

472
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:13,858
I'll be right back.

473
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

474
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,875
Dad late indeed.

475
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:41,752
So, um, what do you wanna do?

476
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:51,095
- Um, we could eat.
- Yeah.

477
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:54,731
Or I guess, we just ate already.

478
00:36:54,765 --> 00:37:00,537
Um, we could smoke?

479
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:05,076
I don't know, sure.

480
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,078
Or we could, drink a beer.

481
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:09,113
My dad has beer.

482
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,849
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,151
I like beer.

484
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,953
Or I'm... I'm starting to.

485
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:20,724
My mom actually drinks a lot,
of beer, nothing crazy.

486
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:23,894
She's just...
she's very Portland.

487
00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:26,998
She gets mad about politics
and stuff.

488
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:30,768
So, that's where you get it?

489
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,903
I mean, that's an
interesting way

490
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:35,072
of thinking about it.

491
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:36,974
I guess.

492
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:40,911
But doesn't everyone get mad?

493
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:42,847
I guess so.

494
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:47,918
Um.

495
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:54,959
I guess
I don't really need a beer.

496
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:55,960
Okay.

497
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,224
Do you want to?

498
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:28,725
Yeah.

499
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,978
This is fun.

500
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:49,346
Yeah.

501
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,256
Um, should I?

502
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,926
I mean, if... if you want to.

503
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,027
Yeah.

504
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:21,846
I haven't done it before.

505
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:26,283
I mean me neither.

506
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,418
Really?

507
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:34,925
Yeah, I mean like,
we don't have to.

508
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:41,265
Go, go get a condom.

509
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,768
Wait. I... I don't have one.

510
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,972
Do you think my dad would?

511
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:49,874
I don't know, go check.

512
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:51,375
Okay.

513
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,145
Is... is this crazy?

514
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,813
Yes!

515
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:49,099
Uh.

516
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,367
Well, I'll see you later.

517
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,403
Yeah. Bye.

518
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:22,066
Can I come over later?

519
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,903
Oh, uh, I have... I have
rehearsal in an hour, so.

520
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:29,840
Wait, so we can't do it again?

521
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:34,078
No, I mean we're definitely
doing it again.

522
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:36,447
When though?
Not... not till tomorrow?

523
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,149
I think we should do it
all the time.

524
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:40,150
You wanna?

525
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,421
You were looking at me!

526
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:46,257
No! You were looking at me!

527
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,825
Oh my God!

528
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:49,860
I was gonna come over
and I was gonna say something,

529
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:51,895
but then Madison
looked at me weird.

530
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,565
Okay, well,
Madison looks at everyone weird.

531
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,301
It's so weird not seeing you
during the day.

532
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:59,870
I know.

533
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,875
You know that day you
texted me at the food carts?

534
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:06,510
I didn't know if I should come
or not.

535
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:09,046
I am so glad you came.

536
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,447
Me too.

537
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,817
Although I'm pretty sure
that day we just talked.

538
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:16,153
No, that day we...

539
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:17,288
No.

540
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,856
You are remembering wrong.

541
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:22,226
You are remembering
incorrectly.

542
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:23,594
No!

543
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:24,495
I disagree!

544
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,102
Is this better
than what Madison likes?

545
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,307
No.

546
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,276
My dad likes it, and it's...
and it's cool.

547
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,211
Um, that's because he's 40.

548
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:52,623
- So when I'm 44, you'll be 45?
- Yeah.

549
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,459
And when I'm 52,
you're gonna be 51.

550
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:59,129
And when I'm 81,
you're gonna be 82.

551
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:00,597
We're gonna be so happy.

552
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,366
We're gonna be so old.

553
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:13,010
Hey!

554
00:43:13,043 --> 00:43:15,179
- Is it okay that I decided to?
- Yeah.

555
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,080
I'm so happy you're here.

556
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,519
Struberry.

557
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:25,122
Strawberry.

558
00:43:25,155 --> 00:43:27,658
It's struberry, it sounds
like January.

559
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,160
Struberry.

560
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:33,530
Yeah, struberry.

561
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:43,267
Harper Ann!

562
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,435
Mom!

563
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:53,010
Harper Ann, are you having sex
with Tilly Dodson?

564
00:44:53,043 --> 00:44:54,611
We're just friends, mom,
that's it.

565
00:44:54,645 --> 00:44:55,612
Yeah, you've become
more than friends

566
00:44:55,646 --> 00:44:57,080
and you know it.

567
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,616
Well, kind of,
but yeah, kind of, but...

568
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,719
Yep. No, you were over there
yesterday, too.

569
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:04,521
- I thought you trusted us, mom.
- Trust?

570
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:06,690
Look, kids spending
every day together

571
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:09,359
in unsupervised rooms
are having sex, Harper.

572
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:10,762
No, they're not.

573
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:13,497
Look, I would know.

574
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,065
Uh.

575
00:45:15,098 --> 00:45:17,301
I just don't want you
having sex.

576
00:45:17,334 --> 00:45:18,335
Why not?

577
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,270
Because you are too young.

578
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,274
No, I'm not.

579
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:32,483
Turney, what do you think?

580
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:34,318
Him?

581
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,487
Definitely like her.

582
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:39,590
Him for sure.

583
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:44,161
Virgins.

584
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:46,730
Her too.

585
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:48,131
Probably.

586
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:49,399
Probably?

587
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:51,201
Definitely.

588
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:54,705
Probably never had a guy
who'd check her out on accident.

589
00:45:58,242 --> 00:46:00,277
Um, hey, do you know what
we're supposed to do

590
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,745
for this essay?

591
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:03,380
What?

592
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:06,350
Um, do you know
what you're doing right now?

593
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:09,419
I heard it was in a tree house.

594
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:10,822
I heard she was on her period.

595
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,257
And apparently, she asked
to wait till she was,

596
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,225
so she wouldn't know
if the blood was from.

597
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:16,093
Oh my God.

598
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:18,228
- Guys, this is kinda gross.
- Yeah.

599
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:20,765
No, like,
that we know this stuff.

600
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,433
Are you just saying
that, 'cause you're getting

601
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:25,435
all the action now?

602
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:27,504
Yeah, maybe.

603
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,773
Why did you say it like that?

604
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,307
It's just gross.

605
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,075
Oh my God!

606
00:46:32,777 --> 00:46:35,345
So what is it like?

607
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:38,448
Um, I guess it's just kind of
like knowing someone

608
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:39,449
really, really well,

609
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:43,387
but differently
than everyone else you know.

610
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,856
Yeah.

611
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:47,157
I wish my first
sexual experience wasn't having

612
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,226
hands stuck down my pants.

613
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:50,795
He should've been expelled,
really.

614
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:53,765
It's okay, I mean, I just Tiger.

615
00:46:53,798 --> 00:46:56,834
I just felt stupid mostly.

616
00:46:56,868 --> 00:46:58,402
Uh, I never should've told
my mom.

617
00:46:58,435 --> 00:47:00,337
Well, he shouldn't have assumed
you wanted that

618
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,239
just because you shared
a locker.

619
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:04,541
Yeah, well, see you in history.

620
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:05,777
See ya.

621
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:28,265
What's up with you
and Adam Turney's sister?

622
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,203
Woah, you really like her.

623
00:47:33,236 --> 00:47:37,374
Yeah, I mean, she's super funny,
and smart,

624
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:40,744
and like really into government,
and like she has all these ideas

625
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:44,348
about how school should be run,
and she's like... I don't know,

626
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:47,651
she's really into basketball,
so I get to watch her practices.

627
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:50,654
She's just kinda awesome.

628
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:52,422
Nice.

629
00:47:58,462 --> 00:47:59,663
How are you?

630
00:47:59,696 --> 00:48:01,231
Good, how are you?

631
00:48:01,264 --> 00:48:02,767
- I'm good.
- That's cool.

632
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,401
So what do you wanna do today?

633
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,837
I don't know,
I think it's up to you.

634
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:13,610
You probably haven't
really been in here before.

635
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,912
Yeah.

636
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:18,348
Yeah, I don't think
I've been in here since...

637
00:48:18,382 --> 00:48:21,551
I don't know when
I would've been here actually.

638
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:23,687
For a basketball, maybe?

639
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,692
Yeah, I feel like me and Adam
might have come in here

640
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:30,394
once when you were gone.

641
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:32,864
I'm sorry, look,
I would never do that now.

642
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,499
We might have looked
at your dolls

643
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:38,235
without their clothes on
or something really weird.

644
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:40,838
Yeah, that is pretty weird.

645
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,309
Well, we should probably do it.

646
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:50,982
I mean, my mom's working late
and my dad's to uh, Lake Oswego.

647
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:53,517
Adam has a
student council meeting.

648
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,285
So...

649
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,454
Yeah, but I should do
homework after.

650
00:48:57,487 --> 00:48:58,588
Mhmm.

651
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,495
Hey, do you ever wanna like,
do it differently?

652
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:07,564
Yeah, how do you mean?

653
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,601
Like, like this?

654
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,404
Like this?

655
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:19,376
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, cradle-robber.

656
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,812
Hey, do I need to hide
my sister?

657
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,618
You eat more bagels
than anyone I've ever met.

658
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:29,486
I love bagels.

659
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:31,856
Hey, um, Abby got
her tooth pulled

660
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,858
and I was thinking after school
we should all go over

661
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,026
and bring her homework.

662
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,160
Mom said we can watch
Super Bowl there.

663
00:49:36,194 --> 00:49:39,329
Oh, um, I actually was gonna
watch Tilly's rehearsal

664
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:41,264
- after school today.
- Oh.

665
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:42,632
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

666
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:44,334
See you later.

667
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:08,391
Hey.

668
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:18,335
I think he might have said
something to my mom,

669
00:50:18,368 --> 00:50:20,470
if it makes you feel better.

670
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:23,908
Really?

671
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,810
Actually, I don't really know.

672
00:50:25,843 --> 00:50:28,411
But he's ignoring me too, so.

673
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:31,448
Yeah, I mean,
it's just different.

674
00:50:31,481 --> 00:50:34,952
Um, but, thanks, thanks Harper.

675
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:36,620
Yeah.

676
00:50:37,587 --> 00:50:38,856
Did you hear what
happened in Geometry class?

677
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,924
No, what happened?

678
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:40,858
Okay,
so the projector stopped working

679
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:43,027
and we gotta be in our phones,
all class.

680
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,961
Oh, lucky!

681
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:44,962
- Hey!
- Hey!

682
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:47,031
- Hey!
- Abby!

683
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:50,400
Um, how's... how's your tooth?

684
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,037
Um, it's fine I guess,
I mean I can't really tell

685
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,839
now that it's gone.

686
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:56,774
Um, kind of hurts now.

687
00:50:56,808 --> 00:51:00,577
Actually, talking about it
right now kind of hurts more.

688
00:51:09,452 --> 00:51:10,620
What's Sam Pierson like, Tilly?

689
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:11,756
Yeah, is he always
running around

690
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:14,025
with his shirt off, like ugh,
look at how sexy I am.

691
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,762
I mean, not really.

692
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:20,664
He's... he's really nice.

693
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:22,732
But what's he like?

694
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:24,401
I don't know.

695
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:27,571
Just normal, I... I guess.

696
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:38,515
I remember that cheer
you guys used to do

697
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:41,685
at basketball games
when you were younger.

698
00:51:41,718 --> 00:51:43,553
That was... that was cool.

699
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:44,255
That's weird.

700
00:51:44,288 --> 00:51:46,824
Yeah, isn't that like sexist?

701
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,059
Yeah.

702
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:52,096
They're just joking,
you're fine.

703
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,166
You guys are joking, right?

704
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,907
I think I'm just gonna do
homework today.

705
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,876
Yeah, me too.

706
00:53:31,728 --> 00:53:32,863
Hey.

707
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:34,799
Oh, hi.

708
00:53:34,832 --> 00:53:38,135
So I was thinking
maybe after school

709
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:41,205
going to hang out with Ethan
and like, some of those guys.

710
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:42,773
Oh, cool, yeah.

711
00:53:42,807 --> 00:53:45,176
Um, you know what,
maybe I'll hang out

712
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,210
with Zoey and Madison,

713
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:49,046
I think they're going
Halloween shopping, so.

714
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,182
Okay, um, text me
when you get home.

715
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:52,817
I can run out or something.

716
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:53,683
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

717
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:54,617
Okay, cool.

718
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:55,953
Okay, bye.

719
00:53:55,987 --> 00:53:56,954
Bye.

720
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:03,260
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You got this! You got this!

721
00:54:03,294 --> 00:54:04,795
Wait, wait, wait.

722
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:05,329
Hold on, wait.

723
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:07,965
- You got it, you got it!
- I know.

724
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,300
You're so close!

725
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:12,036
I'm going off.

726
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:13,004
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Wait, no!

727
00:54:13,037 --> 00:54:15,906
No! No! Ugh!

728
00:54:17,574 --> 00:54:19,709
Nice try.

729
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:21,846
Well, new government awaits.

730
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:25,582
Hey, bro.

731
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:26,784
Hey.

732
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:30,720
Um, I could not figure out
that thing in math today, uh.

733
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:32,790
Oh, shit.

734
00:54:32,823 --> 00:54:35,059
Is this what you're doing
to Adam's sister, Dodson?

735
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:41,731
Dude, I... I just meant like,
I mean,

736
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:45,936
you should it,
you should see this shit.

737
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,239
Plus, I hear that girl's a slut.

738
00:54:48,272 --> 00:54:50,107
I mean you would know.

739
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,674
And you.

740
00:55:14,865 --> 00:55:18,668
Hey, um, so did you want me
to come to your rehearsal today?

741
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:21,839
I know you have your big
homeless wanderer scene.

742
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:24,707
Um, yeah.

743
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,044
Yeah, I don't know,
it might take a little bit

744
00:55:27,078 --> 00:55:31,614
before I have you seeing me
as a hermit in a cave.

745
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:34,118
Well, I think you'd be
a great hermit, you know,

746
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:36,653
you'd stock up on bread,
and Pop Rocks,

747
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:39,722
and you'd have your little radio
playing jazz.

748
00:55:39,757 --> 00:55:44,228
Yeah, yeah, and you'd like,
sneak in 50 cucumber rolls

749
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,030
and like a YBM poster.

750
00:55:57,908 --> 00:55:59,076
Okay.

751
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:04,415
Okay, so he's like this
uptight king, right,

752
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,917
and he's like, "No, you can't be
with my niece",

753
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:08,919
and then he meets this
homeless wanderer,

754
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:11,021
but that's the scene
he's doing today, so tomorrow...

755
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:14,425
Okay, I don't mean to be rude,
but I like don't care.

756
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,493
Okay, that's fair,

757
00:56:15,526 --> 00:56:17,694
but you have to come
to his opening day with me.

758
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,330
There's no way I can make Adam.

759
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:20,663
Yeah, fine.

760
00:56:20,697 --> 00:56:22,099
Hey, you know who's kinda cute?

761
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:26,003
Uh, that guy Eli, he has
the locker like really close

762
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:27,905
to mine.

763
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:29,006
Or him.

764
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:30,107
Hey Harper.

765
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:31,008
Hey?

766
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,276
Abby.

767
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:34,245
What's going on?

768
00:56:34,278 --> 00:56:36,213
Nothing much, we're...
we're pretty good.

769
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:37,714
Cool.

770
00:56:37,747 --> 00:56:39,850
Well, say hi to your brother
for me.

771
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:41,252
Okay.

772
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:43,787
And your boyfriend.

773
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:45,222
I will!

774
00:56:45,256 --> 00:56:48,058
Why are all your brother's
friends hot?

775
00:56:48,092 --> 00:56:49,659
Why?!

776
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:07,811
What?

777
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:11,482
You're like stalking me now?

778
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:12,850
You're my best friend, Adam,

779
00:57:12,883 --> 00:57:15,486
and... and I don't wanna
bum you out.

780
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,088
Then why are you doing something
that's bumming me out?

781
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,193
Whatever, man.

782
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,229
What did you think would happen
when you decided

783
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:27,965
to lose your virginity
to my sister?

784
00:57:27,998 --> 00:57:31,368
That we'd still just hang out
and watch The Flash?

785
00:57:31,402 --> 00:57:32,870
It's not happening, dude.

786
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:49,053
Hey, what's up?

787
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:50,754
I can't.

788
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:51,989
I just I can't.

789
00:57:52,022 --> 00:57:52,990
Adam...

790
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:55,226
Tilly, what's wrong?

791
00:58:04,134 --> 00:58:06,070
It's like we're all hanging out,
you know playing video games

792
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:08,539
in the basement,
Dodson and Turney were there,

793
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,140
then all of a sudden,
Turney was like,

794
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:12,443
"Fuck you, dude!"
and he was like flippin' out!

795
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:16,146
Hey Justin,
what are you talking about?

796
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,183
I mean I... I heard Adam's name,
so I was just wondering.

797
00:58:19,216 --> 00:58:21,185
Look, Liam's the one who called
you a slut.

798
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:23,320
- That wasn't me.
- What?

799
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:26,557
You know, 'cause, you've had sex
with like three dudes.

800
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,159
And Liam was just telling Adam
what he already knew.

801
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,469
And so I was like, I was
like, "I don't even know you",

802
00:58:38,502 --> 00:58:39,303
you know?

803
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:41,071
Like there was no,
no possible way

804
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:42,106
that I was gonna...

805
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,175
So he's just like,
he's getting like

806
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:46,243
way up in my space.

807
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:47,311
I'm like, "Who you tryna fight?"

808
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:48,212
You know, he's tryna fight,
bro.

809
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:49,179
Hey Liam!

810
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:50,481
Yeah?

811
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:52,049
What makes you think
if you can tell someone's

812
00:58:52,082 --> 00:58:54,051
a virgin or not?

813
00:58:54,985 --> 00:58:56,954
Well, I mean, I heard you
talking about

814
00:58:56,987 --> 00:58:59,523
how I'm not one and we all know
you make a game out

815
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:02,893
of pointing out everyone else.

816
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:05,462
Is it if someone's throwing
themselves at you or not

817
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,464
or maybe it's the way
their makeup is

818
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:09,333
or how they dress.

819
00:59:09,366 --> 00:59:11,201
Maybe it's their shorts.

820
00:59:11,235 --> 00:59:17,041
Or is if someone's had
hands down their pants or not.

821
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:21,612
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

822
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,981
See you in history.

823
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:37,094
Um, what do you wanna do?

824
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:38,295
I don't know.

825
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:49,340
Liam's such a dick.

826
00:59:52,543 --> 00:59:55,646
I'm sorry Liam
said those things.

827
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,117
Yeah, I mean, it's...
it's complete bullshit.

828
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,654
Anyway, what's going on
between you and Adam, though?

829
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,655
I don't know.

830
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:07,391
I mean, he's really pissed.

831
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:10,661
He's never really liked this.

832
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:12,429
Us, you know.

833
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:14,064
Yeah.

834
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:18,102
But whatever.

835
01:00:18,135 --> 01:00:19,136
Yeah.

836
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:20,938
Yeah, it's whatever.

837
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:24,441
Um, do you wanna keep
watching this?

838
01:00:24,475 --> 01:00:27,378
Um, not really.

839
01:00:30,581 --> 01:00:32,282
- Wait, I didn't know that.
- Really?

840
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:33,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

841
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:33,717
I thought I told you that
earlier.

842
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:35,419
Oh my God, what instrument?

843
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:37,287
Uh, a trumpet.

844
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:39,022
Okay, bye.

845
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:39,957
Bye.

846
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,561
Hi.

847
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:46,196
I heard Henry's throwing
a party tonight,

848
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,030
are you gonna go?

849
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,600
If you do,
please don't bring him.

850
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:50,467
Uh, well...

851
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:51,435
What's up?

852
01:00:51,468 --> 01:00:52,603
Um, we haven't talked about it.

853
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:54,304
But if Tilly wants to,
then maybe.

854
01:00:54,338 --> 01:00:57,040
Oh my God, do you even listen
to a word I say?

855
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:59,343
Wait, how are your parents
letting you go?

856
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:01,145
- Maddie, your mom is...
- I'm sneaking out.

857
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:03,113
I have my story straight
and everything.

858
01:01:03,147 --> 01:01:04,448
I'm super ready.

859
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:05,582
Are you guys dressing up?

860
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:07,151
MADISON and ABBY:
Yeah!

861
01:01:07,184 --> 01:01:09,520
So what's up with
your girlfriend

862
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:11,321
and Liam Erwell?

863
01:01:11,355 --> 01:01:14,725
Why are you always asking about
my girlfriend anyway?

864
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:15,926
I don't know.

865
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:18,695
Plus, I mean apparently
she grabbed his dick yesterday.

866
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:20,297
I just thought
there'd be a story.

867
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,365
What?

868
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:24,201
Oh, are you going
to Ben Linkson's party tonight?

869
01:01:26,036 --> 01:01:29,606
Sorry, Tilly,
I thought you knew.

870
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,209
I'm... I'm gonna go to class.

871
01:01:32,242 --> 01:01:33,076
Okay.

872
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,278
Bye.

873
01:01:42,586 --> 01:01:45,989
Is it weird to be
in your dad's bathroom?

874
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:51,161
Um, I mean not really,
it's kind of both of ours, so.

875
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:51,995
I don't know.

876
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:55,265
Well, I meant like,
here with me.

877
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:57,201
Oh, no, it's fine.

878
01:01:59,403 --> 01:02:01,271
Okay, cool.

879
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,607
Are you ready to go?

880
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,310
Are you sure you wanna go?

881
01:02:06,343 --> 01:02:07,244
Yeah.

882
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:08,412
Yeah, why?

883
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,514
Why wouldn't I wanna go?

884
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:13,283
Why wouldn't you want me to go?

885
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,787
No, that's... that's not
what I meant.

886
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,256
I just... never mind.

887
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:20,591
Okay, let's go.

888
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,039
Trick or treat.

889
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:20,484
Um, so.

890
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:27,257
Hey guys.

891
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:28,760
Holy shit,
it's the dick grabber.

892
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:34,464
Hey, man.

893
01:03:34,498 --> 01:03:36,133
How's Harper?

894
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,735
Oh, she's... she's cool.

895
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,572
So my brother dropped my ball
yesterday,

896
01:03:41,605 --> 01:03:42,706
it went everywhere.

897
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,108
I wanna go to my mom about it,
but then she'll be like,

898
01:03:45,142 --> 01:03:46,677
"Hey, this is good for you."

899
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:53,283
Oh it's fine,
she doesn't like him anyways.

900
01:03:54,718 --> 01:03:56,520
What?

901
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:58,121
You just need to chill, Tilly.

902
01:03:58,155 --> 01:03:59,891
Harper is an independent woman.

903
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,826
She just needs
her butterfly time.

904
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:04,829
'Cause, she's a
beautiful butterfly, you know.

905
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:06,831
Why are you telling me this?

906
01:04:06,864 --> 01:04:07,564
Look, Turney.

907
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,766
I'm not mad about what you did.

908
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,903
If you weren't with Dodson,
I'd ask you to do it again.

909
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:13,871
I think you're dumber
being with him anyway.

910
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:15,238
We told her that, too.

911
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:16,774
Dick grabber!

912
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:17,875
Where's Dodson?

913
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:19,476
Harper!

914
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:21,511
Harper! Harper!

915
01:04:21,545 --> 01:04:24,414
Harper!

916
01:04:26,216 --> 01:04:26,784
Hey.

917
01:04:31,688 --> 01:04:32,857
Do you wanna go?

918
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:36,526
Yeah, yeah.

919
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,795
You're right.

920
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:42,834
Yeah, Dodson.

921
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:47,504
Dude.

922
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:49,239
- What gives?
- What?

923
01:04:49,272 --> 01:04:50,674
You've been in a shit mood
all night

924
01:04:50,707 --> 01:04:52,209
and I'm the one who has...

925
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:56,213
- You're the one who what?
- Nothing.

926
01:04:56,246 --> 01:04:58,615
Just I'm the one who has to deal
with Liam

927
01:04:58,649 --> 01:04:59,884
and all those other jerks.

928
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:01,953
So I don't understand
what your problem is.

929
01:05:01,986 --> 01:05:03,855
Yeah, well, then why were you
even hanging out

930
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:05,790
with Liam anyways?

931
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:06,924
It's not like I wanted, too,

932
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,526
he just kidnapped my friends,
okay?

933
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:10,527
Yeah, and I...

934
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,565
I bet you didn't wanna
touch his dick either.

935
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,534
How do you know about that?

936
01:05:22,472 --> 01:05:24,174
Tilly!

937
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:28,612
Tilly!
I like you.

938
01:05:28,645 --> 01:05:30,982
And I've never said
anything to you about this,

939
01:05:31,015 --> 01:05:32,449
but I hear stuff about you.

940
01:05:32,482 --> 01:05:34,986
Stuff like... like you're a slut,
or...

941
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:37,421
This is what I'm talking about,
Tilly.

942
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:39,589
You have no idea.

943
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:42,426
You're so busy feeling hurt
about Adam,

944
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:44,327
that you don't bother
to think about

945
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,998
what it's like for me,
for girls.

946
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:50,001
I have sex with you, only you.

947
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:52,602
And all of a sudden,
I'm like this slut.

948
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:53,503
And you have sex

949
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:55,807
and you're part of
some cool boys club.

950
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,474
And you're the one
who touched Liam's dick,

951
01:05:57,507 --> 01:06:02,612
so just fucking tell me
what that's about, and wait,

952
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:03,747
don't actually.

953
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:05,649
Abby pretty much told me that
you already had feelings

954
01:06:05,682 --> 01:06:07,885
- for someone else.
- What?

955
01:06:07,919 --> 01:06:09,453
I don't.

956
01:06:11,956 --> 01:06:13,557
I don't know, Harper.

957
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,995
Part of me just thinks that,
that we should...

958
01:06:18,029 --> 01:06:20,630
That we should what?

959
01:06:20,664 --> 01:06:22,934
I don't know, break up.

960
01:06:25,937 --> 01:06:27,772
Okay.

961
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:28,739
Wait, what?

962
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:31,408
You wanna break up?

963
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:33,376
Yeah, sure.

964
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,880
I mean if you're gonna keep
freaking out about Adam

965
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:37,380
and my friends are gonna think

966
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,382
I'm lame for hanging out
with you

967
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,787
and everyone is gonna have
something to say about it,

968
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,956
then yeah, why the hell not?

969
01:06:44,989 --> 01:06:45,890
Harper, I...

970
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:49,060
No one likes us together,
don't you get it?

971
01:06:49,093 --> 01:06:51,361
So neither do I.

972
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:09,947
Just leave me alone.

973
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:12,582
Give me my own block,
I deserve at least that.

974
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:45,442
Don't say that!

975
01:08:48,112 --> 01:08:51,048
I can breakdance,
did you know that?

976
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:53,084
It's more of a pop and lock
situation.

977
01:08:53,117 --> 01:08:54,051
- See that so?
- Nope.

978
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:55,552
Did you see that?

979
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:57,420
Woah, woah!

980
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:00,925
Woah!

981
01:09:24,115 --> 01:09:25,049
Sup Dodson?

982
01:09:33,224 --> 01:09:36,827
What are you, gay or something?

983
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't think so.

984
01:09:38,695 --> 01:09:40,164
Are you?

985
01:09:40,197 --> 01:09:42,166
Not me.

986
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:21,172
Hi.

987
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:26,743
Um, I thought it'd be less weird
if... it's just if you came over,

988
01:10:26,777 --> 01:10:30,147
it'd be like... I thought
you would need these,

989
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:32,515
especially this.

990
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:37,922
How... how's it going?

991
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:41,125
Honestly, I don't even know.

992
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:43,894
Me neither.

993
01:10:43,928 --> 01:10:45,997
Are you okay?

994
01:10:47,597 --> 01:10:49,300
Yeah, I... I don't know.

995
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,902
I'm still...

996
01:10:51,936 --> 01:10:53,771
Yeah.

997
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:57,041
- Thanks for...
- Yeah.

998
01:10:57,074 --> 01:10:58,275
For these, yeah...

999
01:10:58,309 --> 01:11:02,746
Yeah um, I should get going
I have homework anyway, so...

1000
01:12:05,076 --> 01:12:07,378
How dare ye?!

1001
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:09,746
Did I offend your highness?

1002
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,216
Thus do all traitors
if their purgation

1003
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,051
did consist in words,

1004
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:16,653
they are innocent
as grace itself.

1005
01:12:16,686 --> 01:12:18,823
Let it suffice that
I trust thee not.

1006
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,392
Yet your mistrust cannot make me
a traitor.

1007
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:23,794
Tell me whereon
the likelihood depends.

1008
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:26,964
Thou art thy father's daughter,
that's enough.

1009
01:12:28,099 --> 01:12:29,300
Halt!

1010
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,637
O excellent, young man!

1011
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:37,908
If I had thunderbolt in mine eye
I can tell who should down!

1012
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:38,409
That's enough.

1013
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,311
That's enough.

1014
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:48,285
No and yes, and no and yes,
and no and yes,

1015
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:54,291
and no and yes, and no and yes,
and no and yes, and no and yes.

1016
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:56,026
That was so fun.

1017
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,027
Yeah, that was really fun.

1018
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:58,195
I can't wait until next year.

1019
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:59,363
Yeah, what are we gonna do
next year?

1020
01:12:59,396 --> 01:13:00,931
- What's...
- Maybe Romeo and Juliet.

1021
01:13:00,965 --> 01:13:02,233
- That would be...
- That's so awesome.

1022
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:03,000
Yeah.

1023
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:05,169
Dude, you were...
you were so good!

1024
01:13:05,202 --> 01:13:06,871
- Good job!
- Thank you.

1025
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,239
Yeah.

1026
01:13:08,272 --> 01:13:10,307
You were really good, Tilly.

1027
01:13:10,341 --> 01:13:11,674
Thanks.

1028
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:14,845
You were great.

1029
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,882
- Isn't he good?
- Yeah.

1030
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:18,949
Yeah, super good.

1031
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:22,353
- Go, go, go.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1032
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:23,320
- Come on, no!
- Yes!

1033
01:13:23,354 --> 01:13:24,288
- Go!
- No, I!

1034
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:25,289
- Yes!
- Go, Go!

1035
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:26,123
No! No! No!

1036
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:27,191
- I won!
- You cheater! You cheater!

1037
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:30,294
- How did I cheat?
- I won! I won! I won! I won!

1038
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,429
I won! I won!

1039
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:33,497
...this one graphic novel.

1040
01:13:33,531 --> 01:13:36,200
But my teacher said that
there's too many vicarious

1041
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:37,268
to account for my...

1042
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:38,936
Hey Harper!

1043
01:13:38,969 --> 01:13:40,104
Hey, Josh.

1044
01:13:40,137 --> 01:13:41,172
How's it going?

1045
01:14:09,066 --> 01:14:09,500
Sing!

1046
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:11,769
Sing me a song!

1047
01:14:11,802 --> 01:14:15,372
Sing us a song, Adam.

1048
01:14:19,643 --> 01:14:22,246
And that's why racial tolerance
and inclusivity

1049
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:24,114
are important parts of feminism.

1050
01:14:24,148 --> 01:14:25,516
Actually, most.

1051
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:28,886
Because, without them,
women will never truly be free.

1052
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:31,755
You know, I agree Harper, but...

1053
01:14:31,789 --> 01:14:33,390
Personally, Mr. Sloan,

1054
01:14:33,424 --> 01:14:35,793
I don't think there's any room
for buts.

1055
01:14:35,826 --> 01:14:38,862
Our generation isn't gonna
tolerate buts when it comes to

1056
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:41,799
equality for women
regardless of race.

1057
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:44,368
I mean, just ask the internet.

1058
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,904
Yeah, I... I think she's right.

1059
01:14:46,937 --> 01:14:49,406
Harper, we... we have
a few minutes.

1060
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,877
Do you have any thoughts
you wanna share about why

1061
01:14:53,911 --> 01:15:00,251
you think women of color have
traditionally been oppressed?

1062
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:02,920
Um, yeah.

1063
01:15:02,953 --> 01:15:04,922
Yeah, I do.

1064
01:15:14,965 --> 01:15:16,200
Hey.

1065
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:25,042
Are you walking to school?

1066
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:38,489
Um, are you sad the play's over?

1067
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:44,461
Yeah, I mean, it's always
really hard working on

1068
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:46,930
something for so long and then,
I don't know.

1069
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:52,202
It's just... it's just over.

1070
01:15:52,236 --> 01:15:55,339
Thanks for coming by the way.

1071
01:15:55,372 --> 01:15:59,043
Yeah, I mean I was glad to,
actually.

1072
01:15:59,076 --> 01:16:03,280
Um, I guess, just to finally see
all the hard work pay off.

1073
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,218
But I don't know, I mean yeah,
everything's...

1074
01:16:08,252 --> 01:16:10,954
everything's going good.

1075
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:13,390
I'm starting a debate club
after Christmas break.

1076
01:16:13,424 --> 01:16:15,292
So...

1077
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,361
I don't know.

1078
01:16:17,394 --> 01:16:19,496
It's just something
my teacher recommended, really.

1079
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:22,066
But it will be cool to try.

1080
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:27,271
I got another letter from India,
from my cousin or whatever.

1081
01:16:27,304 --> 01:16:28,639
Yeah?

1082
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,641
What did it... what did it say?

1083
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,610
Well, apparently
there was a storm.

1084
01:16:33,644 --> 01:16:37,981
And her goat died,
unfortunately.

1085
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,586
Um, the power went out,
but it's back now.

1086
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:48,492
Sometimes I... I reread
these letters and I just wonder

1087
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:53,297
if... am I really related to her?

1088
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:57,901
Or is she just some woman that's
tryna mess with me, you know?

1089
01:16:57,935 --> 01:16:59,670
I don't know,
you could write back

1090
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:03,941
and like, pretend to be someone
completely different.

1091
01:17:03,974 --> 01:17:08,078
Um, but then again
don't take my advice.

1092
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:11,081
Maybe...
maybe you like the letters.

1093
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:17,388
What do you... what do you have
for lunch today?

1094
01:17:19,523 --> 01:17:22,292
Well, my dad made me
a sushi wrap,

1095
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:25,929
but I think I'm gonna go with
a burrito today.

1096
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:28,599
What about you?

1097
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:31,068
I kind of want a pizza.

1098
01:21:13,486 --> 01:21:18,486
