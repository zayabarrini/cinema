1
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:47,459
When it comes to the Mock Elections,
we will have three fictional parties.

2
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:55,301
Blue, which represents freedom
and equality.

3
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,179
Red represents industrial development.

4
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:06,061
And yellow represents preservation.

5
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:10,774
You can cast your vote for any of these.

6
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
<i>His Majesty, the king,
announced he will abdicate</i>

7
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,748
<i>so that we can become a "democracy."</i>

8
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:22,424
<i>People can now choose a new leader
through a process called "elections."</i>

9
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:27,679
<i>But our country has never
had elections before.</i>

10
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,809
<i>In four days,
the government will hold a "Mock Election"</i>

11
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,853
<i>so that everyone can understand
this process.</i>

12
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>To explain, here is the Head of the Bhutan
Election Commission, Tshering Yangden.</i>

13
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,529
<i>Thank you.</i>

14
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,075
<i>This is a historical moment.</i>

15
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:53,288
<i>Our election officials are all over
the country.</i>

16
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,751
<i>I will be going to the village of Ura</i>

17
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>to serve the country
to the best of my abilities.</i>

18
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,593
<i>I hope citizens will come together
for this monumental process.</i>

19
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,650
Tashi, I need guns.

20
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,117
Can you get me guns?

21
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,791
I don't know, Lama.
I have never even seen one before.

22
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,211
I need two guns.

23
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,551
I need them by Full Moon.

24
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,678
Things need to be made right again.

25
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,766
It's so sad.

26
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,727
What is, Lama?

27
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,232
Our country, it's changing.

28
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,664
<i>♪ Now look at them yo-yo's
That's the way you do it ♪</i>

29
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,877
<i>♪ You play the guitar on the MTV ♪</i>

30
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,339
<i>♪ That ain't workin'
That's the way you do it ♪</i>

31
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,341
<i>♪ Money for nothin'... ♪</i>

32
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,589
The dialysis machine is free today,
can you take me?

33
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
Did you hear me?

34
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:21,103
I don't think I have time,
I need to be away for a few days.

35
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,731
Can you manage on your own?

36
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,284
Breakfast? I was going to make something.

37
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,206
If I eat, I'll be late,
I really need to go.

38
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,582
Take your medicines on time.

39
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,768
Ap Dorji brought a new TV!

40
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,941
The biggest one in our village.

41
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:13,947
Last time he paraded that yak leg around

42
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:20,203
just to announce
he was eating yak that night.

43
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,500
Dorji! Congratulations!

44
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,377
Thank you!

45
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,509
Everyone knows
he sold his two cows to buy it.

46
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,150
We also got a TV, even if it's an old one.

47
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,453
But do we parade it in front of everyone?

48
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,433
<i>stroke with a feather.</i>

49
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,518
<i>For others...</i>

50
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,645
It's on!

51
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,231
<i>and care about vengeance.</i>

52
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,318
Wow! I can't believe it!

53
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,989
Our country's own TV channel!
A Bhutanese TV channel!

54
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,075
We are indeed a modern country now!

55
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,804
<i>people of Ura,
learn how to vote in the Mock Election</i>

56
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,349
<i>so you can vote for me, "Lodro,"
in the general elections.</i>

57
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,018
<i>Remember how my family always served you.</i>

58
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,188
Can't believe this idiot represents
the "freedom and equality" party.

59
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,859
Imagine our country
if he wins the elections.

60
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,697
What's worse is
your mother is voting for him.

61
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,042
You know they are fattening up two pigs?

62
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,132
Lodro will slaughter them to throw a party
when he launches his election campaign.

63
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,345
Our villagers flock
to wherever there is free pork.

64
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,265
Just like flies hovering over shit.

65
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,017
They are so cunning, it's disgusting.

66
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,729
Ah.

67
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,818
Thinley must win the elections.

68
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,949
Enough of being servants
to Lodro's family.

69
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,411
Such feudal systems cannot exist
in today's world.

70
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,250
I can't agree with your mother
on this matter.

71
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,962
I really don't care about all this.

72
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,799
The head of Elections
is coming here tomorrow.

73
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,344
The village headman wants me
to be her assistant.

74
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,392
Wow! We also have a TV?

75
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,439
Yes, we do.
This was given to us by Uncle Thinley.

76
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:41,071
But you know Ap Dorji has a new one
that's way bigger.

77
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,243
But he had to sell his cows for that TV.

78
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:50,580
Thanks to Uncle Thinley,
we never have to sell our cows.

79
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,210
Oh, okay, Dad, but did you get my eraser?

80
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,548
I forgot to get them.

81
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:05,011
I have been busy
with the upcoming elections.

82
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,306
Dad, what is elections?

83
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,603
Let's say I am busy right now
so one day you can be the Prime Minister.

84
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,232
I don't want to be the Prime Minister,
I just want my eraser.

85
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:22,320
Okay, I will make sure I get an eraser
for the future Prime Minister of Bhutan.

86
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,114
Okay.

87
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:30,203
Anyway, I need to go help Thinley
with his campaign.

88
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,999
See you later.

89
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:48,179
Lama, these are for you
until I get back.

90
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,058
Make sure you get them
by the Full Moon.

91
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,435
Yes, of course, Lama.

92
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,236
<i>In other international news,</i>

93
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>Bhutan, a country
that was the last in the world</i>

94
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,492
<i>to connect to the Internet
and even allow televisions,</i>

95
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,079
<i>has just also become
the world's youngest democracy,</i>

96
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,417
<i>with the kingdom's
beloved 51-year-old monarch abdicating</i>

97
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,711
<i>in favor of democratic reforms.</i>

98
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,673
<i>The government is teaching
their mostly rural population</i>

99
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,344
<i>about their newfound democratic rights
and privileges.</i>

100
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,764
<i>But strangely,
many Bhutanese don't want this change...</i>

101
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,643
<i>...and the democratic transition
has been highly unpopular.</i>

102
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,483
Yes, Phurba, I am coming to Ura now.

103
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,236
The voter registration there
has been a disaster.

104
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,075
What have you guys been doing?

105
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:59,250
You know CNN, BBC and even Al Jazeera
are covering our elections.

106
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:07,967
Imagine how embarrassing it would be
if the world saw empty polling stations.

107
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,138
The Mock Election has to succeed.

108
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,891
Okay.

109
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,475
Oh, it's you, Master Tashi.
Are you going down?

110
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,187
Yes, I am going down.
Are you going up?

111
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,439
Yes, I am going up.

112
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,572
Ron, please.

113
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,747
So listen, uh, Ron, if anyone asks,

114
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:47,001
you are here to visit Buddhist temples
and, uh, I am your guide, okay?

115
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,841
Well, if it is the one,
I hope the price is right.

116
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,638
For how much you are offering,
they'd be crazy to refuse.

117
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,961
Tshomo, everything well?

118
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,045
How have you been?

119
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:36,759
So, you and Yuphel don't visit me
these days.

120
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,514
- Do you have enough to eat?
- You don't have to worry about us.

121
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,440
Where did Choephel go?

122
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,692
He should be helping you with work.

123
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,904
Useless husband.

124
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,782
I warned you from the start
that you shouldn't mix water and milk.

125
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,869
Our traditions have to be maintained.

126
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,372
Lodro has to win the elections.

127
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,292
Do you need some money?

128
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,878
It's okay, we are getting by.

129
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,424
Here, buy Yuphel some sweets.

130
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,813
Thank you, Mother.

131
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,488
- I'll get going, then.
- I am sorry we don't have any.

132
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,241
It's okay. I'll look in other houses.

133
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,994
In fact,
I have never seen a gun in my life.

134
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,038
I haven't either.

135
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:52,669
Ap Penjor might have them,
you should go check his house.

136
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,838
Thank you, I will go check there.

137
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,924
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

138
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,083
- So, we're all set for today?
- Yes.

139
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,794
We'll be going
to our contact person's house.

140
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,087
It's a five-hour drive.

141
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,914
- Good morning!
- Please, come sit.

142
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,174
Good morning.

143
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,810
Good morning. Please, come sit.

144
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,362
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

145
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,157
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

146
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,914
<i>America, demand your MTV!</i>

147
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,588
What do you want?

148
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,592
Mmm. Can I have this black water?

149
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,348
<i>I'm motivated by my duty.</i>

150
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,279
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

151
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,364
Can you tend to the people outside?

152
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,581
<i>This man and I have
some unfinished business.</i>

153
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,304
So listen, uncles.

154
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,432
Do you know about
the upcoming Mock Elections?

155
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:40,771
I heard we need to choose a new leader,

156
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,650
but what's the use?

157
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,070
We already have His Majesty.

158
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,241
Ah, it's the political system in India.

159
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,870
Their leaders are pulling
each other's beards,

160
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,998
throwing chairs at each other,

161
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,375
and now we want to bring that
to our country?

162
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:06,881
This is a very serious matter!

163
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:11,344
I came all this way
to make sure you all take part.

164
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:18,100
People in other countries are willing
to kill each other for this right.

165
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,685
Our king has gifted us this,

166
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,648
you should at least learn
how you can enjoy this gift!

167
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,650
- Yes.
- Well, isn't it?

168
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,734
Yes.

169
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:32,949
Here, take these.

170
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,204
Make sure you are there
for the Mock Election.

171
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,855
Hey, who is that hero?

172
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,816
That's James Bond.

173
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,153
They call him 007.

174
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,240
<i>Some men are coming to kill us.</i>

175
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,536
- 007.
<i>- We're gonna kill them first.</i>

176
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,020
Your father is a traitor
for supporting an outsider!

177
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,397
You people should leave our village!

178
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:55,740
Good afternoon, everyone!
My name is Phurba.

179
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,829
We are from the election office,
to teach you all how to vote.

180
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,582
The Mock Election will be in three days.

181
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:10,546
For that, we are providing you
a choice of fictional parties.

182
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:15,176
Three of them: red, blue and yellow.

183
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:19,263
Just vote for the one you think
will bring you the most happiness.

184
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,517
Before we get to the Mock Election,
we need to register each of you.

185
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,188
- Your name, please?
- Wangda.

187
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,482
- Wangda what?
- Just Wangda.

188
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,566
Just Wangda?

189
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,278
- How about your date of birth?
- Wooden rabbit.

190
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,906
No, no, I need date, month and year.

191
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,950
Hmm. That I don't know.

192
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:47,833
My parents told me that I was born
when the king was 15 years old.

193
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,168
Oh, well.

194
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,672
Don't any of you know your own birthdays?

195
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:58,260
If this is the case, please go back home

196
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,264
and come back
when you know your birthdays!

197
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:08,396
But please come back to register.
Those without birthdays, please go!

198
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,691
How would we know
such useless information?

199
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,287
Madame, you got here so early.

200
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,791
This is Tshomo.

201
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,962
The village headman assigned her
to help us.

202
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,881
Look at this, Phurba!

203
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,260
You all came here before me,
yet it's still such a mess.

204
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,470
If I am not here,
you can't do anything right.

205
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,560
I think we will need to go door-to-door
and drag everyone to get registered.

206
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,604
- We leave first thing tomorrow morning.
- Yes, madame.

207
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,609
Idiot!

208
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,779
- Why couldn't you tell me she was here?
- Sorry, sir.

209
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,615
Now start registering
whoever is left.

210
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,741
Yes, sir.

211
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,994
Hello, name please?

212
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,291
<i>...I am going to vote,
are you going to?</i>

213
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:59,465
<i>Concerned about our country's economy?
Then please go and vote.</i>

214
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,972
How was school, my dear?

215
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,311
What happened?

216
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:20,319
Tell me, what happened?

217
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,031
Nothing, I was playing and I fell.

218
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,159
Look at your clothes,
they're all covered in dirt.

219
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,372
- Tell me, what happened?
- Nothing.

220
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,999
I can tell when something is wrong.

221
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:44,760
<i>If you love your country,
you should go vote!</i>

222
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,229
Mommy, today, the teacher got angry at me.

223
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,569
I did not have an eraser.

224
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,072
I corrected my mistakes
with my handkerchief

225
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,658
and it tore up the pages.

226
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,827
The teacher shouted at me.

227
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,705
All these pages tore.

228
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:18,669
It's okay, dear, we'll go to the market
tomorrow and get you an eraser.

229
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:24,633
<i>We need to break away
from the past</i>

230
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:30,347
<i>and work together
for what modernization brings us.</i>

231
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,183
<i>People of Ura, for the General Election,</i>

232
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:39,732
<i>please cast your sacred vote for me,</i>
"<i>Thinley."</i>

233
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,737
Mommy.

234
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,742
Friends said
Dad supports "industrial development."

235
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:55,748
It doesn't matter what they say.
Don't worry about such things.

236
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:05,299
And my cousins said Dad is a traitor
for not agreeing with Grandma.

237
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,550
Is Dad a traitor?

238
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,593
Greetings!
- Hello, Mr. Benji!

239
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,180
Come sit here.

240
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,102
If you told us you were coming,
we could have prepared lunch for you.

241
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,528
Bumo, bring the item.

242
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:14,076
He is the foreigner
I told you about.

243
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,996
A friend of mine, Mr. Ron.

244
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,561
Mr. Ron is actually a gun collector.

245
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,065
Don't worry about selling your gun to him.

246
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,277
He is very knowledgeable and respected.

247
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,530
It's only right to sell it to him.

248
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:56,869
The gun has been here for generations.

249
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,998
This is an American Civil War rifle.

250
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,461
But look at the serial number.

251
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,047
This one is so rare.

252
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,762
We've been searching for this
all over the world for the last 30 years.

253
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,974
It looks like this gun is...

254
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,687
like a long-lost treasure for him
and his people.

255
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,578
Tell him, I'll give him $75,000.

256
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,747
Seventy-five thousand?

257
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,753
Auspiciousness comes
to those with good hearts!

258
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,546
He wants to give you...

259
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:58,680
3.5 million Ngultrums for this gun.

260
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,683
My, my...

261
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,520
That's too much.

262
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:11,068
I feel uncomfortable accepting that much.
It's not like I am selling him a diamond.

263
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:16,240
- I just wouldn't feel right.
- No, no, just listen.

264
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,117
I told him about your debts.

265
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:24,456
He understands
the difficult situation you are in.

266
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,376
He is being kind to help you out.

267
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,544
Not enough?

268
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,464
No problem, I can go up to 85K.

269
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,717
No, no!
He thinks the amount's too high.

270
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,469
He wants something lesser than that.

271
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,266
What?

272
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,274
So, how does 1.5 million Ngultrums sound?

273
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:56,989
Well, 1.5 million still is very generous,
but it's more acceptable.

274
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,908
So it's a deal?
- Sure.

275
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,078
Hey, Ron, done deal.

276
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,373
Wait, what?

277
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,792
USD 32,000.

278
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:15,173
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

279
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,176
So, it's all done. Okay.

280
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,512
There's a bank
a couple of hours from here.

281
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,891
So we'll do the withdrawal and then
come back tomorrow morning. Is it good?

282
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:29,605
Tomorrow, we will pay you,
and you give us the gun then.

283
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,689
Okay.

284
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,441
Ah, yeah. Okay.

285
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,277
Okay, give me that.

286
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,698
Remember, it's 1.5 million,
there's five zeros in that.

287
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,534
Look after it well.

288
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,681
Ah. Here we go.

289
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,978
- Hello, Ap Penjor.
- Hello.

290
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,772
- Are you well?
- Yes.

291
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,815
- You look good.
- All is well.

292
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,400
- Please, come inside.
- Yes.

293
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,249
What is it?

294
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:36,546
I am busy here for the sake of both of us.

295
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,925
But we have to pay our bills.

296
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,262
<i>If you need money,
check under the mattress.</i>

297
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,348
<i>I need to go.</i>

298
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,434
Hello?

299
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,442
Does Benji live here?
- Yes.

300
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,445
- Call him.
- He is not here at the moment.

301
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,780
Where did he go?

302
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,534
He said he would be back in a few days.

303
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,371
- Who are you?
- I am his wife.

304
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,969
Is Benji into antique trading?

305
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,847
No, that was given to him by his parents.

306
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,103
Is Benji with any foreign guests?

307
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,731
Guess what. I found it.

308
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,400
Yeah.

309
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,695
Yeah, it was with some Bhutanese farmer
in the middle of nowhere.

310
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,198
No, he has no idea how much it's worth.

311
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,827
Can you believe it, after all these years?

312
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:51,788
Yeah.

313
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,875
Okay, so I should have it by tomorrow.

314
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,001
Call me then.

315
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,134
This man seems to be involved with guns.

316
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,220
It seems he has entered Bhutan,

317
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,556
and we are wondering
what he is doing here.

318
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:13,018
Our search revealed
that Benji is his registered guide.

319
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:17,022
- Do you know anything about this?
- No, I don't know anything.

320
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,901
I doubt Benji would be involved
in gun trading.

321
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,111
I mean, is there gun in Bhutan?

322
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,781
Does this look like a toy to you?

323
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,577
Call me the moment
Benji gets in touch with you.

324
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,661
Okay.

325
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,765
<i>The subscriber
you have dialed is switched off.</i>

326
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,275
Here you go, master.

327
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,363
Wow, this is really heavy.

328
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,449
Of course it is.

329
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,579
It is a precious antique.

330
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,751
They say it killed many Tibetans
during the wars.

331
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:24,464
We had forgotten about it.

332
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:29,386
Just left it in storage.

333
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:34,432
No one really cared about it.
Until today, this foreigner--

334
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,395
- But does it still work?
- Of course it does.

335
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,318
Why would Lama want a gun?

336
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm not sure.

337
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,659
He still has two years left
for his meditation retreat.

338
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,163
Suddenly, he wanted guns.

339
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:08,717
I do owe so much to Lama.

340
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,388
All of us in the village are happy
and peaceful

341
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,934
because of his prayers and blessings.

342
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,605
If he needs it,
please accept this as an offering.

343
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:25,442
That's not acceptable at all.

344
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:29,529
- It is not much, but I must pay you.
- Please, no need.

345
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:34,201
- No, it's inauspicious.
- I simply cannot accept.

346
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:37,996
No, I could never accept money
from a monk.

347
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:45,837
Here then, a betel nut for a gun.

348
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,464
I'll accept a betel nut.

349
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:51,635
There will be no karmic debt between us.

350
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:57,390
Lama will have a ritual on the Full Moon.

351
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,809
You and your daughter must attend.

352
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,647
Of course! We will.
I presume Lama will need bullets as well?

353
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,940
Oh, yes, he will need some.

354
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:29,339
Madame, we went knocking
on every door but--

355
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,967
The entire world is watching us.

356
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,511
It's unacceptable
that we have 10% voter registration.

357
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,765
Democracy is the pinnacle
of Gross National Happiness.

358
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:43,144
We must evolve with the rest of the world.

359
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,791
Who's that?

360
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:09,337
Some useless government official trying
to teach people how to vote.

361
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,508
People need to be taught how to vote?

362
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,015
Let's go, Ron.

363
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,204
Is that a monk? With a gun?

364
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,587
It's Master Tashi.
He is our Lama's attendant.

365
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,891
- Hello, master, where are you off to?
- I am going to our monastery in Ura.

366
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,934
Is something wrong?

367
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,937
We are heading that way,
we can give you a ride.

368
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,482
Hello, Master Tashi.
Where are you coming from?

369
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,275
From Ap Penjor's house.

370
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,904
This is the head
of the Elections office. Please hop in.

371
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:20,116
Let us accumulate some merits
by serving a monk.

372
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,328
Yeah. Yeah, we're on our way.
But, oh, my God, that bank.

373
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,497
Yeah, we got the cash, it's all in a bag.

374
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,583
Oh. Okay, we're almost here.
I'll let you know.

375
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,077
Food?

376
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,004
Tea?

377
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,680
Here you go.

378
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,934
This is all for you.

379
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,282
Don't be upset, I gave it away.

380
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,411
What was that?

381
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,830
You gave the gun away?

382
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,749
- Mm.
- What'd he say?

383
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,880
I didn't quite get you.

384
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:03,887
You keep the money, we take the gun,
that was the arrangement.

385
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:10,560
Yes, but it's too late now.

386
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,106
But we had a deal.

387
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:17,984
Who did you give it to?

388
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,071
So, why are you carrying that?

389
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,157
- Carrying what?
- That gun.

390
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,659
Oh, it's for my Lama.

391
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,495
What is it for?

392
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,831
I don't know.

393
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,043
Lama said he needs to make things right.

394
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,127
Right.

395
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,087
To a monk?

396
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,633
Now, listen...

397
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,722
you put me
in a very awkward position here.

398
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,643
Who is this monk?

399
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:54,020
Why would a monk take our gun?

400
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,984
He is from the Ura monastery.

401
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:04,697
Apparently, the Lama wanted a gun.

402
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,784
So I gave it as an offering.

403
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,539
A Lama with a gun.

404
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,544
Why would a Lama want a gun?

405
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:21,339
What is our country coming to?

406
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:27,262
So, what are you officials doing here?

407
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:31,224
We are here to modernize our country.

408
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:35,228
To teach rural people how to vote.

409
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:39,482
- Have you heard about it?
- Heard about what?

410
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,652
- Elections.
- Oh, I don't know.

411
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:47,448
- Is it that new pig disease?
- Pig disease?

412
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:53,329
No! It's where you choose your new leader.

413
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:54,914
Oh, no.

414
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,292
What happened to His Majesty?

415
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:02,130
His Majesty is still there,
but he's giving up his power to rule.

416
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,969
But why would someone even do that?

417
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:13,391
Because to be democratic is to be modern.

418
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,184
Mmm.

419
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,563
I have never heard about this.

420
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,441
Well, that's because
this is new to Bhutan.

421
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:25,820
I guess it's a teaching of the Buddha?

422
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,574
Well, not really.

423
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,581
Oh, then how can we be so sure
if it will even be good for us?

424
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,838
It doesn't matter
what Buddha taught 2500 years ago.

425
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,258
This is modern thought,
of course it will be good for us.

426
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:54,098
Where did this monk go?

427
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,434
To the monastery.

428
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,231
- When did he leave?
- He left this morning.

429
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,402
- By car or did he walk?
- He walked.

430
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,654
Walking?

431
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:12,450
Hey, Ron, I think
we can catch up with him. Let's go.

432
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,670
Master!
- What?

433
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,965
Tell your Lama
to come attend our Mock Election.

434
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,468
His presence could draw in people.

435
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,638
No, we can't.

436
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:39,477
Lama is planning something important
on the Full Moon day.

437
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,730
Isn't that in two days?

438
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,067
It's on the day
of our Mock Elections.

439
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,153
What is Lama planning to do?

440
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,324
I am not sure.

441
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,453
He said it's to make things right again.

442
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,378
Mmm. Stop here. This is my stop.

443
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,607
- Thank you for the ride.
- See you on the Full Moon.

444
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,318
We will also come for your Lama's event.
Okay.

445
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,711
Hmm. This is perfect!

446
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,088
Religious gatherings always
bring in huge crowds.

447
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,716
Let's set up the Mock Elections there.

448
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:56,429
Yes, madame, villagers gather like flies
for such events.

449
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,376
Master, please wait a moment!

450
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,130
I need to talk to you
about something very important.

451
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,423
How can I help?

452
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,594
My name is Benji,

453
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:41,390
and this is my friend, Mr. Ron.

454
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,772
Do you know the country America?
It's very far away.

455
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:52,693
He's come all this way,
with great difficulty, for that gun.

456
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,367
Yesterday, we went to Ap Penjor's.

457
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:03,871
He said he was in debt,
so I offered to help him.

458
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:09,001
I helped make a deal
between Mr. Ron and Ap Penjor.

459
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:13,172
We were going to buy the gun from him.

460
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,509
But this morning you had taken the gun.

461
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,762
- Can we please have the gun back?
- What?

462
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,390
Please don't joke like this.

463
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,269
Do you realize how much trouble
it was to get it?

464
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:30,898
Wait! We don't want it for free,
let us buy it from you!

465
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:42,451
Wait! Wait! Hold on a second!

466
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,872
Hold on!

467
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:49,041
You are not understanding me here.

468
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,631
Oh!

469
00:52:56,549 --> 00:53:01,304
- What are you doing with so much money?
- This is all for you.

470
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,974
Just give us the gun in return.

471
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,728
No, no, what will I do
with this much money?

472
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:13,149
I don't need money, I need guns.

473
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:18,863
- What's a monk going to do with a gun?
- It's for my Lama.

474
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:23,743
I have been searching
all over for this gun.

475
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,413
Ron, it seems
he doesn't want the money.

476
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,752
Look, tell him I can pay
in lots of dollars.

477
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:34,378
What did he say?

478
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:38,841
He will give you
a lot of dollars for the gun.

479
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,680
Come here, let me show you,

480
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,810
see this shiny green note
with this bald man?

481
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,439
This is the most powerful currency
in the world.

482
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:56,150
Today is your lucky day.

483
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,155
Forget about how powerful dollars are,

484
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,283
some people even sell their kidneys
for dollars.

485
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:08,663
Look, tell him he can name his price

486
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,498
for the gun, anything.

487
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,626
He's even starting to beg now.

488
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:17,213
You wear the Buddha's robes,

489
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:20,341
so I know you are a person
of immense compassion.

490
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,635
Please just give us the gun.

491
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:24,845
I am very sorry.

492
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:29,850
Yes, as a monk,
I am duty-bound to help others.

493
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,230
But just not this time, I'm sorry.

494
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,111
So sir here will shout,
"I want blue," okay?

495
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,407
And then, uh, the grandma in black.

496
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,200
Yes, please come up.

497
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,375
Here, take this.

498
00:54:56,252 --> 00:55:02,675
So sir here will shout,
"I want blue," okay?

499
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,554
When he shouts, "I want blue,"

500
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:10,057
all on this side must shout,
"We don't want blue, we want red!"

501
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,352
Before we begin,
let's divide ourselves into two sides.

502
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,605
From the middle, move to this side,
and you all move to that side.

503
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:23,487
This side is for blue
and that side is for red, understood?

504
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,533
Now to begin, shout, "We want blue."

505
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:31,078
Okay. We want blue.

506
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:35,082
- A bit louder.
- We want blue!

507
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,752
- Still a bit louder.
- We want blue!

508
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:41,505
Yes, just like that.
We want blue!

509
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,091
- We want red!
- We want blue!

510
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,678
Okay, okay, that's enough!

511
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,931
Show some passion!
It's for your new leader!

512
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,268
You aren't supposed to like each other!

513
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,645
Shout louder!

514
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,647
Like you want to hit each other!

515
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:03,069
Well, not really hit,
but act like you want to!

516
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:06,614
You are supposed
to despise each other. Once more!

517
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,491
- We want blue!
- We want red!

518
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:11,660
- Down with red, we want blue!
- Glory to red!

519
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:24,840
Why are you teaching us to be so rude?
This is not who we are.

520
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,927
<i>Down with blue, we want only red!</i>

521
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:30,513
Please wait!

522
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,268
Why doesn't he want the money?

523
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:40,314
I don't know, man, something
about his master wanting the gun.

524
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:42,900
Master?

525
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,278
What are we doing?

526
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,905
Can you just wait a second?

527
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:54,161
Look! It's just an old gun,
it probably doesn't even work.

528
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,206
Look, the gun is very old!

529
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,291
It's not going to benefit you.

530
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:09,009
Well, Ap Penjor said it killed
hundreds of Tibetans during the war.

531
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:13,222
Yes, but the war was a few centuries ago.

532
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,765
It's old talk.

533
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,852
Look at the metal, it's all rusted.

534
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,188
Wouldn't you prefer something new?

535
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,192
Hello? What's happening?

536
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:30,531
I told him it's an old gun.
It would be better if he gets a new gun.

537
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:36,162
Okay, tell him with the money I can offer,
he can buy ten brand-new guns.

538
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,167
Looks like you accumulated
lots of merits in your previous life!

539
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:46,547
Give him the gun, and with his money,
you can buy ten brand-new guns.

540
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:50,134
Ten guns that can kill! What a deal!

541
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,474
Yes, yes, please sit down.
I am telling you the truth.

542
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,769
You would never get such a deal
for rusted junk.

543
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,274
The heavens are showering you
with this opportunity

544
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,944
because you are such a good monk.

545
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,864
Don't squander such opportunities,
grasp it with both hands!

546
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,118
Well, I don't really need ten guns.

547
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,495
But I do need two guns.

548
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,706
That can be done.

549
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,126
Mr. Ron is an expert
when it comes to guns.

550
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:28,839
In his country,
there are more guns than people.

551
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,383
- More guns than people?
- Yes!

552
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,844
Wow, must be a very unique land.

553
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:38,349
Guns are a very important part
of their culture.

554
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:41,101
In their version of the sutras,

555
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:47,024
the second verse states that
all citizens have the right to own guns.

556
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,445
Now, let's not waste time,
just give us this gun.

557
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,573
Okay, so I would need two guns.

558
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,411
So we will give you two guns,
two brand-new guns.

559
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:05,626
That sounds like a fair deal,
don't you think so?

560
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,711
Of course it is a fair deal!

561
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,129
Hey, Ron, Ron.
Yeah?

562
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,675
We'll trade this old gun
for two new guns, is that okay?

563
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,802
- Two guns? For that one?
- Yeah.

564
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:20,599
Okay, you can tell him that he can choose
any gun from this list.

565
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,559
All right.

566
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:30,025
Look at the choice you have.
You can pick any gun from this list.

567
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,569
How is this one?

568
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,654
Hello?

569
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,573
- How about this one?
- No.

570
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,701
Okay, you don't like that one.
Hello? Hello?

571
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:44,331
This is what the American cowboys use.

572
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,041
This one is very cool.

573
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,168
Nah, it's too small.

574
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,629
- Huh?
- It's too small!

575
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,840
A monk. Monk. Like--

576
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,428
Wears robes, meditates--
Yeah, yeah, like a Buddhist monk.

577
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,887
Oh, this one!

578
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:04,143
It's what the hero 007 used on the TV.

579
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,729
I want this one!
Please tell him to get me this one.

580
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,315
- The biggest one?
- Yes, this one.

581
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,485
Now, don't take advantage,
you greedy monk!

582
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:17,990
- Oh!
- No, no, I am looking out for you.

583
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,867
If it's big, it will be heavy.

584
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:22,536
If it's heavy,
it's difficult for you to carry.

585
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,831
If it's small, it's light and easy.

586
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:28,584
- No, I want this!
- This one is better.

587
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,586
No, I want this one.
Tell him to get me this.

588
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:35,799
I don't know what a Buddhist monk wants
with a gun, but listen...

589
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,718
Hello? Hello?

590
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,931
What?

591
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:46,101
He's not budging, man,
he's saying he wants two.

592
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,103
Two AK-47s?

593
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,607
What's he gonna do with AK-47s in Bhutan?

594
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,818
Okay.

595
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,488
Hello, there's a little problem,

596
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:02,326
the monk wants AK-47s for the gun,
two of them.

597
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,207
Hey, master!

598
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:13,170
I am sorry, you are taking too long.
I must return to my Lama.

599
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,089
No, please wait.

600
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:19,927
We are getting you your guns.
It will be here in a few days.

601
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,930
A few days? I don't have a few days.

602
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,599
I need the guns before the Full Moon.

603
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,975
Full Moon?

604
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,313
Day after tomorrow? That's too soon.

605
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:36,026
If I don't get them by Full Moon,
it's useless.

606
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:39,822
Hey, Ron,
he's saying he needs the guns

607
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,323
by day after tomorrow.

608
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,867
- Are you kidding?
- I'm not, he's not budging.

609
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,620
It doesn't seem to be negotiable.

610
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,792
All right, we'll have
to figure something out.

611
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,795
Probably from India.

612
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,339
Hey, do you have a phone number?

613
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,424
Mm.

614
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,972
Don't worry, let's do this:

615
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:09,476
Meet me down there on the Full Moon day.

616
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,313
We can exchange our guns by the stupa.

617
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,778
You better keep your word.

618
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,029
Mm. Don't worry.

619
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,824
It's bad karma to lie.
- Yes, yes.

620
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:31,290
<i>I am Tshering Yangden,
the Director of Elections.</i>

621
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:38,422
<i>His Majesty has given us
this precious gift.</i>

622
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:44,761
<i>Let us not waste this opportunity.</i>

623
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:51,435
<i>Please come join us for the Mock Election</i>

624
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:55,189
<i>and learn how to exercise
your sacred duty.</i>

625
01:02:55,189 --> 01:03:00,569
<i>Let us Bhutanese all work together</i>

626
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,071
<i>to make our country modern and developed!</i>

627
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,458
Wow, my favorite!

628
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,461
Mother made pork and radish!

629
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,196
Your mother came by?

630
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,328
Did she complain endlessly about me again?

631
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,420
Tomorrow's election registration
is at the market.

632
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,966
I am going to take Yuphel with me.

633
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,427
Why would you take Yuphel?

634
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:16,270
She used her handkerchief
to erase her notebook.

635
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,940
It tore the pages.
The teacher scolded her.

636
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,444
Yuphel.

637
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:29,241
It's okay. I'll see your teacher tomorrow.

638
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,035
I'll tell her I forgot your eraser.

639
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,120
No, it's okay.

640
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,164
You shouldn't go to her school.

641
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,083
What's wrong with me going
to my own daughter's school?

642
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:43,589
You are too involved
with Lodro and Thinley's election.

643
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,426
It's causing so much disruption
to our family.

644
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:54,433
Even at Yuphel's school,
there are all these rumors about you.

645
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:07,529
I am doing all this for us,

646
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,656
for Yuphel's sake.

647
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,412
When Thinley wins
and gets a ministerial position,

648
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,581
he will remember we supported him.

649
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,378
He could help us get Yuphel
into a city school.

650
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,796
Away from this pathetic rural life.

651
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:30,010
Here, the highlight of the month...

652
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:34,097
is eating a piece of dried pork.

653
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,646
Is there anything for us here? Tell me!

654
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,958
Ron.

655
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,964
Greetings.

656
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:23,355
Little girl, get us two teas?

657
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:42,290
Why do you keep calling?

658
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,584
The police?

659
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,424
What--? What did they want?

660
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,182
Hello?

661
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:01,810
Yeah.

662
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,271
A photo of a foreigner?

663
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:07,858
What did this foreigner look like?

664
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,699
Yeah, and then?

665
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,576
Guns?

666
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:21,204
Why would I be involved in guns?
I am not crazy.

667
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,584
Don't worry,
I am just being his guide, okay?

668
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,214
Okay, so, listen.

669
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:35,469
We got two brand-new AK-47s
with a hundred rounds.

670
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,388
A hundred, eh?

671
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,433
Yeah, the monk can shoot up the whole
mountain with that many if he wants.

672
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,150
The worry was the government
wouldn't be able to register the voters,

673
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,819
but all efforts are being put in
to increase the voters' turnout

674
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,197
for tomorrow morning's Mock Election.

675
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:59,034
This is Karma Gelek, with cameraman
Kinley Wangchuk, reporting from Ura.

676
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:03,163
Was that okay?
Should we redo it?

677
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,106
How many did you get?

678
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,026
Just this one for now.

679
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:38,406
This is an offering for you
from Ap Penjor.

680
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,243
Even this was very difficult.

681
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:47,207
It felt like
the entire world was after this gun.

682
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:55,340
Ap Penjor gave these bullets too.

683
01:08:56,675 --> 01:09:03,515
He said this gun killed
many Tibetans in the wars.

684
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,688
There's a lot
of aggression in it, huh?

685
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:10,772
Yes.

686
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,234
This is good, this is good.

687
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:19,322
I got a ride with that lady

688
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:24,327
who was on the radio the other day.

689
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:28,456
- Oh, she's arrived?
- Yes.

690
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,584
Did she see the gun?

691
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,377
Yes, she did.

692
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:38,091
She was very occupied
with that election thing

693
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,260
everyone seems
to be going on about these days.

694
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:46,308
Wonderful,
everything is falling into place.

695
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:48,143
Yes, it is.

696
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,951
Yuphel, take this
and go buy yourself an eraser.

697
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:08,288
Go straight to school, okay?
Mother needs to go to work.

698
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:09,372
Okay, Mommy.

699
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,135
So how far is this place again?

700
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:27,307
It's gonna take the whole day.

701
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,812
Are we gonna make it back in time?

702
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,863
Red chilies,
high-quality red chilies!

703
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:52,791
Green chilies, green chilies!
Indian chilies!

704
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:03,385
The moment we get down,

705
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:07,347
we must prepare for tomorrow.

706
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:13,478
We don't have much time.
Yes, Lama.

707
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,565
- Did you bring the gun?
- Yes, I did, Lama.

708
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,195
- And the bullets?
- Yes, Lama.

709
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,458
Tshomo, there is a little girl for you.

710
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,002
Oh, no, she's come here?

711
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,259
Mommy, I don't like this market.
No one sells erasers here.

712
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:51,433
- Hi, what's your name?
- My name is Yuphel.

713
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,019
In that case...

714
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:58,481
I did not know you were a mother.

715
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,858
Here you go, an eraser.

716
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,613
An eraser for the little madame.

717
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,907
You probably need pens too, right?

718
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,714
Mommy, look, foreign pens and an eraser.

719
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:27,594
I'll share them with my classmates,
maybe then they will talk to me?

720
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,804
Who doesn't talk to you?

721
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:38,021
Actually, madame, this is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

722
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,861
Here, Yuphel, sit down.

723
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,911
Why don't you draw something?
Sit, Tshomo. Sit down.

724
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:55,663
Sit.

725
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:08,968
Do you really think all this is worth it?

726
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:13,306
I told you,

727
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:18,061
people around the world fight
for these changes we are now gifted.

728
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:26,778
Yes, but if we don't have to fight for it,

729
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,740
maybe we don't really need it.

730
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,954
For a villager like myself,

731
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,582
the most important thing in life
is my family.

732
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,212
Ever since all of this came
to our village,

733
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,924
my family life has been disrupted.

734
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:55,223
My husband spends all his time trying
to compete with our neighbors.

735
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,977
My mother and husband have become enemies,

736
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:01,563
they don't even talk
to each other anymore.

737
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:15,493
This bitterness has even
reached Yuphel's school.

738
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:23,751
Her classmates don't play with her
because she is her father's daughter.

739
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:34,304
It's because we've just started
this process.

740
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:37,515
Soon it will pass,
and everyone will be happy and prosperous.

741
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,356
But, madame, we were always happy.

742
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,246
Yuphel, we should get going.

743
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,460
Madame, this drawing is for you.

744
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:17,513
Thank you so much for the pens and eraser.

745
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,159
Hello? Yes, sir.

746
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,162
We haven't been able
to track them down yet.

747
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,333
We are looking for his guide.

748
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,086
Yes, yes.

749
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:51,923
I will report back
when we have an update. Yes, sir.

750
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,345
<i>The worry was the government
wouldn't be able to register the voters.</i>

751
01:15:57,345 --> 01:16:00,390
<i>But all efforts are being put in
to increase the voters' turnout</i>

752
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,684
<i>for tomorrow morning's Mock Election.</i>

753
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:07,105
<i>This is Karma Gelek, with cameraman
Kinley Wangchuk, reporting from Ura.</i>

754
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:12,026
- Duba, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

755
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,793
Yes, it's Nobs here.

756
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:34,841
It will reach the gate later tonight,
just make sure it gets past Customs.

757
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,261
I'll make the payment at the end.

758
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,728
You will get your items later tonight.

759
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:51,149
It's going to cost you $30,000.

760
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:52,608
Thirty thousand dollars?

761
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,070
After all we have been through together?

762
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,488
Come on, Nobs, bring it down.

763
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:02,035
I'm not sneaking in
Indian domestic helpers.

764
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:03,870
We're talking about guns here!

765
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,292
He say he wants $30,000.

766
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,632
I want that as well.

767
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,304
I need it to photograph my angels here.
Leave it behind.

768
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:25,892
He wants the camera as well.

769
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,245
Nobs, so we're good, right?

770
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,955
I'll see you later.

771
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,146
Father!

772
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:16,776
- Look what I got!
- Wow, so many!

773
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:20,613
These are all foreign ones.

774
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,156
- Foreign?
- Yes.

775
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,578
You must have spent a lot of money
on these.

776
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:30,957
We didn't buy it.
The election lady gave it to us.

777
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,376
- The election madame?
- Yes.

778
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:37,630
If you get a chance,

779
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,924
you should talk to her about Thinley.

780
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:44,345
This is really too much now.

781
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:48,724
I don't care about Lodro or Thinley,
and how they want to win desperately.

782
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,854
We don't need to send her
to a city school.

783
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:55,940
She's happy right here with her family.

784
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:02,029
I just want our old lives back.

785
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:08,202
Where our family was happy and together.

786
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:19,005
The life where Yuphel had friends
to play with.

787
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:37,023
So, I mean, you--

788
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:42,069
You don't think
he's gonna kill anyone, do you?

789
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,072
He's a monk right?

790
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:50,244
So, he wouldn't do that, right?

791
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,663
I don't know, man.

792
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,917
We live in strange times.

793
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,256
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
these guns are pretty dangerous.

794
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:07,136
They could cause a lot of a damage
if they're not used responsibly. You know?

795
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:25,279
Customs got all suspicious about it,
such a heavy bag.

796
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,587
That's it.

797
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:50,012
The money is all there,
you can count it.

798
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:59,146
The money is there, but, Benji,
not sure what you are doing here.

799
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:01,524
You know the risks.

800
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:03,943
Better be careful.

801
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:09,949
Good business.

802
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,239
Madame, good news.

803
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,783
After extensive pushing here,

804
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:57,872
we have registered 98% of eligible voters.

805
01:21:57,872 --> 01:22:00,708
Mmm. Good, that's very good to hear.

806
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,252
Congratulations to all of us.

807
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:13,512
Please remember the three colors!

808
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,265
Blue for freedom and equality.

809
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,893
Red for industrial development.

810
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:22,188
Yellow for preservation.

811
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:24,940
You can vote for whichever is your choice.

812
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,419
Remember,
red is industrial development.

813
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,214
That is most like
what Thinley will bring us.

814
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,300
Oh, get out of here,
you children!

815
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,011
This is only for people above 18.

816
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:01,352
Why don't you rascals listen?
Do you have wooden ears or what?

817
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:30,506
She's the one.
The one responsible for all this.

818
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,593
Many people seem
to have turned up for this.

819
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:37,930
Yes, it's become quite the event.

820
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,312
- Greetings, Lama.
- Hello.

821
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:48,107
I wonder what great misfortune
has come for you

822
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,693
to abandon your meditation to come to us.

823
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:55,489
Yes, we must come together to play
our part for the sake of our future.

824
01:23:57,074 --> 01:24:00,494
Today, your gun will make things right
once again.

825
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:04,373
We don't have time,
let's get ready for her.

826
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:05,458
Yes, Lama.

827
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,556
So can you fix it?

828
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,154
Hey, hey! Please stop.

829
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,119
Our car broke down,
we need to get to Ura.

830
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,331
We are also in a rush,
we are going for Lama's ritual.

831
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,333
And apparently we need to go vote, hop in.

832
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,876
Thank you so much!

833
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,545
Ron, come, come on,
let's get in. Come, come!

834
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,761
Give me the bag.

835
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:21,700
We are done. We had a 98% turnout.

836
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,370
Wow! That's historic.

837
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:39,218
Wait, why is everyone voting
for the yellow party? Look at this.

838
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:44,598
Yes, the yellow party secured over 95%.

839
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,143
A party wouldn't win by 95%.

840
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:57,403
When I asked the people
who they voted for,

841
01:25:57,403 --> 01:26:01,490
most of them said yellow.

842
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,575
But why?

843
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:08,289
Madam, yellow is the color of the king.

844
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,418
Why didn't we think about that?

845
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:18,132
Looks like even if they went to the polls,

846
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:22,011
the color yellow still connected them
to the king.

847
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,120
Little girl.

848
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,790
Did you see this foreigner?

849
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:54,710
Did you see this foreigner?

850
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:16,625
I understand
how much people love His Majesty.

851
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,962
That's exactly why we can't fail him.

852
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:26,093
Do they have to be that loud?

853
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:34,560
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

854
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,397
- Can we help you, officer?
- We are looking for two individuals.

855
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:39,481
Hello.

856
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,612
Lama wants you over at the ritual.

857
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,031
I don't have time.

858
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,700
He insists you come.

859
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:52,703
All these preparations
have been made for you.

860
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:55,414
- For me?
- Yes.

861
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:57,958
Lama says he planned all this,

862
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:03,756
after he heard you on the radio
saying you were coming to Ura.

863
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:07,134
So, please, come.

864
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:12,890
Might as well, our Mock Election turned
into a pig's disease.

865
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:17,561
Tshomo, Phurba, let's go.

866
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,840
Look, there's a foreigner coming.

867
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,222
Hello.

868
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:56,058
You guys made it.

869
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:02,648
So many people up there.
What's going on?

870
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,858
Is there some sort of event?

871
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,443
Are those the guns?

872
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:09,780
Don't say it so loud.

873
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,243
Great! Lama will be happy to see them.

874
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:15,869
Hey, hold on, you guys!

875
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:18,705
Benji, who's that?

876
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,837
Benji? Mr. Coleman?
- Yes, officer.

877
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,464
Could you guys please come with us?

878
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,883
We need to ask a few questions
about your stay in Bhutan.

879
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,052
Oh, I'm here to visit the temples.

880
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:36,223
What an auspicious day.

881
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:40,894
Lama has come out of retreat.

882
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,232
All our villagers have gathered here.

883
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:50,237
The government officials have also come.

884
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:52,823
And now we even have police officers here.

885
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:55,784
All gathered spontaneously,
how auspicious!

886
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,995
Please, you all must come
attend the ritual.

887
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,914
Please come, please come.

888
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,881
Don't try anything smart.

889
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:28,525
Where are you from, sir?

890
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,777
I'm from the U.S.

891
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,823
Oh. A great democratic country.
The leader of free world.

892
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,705
Sir, do you know we are teaching
about democracy to the Bhutanese?

893
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:43,790
That's great.

894
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,551
This is my first time meeting an American.

895
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,930
After the ceremonies,
can we talk about democracy?

896
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,390
I have a feeling that you can help us.

897
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,268
Our Mock Election didn't work
as we had planned.

898
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:08,607
No, sorry, I don't think I can do that.

899
01:32:11,235 --> 01:32:15,822
Oh, don't be modest, sir.
You're from the land of Lincoln and JFK.

900
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,795
Can everyone listen here?

901
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:19,553
I don't know anything
about these modern ways.

902
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:22,931
I don't know
if these are good or bad for us.

903
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,852
But we need to make things right.

904
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,189
Stupas represent
the enlightened mind of the Buddha.

905
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:38,322
We have built many like this one
in the past to avert obstacles.

906
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:43,744
Now we will build a new one,
to clear obstacles for our country,

907
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:47,622
as we find ourselves at a moment
of great change and transition.

908
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:54,963
When we build stupas, we fill them
with grains so it may avert famines.

909
01:33:55,672 --> 01:34:00,761
We put in medicines to avert pandemics.

910
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:10,812
And deep in the foundation,
we must bury something

911
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:15,567
that symbolizes hatred,
conflict and suffering.

912
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,486
And we build our stupa on top of this,

913
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:25,494
to symbolize the victory
of compassion and peace

914
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:28,914
over these three poisons.

915
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,292
As a symbol of all the negativity
in the world,

916
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:37,923
we will take this gun
and bury it under the stupa.

917
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:41,259
Hey, get the gun back,
get it back.

918
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,262
Wait, wait, wait,
what's happening? Hey.

919
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,722
What's going on?

920
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:52,854
You are entrusted with important
responsibilities for our country.

921
01:34:54,481 --> 01:35:00,195
Please make aspirations for our country
and place it in the foundation.

922
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,699
Maybe...

923
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:09,204
What? What's going on?

924
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,206
May all be victorious!

925
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,669
May all be victorious!

926
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:29,391
Hey, you two!
Come along with us now.

927
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:31,476
Sir.

928
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:36,648
Sir, sir.

929
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:40,026
Please hold on a moment.

930
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:42,696
The reason why we are here is because...

931
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:47,242
we wanted to make an offering
for the stupa.

932
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,787
- What was that?
- Yes.

933
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,167
Master Tashi, please come here.

934
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,503
We heard Lama was planning
something like this

935
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:02,841
so we came all the way
to make an offering, right?

936
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,641
The two of us have been working
to bring the most powerful

937
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:14,436
and deadly guns to offer here.

938
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:16,771
We are happy to get this opportunity.

939
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:22,319
Yes, 007's guns from the movie.

940
01:36:23,028 --> 01:36:26,156
- 007?
- Yes, 007's guns!

941
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:28,366
Is this true?

942
01:36:29,075 --> 01:36:33,079
Yes, sir, they were going
to bring us two guns,

943
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:37,167
two powerful guns,
guns that can kill people.

944
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,753
- Guns that can kill people?
- Yes.

945
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:44,424
Actually, my friend Mr. Coleman,

946
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:48,887
he came all the way to, uh, donate
these guns for stupa's construction.

947
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:51,515
Please have a look.

948
01:36:55,602 --> 01:36:56,603
Here you go.

949
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:05,237
Oh! These are AK-47s!
Where did you get these?

950
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,739
Even the Bhutanese army doesn't
have these.

951
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,005
Please excuse us.

952
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:38,687
Okay, now. Everyone, please, listen.

953
01:37:41,815 --> 01:37:49,281
Our friend here has crossed many oceans
to come here from a land called America.

954
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:55,579
To bring these guns
as an offering for our stupa.

955
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:59,708
So let us express our gratitude to him.

956
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:05,964
These guns are
the deadliest guns in the world.

957
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:08,967
I have seen how they kill
with my own eyes.

958
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:18,643
Please place them into the foundation
with your own hands.

959
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:23,148
And as you do, please pray

960
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:27,569
that wisdom and compassion destroys

961
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:33,908
all the hatred,
aggression and suffering in the world.

962
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:34,993
Please place them in.

963
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,121
Please place them in.

964
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:40,832
Just throw it in.

965
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:59,100
May all be victorious!

966
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,899
May all be victorious!

967
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,787
May all be victorious!

968
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:28,792
I wanted to offer our foreign friend here

969
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,836
a small token of appreciation...

970
01:41:34,047 --> 01:41:41,846
for the kind offerings he has made.

971
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,352
Phalluses are
a very important part of our culture.

972
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:50,980
We believe that it destroys duality,

973
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,235
and, uh, it gets us closer
to enlightenment.

974
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,119
Thank you.

975
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:13,628
May all beings have happiness,

976
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:18,341
may all beings be free from suffering.

977
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:25,682
Thank you.

978
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,439
Thank you so much
for your extremely generous contribution.

979
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,484
Uh, happy to contribute.

980
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:42,448
They say if you contribute and participate
in this kind of sacred rituals,

981
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:45,618
it will help you accumulate
incredible merits.

982
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,580
- Merits?
- Good deeds.

983
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:52,166
Oh, is that so?

984
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:56,963
Yeah, it will actually help you get rid
of your personal attachments.

985
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,258
But none of us are here
for those reasons, huh?

986
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:03,386
Yeah, of course not.

987
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,972
Thank you for coming here and helping us.

988
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,307
Please take care, madame.

989
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,894
Thank you for everything
you have done for us, Tshomo.

990
01:43:55,355 --> 01:43:57,690
Madame, here is your eraser.

991
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:02,654
You need it more than me.

992
01:44:02,654 --> 01:44:05,657
You have important responsibilities.
