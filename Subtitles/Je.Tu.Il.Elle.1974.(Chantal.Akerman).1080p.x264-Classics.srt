1
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:25,190
l YOU HE SHE

2
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,380
And so I left.

3
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,320
A tiny white room...

4
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,399
on the ground floor...

5
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,320
as narrow as a corridor...

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,170
where I lie, motionless...

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,729
and alert...

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,179
on my mattress.

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,810
The first day I painted
the furniture blue.

10
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,590
The second day I
repainted it all green.

11
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,729
The third day I put
it out in the hallway.

12
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,699
On the fourth day I lay
down on the mattress.

13
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,669
l think the empty
room feels larger.

14
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,479
On the fifth day I
moved the mattress.

15
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,199
After that I lifted it up...

16
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,470
and stood it up
against the window...

17
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,709
and then against the wall.

18
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,009
l lay down and wrote
a letter the sixth day.

19
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,879
l was very clear in what l said.

20
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,639
First it took three
pages to express myself

21
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,710
Then l wrote the same
thing in six pages.

22
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,379
On the eighth or ninth day,

23
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,220
l rewrote the second letter.

24
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,980
l wrote eight pages while
eating a lot of sugar.

25
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,950
Then l crossed things out...

26
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,899
and corrected things.

27
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,120
A few lines remained.

28
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,789
l stopped eating
and sat in silence.

29
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,519
l started writing
again a few days later.

30
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,330
After a few days, I reread
everything l'd written.

31
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,750
l lay down on my mattress...

32
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,539
then got up to undress.

33
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,490
l lay down again, naked.

34
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,750
l spread my clothes over me

35
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,750
and waited.

36
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,829
l listened to my breathing.

37
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,119
l played with my breathing.

38
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,539
Then I forgot about
playing the game...

39
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,930
and l waited.

40
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,910
Now and then I ate a
large spoonful of sugar.

41
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,980
l realized l'd been there
for at least 28 days.

42
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,509
When I looked up sudden/y...

43
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,839
there were people
walking in the street.

44
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,150
l spilled all the sugar on
the letters on the floor...

45
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,309
and l lay down again...

46
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,710
and waited.

47
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,299
l waited some more

48
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,269
for it to pass or for
something to happen -

49
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,710
for me to believe in God or for
you to send gloves for the cold.

50
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,680
lt took some work to scoop
up all the sugar with a spoon.

51
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:51,740
After that, l stopped
Iistening for footsteps.

52
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,539
There were too many, and they
were too loud during the day.

53
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,019
Then I just waited.

54
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,630
lt snowed.

55
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,589
l figured that, in any case,
Iife had come to a halt...

56
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,160
that nothing more would happen...

57
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,759
and that l should wait for
the snow to stop and then melt.

58
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,599
lt snowed for a very long time.

59
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,920
Four days.

60
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,849
Then one day it stopped snowing.

61
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,730
Shortly after that, the
snow melted and l got up.

62
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,680
The clothes on top of me landed
in the sugar left on the floor...

63
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,289
and l was naked.

64
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,140
l heard footsteps come to a stop.

65
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,589
Someone was looking at me.

66
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,630
l remained motionless, naked...

67
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,460
so that other passers-by
could look at me.

68
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:55,990
Few people walked by,
and then no one at all...

69
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:58,920
and night fell.

70
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,809
l got dressed.

71
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,519
lt was later, much later

72
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,289
when I looked at
myself in the window...

73
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:34,150
after the sugar had
been gone for a while,

74
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,230
and l was wondering
what was happening to me.

75
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,640
l realized l was hungry.

76
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,460
l got up...

77
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:53,640
and looked at myself.

78
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,589
l took off my sweater
to get a better view.

79
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,539
After that...

80
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,569
l stripped and looked at myself.

81
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,329
l stopped a truck.

82
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,530
l got in.

83
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,630
The driver didn't say anything.

84
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,820
Then he told me to
Iie down on his bunk,

85
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,139
because I had to be tired.

86
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:38,179
l looked at his
beautiful broad neck,

87
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,409
his big head of red hair.

88
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,389
l thought l wanted to kiss him.

89
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:53,440
You see this is what matters.

90
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,949
Move your hand.

91
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:02,969
Slowly.

92
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,460
Not so fast.

93
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:13,639
Up and down.

94
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,070
Slowly at first,
then a little faster.

95
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,179
l can feel it.

96
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,650
lt's getting warm.

97
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,849
lt's getting harder.

98
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,940
lt's filling up.

99
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,010
Now the heat comes...

100
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,030
inside and out.

101
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:08,650
Slowly.

102
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,389
lt's gonna get real
big and burst its skin.

103
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,610
You obey, but you're afraid.

104
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,829
You think it's wrong.

105
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,170
Stroke it faster.

106
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:40,949
Faster.

107
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,599
Keep going.

108
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,380
You can feel it coming.

109
00:49:58,469 --> 00:49:59,989
Go on.

110
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,880
Slowly.

111
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,960
That's right, up and down.

112
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,369
lt came in little waves.

113
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,599
l'm gonna put my head
on the steering wheel.

114
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:21,349
l met my wife out in the country.

115
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,300
l was walking down the road.

116
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:30,590
l was pissed off
'cause l was lost.

117
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,159
l see her speed by me.

118
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,809
So l yell to her.

119
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,690
lt was wintertime.
November, l think.

120
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,579
l stop her and
ask for directions.

121
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,320
l was 18

122
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,030
and she was very
young, just like you.

123
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,170
l looked at her.

124
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,719
l wanted to undress her but
she preferred to do it herself.

125
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,309
We did it right
there on the spot.

126
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:09,119
lt was nice.

127
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:17,019
We did it a lot after that...

128
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:21,309
but then she got
pregnant and had a kid.

129
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,829
l had to find another job,
any stupid shit for more money.

130
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,070
After that l had less time.

131
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:39,300
All my energy went into my work.

132
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:45,460
l was dead tired
and when l got home,

133
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,190
there she was with
her big tits and belly.

134
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,130
Saturdays and Sundays we'd screw.

135
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,070
But it wasn't the same

136
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,320
and then the kid arrived.

137
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,730
l didn't want her as much and
she didn't want me as much.

138
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:14,800
lt's strange. It's
as if the kid...

139
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:19,289
stopped us from screwing.

140
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,260
Or maybe l was just too
tired and overworked.

141
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,260
And she had the
baby to take care of.

142
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,090
So now and then...

143
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:40,079
we'd fulfill our marital duty.

144
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,920
lt's really strange,
but it felt the same

145
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,559
as bringing home the bacon

146
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,519
or bouncing the kid on my knees.

147
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,340
l don't know.

148
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:03,389
l have pictures, by the way.

149
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,900
Me with the kid
on my lap, whining.

150
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,820
l've got two now.

151
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:21,809
A girl who's 11,

152
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,989
and the little one's 11/2.

153
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:33,019
And now l'm a truck driver.

154
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:47,849
Now and then l pick
up girls on the road.

155
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,630
But l know

156
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,030
that there's no
tomorrow no nothing.

157
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,170
Just the moment.

158
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,360
So l ask them...

159
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,079
and if they say okay,
we do it back there...

160
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,739
on the bunk.

161
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,440
lt's nothing. It's not starting
a family or supporting one.

162
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,130
lt's just about getting laid.

163
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:26,800
A screw and that's all.

164
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:40,909
You know, l have a cousin.

165
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,300
lt's funny...

166
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,730
because he married a
woman for her money.

167
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,090
His only pleasure now is
accumulating even more money.

168
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,650
He's a jerk, but
everyone's thrilled.

169
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:07,170
Nothing's changed. He does
his thing, has his dough.

170
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,809
l have a brother too.

171
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:20,429
He works in a factory.

172
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,730
lt's funny. My brother
used to be a real loser.

173
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,860
Always coming in last,
always getting yelled at.

174
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:35,119
Couldn't earn any money.
His life was a mess.

175
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:38,610
Always had shitty jobs.

176
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:45,179
l don't know how to say it,
but he suddenly got fired up.

177
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,570
l mean...

178
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,630
he got himself a girl,
took care of that part,

179
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,929
so he could concentrate
on getting ahead.

180
00:56:58,659 --> 00:57:02,119
Now he's the boss. He loves
yelling at everyone else.

181
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,559
lt's funny. He really gets
into yelling at people.

182
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,380
He turns all red...

183
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,570
like he's gonna
start breathing fire.

184
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
Sometimes, when l get home,

185
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,269
l see my wife waiting for
me with the little one.

186
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,550
She changes his diaper, taps
gently on his little butt,

187
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,929
carefully cleans his little ass

188
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:46,309
and his little peter
with cotton balls.

189
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,949
And then that ointment
that really stinks.

190
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,059
She bends down over him.

191
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,349
lt's funny. The kid
already gets hard.

192
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,280
l'm dead tired when l
g,et home, and so is she

193
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,199
so nothing.

194
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:08,500
l must be getting old.

195
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,130
And my daughter...

196
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,579
when we eat dinner...

197
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,170
she's in her nightgown.

198
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,750
l slapped her bottom once and
told her, ''Go get dressed.

199
00:58:31,389 --> 00:58:33,380
Show some respect
for your father.''

200
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,869
Because she turns me on you know.

201
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,389
She's quite a dish, small
as she is, and just 11.

202
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,829
l'll tell you something:
When l drive like this

203
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,360
for hours on end there's nothing.

204
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,579
Just telephone poles and
the hum of the engine.

205
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,369
lt's funny, 'cause
l starrt to daydream.

206
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,139
And when l do my dick stands up.

207
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,590
Sometimes l don't
even realize it.

208
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,579
Sometimes l help it along
by thinking of certain stuff.

209
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:22,039
For example, a woman's
pussy, nice and wet...

210
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,300
her legs wide open.

211
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,300
Or a woman crying.

212
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,530
A woman crying in a corner.

213
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:35,699
A woman crying
- works every time.

214
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,550
Even totally random
stuff sometimes.

215
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,119
lt's funny. When l first started
driving, l didn't dare think that stuff.

216
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,170
l'd just drive faster,

217
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,809
and if l felt that
heat l'd sing real loud.

218
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,519
l'd feel all the heat in my belly

219
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,239
rise up through my chest
and burst out my throat.

220
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,559
Or sometimes other
drivers and l race

221
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:16,889
stupid shit like that.

222
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,989
Sometimes, on long hauls,
a second driver comes along.

223
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,429
l give him a hard time
until we get in a fight.

224
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,610
lt's me.

225
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,070
l don't want you to stay.

226
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,059
l'm hungry.

227
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,819
More.

228
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:32,090
This.

229
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,100
l'm thirsty.

230
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,399
She said, ''You have
to leave tomorrow.''

231
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:46,390
We'll to the woods no more.
The laurels are all gone

232
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,829
The pretty lass has
gathered them all.

233
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,760
See the people dance.
Come join in the dance

234
01:25:03,109 --> 01:25:07,180
Leap and dance and
kiss whom you please.

235
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:16,220
We'll to the woods no more.
The laurels are all gone

236
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:24,140
The pretty lass has
gathered them all.

237
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:32,399
Come join in the dance.
See the people dance.

238
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:40,869
Leap and dance and
kiss whom you please.

239
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:06,260
