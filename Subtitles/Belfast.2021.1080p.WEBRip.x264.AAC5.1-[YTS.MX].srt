any of these groups

176
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,852
making all this mess
in your street?

177
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,245

his work to see his family.

180
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,554
Glad to hear it, madam.

181
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,992

-Hi.

182

-Hi, boys.

185
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,133

186
00:10:58,483 --> 00:10:59,615

Stay in your homes tonight.

187
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:00,790
-Thank you very much.
-Okay?

188
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,400

-GRANNY: Did they attack you?

192

No. It was only
the Catholic houses.

193
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,286
Them boyos want them out.

194

-Not at all.

Sure, they're friends,
they're family, same as us.

197

They just kick
with the left foot.

198
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,165
Exactly.

199
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,341
Sure, my best friend in
the street is Mrs. Ganjawala.

200
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,865
She's Indian.

201

Well, them curries,

PA: Does the doctor
want to see you again?

214
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,901
He's given me a letter
for the hospital.

215

-There's no point.

216

big decisions to make, son.

217
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,784
Did you clear up
that wee bit of trouble

218
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,699

-GRANNY: Hey, wee fellas.

219
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,876
We're not deaf back here.

220
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,323
Oh, yes, we've friends
on the Protestant side.

221
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:40,934
They weren't friends last night.

222
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,631
They weren't
friends last night, though.

223

BUDDY: Paddy Kavanagh told me
as long as Catholics

224
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,158
keep confessing everything bad
that they do to a priest,

225
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,812
then they can do
whatever they want

226
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,596
and God will forgive them
all the time.

227
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,381
Well, Paddy Kavanagh's
family's not gonna be living

228
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,035
in this street for much longer,
so you'd better check

229
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,906
he's not taking
the hand out of you.

230
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,865
Ugh, I don't know how it works.

231
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,736
They get a lot of water thrown
on them and then they're okay.

232
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,259
I think that's it.

233
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,044
-Why aren't you going, too?
-

234
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,480
'Cause me and your father
have business to discuss.

235
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,916
God understands.

236
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,007
-What are those?
- My little secret.

for one day.

239

Well, your granny says you can
never have too much God.

240
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,061
You might need him
before too long.

Look, mind your nonsense

251
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,689
Your aunties and uncles
want to say goodbye

252
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,995
to your father
before he goes back.

253
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,431
But, Daddy,
are you not gonna be

254
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:45,128
a vigilante on our barricade?

255
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,391
No more talk
about bloody barricades.

256
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,263

260
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:59,186

picture house in town tomorrow,

261
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,188
Daddy will pick the film,
and we'll forget about

262
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,624
this whole bunch of eejits

263
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,147
before I have to go
back to work.

264
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,845
Was that our side
that done all that

265
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,109
to them Catholic houses
in our street, Daddy?

266
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,286
There is no our side
and their side in our street.

267
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,071
Or there didn't
used to be, anyway.

268
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,378
It's all bloody religion.
That's the problem.

269
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,467
Then why are you
sending us to church?

270
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,338
Because your granny'd
kill me if I didn't.

271
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,080
But, Daddy,
if we were Catholics,

272
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,865
we could not go to church,

273
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,388
and then every once
in a wee while,

274
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,259
we could go in and confess,

275
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,261
and then they'd have to tell us
we were forgiven

276
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,611
and we wouldn't have to go
in again for ages.

277
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:37,267
PA:
I've nothing against Catholics.

278
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,443
But it's a religion of fear.

279
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:43,534
Protestants, you will die!

280
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,754

281
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,236

this pestilential mortal coil?

283
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,631

284
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,940
Well, I will tell you where.

285
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,334
Picture the scene.

286
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,467
A fork in the road.

287
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:09,082
In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.

288
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:13,825
In the other,
a long and winding road

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,092
which stretches down and away
into an unknowable distance.

290
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:23,661
One will take you to the bosom
of the Lord's grace,

291
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:27,927
forever and a day
caress you with beatific love.

292
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:33,802
And the other will spew you
into an eternal pit

293
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,979
of sulfurous suffering,
pustulating pain,

294
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,199

00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,606
We've a wee fella down
our street called Thomas.

346
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,956
-What's he?
-Protestant definitely.

347
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,350
He's not. He's a Catholic.

348
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,047
-No, he's not.
-He is.

349
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,049
Sure, they burnt his house out
the other night

350
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,791
'cause his family is Catholic.

351
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,750
Sure, we've a cousin
called Thomas.

352
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,839
I know. That's what I'm saying.

353
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,363
Well, how the hell are you
supposed to know, then?

354
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,148
You have to get taught it.

355
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:10,671
Who teaches you?

356
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,151
So the doctor says,
"Listen, John,

357
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,804
I've got some bad news
and worse."

358
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,806
And John says, "Oh, no.
Wh-What's the bad news?"

359
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,983
And he goes, "Well, you've only
got 24 hours to live."

360
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,594
John says,
"That's-that's awful.

361
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:21,943
What could be worse than that?"

362
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,684
Doctor says,
"Well, I've been trying

363
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,990
-to get ahold of you
since yesterday." -

364
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,168
-Why do you even have to know?
-In case they attack you.

365
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,908
-When?
-When you're out and about.

366
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,475
Well, if they're attacking you,

367
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,781
they're not gonna stop
and tell you their name.

368
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,652
It wouldn't get to that stage.

369
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:38,829
-Why? -'Cause you use your
secret knowledge to bluff them.

370
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,701
What are you talking about?

371
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,529
They can just come up to you
when you're not expecting it

372
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,749
and ask you, "Are you
Protestant or Catholic?"

373
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,403
But it's a trick question,
you see,

374
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,057
'cause they don't
tell you what they are.

375
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,103
And what do you say then
to not get a dig in the gob?

376
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,844
-"I'm a Catholic"?
-Wrong.

377
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,716
That's exactly
what they think you will say.

378
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,326
They think you're trying
to bluff them.

379
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,154
But you have to
double-bluff them.

380
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:02,070
-How?
-You say, "I'm a Protestant."

381
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,986
-But I am a Protestant.
-That's the point!

382
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,901
BUDDY: Blanchflower's now
at the halfway line.

383
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,642
-He looks up.
-

384
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,559
Is there nothing this
Spurs right-half cannot do?

385
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,257
Perfect through ball!

386
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,827
Nice pass, son.

387
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,264
Would you go on away in and
tell your pa I'd like to have

388
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,484
a wee chat with him, please?

389
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,704
Tell him it's Billy Clanton.

390
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:28,879
And McLaury.

391
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,362
PA:
What do you want?

392
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,103
BILLY: We're looking to cleanse
the community a wee bit.

393
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,541
You wouldn't want to be
the odd man out in this street.

394
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,457
You saw what happened to your
neighbors from the other side.

395
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,677
You touch my family
and I'll kill you.

396
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:44,982
Calm down, fella.

397
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,897
I'm a Protestant, like yourself.

398
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,160
-MACK: All all right?
-Aye, it's okay, Mackie.

399
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,162
BILLY:
Look, things get out of hand

400
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,295
pretty quick round these parts.

401
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,646
Cash or commitment.

402
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,084
The boys who cleaned up
your street

403
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,999
have made me their new
local chief.

404
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,133
So, you can report to me
with either.

405
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,569
All right?

406
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,571
Have a wee think.

407
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,051
I'll be in touch.

408
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,537
Buddy, come on.

409
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,886
Come and show me
how to play this game.

410
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,018
Come on.
Let's have a look. Huh?

411
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,456
♪ ♪

412
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:36,730
See you, now.

413
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,604
All the big boys have left.

414
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:42,910
Buddy, give your brother
a hand there, will you?

415
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,303
Pick this sofa up, right?

416
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,000
MA:
Here, can you give us a hand?

417
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,132
SOLDIER:
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,569
MA:
You want to set your gun down?

419
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,397
SOLDIER:
No, it's all right, thank you.

420
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,791
MA: Now, don't you be
scratching my walls with that.

421
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,315
PA:
You got it? Right now, hold on.

422
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,273
This worked earlier.

423
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,275
I'll go in first.

424
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,539
-All right?
-Stewart.

425
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,498
-MR. STEWART: Frankie.
-FRANKIE: All right?

426
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:07,108
All right, Frankie?

427
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,370
Is that you all this time
at the barricades?

428
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,893
Somebody has to.

429
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,330
Better me than Billy Clanton.

430
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,027
Aye.

431
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,203
Not many people chose this.

432
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,857
There's a few men hiding
behind them barricades.

433
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,380
And they'll keep hiding

434
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:19,338
where they're afraid
for their families.

435
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,340
It's a waiting game now.

436
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,950
When it's time
for that wall to come down,

437
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,474
I'll be the first
to swing a hammer, but now?

438
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:28,347
"They also serve
who stand and wait."

439
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,047
We can't all be acting
the Lone Ranger.

440
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:48,323
: This is
a story of long, long ago,

441
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,978
when the world
was just beginning.

442
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,675
A young world.

443
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,199
A world early
in the morning of time.

444
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,825
No wonder
you brought us to this.

445
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,218
It's educational for the boys.

446
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,698
Aye.

447
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,529
MA: Raquel Welch is
a hell of an education.

448
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,149
PA: If people ask you to join
anything, deliver anything,

449
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:35,109
do messages for anybody,
you do nothing, okay?

450
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:37,416
You tell your ma, she'll
tell me, and I'll sort it.

451
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,069
-You understand me?
-WILL: Yes, Daddy.

452
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,550
Very good.
I'm proud of you, son.

453
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,030
Now get off to bed,
the pair of you.

454
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:44,858
I'm up too early
in the morning to see you,

455
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:47,208
so make sure you get to school
all right, all right?

456
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,210
Don't mess your mother about,
and I'll see you in two weeks.

457
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,907
-Okay?
-Yes, Daddy.

458
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,082
Good boys.

459
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,043
MINISTER:
A fork in the road.

460
00:23:56,217 --> 00:24:01,004
In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.

461
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:05,313
Which road will you take?!

462
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,666
MA:
You're running round here

463
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,189
like the man
in the big picture,

464
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,626
not paying your taxes

465
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,844
and spending all our money
on horses.

466
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,411
It's the building trade.

467
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,152
I told you it doesn't work
the normal way.

468
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,545
I told you I had it covered.

469
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,068
I was the one
who had it covered.

470
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,417
No, you had us paying
three years of back tax.

471
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,027
To keep you out of bloody jail.

472
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,334
We're drowning in debt.

473
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,336
PA: We're near done
with the back tax.

474
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,512
Ten pound a month
for three bloody years.

475
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:32,819
This is the time to think
about making a new start.

476
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:35,517
I know nothing else
but Belfast.

477
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,040
Exactly.

478
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,260
There's a whole world out there.

479
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,523
We can give these boys a
better chance than we ever had.

480
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,657
There's Commonwealth countries
needing tradesmen.

481
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,050
The government will give you
assisted passage.

482
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,183
We can get the whole family
to the other side of the world

483
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,011
for ten pound.

484
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,926
We're living in a civil war,

485
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,190
and I'm not here
to protect my family.

486
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,934
MA:
What are those supposed to be?

487
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,153
PA:
An escape route.

488
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,467
SOLDIER:
Get this street locked down.

489
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,817
GIRL: Come on, get a move on.
We're gonna be late again.

490
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,427
-Come on!
-

491
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,994
:
Throughout the night,

492
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,127
sniping became
the tactic of the rioters.

493
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,824
As we drove past a side street,

494
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:24,435
three men on the corner
dived for cover.

495
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,915
-It's not bad, though, is it?
-A young man with a revolver

496
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,613
asked us for a lift.

497
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,745
At 4:00 this morning,
RUC turned us back

498
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,791
-from the Falls area.
-Yeah.

499
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:33,880
NEWSMAN: Snipers, they said,
were still at work,

500
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,056
and in the distance,
one heard the ominous burst

501
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,623
of machine-gun fire.

502
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,668
The scene terrified me,

503
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,192
but it reminded an
American colleague of Harlem,

504
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,151
but, he added, it seems easier
to get guns here.

505
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,109
MA:
One more left.

506
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,459
NEWSMAN: Dawn over Belfast
today showed a grim scene,

507
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,418
buildings scarred by fire,

508
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,594
thousands of pounds' worth
of damage caused,

509
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,683
and, of course,
the tragic loss of life.

510
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:57,860
It's been a night of shame for
Belfast, one that will live on

511
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,209
in the memories
of its people...

512
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,776
MA:
Come on, you two. School.

513
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,044
MISS LEWIS:
Walking, please. No running.

514
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,481
-BOY: Morning, miss.

515
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:13,484
STUDENTS:
Twelve elevens are 132.

516
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,401
Twelve twelves are 144.

517
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,316
MISS LEWIS: Well, I'm pleased
to say your times tables

518
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,840
were a lot more impressive
to hear

519
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,363
than your test scores
were to read.

520
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:23,625
The whole point
of these weekly tests

521
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,584
is to monitor your progress.

522
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:29,109
The best will sit directly by
my desk, the seat of learning,

523
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:31,328
and the rest of you will view
your Sisyphean struggles

524
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,504
from the distance
you have imposed upon yourself

525
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,636
by a lack of application.

526
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,291
Billy Clanton Junior, 17%.

527
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,119
Bottom row, seat 12.

528
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,121
Rachel, seat 11.

529
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,513
Martin to seat ten.

530
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,776
Freddie, seat eight.

531
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,734
Karen to seat four.

532
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:50,173
And in the medal positions
this week, with 72%, in bronze,

533
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,393
is Buddy, seat three.

534
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,962
And, of course, in silver
again, we have Ron,

535
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,791
and Catherine with
the gold yet again this week.

536
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,228
Congratulations, Catherine.
Very well done.

537
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:10,672
The wee girl still showing
some interest, yeah?

538
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,588
She looks at me sometimes,
but we're not allowed to talk

539
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,330
in the class,
so I can't say anything.

540
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:17,984
And then when we go out
to the playground,

541
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,464
she always goes off
with the other girls.

542
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,554
Anyways, I think
she loves that other fella.

543
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,992
Ah, you don't know that
for sure.

544
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,385
Women are very mysterious.

545
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,866
And women can smash
your face in, too, mister.

546
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,913
Your granny's become
less mysterious over the years.

547
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,697
So, you really like her?

548
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,613
When I grow up,
I want to marry her.

549
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:41,007
Yeah, sounds like
you really like her.

550
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,792
You know,
she's not only at school.

551
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,839
You could see
where she lives maybe.

552
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,058
It's Reynolds Drive,
four houses in from the right,

553
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:50,451
the one with the wonky eight.

554
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,453
Oh, you've done your research.

555
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:55,108
I pass it every day
on my way home.

556
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:58,154
I try to look in,
but she never sees me.

557
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,417
She's always doing
her bloody homework.

558
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,637
If she were a wee bit
more stupid like me,

559
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,595
we'd be sitting together
by now.

560
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,687
Ah, "a pity beyond all telling
is hid in the heart of love."

561
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,689
Oh, he's full of
pretty answers, that one.

562
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,168
Come on, it's time to go.

563
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,604
I don't want your mommy
shouting at me

564
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:14,823
because you're late.

565
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,999
-Cheerio, son.
-Cheerio.

566
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,875
GRANNY:
Here, take this threepenny bit.

567
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,790
Get yourself a wee sweetie.

568
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:26,487
I'm not allowed, Granny.

569
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,619
My da says you can't afford it.

570
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,230
I'm always saying
to your man there

571
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,232
what's yours is mine
and what's mine's me own.

572
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,147
Thanks, Granny.

573
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:37,324
Try and find out
how that wee girl thinks.

574
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:38,934

Can you tell me
exactly what he said?

607
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,161
He just said he couldn't give
any more money to the streets.

Why is your da not coming home?

649
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,312
He can't come home
every weekend.

650
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,140
It's too dear.

651
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,404

-I'm not allowed.

-Why not?
-My mother said she'd kill me.

656
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,117
Sure she doesn't have to know.
That's the whole point.

-Are you in one?
-Aye.

658
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,250
-What's it called?
-Doesn't have a name.

659
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,165

-Has to be secret.

when you join.

God. This takes ages.

No wonder they call it
long division.

689
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,644
Patience.
Patience with the sums.

690
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:00,038
Patience with the girl.

691
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:01,996
Is it 27?

692
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,260
That's close enough.

693
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,957
And now just make sure
y-your numbers

694
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,829
aren't very clear to read.

695
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,700
She might give you
the benefit of the doubt

696
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:15,444
if your seven looks like a one
with a fancy tail, right?

697
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:18,317
The same with a two and a six.

698
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,188
Right? Keep her guessing.

699
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,799
That means you'll have two
or three horses in every race.

700
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,671
Isn't that cheating?

701
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:27,500
No, well, I'd call it
spread betting.

702
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:31,156
And if it gets you moved up by
one seat to bask in the light

703
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,549
of her glory,
then you're off to the races.

704
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,030
But sure there's only one
right answer.

705
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,771
If that were true, son,
people wouldn't be

706
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,208
blowing themselves up
all over this town.

707
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,346
I think my da wants us
to leave Belfast.

708
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,222
What do you want?

709
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:58,879
Every night, before I go to
sleep, when I say my prayers,

710
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,664
I ask God if he'd fix it
so that when I wake up

711
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,885
in the morning, I'm the best
footballer in the world.

712
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:07,453
And then I also ask him as well

713
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:10,238
that when I grow up,
can I marry Catherine.

714
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,153
Even if she loves Ronnie Boyd.

715
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,808
But she could still see him,
but she'd marry me.

716
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,679
That's what I want.

717
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,428
LIBERTY VALANCE: You looking

00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,842
I have to keep those boys

PA: Well, I can't come home
every weekend, for God's sake.

729

well, then don't blame me

730
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,195

-That's not what I'm saying.

Sparkle biological
washing powder

736
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,601
that their whites
are whiter than ever.

737
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,255
They've discovered
for themselves...

738
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,778
MA:
What have I done?

739
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,914
BUDDY:
All right, Mummy?

740
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,700
Why do you always get sad
when a letter comes?

741
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,573
WOMAN: Remember, our
washing powder is biological.

742

MISS LEWIS:
Come on, Mr. Slowpoke.

743
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,666
Get inside now.

744
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,191
And finally a switch in
the medal positions this week.

745
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,931
Well, Mr. Buddy,
you may not have improved

746
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,456
your handwriting in maths,
for which this once,

747
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,632

but you have
improved your score.

750
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,509

is Buddy.

Be careful what you wish for.

That's what the minister
at the wee mission says.

765
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:51,573
When is your next chance?

766
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:54,620
We have to do a project
about the moon landing.

767
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,883
What, did those boys
not come back from that?

768
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,842
They did, and now we have to
cut things out of the papers

769
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:01,844
and explain how they got there.

770
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,803
If they did get there,
if they did get to the moon.

771
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:05,370
It's not what it says here.

772
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,676
God doesn't like it.

773
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,418
And I watched every night, too,
that they were up there,

774
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,246
and how did I never see
Mike Collins

775
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,814
in the mother ship
doing his orbit?

776
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:16,598
Sure you would have seen
the shape of Columbus

777
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,121
against the light of the moon.

778
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,993
No, that's 'cause mostly
he was on the dark side.

779
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,474
Exactly. It's the side that
Lucifer hangs his shillelagh.

780
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:25,041
What? No, look, he was
on the dark side of the moon

781
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,174
most of the time where
we couldn't see him, you know,

782
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,481
while he was doing his orbit,
and then maybe, you know,

783
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,526
just before he was due
to come round the corner,

784
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,267
you had to go in for your tea.

785
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,748
If I could come up with
something smart about that,

786
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,706
maybe I could
stay up at the top desk

787
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,534
and wait till
she gets back there.

788
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,493
Or you could say the moon's
made of green cheese

789
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,103
and drop down a place,
if you wanted.

790
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,496
Or you could do
the project together,

791
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,193
you and the young lady.

792
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,673
You'd get the same marks

793
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,762
and maybe end up
on the same seat together.

794
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,633

Hey, Romeo, come on!

We have work to do.

820
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:25,205
Operation Steal The Chocolate.

821
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,120
It's simple.
We go into the shop

822
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:28,904
and keep Mr. Singh talking
down by the fridge.

823
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,819
He has to move the boxes
round at the bottom

824
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,299
to get me a Lemon Mivvi.

825
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,170
His head'll be down
part of the time.

826
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,129
You stay at the front
of the shop,

827
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:39,437
and when you see he's not
looking, you make a sweep.

828
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,830
-What's a sweep? -A big grab
for all the chocolate bars

829
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,702
on that low shelf
near the till.

830
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,878
Sure he'll know they've been
nicked if there's a big gap.

831
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,793
I thought you said
we'd just do a couple,

832
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,490
so he'd never even notice.

833
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,013
I don't want lifted
by the police.

834
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,275
All right, all right.

835
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,668
-GIRL: All clear.
-No sweep.

836
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,322
Just a small grab, okay?

837
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,106
I might be able to swipe you
a chocolate mousse

00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,020
You're joking me.

856
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:42,500
It's all I could see.

857
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,066
Turkish Delight?

858
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,981
Who the hell
eats Turkish Delight?

859
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:48,201
-Do you eat Turkish Delight?
-No.

860
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,550
I don't like it.

861
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,379
Nobody likes it.

862
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,555
-It's all they had.
-Are you blind?

863
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,035
I had to think quickly.

864
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,558
Not quickly enough.

865
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:00,343
There was Flakes and Crunchies.

866
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,824
All you need is an in and out
with a fast hand,

867
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:05,131
and then the Milky Bars
are on me.

868
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:06,915
I'm not sure
you're cut out for this.

869
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,570
-Hey, Buddy, your da's home.

870
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,530
-Sure it's only Wednesday.
-He came in a taxi.

871
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,576
-And you, too!
-What?

872
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,752
Keep your mouth shut.

873
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:25,020
PA:
When did you write to them?

874
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,674
MA:
None of your business.

875
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,241
PA: Just tell me.
When did you write to them?

876
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,634
-It's a simple question.
-None of your business.

877
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,505
PA:
Just give me a simple answer.

878
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,681
-I'm not getting interrogated.
-When did you write to them?

879
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,509
MA: When the last receipt
came through.

880
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:37,250
I knew it was the last one
'cause for three bloody years

881
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:38,817
I've been counting
them envelopes

882
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,209
coming through that door,
and there wasn't

883
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,602
so much as a thank-you
with this one.

884
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:43,299
PA: It's the taxman,
for God's sake.

885
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:44,736
Who do you expect,
Father Christmas?

886
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,564
MA: We've been
scrimping and saving,

887
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:49,001
and they hadn't the good grace
as to say, "That's it.

888
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,524
You're done.
You're in the clear."

889
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,526
So what'd you say to them
in your letter?

890
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,485
I said I wanted
a full official declaration

891
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,836
that my husband was
in the clear a hundred percent

892
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,534
on all back taxes,
and that they acknowledged

893
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,145
that everything was shipshape
and above board,

894
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:04,494
and that my family's good name

895
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:06,540
wasn't on
some credit risk list.

896
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:09,151
-Christ. Christ the night.
-What?

897
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:14,635
No.

898
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,768
-No.
-Yes, yes, oh, yes.

899
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:19,118
They've decided-- thanks
to acting on your request--

900
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,773
they've decided to go back
further into my accounts

901
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,036
and say that I owe
another 572 pound,

902
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,646
which based on
current earnings,

903
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,474
should take another
five years to pay off.

904
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,389
So it's a handy wee letter
you sent, wasn't it?

905
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:30,999
You bugger!

906
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:32,958
-Oh, you're a lying bugger!
-

907
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,351
Aye, that's right, believe the
taxman before you believe me!

908
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:41,270
Your work won't be too pleased

909
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:43,882
with you skipping off
in the week.

910
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:45,274
I'll work the weekend.

911
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:47,320
Ah, when's that job finish?

912
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:49,017
This one's nearly done.

913
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,585
What, there's another one
over there, is there?

914
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,282
Aye. Big one.

915
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,154
A long one.

916
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,243
They're asking some of the boys
to move over permanent.

917
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,680
Offering accommodation
because of the time involved.

918
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,160
Couple of years.

919
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,118
Building a hospital.

920
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,251
Your father has to go
to the hospital.

921
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:06,687
You talk to him about it.

922
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,515
Won't talk to me about doctors.

923
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:09,734
Is that right?

924
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,736
Ah, it's just a couple of days.

925
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,042
A wee test for the lungs.

926
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,218
It's all that bloody time
over in Leicester.

927
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:18,438
-Where's that?
-In England.

928
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:20,266
Is that near where Daddy works?

929
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,703
Nah, your daddy works near,
uh, London, the Big Smoke.

930
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:25,053
This was in the countryside.

931
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:26,533
What were you doing?

932
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,143
I was a coal miner.

933
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:29,928
You've done a lot
of different jobs, Pop.

934
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:31,538
You can say that again.

935
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,062
Yeah, none of them lasted
more than a week.

936
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,413
My mother's worried about you.

937
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,502
Your mother's worried about you.

938
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:44,029
Well, Granny's always worried
about something, isn't she?

939
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,901
Ah, well, your granny's
a very caring person.

940
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:49,077
Sometimes it affects her nerves.

941
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:50,426
Like your mommy.

942
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,168
Mommy's worried, too, isn't she?

943
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:59,914
Daddy, are we gonna
have to leave Belfast?

944
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,006
PA: All right, Buddy,
that's me away, then.

945
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,660
I'll see you
when I get back next week.

946
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,444
MISS LEWIS: In you come, girls.
Catherine. Quinn.

947
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:10,229
Come on in, girls. You can help
put the pencils out.

948
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:12,100
PA:
Be good, son.

949
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:13,493
If you can't be good?

950
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,669
BOTH:
Be careful.

951
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:18,411
BILLY:
Seems like only yesterday

952
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:21,022
you and me were
in school together.

953
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:23,982
You're gonna need to stay
away from my family.

954
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,245
BILLY: That's big talk
for a fella who's never here.

955
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:28,595
PA: You can rely on me
to be here when it matters.

956
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,336
BILLY:
I hope your timing's good.

957
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,165
Things get out of hand
pretty quick round these parts.

958
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:38,300
Do you know the problem
with men like you?

959
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:40,650
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

960
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:43,915
And the problem with men like
you is you know you're not.

961
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,093
We'll keep it simple.

962
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,749
You're with us
or you're against us.

963
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:52,924
Clock's ticking.

964
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,403
You're a soft touch!

965
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:56,405
Time for real Protestants
to step up!

966
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,059
PA:
Ach, you're no real Protestant.

967
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,801
You're a jumped-up gangster
and always were.

968
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,646
MAN: There's peelers about.
Hey, watch it, youse two.

969
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,300
WOMAN:
Quick.

970
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:32,137
MA: Ah, look.
There you are now, son.

971
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,318
Hello, son.

972
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:41,624
The police officer here
just wants a wee word with you.

973
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,452
There seems to be
a-a wee bit of confusion

974
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,672
about something that happened
at Mr. Singh's.

975
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:47,892
Go on, sit down there, now.

976
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,856
POLICEMAN:
Do you know why I'm here, son?

977
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,424
Don't lie to me.

978
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:00,252
A very serious crime
has been committed

979
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:01,819
down in Mr. Singh's shop.

980
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,082
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

981
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,827
All the best, now,
and give my regards to Josie.

982
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,220
-POLICEMAN: I will do.
-I do like a man in a uniform.

983
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,875
Was he in there long?

984
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:17,530
Apples'll grow again, should
they grow on a gooseberry tree!

985
00:47:17,704 --> 00:47:19,532
I didn't even
eat the chocolate!

986
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:22,840
: No, I won't
be here when it's over.

987
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:24,711
You're asking me
to wait an hour to find out

988
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,713
if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

989
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,410
I say it's too long to wait.

990
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,108
-I won't do it.
-WILL KANE: Amy...

991
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:32,458
I mean it.
If you won't go with me now,

992
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,939
I'll be on that train
when it leaves here.

993
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:37,811
I've got to stay.

994
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:39,857
No, you're not listening to me.

995
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,033
:
I am listening. I am listening.

996
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,556
Would you, would you listen
to me for a change?

997
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,514
I'm trying to be practical
about this.

998
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,299
MA: Look, the police were here
today but their father wasn't,

999
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,822
so, no, I'll not be
having any lectures

1000
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,215
-from you, mister.
-Don't be like that.

1001
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:51,999

MRS. FORD: All the better

-Welcome home. -Ah, you're
a silver-tongued charmer.

- All right?

1024
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:05,420
MR. STEWART:
Ah, just the fella.

1025
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:07,118
Have you got a horse
for the 2:30 race?

1026
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,728
I have, but if I tell you,
the odds'll come down.

1027
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:11,209
Christ, I'm not gonna
bet the house.

1028
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,211
Fancy Man, each way.
She'll get you a pint.

1029
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:16,083
-Is that Paddy moving out?
-Poor Catholics have no choice.

1030
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,693
-It's a mad world.
-Well, get used to it.

1031
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,434
We all live there now.

1032
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:21,871
NEWSMAN:
Prize capture was a tanker

1033
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:24,744
laden with
2,500 gallons of petrol.

1034
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,138
They'd also taken dozens
of crates of milk bottles

1035
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:29,575
from a passing truck and
dubbed the whole enterprise

1036
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,316
the Petrol Bomb Factory.

1037
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,448
MA: Sure all the kids in
the street are going mad.

1038
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,146
PA:
What do you want me to do?

1039
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,539
MA:
You need to talk to them boys.

1040
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,634
How many was there?

1041
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:47,854
About ten of them.

1042
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,465
And what did your mate do?

1043
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,121
He said he wasn't joining
anything they belonged to.

1044
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:57,429
Then he gave the big one a dig
in the gob and ran like hell.

1045
00:49:57,603 --> 00:49:59,344
So did I.

1046
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,346
Did they chase you?

1047
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,435
Aye, but we got
a street ahead of them.

1048
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:05,741
Then we ran into me Uncle
Tony's and turned the corner

1049
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:07,700
before they could see us.

1050
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,876
We put the heart across
me Uncle Tony.

1051
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,921
He was on the toilet,
doing his horses,

1052
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:14,576
and then he dropped his pencil
down the loo.

1053
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:18,276
You've delivered
for these boys before, aye?

1054
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,278
Mm-hmm.

1055
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:22,106
And you know it's not milk
they're putting

1056
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,543
back in them empty bottles?

1057
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:26,371
I do now, Daddy.

1058
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,636
You were right to tell me.

1059
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:35,380
Come here and hold this, son.

1060
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:38,078
Hold that there.

1061
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,432
-You got that?
-Mm-hmm.

1062
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:47,435
REPORTER: And amid more
citywide violence overnight,

1063
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:49,916
government figures issued today
reveal that Northern Ireland

1064
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,962
now has the highest rate
of unemployment in the UK.

1065
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:55,095
PA:
Here it is. Planet Earth.

1066
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,792
And do you know where that is?

1067
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,707
-Sydney.
-Australia?

1068
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,361
Aye, that's right.

1069
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,059
-Do you know about it?
-Aye.

1070
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:03,930
They've got surfing
and weird football.

1071
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:05,671
And they have kangaroos
on the barbecue.

1072
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,151
And the weather's good.

1073
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:08,848
Young Joe Turner's
down there, too.

1074
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,284
That's right.

1075
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,156
How do you fancy that?

1076
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,548
What?

1077
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,550
Moving over there
for a wee while.

1078
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,074
You're joking.

1079
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:18,901
No. It's just down the side
a wee bit.

1080
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,468
It's ten and a half
thousand miles.

1081
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,905
Right, school, you two-- now.

1082
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:30,304
We might as well be going to
the moon if we went down there.

1083
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:31,871
Sure, you've already
family there.

1084
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:33,133
One second cousin.

1085
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:34,569
And you've the phone.

1086
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:37,355
And a millionaire
to pay the bills?

1087
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,052
We could take trips back.

1088
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:41,228
And pay for it with what,
Scotch mist?

1089
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,361
Family could come over
for holidays.

1090
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,058
I didn't come up the loch
in a bubble.

1091
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:46,538
There's no one from round here

1092
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:48,148
can afford the fare
to go down there.

1093
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,368
Or the time off work,
if they had any work.

1094
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:51,978
You just heard the bloody news.

1095
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,762
We have to do something.

1096
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:55,895

just staining my legs brown
with the tobacco water.

half the night

00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:36,741
PA:
The boss has been in touch.

1196
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,612
They want me to stay on.

1197
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,006
A permanent job in England.

1198
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,574
Wanting me to move
into management.

1199
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,140
It's more money.

1200
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:46,533
MAN:
Just let us through there.

1201
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,100
There's a house
that goes with it.

1202
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:49,710
We get it rent-free,

1203
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,365
with a chance to own it
if things go well.

1204
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,280
A wee bit bigger
than what we have here.

1205
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:55,934
A room for each of the boys.

1206
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,718
There's a wee garden, too.

1207
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:00,025
Are you allowed to play
football in that garden, Daddy?

1208
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,766
PA:
Aye, son.

1209
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,203
If I say yes, there's
more money straightaway.

1210
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,597
We could start getting on top
of that back tax now.

1211
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,295
This family's not gonna get
another chance like that

1212
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,731
in this town, not now.

1213
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:14,692
Hey, watch out
for that traffic there.

1214
00:57:14,866 --> 00:57:17,608
I'm watching it now, Mammy.
It's okay.

1215
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:19,871
DRIVER:
Come on, now. Two minutes.

1216
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:22,743
Get on board if you're coming.
Last tickets now.

1217
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,663
Sounds like
they really want you.

1218
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,191
What do you want?

1219
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,065
I want my family with me.

1220
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,851
I want you.

1221
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:50,118
You and me,

1222
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,991
we've known each other
since we were toddlers.

1223
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,298
We've known this street

1224
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,040
and every street round it
all our lives.

1225
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:02,000
And every man,
woman and child that lives

1226
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:05,003
in every bloody house,
whether we like it or not.

1227
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:08,485
I like it.

1228
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:12,967
And you say you've
a wee garden for them boys?

1229
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,757
But here, they can play
wherever the hell they like,

1230
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,802
'cause everybody knows them,

1231
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:25,327
everybody likes them
and everybody looks after them.

1232
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,418
If we go over the water,

1233
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:32,900
them people's not gonna
understand a word we say.

1234
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:37,035
And half of them,
they'll take the hand out of us

1235
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,646
for sounding different.

1236
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,607
And the other half,
they'll hate us

1237
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,740
'cause men here are killing
their young sons on our streets.

1238
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,743
They'll think
we don't give a shite.

1239
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,398
And you think they're gonna
welcome us with open arms?

1240
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:55,444
What, and say, "Come on in.

1241
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,317
Well done for stealing
the house off of us"?

1242
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,668
Things change.

1243
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,891
Aye. They do.

1244
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:12,549
We need to decide by Christmas.

1245
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,553
You need to decide by Christmas.

1246
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,906
You're coming back,
aren't you, Daddy?

1247
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,953
You look after your mummy.

1248
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:28,347
Be good. If you can't be good...

1249
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:31,655
"And if you can't be good,
be careful."

1250
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:33,918
DRIVER:
Right, off we go.

1251
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,790
Aldergrove Airport,
ladies and gents.

1252
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:53,328
PA:
We'll talk on the phone, okay?

1253
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,897
MA:
Give me a ring.

1254
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:59,117
Tell me when you've got there.

1255
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,913
♪ I'm stranded ♪

1256
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:20,921

1260
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:47,121
NURSE: I caught you looking
at Dr. Kildare.

1261
01:00:47,295 --> 01:00:50,124
-NURSE 2: Right. You can talk.

1262
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:52,083
POP:
Have you wrote to Santa?

1263
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:53,780
MA: Oh, he has,
but Santa's explained

1264
01:00:53,954 --> 01:00:55,434
that money's
a bit tight this year,

1265
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:57,349
so he's not to expect too much.

1266
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,264
Sure, Santa has plenty
of surplus

1267
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:01,483
if you talk to
the people in the know.

1268
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,572
Your health is all you need

1269
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,792
-for a Christmas present.
-Ah. Well, you've the right one

1270
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,620
to keep you cheerful here,
haven't you, Pop?

1271
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,753
You tell your mammy
to stop her cheek,

1272
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,406
or I'm not taking you
to the show.

1273
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,843
What show's that?

1274
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:14,105
MA:
I don't know. I think there's

1275
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:15,628
Christmas carols in it, though.

1276
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,282
GRANNY: Oh, that's
me waterworks.

1277
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:19,023
MA:
And you, behave yourself.

1278
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,589
Don't be annoying your pop.

1279
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,113
Don't be asking
for any Christmas presents.

1280
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:23,375
He's no money, either.

1281
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:26,247
Taxman's got it, like ours.

1282
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:28,075
Ach, don't worry.

1283
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:30,948
Your mammy will persuade Santa
to bring some presents.

1284
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:33,341
Ach. Don't think so, Pop.

1285
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:34,908
I always know
when there's no money.

1286
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:36,562
-MAN: Hello?

1287
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,390
-It's the rent man.
-BUDDY: I'll get it, Mam.

1288
01:01:38,564 --> 01:01:40,087
Shut your mouth.

1289
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:42,742
Is your mum in there, wee man?

1290
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,135
Nobody's here.

1291
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:45,745
-

1292
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:48,313
Oh, that puts me in mind
of a great wee system

1293
01:01:48,487 --> 01:01:50,881
we had in the old days
for paying the rent.

1294
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:53,971
The rent man would come round
and collect the money

1295
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:56,147
for every house
in the whole street,

1296
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:58,279
and once he had done

1297
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:01,543
and all the rent books
were marked up to date,

1298
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,807
one of the boys would
hold him up at gunpoint

1299
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:05,547
in the back entry

1300
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,767
and take all the money
back off him,

1301
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:10,291
and then he'd hand it
straight back

1302
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:12,380
to all the residents
in the street,

1303
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,948
with a little commission
for the service.

1304
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:18,647
Yeah, it was
a very effective system.

1305
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:21,215
And the rent man was
so good about it in the end

1306
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:23,783
that eventually they cut him in
for a wee bit, too,

1307
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,307
and everybody was happy.

1308
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:29,136
Except for the council,
I suppose.

1309
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:32,052
His work's giving my da a house
in England now if he wants one.

1310
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,402
It's got a garden
and everything,

1311
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,275
and two toilets, and they're
both inside the house.

1312
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,581
There's nothing wrong
with an outside toilet,

1313
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,366
except on an aeroplane.

1314
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:46,023
My ma says,
if we went across the water,

1315
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,329
they wouldn't understand
the way we talk.

1316
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:49,983
That shouldn't be
a problem, son.

1317
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:51,898
I've been married
to your granny for 50 years.

1318
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:54,988
I've never understood
a word she's said.

1319
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:57,425
And if they can't
understand you,

1320
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,951
then they're not listening,
and that's their problem.

1321
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,604
You know, when I was
in Leicester,

1322
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,432
they said the same thing
about me.

1323
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:07,871
You know, so I put on
a different bloody accent

1324
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:09,655
every day just to annoy them.

1325
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:11,483
They never knew who I was.

1326
01:03:11,657 --> 01:03:13,093
But I did,

1327
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:16,618
and that's the only one
who needs to know.

1328
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:19,534
You know who you are, don't you?

1329
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,232
Yes, Pop.

1330
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:25,714
You're Buddy from Belfast 15,

1331
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,716
where everybody knows you

1332
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,371
and your pop looks out for you

1333
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:32,373
and your mummy looks out
for you,

1334
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,898
your daddy looks out for you,
your granny looks out for you,

1335
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,421
your brother looks out for you,

1336
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:39,946
and the whole family
looks out for you.

1337
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:44,821
And wherever you go
and whatever you become,

1338
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:47,562
that'll always be the truth.

1339
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,435
And that thought
will keep you safe.

1340
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:53,046
It'll keep you happy.

1341
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,656
Will you remember that for me?

1342
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,137
-Yes, Pop.
-Aye.

1343
01:03:57,311 --> 01:03:59,574
Fine man you are.

1344
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:02,099
Now, forget about

1345
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:05,058
what your father
and your mother want.

1346
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:07,017
What do you want?

1347
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,890
I want you
and my granny to come, too.

1348
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,735
-

1349
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,780
:
Hear me.

1350
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:35,436
Hear me.

1351
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,309
I am here tonight to warn you

1352
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:42,052
that you have yet
a chance and hope

1353
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:44,054
of escaping my fate.

1354
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:46,665
Who wears chains that size?

1355
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,102
: Granny, you're not
allowed to talk in the theater.

1356
01:04:49,276 --> 01:04:50,843
It makes one heck of a necklace.

1357
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:53,541
You were always
a good friend to me.

1358
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:55,587
Thank you.

1359
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:59,156
You will be haunted.

1360
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:05,640
Is this the chance and hope
you mentioned, Jacob?

1361
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:07,599
It is.

1362
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,862
I think I'd rather not.

1363
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,951
Oh, I'm bloody well sure
you wouldn't.

1364
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,056
When will Pop get out
of the hospital?

1365
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,581
When the doctors say
his lungs are fine.

1366
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:35,932
When Pop went to England
to be a coal miner,

1367
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,759
did you go with him?

1368
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,025
Did you want to?

1369
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:47,639
Neither do I.

1370
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,470
Has your father said
what he's doing?

1371
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:57,475
He says it has to get decided
by Christmas.

1372
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:58,911
When's he coming back?

1373
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,173
At the weekend.

1374
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,827
We're going to the pictures.

1375
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,221
He's taking us to
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

1376
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:05,918
What in the name of God is that?

1377
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:07,006
It's a flying car.

1378
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,965
Oh, God, I've heard it all.

1379
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:11,489
It goes over a cliff, and you
nearly fall out of your seat.

1380
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,012
Do you want to come?

1381
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:15,319
It'll be company for you
till my pop's home.

1382
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:17,408
If God had wanted me
to see flying cars,

1383
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:19,453
I'd have been born
with blinking wings.

1384
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,196
You love your films, don't you?

1385
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:28,985
I was a great one for the
pictures when I was your age.

1386
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,596
I used to think you could
climb right inside the screen

1387
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,599
and visit all those
strange places you saw.

1388
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,818
Like that one in that film.

1389
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,516
What was that, uh...?

1390
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,908
Uh, Lost Horizons.

1391
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,649
-Did you ever see that?
-No.

1392
01:06:41,823 --> 01:06:43,564
What was the name
of the place, Granny?

1393
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,003
Shangri-La.

1394
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:48,874
That's what they called it.

1395
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:51,050
Did you ever go there?

1396
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,188
There were no roads
to Shangri-La

1397
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,668
from our part of Belfast.

1398
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:04,803
So, will you go one day?

1399
01:07:18,947 --> 01:07:20,819
-

1400
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:23,256
What? Where do they think
they're going?

1401
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,084
Look out!

1402
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:35,921
:
What's happening?

1403
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:37,749
:
Look!

1404
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:39,229
-Oh!
-Look at that!

1405
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,103

Sit down for
a few minutes here.

1440
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:57,002
We've a wee word
to have with you.

1441
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,443
Buddy, uh, Mum and I want
to talk to you about something,

1442
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:06,316
something that we might
have to do as a family.

1443
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,146
You know the way your dad's
over in England

1444
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,974
and he's been working
over there for quite a while?

1445
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,064
Well, we were thinking that,
uh, you know,

1446
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,850
maybe we'd all go as a family
and go live there.

1447
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:24,377
And, um, your dad's seen
a really nice wee house,

1448
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:27,206
and it's got
a lovely garden and...

1449
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,816
Play football, Buddy.

1450
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,818
-Aye.
-There's loads of room there.

1451
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,733
-More room than we have here.
-

1452
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,779
-I don't want to go to England!
-Could you switch that off?

1453
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:36,215
I don't want to go to England!

1454
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,434
It's all right, darling.

1455
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:38,783
-Hey, it's okay.
-It's all right.

1456
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:40,915
I'll have no friends
and no cousins,

1457
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:43,309
and I won't be able
to see Catherine at school!

1458
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,093
Hey, listen, you'll make new
friends, and you're gonna have

1459
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:46,573
a big garden
to play football in.

1460
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,096
I don't care about the garden!

1461
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,837
I want my granny and my pop,

1462
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:52,057
and I want to do my project
on going to the moon

1463
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,059
and get on the first desk,
and I don't want to

1464
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,669
-have to talk funny.
-Hey, hey, Buddy.

1465
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:57,367
And I don't want to forget
what road I have to

1466
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:58,672
-go down when I'm dead.
-That's enough now, darling.

1467
01:09:58,846 --> 01:10:00,544
No one's asking you
to talk funny.

1468
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,415
-No decision's been made yet.
-It's all right. Exactly.

1469
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:03,721
No, we were just trying to see
what everyone thought first.

1470
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,331
-You're just overtired.
-Exactly. Yeah.

1471
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:08,116
I don't want to leave Belfast!

1472
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:36,188
Let's just leave it
till Easter.

1473
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:39,060
-See where we are then.
-: Aye.

1474
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,237
These boys are suffering.

1475
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,328
I don't think we've got
till Easter.

1476
01:10:48,592 --> 01:10:51,203
I don't think you and me
have got till Easter, either.

1477
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:59,211
Well, come home.

1478
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:01,387
We'll fight this together.

1479
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,390
Kids the same age as ours

1480
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:06,566
are getting killed
around the corner.

1481
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:10,918
Well, we'll be careful.

1482
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,445
You can't be with them
24 hours a day.

1483
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,970
You can't take away
their childhood, either.

1484
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:32,418
You know, whatever happens...

1485
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:37,902
...what you've done
with these two,

1486
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:39,947
it's phenomenal.

1487
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:45,083

Roman Catholic street.

1518
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,384
That was before the trouble
in the middle of August.

1519
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:53,951
Now the government are proposing

1520
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,692
to rebuild this street,

1521
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:57,563
but there are increased
tensions in the city,

1522
01:13:57,737 --> 01:14:00,348

01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,848
-okay, son?
-All right, Daddy.

1534
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:24,895
Right, wee fella,
you did well for not

1535
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:26,766
grassing us to the police,
so you're in.

1536
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,159
What do you mean?

1537
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,943
You're one of us now,
and this is it.

1538
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:32,598
-This is what?
-This is war.

1539
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:35,949
Let's go, boys! Let's do this!

1540
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:37,603
BUDDY:
What are we gonna do?

1541
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:39,126
Whatever the hell we want.

1542
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,955
MAN: Our blood's up, lads.
Our bloods up.

1543
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:43,609

Authorities are urging citizens

1544

to return to their homes
immediately

1545
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:49,223
and to stay inside and off the
streets until further notice.

1546
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,095
Effective immediately.

1547
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:53,010

They machine-gunned us.

1548
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:56,056
Armored cars paving the way
for the hooligans to come in.

1549

Everybody, home now.

This city belongs

Get yourself something.

1565
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,138

1566
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,665

Oh, Mammy!

1571
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:56,377
We're looting the supermarket.

1572
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,944
Where did you get that?

1573
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,729
I told you, we're looting
the supermarket.

1574
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:01,295
You're what?

1575
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:03,210
You wait right there, young man.

1576
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:09,782
Why did you take
that washing powder?

1577
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:11,784
It's biological.

MA:
Come on.

1579
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:26,582
Move! Move it!

1580
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,542
You watch yourselves.

1581

Now, you put that back.

1582
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:35,373
Do you hear me?

1583
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,331
And if you ever,
ever do anything

1584
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:38,855
like that again,
I will kill you.

1585
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:40,683
Do you hear me?
And you, young madam,

1586
01:16:40,857 --> 01:16:42,989
if you ever drag my son
into something like this again,

1587
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:46,210
I will beat you black and blue
until you never get home again.

1588
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:47,907
Do you hear me?

1589
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:49,953
All right? Put it back I said.

1590
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:51,519
BILLY:
Hey, woman!

1591
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,217
We don't put things back.

1592
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:55,480
That's not the statement
we're trying to make.

1593

MAN: Billy, come on.
The army are coming. Come on!

Tear gas and rubber bullets
will be used!

We're clearing this area!
Move out the way now!

-BILLY: Time to get out of here.
-McLAURY: Don't try anything.

1602
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,938
BILLY: So you two are going
to guarantee safe passage

1603
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:20,418
for me and my men.

1604
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:21,898
If you try to run,

1605
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,334
I'll put a bullet
in your son's head.

1606
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:26,337
-

1607
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:32,473
BILLY: Ah, here he comes,
the Lone Ranger.

1608
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,172
SOLDIER:
Clear this area right now!

1609
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:38,044
I can see your kind needs
a little discipline.

1610
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:40,090
You let them go now.

1611
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:42,658
No, I think if I do,

1612
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:45,051
one of them soldiers
is gonna take my head off.

1613
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:48,272
If they don't, I will.

1614
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:52,015
Over their dead bodies.

1615
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,720
Folks always have
a problem with change.

1616
01:18:01,894 --> 01:18:04,244
But you'd better get
used to it, mister.

1617
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:08,031
People like me

1618
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:11,382

It's gonna be all right.

1646
01:20:28,736 --> 01:20:33,002
I'll talk to the committee,
get this fixed.

1647
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:35,526
There'll be no more bother.

1648
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:43,577
I caught sight of my face
in that shop window

1649
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:45,623
when I was running
down the street

1650
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,886
and dragging them poor kids
behind me.

1651
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:54,414
And I was looking
in the mirror just now...

1652
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:58,244
...at that same face.

1653
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:03,815
And I asked myself...

1654
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:08,341
"What the hell am I doing?"

1655
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:19,526
And then I was sick.

1656
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,662
Like I am every morning now.

1657
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,542
And I realized...

1658
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:42,723
...I don't think

1659
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,161
it really matters anymore.

1660
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,949
So, tomorrow...

1661
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:57,086
...when Uncle Mack
and Auntie Violet come round...

1662
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:04,093
...we're going to start
packing.

1663
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:22,589
POP:
You have no choice.

1664
01:22:22,763 --> 01:22:26,376
You know they're gonna come
for you, don't you?

1665
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:30,380
And this time,
they'll send somebody serious.

1666
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:34,819
Get yourselves to the moon.

1667
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:43,480
London's only
one small step for a man.

1668
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:47,005
Belfast will still be here
when you get back.

1669
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:50,182
Will you?

1670
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:55,883
I'm going nowhere
you won't find me.

1671
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:13,031
MISS LEWIS:
And now to announce the winners

Well, how'd it go with this?

BOTH:
We got a gold star.

1675
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:24,347
Ah, good on youse.

1676
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:27,872
Now, tell me this,
seeing as you two will know--

1677
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:30,788
how do I get to the moon
with only ten pound,

1678
01:23:30,962 --> 01:23:33,486
three leaky umbrellas
and my bus pass?

1679
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:47,500
See, there's an art
to an Ulster fry, son.

1680
01:23:47,674 --> 01:23:49,633
Mind you, I'm glad
your Aunt Violet's away

Sure, I think it's great that

1685
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:00,557

01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,941
Oh, I'm done.

1704
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,726
-Here. You're all right.
-Oh, dear.

1705
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,423
-Will!
-

1706
01:25:24,597 --> 01:25:26,164
-You're all right.
-Yeah.

1707
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:27,731
Take that note up
to Mrs. Hewitt

1708
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:29,385
and get the wee message
for your granny.

1709
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:30,647
For her nerves.

1710
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:32,910
-Come on.
-

1711
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:48,404
That was a lot of people
that came to see him today.

1712
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:50,580
Aye.

1713
01:25:50,754 --> 01:25:52,756
He was very popular.

1714
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,366
And he owed half of them money.

1715
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:01,721
He used to help me
with my maths.

1716
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:12,079
He was a very deep thinker.

1717
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,562
A very deep thinker.

1718
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,695
Did he help you?

1719
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,657
Yeah.

1720
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:28,052
Yeah, he did help me.

1721
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:31,882
He helped me a lot.

1722
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:38,236
MINISTER: "For now we see
through a glass, darkly;

1723
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:40,630
"face-to-face:

1724
01:26:40,804 --> 01:26:44,547
"for now I-I know in part;
but then I shall know

1725
01:26:44,721 --> 01:26:47,419
"as also I am known.

1726
01:26:47,593 --> 01:26:49,639
"For when I was a child,

1727
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:52,946
"I spake as a child,
I understood as a child,

1728
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,254
"I thought as a child:

1729
01:26:56,428 --> 01:27:00,040
but then I became a man and
I put away childish things."

1730
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:06,830
So do not say in grief
that you are sorry he is gone,

1731
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:11,008
but rather, say in thankfulness

1732
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:14,316
you are grateful he was here.

1733
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,976
MAN:
God love him.

01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,674

Ah, I'll miss him, now.

1736
01:27:26,632 --> 01:27:28,591

to toast him down the club, eh?

1737
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:30,201
MAN: Will we head down now,
sure, will we?

1738
