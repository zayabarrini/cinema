1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What is it you're drawing, Celestine?

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A bear.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And what's this?

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's a mouse.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They're friends.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Um, you're wrong there.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Am not!

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are so!

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
-Yes!
-No!

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
-No!

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Am mouse and a bear? It's just not possible!

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shush!

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Good. So, which story should I tell you tonight?

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The one about the big evil bear?

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, the big evil bear!

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In winter, the big evil bear sleeps.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, when he wakes up...

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When he wakes up, he's hungry!

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Exactly!

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And when he's hungry...

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He'll eat anything?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Absolutely anything!

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tires! Melons! Lamps! Cars! Houses!

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And when he's hungry, he drinks...

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Um, I mean eats,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Absolutely anything!

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And, what is the big evil bear's favourite food?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A little mouse?

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A little mouse? ONE little mouse?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ten!

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A hundred!

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thousands of little mice!

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wrapped.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
On bread.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In a pan.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Boiled.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Even raw!

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Completely raw?

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Most of all, completely raw!

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And still living,

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
with a little coat and a backpack still on,

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
this is what he likes the most.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Completely raw.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And still breathing.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But, but, are you sure that he is this evil?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you know the story of a little mouse who didn't

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
believe in the stories about the big evil bear?

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Everyone told her: ,,Beware of the bear!''

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But would she listen?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That little... that stupid little...

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Cretin!

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, pardon me...

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That, that...That dirty little...

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That naughty child!

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She didn't believe that bears are evil,

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
she said things like:

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
oh, the big evil bear,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it's just a story that the Gray told us

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
while drinking her eternal cup of tea.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But she was wrong!

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because one day,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
a beautiful d....

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Did you draw this, Celestine?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Believe me, children,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
it's only in fairytales that the bears are friends with mice!

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
*mumble, mumble, mumble...*

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is she saying?

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What did you say?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I said that that i didn't know.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm trying to listen here!

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can't understand her!

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Of course I can!

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No you can't!

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, I can't?

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Even when we understand her, you don't understand anything.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Repeat that!

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SILENCE!

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Come here, little birdie.

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
*?$&%#/

81
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Celestine!

82
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is it clear, can we go out?

83
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wait...

84
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's go.

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, look, he's lost his first tooth.

86
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oooh, poor darling.

87
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And not a trace of sugar.

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like a pearl.

89
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, don't cry now, my darling,

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's not that bad. I'll put the tooth on your nightstand,

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and the tooth fairy will come.

92
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,040
The tooth fairy?

93
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,758
What tooth fairy?

94
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,044
The nice little mouse tooth fairy.

95
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,462
She'll fly by when you'll sleep

96
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,036
and take your tooth.

97
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:08,583
She'll replace it with a nice golden coin.

98
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,289
By the value of... ?

99
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,473
A biiiig coin! Your first! The beginning of your great fortune.

100
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,339
If you learn to invest it, that is.

101
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,959
But... I've never heard of this mouse tooth fairy before.

102
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,737
It's because you've never lost a tooth before!

103
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,769
It doesn't matter. Firstly, if it's a mouse from a fairy tale

104
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,334
she can't possibly exist.

105
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:38,004
No? Why do the teeth dissappear from nightstands then?

106
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:43,030
Well, you best go to sleep now. Then the fairy will come to collect your tooth

107
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,665
and replace it with a coin.

108
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,468
How much will she give me?

109
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,120
Um... One pound.

110
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,083
Two.

111
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:55,219
Oh this is great! That's my son.

112
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,236
Come on, darling, now go to bed.

113
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:03,992
A MOUSE!

114
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,191
A mouse? Where?

115
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,117
There, by the toys!

116
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:10,174
I'll catch it!

117
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,807
She's under here!

118
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:23,959
Where is she?

119
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,919
There!

120
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:37,686
Hey! My tooth!

121
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,172
That's my money! Give it back!

122
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,013
Dirty beast!

123
00:12:46,014 --> 00:13:04,548
Less noise, George, the little one is sleeping!

124
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,711
George! The trash!

125
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:08,351
Ernest, Ernest, my name is Ernest,

126
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:08,506
i have no idea what he's singing here, sorry

127
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:11,179
...because I'm hungry, I'm hungry,

128
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,943
I'll eat anything, I'll eat anything

129
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,582
It doesn't have to be healthy.

130
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,947
I'm giving this up, i cant translate songs.

131
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:30,790
Give some spare change in my hat.

132
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:46,258
I assure you that if you give me some change,

133
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,143
you'll feel better.

134
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:50,144
And me too.

135
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,523
You have five days to pay the fine.

136
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,634
I'M HUNGRY!

137
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,225
Noooo!

138
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:17,535
Don't eat me!

139
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,578
But I'm hungry.

140
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,579
What's your name?

141
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:23,457
Ernest.

142
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,034
I'm Celestine.

143
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:28,635
Take me seriously, Ernest!

144
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:30,227
You can't eat me.

145
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:32,207
Bears eat mice only in fairytales.

146
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,830
Don't tell me you beilive in fairytales, Ernest. You are not an idiot.

147
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:35,831
Yes, well, but I'm hungry!

148
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,832
You're hungry, you're hungry...

149
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,886
You think eating a little mouse like me will make you full?

150
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,986
Look at me, Ernest, I'm nothing but skin and bones.

151
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,499
And it's very bad for you health to eat from dumpsters.

152
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:46,882
You woudn't beilive how many diseases are there.

153
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,773
Flu, tifus, colera, hepatitis...

154
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:50,985
Do you want to catch every disease in existence?

155
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,561
Well... No, Celestine, but...

156
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:57,115
Let's see. Very cold and moist... Red eyes...

157
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:59,394
Thin fur... Are your ears sore?

158
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,171
And teeth?

159
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,703
Oh my... You have a dental disease.

160
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:04,704
What?

161
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:05,705
I'm sick?

162
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:06,706
Not yet.

163
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,657
But it'll come.

164
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,027
Listen, Ernest.

165
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:16,584
I know a place where you can regain your health by eating anything you want.

166
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:17,585
Marshmallows?

167
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:23,049
Marshmallows, toffees, nougat, cakes, lollipops... Allright?

168
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,148
Allright.

169
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,687
It's here.

170
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,569
You won't be hungry after this, Ernest.

171
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,570
No, wait!

172
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,590
Here you go. Bon apetit.

173
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,975
Celestine!

174
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:15,976
Thanks!

175
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,172
No problem.

176
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:44,173
Watch where you're going!

177
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,000
You made me drop my money!

178
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,001
I'm sory madam, I'm in a hurry!

179
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:23,301
It's not open yet.

180
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:30,131
They told us to wait here.

181
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,319
You stink of garbage.

182
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,749
Hurry up, or the big evil bear will get you!

183
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,493
How many teeth did you find?

184
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:01,494
Seven.

185
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:03,714
Not bad. I found twelve.

186
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,589
Twelve?

187
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,074
I usualy find more, it's way below my best score.

188
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,075
And you, Celestine?

189
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,076
How many did you find?

190
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,824
...well...

191
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,770
Please wait there.

192
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,530
This will hurt.

193
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:45,531
Step forward.

194
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:50,392
Here you go, madam, twelve teeth.

195
00:22:50,393 --> 00:22:51,393
Very good.

196
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:52,394
I can do even better, you know.

197
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:53,395
Yes, yes... Next!

198
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,263
Seven? Only?

199
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:02,979
Yes, but three incisors. And look at the quality.

200
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:07,315
Incisor? I need one, this one is much too short.

201
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,945
Thank you!

202
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,823
We'll try this one...

203
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:32,577
Repeat after me: The big bad bear is our biggest burden.

204
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,538
Wa wig wed wear if far wiweft wurden.

205
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:37,539
It doesn't fit...

206
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:41,941
And now?

207
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:46,617
Wa fig fet fear iw of biweft buften.

208
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:49,614
Allow me.

209
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,699
Try.

210
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
The wig wad wear...

211
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:58,701
Stop!

212
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,446
And now?

213
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:06,162
The big bad bear is our biggest burden.

214
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,163
Here we go.

215
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,846
The length, my darling, the length.

216
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:10,847
What?

217
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:11,848
Only one tooth?

218
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:12,849
One single tooth in the whole night?

219
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,058
Well yes, but I was thrown in the bin...

220
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,463
Oh yes? And how did you escape?

221
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:19,464
Well, there was a bear...

222
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,456
A what?

223
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:24,820
No, no, nothing...

224
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,464
Can we see what you carry around in that bag?

225
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:34,835
Well, we can see how you spend your time, Celestine.

226
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:38,670
You draw. Instead of working.

227
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,561
You will never become a dentist if you continue like this, Celestine.

228
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:50,510
But, but, I don't want to be a dentist...

229
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,846
Oh, I see what's going on here.

230
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm afraid, Celestine, that you have lost a too many points...

231
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,795
What you need is a boost of motivation.

232
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:03,796
Come with me.

233
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:12,053
You see, Celestine, our kind is nothing like the bear kind.

234
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,054
Our strength does not lie in

235
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:16,725
our weight, muscles, claws or scary teeth.

236
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:22,897
No, we are delicate, quiet, refined beings.

237
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,372
Our whole civilisation,

238
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:28,833
everything we've ever made possible over the centuries,

239
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:31,087
we owe all that to what?

240
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:35,389
To what, Celestine?

241
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:36,390
To what?

242
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,691
To our incisors.

243
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:39,692
That's right!

244
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,799
They are the very basis for our exsistance.

245
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,505
Thanks to them, we were able to build the biggest cities,

246
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:48,575
remove the biggest obsticles,

247
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:51,555
and construct the most complex machinery!

248
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,830
We have the biggest mills in the world!

249
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:07,250
And all this thanks to our cute, precious, delicate, perfect, sharp front teeth.

250
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:12,661
But, Celestine, what happens if a rodent looses an incisor?

251
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,079
He dies.

252
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,159
It is an unescapable fate.

253
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,311
He can't chew or talk, he dies,

254
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,312
killed by hunger

255
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,414
and loneliness.

256
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:34,071
What is the best replacement for a lost tooth?

257
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:36,646
The bear's tooth.

258
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:40,051
That's correct. Bears' teeth are very hard.

259
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:43,140
And the easiest teeth to collect are those which little idiotic bears

260
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:45,552
leave under their pillows.

261
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:46,553
Well, Celestine...

262
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:51,059
You will return to the surface and search for other teeth

263
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
in these little idiots' bedrooms.

264
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:57,403
But, Celestine, you may not return here

265
00:26:57,404 --> 00:27:01,165
until you've collected fifty teeth.

266
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,700
Fifty teeth, Celestine!

267
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,880
Good luck, Celestine!

268
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:12,881
Well, are you coming or not?

269
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:13,882
Yes, I'm coming!

270
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,716
Hello, hello children!

271
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:32,869
How are you?

272
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,870
Fine, thanks!

273
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,153
I would like a cupcake please!

274
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,969
I would like some boiled sweets!

275
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,589
I want some marshmallows!

276
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,100
A lemon cake please, daddy.

277
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,101
Coming right up!

278
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:00,440
Wait a minute!

279
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:04,437
Come here you punk!

280
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,979
You are not allowed to eat sugar! I told you a hundred times!

281
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,098
But daddy, why?

282
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,796
Don't daddy me! You are not allowed to eat even the smallest piece of sugar!

283
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:21,089
Do you want your teeth to rot and fall on the floor?

284
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,398
You'll end in your mother's shop there,

285
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,468
with completely rotten teeth?

286
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,404
Is that what you want?

287
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:31,528
Go now, we'll talk about this in the evening.

288
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:44,163
Hello, sir! How are you today?

289
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:46,936
I'm very well, thank you.

290
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:50,085
I need a tooth, so I'll be able to eat nougat again.

291
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,086
But of course,

292
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,087
which one do you need?

293
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:56,733
Actually, it's a first molar...

294
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:05,960
I have exactly what you need.

295
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,609
It's a first molar of top quality.

296
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,610
Try it on!

297
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,199
I'll take it! It's perfect! Thank you, maam.

298
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,268
Here you go, sweetie.

299
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,348
And you, my little, what will you have?

300
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:21,349
Sugar canes?

301
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,291
Cotton candy?

302
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,275
Sprinkles?

303
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:27,099
Do you have any marshmallows?

304
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,317
Marshmallows? But of course!

305
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:31,549
Oh, but I've run out...

306
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,656
No, no, no! Don't cry! I still have them in storage!

307
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:39,146
Wait here, I'll be back right away.

308
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:45,961
What are you doing here?

309
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,393
Thief! Thief!

310
00:29:47,394 --> 00:30:01,831
What have you done? I'm calling the police!

311
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,720
My marshmallows!

312
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,721
They are mine!

313
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,727
Police! Help! Police!

314
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,728
There's a thief!

315
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,729
He'd eaten all of my candy!

316
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,335
Here he is! It's him! He's here!

317
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:20,336
What's going on here?

318
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:28,577
Firstly you beg for money and now you're stealing?

319
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,578
But how did you get in there?

320
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,992
A little mouse told me...

321
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:34,993
A little mouse? What?

322
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,441
I was hungry and it smelled nice in there.

323
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,139
Well, we're taking you with us.

324
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:57,732
My marshmallows! My marshmallows! They are mine!

325
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,300
What a shameful display. I have no respect for this sort of people.

326
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:21,326
Ernest, Ernest! Do you want me to free you?

327
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:23,871
And if I do... 

328
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,595
will you do me a little favour?

329
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:38,997
What about a big favour?

330
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,237
Will you do me a big favour if I free you?

331
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:54,967
An enormous favour?

332
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,597
The biggest favour in the world?

333
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:10,129
Yes. The biggest favour in the world.

334
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,672
Would you like more peas, darling?

335
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,941
No, I want some candy.

336
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,733
Come on. Don't start that again.

337
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:31,948
We told you a hundred times that you can't have any candy.

338
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:32,949
But why?

339
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,453
You see, my boy, it's the buisiness. 

340
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,043
I sell candy, which makes the teeth rot...

341
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:40,806
... and I sell replacement teeth.

342
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:44,707
And when you grow up, you'll inherit those two shops.

343
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,708
You'll be able to make a great fortune, my boy.

344
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:50,062
But only if you'll have a perfect smile for your clients.

345
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:56,280
And like my father said:

346
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,628
It's simple, Leon. 

347
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:56,627
A beautiful smile is nothing but healthy teeth.

348
00:32:57,629 --> 00:32:58,629
To become rich,

349
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,479
you have to make other people's teeth rot, 

350
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,728
not your own. Do you understand?

351
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,869
Yeah..

352
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,206
Well, there's a lot to do tomorow, so let's go to sleep.

353
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:17,396
I have to replace all of my stock...

354
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:20,728
Well I'm lucky... Nothing like this would happen to my shop.

355
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,177
Who in the world would get the idea to steal teeth...

356
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:36,687
It's here, Ernest. Hurry!

357
00:33:38,923 --> 00:33:40,195
This is it.

358
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:45,476
Stop it! You're making too much noise!

359
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:49,696
Stop! You'll wake up the whole neighbourhood!

360
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,723
Here we go.

361
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:54,724
Wait!

362
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:57,464
Where are those teeth?

363
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,970
They're not here, they are probably in storage...

364
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:00,971
And that's here, right?

365
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,972
Yes, that's it.

366
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:02,973
Now, let's see...

367
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,987
No, what are you doing?!

368
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:13,923
Stop it!

369
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:15,671
Here you go, it's opened.

370
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:16,672
Are you mad?

371
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:17,673
What? I opened it.

372
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:20,235
Ernest, I won't be able to carry that on my own...

373
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:22,388
Noo, I'm tired...

374
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,389
But you promised...

375
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,140
Allright, but that's all I'm doing.

376
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:33,261
Wait, I'll check if the coast is clear.

377
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,287
It's allright, you can come... Ernest?

378
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,288
Wait!

379
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,661
Bears have to go to sleep early.

380
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,662
Especially in winter.

381
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,110
Celestine! I forbid you to return before you...

382
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,487
Celestine...

383
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:19,391
This is unbelieveable!

384
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:21,525
This is fabulous!

385
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,526
Just look at this! 

386
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:23,527
How did you manage to...

387
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,069
It's great, this! I'm so proud of you!

388
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,070
Everyone! Long live Celestine!

389
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:33,071
Long live Celestine!

390
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:41,391
A big evil bear!

391
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,392
Ernest?

392
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:49,446
Celestine? You know that....

393
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:50,447
...that...

394
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:51,448
...That was you wasn't it?

395
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:52,449
You brought him here!

396
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,341
She was the one that never believed in big evil bears!

397
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:58,603
Everyone told her to beware of...

398
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,225
This way!

399
00:37:23,872 --> 00:37:25,233
Jump!

400
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,447
There! They are there!

401
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,041
This way!

402
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:51,278
There is the exit!

403
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:12,197
Left! Turn left!

404
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:26,213
Look!

405
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:38,885
I'm sure that I'd locked the door...

406
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:39,886
A mouse!

407
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:40,887
In my husband's truck!

408
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:17,400
What are you doing, Ernest? Why did you steal the truck? Are you mad?

409
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:18,810
I was asleep, it's not my fault.

410
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:20,547
So it's my fault?

411
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:21,548
Yes, you made me climb down with you!

412
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,142
I couldn't carry that bag by myself!

413
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:25,143
You told me you'd show me the exit!

414
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,288
But you told me you remebered where it was!

415
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,289
I said that?

416
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:33,985
Ernest! Pull over! You can't escape!

417
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,956
Stop this instant!

418
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:39,957
I have a better idea.

419
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,441
Don't think you'll escape!

420
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:46,442
You might want to look there.

421
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,600
Ernest! I will never let go of this car!

422
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,301
Well, do as you please, but I'm turning right there.

423
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,566
Here we are.

424
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,526
Well, goodbye now.

425
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,670
What do you mean?

426
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,075
I'm going home.

427
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:43,076
And me?

428
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:46,350
You? I don't know.

429
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:48,839
I'm going to my home, and you're going to yours.

430
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,547
But, Ernest, I don't have a home.

431
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,398
You saw them chasing me...

432
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,270
Celestine, we are over.

433
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,271
It happens.

434
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,272
You saved me from the police, 

435
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:02,468
and in exchange I promised you the biggest favour in the world.

436
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:03,469
But Ernest...

437
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,510
Well, goodbye now.

438
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:09,681
But the situation has changed, Ernest!

439
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:13,921
I don't want any mice in my house.

440
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:31,731
Ernest, can you please listen to me?

441
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:35,787
No. I don't want a mouse living in my house.

442
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:37,747
You take one in, and a thousand come to follow.

443
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:40,123
I know what you are like. Goodbye!

444
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:45,677
But Ernest...

445
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:46,678
I told you to leave!

446
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,588
But Ernest, you have to understand that things change...

447
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,767
I don't want mice in my house!

448
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:55,768
But...

449
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:56,769
No buts!

450
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,770
Ernest!

451
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,771
I'm hungry!

452
00:41:58,772 --> 00:41:59,772
No!

453
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:00,773
Mice!

454
00:42:34,296 --> 00:42:36,928
Thank you.

455
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:40,721
Celestine, I told you...

456
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,633
Hasn't anyone told you that it's impossible to get rid of mice?

457
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:43,634
Every bear knows that.

458
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:46,102
If you don't kill them, that is.

459
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,559
Your chocolate is burning.

460
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,780
Do you want to kill me, Ernest?

461
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,540
You can't do it with a broom, I'm too quick.

462
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,701
You could use the good old mouse trap,

463
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:01,925
but it's not that easy because we know very well how they work...

464
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:03,697
You could use the poison, of course, 

465
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:04,698
or a glue trap!

466
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:05,699
They are the cruelest of all.

467
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,464
The poor little mouse walks on it and

468
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,068
her paws get stuck on it.

469
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:11,774
She can't do anything about it.

470
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:13,530
She is very scared, and her heart beats 

471
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:15,293
so fast that it eventualy explodes.

472
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:16,294
Is that what you want, Ernest?

473
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:17,295
To make my heart explode?

474
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,395
Well no, Celestine, but a bear and a mouse can't...

475
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,138
What? What can't they do?

476
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:28,167
Mice should live below and the bears above, is that it?

477
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:30,326
Well yes. It has always been like this...

478
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:33,358
Allright, Ernest. Do you have a basement?

479
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,359
Um, sure...

480
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Okay.

481
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,244
I get the basement and you stay here.

482
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:40,436
But...

483
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:43,754
No buts. Goodbye, Ernest. And stay above!

484
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:51,635
No! You rest down below, Celestine!

485
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:53,790
I don't want to hear you, let alone see you!

486
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:56,696
My chocolate!

487
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,948
... she is the one that didn't believe in stories about the bears...

488
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:50,120
...everyone warned her to stay away from evil bears...

489
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:57,830
It's just a nightmare.

490
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,404
Don't be afraid, I'm not your nightmare.

491
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:06,405
I'm Ernest!

492
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:12,987
Ernest, I'm worthless.

493
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:15,109
Worthless?

494
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:17,161
What are you saying?

495
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,162
I am!

496
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:21,068
I am alone in the world and noone likes me.

497
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:23,148
And I don't have a home anymore.

498
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:24,149
Oh yeah?

499
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,158
And me? Does anyone like me?

500
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:29,607
Did you paint this, Celestine?

501
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:33,944
It's brilliant!

502
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:35,899
It's just like me!

503
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,141
Celestine, who painted this, is not worthless!

504
00:48:39,142 --> 00:48:40,142
You are a great artist!

505
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:41,143
Well, yes, but...

506
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,786
This is why I'm all alone.

507
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,176
They don't want me to draw,

508
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:47,177
they want me to be a dentist...

509
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:49,244
Oh yes...

510
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:50,245
I know what you mean...

511
00:48:50,246 --> 00:48:51,672
I wanted to be an actor.

512
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:53,015
And a musician.

513
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,938
And a storyteller.

514
00:48:54,939 --> 00:48:57,179
But no, of course, they wanted me to be a judge.

515
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,629
Like my father, and his father, and my uncle and his father.

516
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,117
Stop playing your music, Ernest!

517
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:05,913
Stop torturing our ears with your stories!

518
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:08,737
You should be studying law instead of singing!

519
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:09,738
Look!

520
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,739
No, Celestine!

521
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,745
You stay down below!

522
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:16,291
I don't want to hear from you again!

523
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:22,247
Isn't that a great picture?

524
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:25,177
Come with me.

525
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:27,989
Take your paints and brushes and follow me.

526
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,388
We're going to make you an art studio.

527
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:40,790
And what are you going to paint?

528
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,154
This is going to be my first real painting.

529
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,889
The big evil bear, for example!

530
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:47,133
Here!

531
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,577
Raise your arms!

532
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:50,578
Like this.

533
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,222
Lift your foot!

534
00:49:58,223 --> 00:49:59,223
Perfect!

535
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:01,529
Now don't move!

536
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,530
So you'll look calm.

537
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:13,108
Can I see?

538
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,892
I told you not to move!

539
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:26,123
Ernest?

540
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:28,878
Are you ill?

541
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,502
I'm just a little tired...

542
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:33,503
Go to bed right now!

543
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:37,530
You have to drink a lot of water when you're ill.

544
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,392
Leave me alone! Help!

545
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:06,428
Calm down, Ernest!

546
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:09,213
I'm not your nightmare.

547
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:10,214
I'm Celestine!

548
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:14,199
Are there any marshmallows left?

549
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Of course.

550
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,201
You didn't eat them all?

551
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:18,323
No, you dummie!

552
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:19,771
Promise?

553
00:52:19,772 --> 00:52:20,772
Promise.

554
00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:56,592
Good night.

555
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:57,593
Night.

556
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:20,766
Celestine!

557
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,767
You know what?

558
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:22,768
I'm cured!

559
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:42,626
I bet you can't juggle with four!

560
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:43,627
You bet? 

561
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:54,879
Again, do it again!

562
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
Come on!

563
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:12,793
...and the president of the police department

564
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,467
Do you think they are talking about us?
(reports that the thiefs are still on the run)

565
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,522
and that they are still looking for them.

566
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:21,059
They say that it's only a matter of time before...

567
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,683
No, I'm sure they'd allready forgotten about us.

568
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,309
We will not rest until we find Ernest and his partner in crime Celestine.

569
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:41,026
We only have to wait until they leave their hiding place.

570
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,197
It doesn't matter how long it takes,

571
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,078
they must be punished!

572
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:51,044
And when we catch them, we will hand them over to justice!

573
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:53,028
Ernest will be prosecuted like he deserves,

574
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:55,287
and Celestine deserves a severe punishment.

575
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:56,288
He is the greates criminal of them all

576
00:54:58,557 --> 00:55:01,683
and Celestine will be punished for this abominable crime.

577
00:55:01,684 --> 00:55:04,901
We will severely judge Ernest.

578
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:09,010
Nor Ernest nor Celestine will escape their sentence!

579
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:12,249
You called for me, Ernest?

580
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,959
No, no, it's nothing, Celestine...

581
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Everything is fine.

582
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:18,010
It's all fine.

583
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,356
You are getting better, Celestine!

584
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:29,011
Yes, but I've had enough of painting big evil bears.

585
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:30,012
Yes?

586
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,068
Did you find a more interesting subject?

587
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,012
I'd like to paint a winer landscape.

588
00:55:40,013 --> 00:55:42,326
Well, you'll have to wait for spring...

589
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:44,817
Bears know very well how to do this.

590
00:55:44,818 --> 00:55:45,818
Waiting for spring.

591
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:47,895
But the snow will melt by then.

592
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,681
Celestine would like to paint snow...

593
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,029
Celestine would like to paint some snow...

594
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:07,178
Go to work now, you artist!

595
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:08,179
Thank you, Ernest!

596
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,292
Ernest, I give you '' Winter ''.

597
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:34,087
In music, it would sound like...

598
00:58:10,926 --> 00:58:13,513
Ernest, the truck!

599
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:14,514
What's up with it?

600
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:17,324
It's like a big red dot.

601
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:19,769
If they see it, they'll find us.

602
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:23,817
There's only one thing to do!

603
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,573
Ernest, did you see the fish?

604
00:58:48,574 --> 00:58:49,574
Yeah, yeah...

605
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:50,575
I did.

606
00:58:51,855 --> 00:58:53,140
Don't you want to take a closer look?

607
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,832
No, no, I can see them from here.

608
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,644
Celestine, we're going back, come.

609
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:11,943
...is still going on. We have yet to find Ernest, the thief,

610
01:00:11,978 --> 01:00:13,650
and his partner Celestine.

611
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,296
Leave that be.

612
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:20,963
Don't be upset.

613
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:21,964
They'll never find us.

614
01:00:58,652 --> 01:00:59,481
What was that?

615
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:02,274
It's that mouse again!

616
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,792
George?

617
01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:08,950
My truck!

618
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:11,067
My shop!

619
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:14,330
Paint?

620
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:22,712
Ernest...

621
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,842
Luce, call the police!

622
01:01:24,843 --> 01:01:25,843
I know where Ernest is!

623
01:01:48,594 --> 01:01:50,355
Celestine...

624
01:02:17,636 --> 01:02:20,583
Oh, look! What a sunny morning!

625
01:02:23,593 --> 01:02:24,704
But the big evil bear is groaning...

626
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:27,979
He hasn't woken up yet.

627
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,880
He could eat me, that evil bear...

628
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,827
Good idea, after you've woken me up.

629
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:37,499
Well, we'll give him the breakfast for big evil bears.

630
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:41,792
If sir would like to open his mouth...

631
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:47,792
This is delicious.

632
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:51,692
I can't believe you can sleep in this sunshine.

633
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:00,394
Ernest, come see!

634
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:08,349
Go to the basement, Ernest!

635
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:09,563
You have to hide there!

636
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,870
And you? You have to hide as well!

637
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,004
Don't worry, I have a plan!

638
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:15,005
A plan?

639
01:03:18,823 --> 01:03:19,778
Celestine, are you sure of this?

640
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:20,779
Stay down there!

641
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:24,581
Celestine?

642
01:03:40,751 --> 01:03:41,498
He's here!

643
01:03:59,575 --> 01:04:00,528
Where is Ernest?

644
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:07,248
Ernest? He went to town to search for honey, and he said he'd be back tomorow.

645
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:18,055
For the last time, tell us where Ernest is!

646
01:04:20,744 --> 01:04:23,765
As you please. You know what's coming.

647
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:53,066
For the last time, Ernest, where is Celestine?

648
01:04:53,986 --> 01:04:56,162
Allright. You know what's coming.

649
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:22,378
Read all about Ernest's trial!

650
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:26,965
Buy the newest deluxe story about him and Celestine!

651
01:05:28,475 --> 01:05:30,301
It's him! There! Look!

652
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:11,564
The trial will now commence.

653
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:15,511
Bring in the accused.

654
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,441
Accused, stand up and introdouce yourself.

655
01:06:32,638 --> 01:06:33,442
Celestine.

656
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:41,566
Celestine. Can you tell us where we can find Ernest?

657
01:06:43,357 --> 01:06:46,316
What? You don't want to tell us where Celestine is?

658
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:50,757
Very well. In this case, you will be judged twice.

659
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:51,758
First time for what you've done,

660
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:54,500
and the second time for what she's done.

661
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:57,618
What? Celestine? What harm did she do?

662
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:58,890
She didn't do anything!

663
01:06:58,891 --> 01:06:59,891
Didn't do anything?

664
01:06:59,892 --> 01:07:02,732
She brought a rampaging bear in our town!

665
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:03,733
You call that nothing?

666
01:07:04,971 --> 01:07:07,137
What was he supposed to do? Die of hunger

667
01:07:07,137 --> 01:07:09,326
while the rich fat bears have everything they want?

668
01:07:11,086 --> 01:07:12,440
But I helped her carry her bag full of teeth.

669
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:13,441
It was a lot too heavy for her.

670
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:14,442
Silence!

671
01:07:14,443 --> 01:07:16,846
You wanted her to be a dentist, not me!

672
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:17,847
Silence!

673
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:20,500
Ernest, you and that Celestine are accused

674
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,286
of a number of unbelieveable crimes.

675
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,882
Burglary and damage.

676
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:28,546
Theft of a truck.

677
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:29,547
Running away!

678
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:30,548
Causing injuries!

679
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:33,540
And there are many more!

680
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:36,034
And that's not all!

681
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:39,101
But the most evil thing that you've done, Ernest...

682
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:40,927
You are accused of an unforgivable crime...

683
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:45,824
You were scaring the children.

684
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:46,825
What?

685
01:07:46,826 --> 01:07:47,826
Me? Children, was I scaring you?

686
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,034
Me?

687
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:54,542
I was upsetting the mother?

688
01:07:54,543 --> 01:07:56,154
Maam', do I scare you?

689
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,901
Well, no...

690
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:04,118
A mouse! There! A mouse! Help!

691
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,119
I give the...

692
01:08:08,563 --> 01:08:11,112
I give the word to the defense.

693
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:14,109
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 

694
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,110
your honor, 

695
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:18,543
I'd like you to put yourselves in my client's skin.

696
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:20,534
Being a bear ifs ifs fa fefifbe pfifn...

697
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:24,757
What did he say?

698
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:25,758
I don't know...

699
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,759
What are you saying?

700
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,760
I said that I didn't know!

701
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,268
Shut up, we're listening.

702
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:30,850
Yes, because you can understand him.

703
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:31,989
Of course I can.

704
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,644
Liar! You don't understand a thing!

705
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:34,645
You never understand anything.

706
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:40,842
Silence! Calm down!

707
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:48,004
Celestine, we are looking at an accusation wich is supported by...

708
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:48,758
...nothing at al!

709
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:49,759
I'm going to tell you what you are accusing me of.

710
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,737
You are accusing me of living with a bear!

711
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:53,783
How dare you!

712
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:56,371
All this is a result of your prejudgments!

713
01:08:56,476 --> 01:08:59,110
Yes, Celestine is my friend!

714
01:08:59,111 --> 01:09:00,111
That's what's bothering you!

715
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:03,507
Bears live above and mice below, that's what this is all about!

716
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:05,500
Is this how you want to raise your children?

717
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:06,501
In fear of mice?

718
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:09,122
Do you want them to be stupid of what?

719
01:09:09,123 --> 01:09:10,123
Silence, Celestine!

720
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:12,571
You are the accused, not an attorney!

721
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:14,959
You are the one having to face the consequences!

722
01:09:21,236 --> 01:09:22,364
Leave the house!

723
01:09:23,366 --> 01:09:24,366
The trial is not over!

724
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,367
Come back!

725
01:09:29,389 --> 01:09:31,241
Celestine, listen to me well.

726
01:09:31,242 --> 01:09:35,596
Noone questions the foundation of our society!

727
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:36,377
Especially a mouse.

728
01:09:38,737 --> 01:09:40,153
Silence!

729
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:45,846
Come back!

730
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:47,572
What are you doing?

731
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:48,573
We have to stop!

732
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:54,787
Don't come any closer! Return to your bench!

733
01:09:55,349 --> 01:09:56,840
This is an order!

734
01:09:59,006 --> 01:10:00,741
But Mr. Judge, you are on fire.

735
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:03,414
Obey me! Go back to your seat!

736
01:10:03,415 --> 01:10:04,415
I will not say it again!

737
01:10:12,734 --> 01:10:14,979
Climb down! I order you to climb down from there!

738
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,998
Let me go! Let me go, I tell you!

739
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:33,782
Mr. Judge! Go, quickly!

740
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:34,783
We have to leave!

741
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:47,663
Where did the others go?

742
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:48,664
They saved themselves.

743
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:49,665
Come on, let's go.

744
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,201
They've forsaken me.

745
01:10:52,263 --> 01:10:53,732
All but you.

746
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:54,733
Let's go, now...

747
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:00,840
Tell me, Celestine...

748
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,476
If we make it out of here alive...

749
01:11:02,477 --> 01:11:03,477
What do you want most in the world?

750
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:08,369
Find Ernest and never leave him again.

751
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,370
Allright.

752
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:14,689
But you know, Celestine, it's funny that you'd want to live with a bear...

753
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:15,690
Why?

754
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:18,384
Don't you live with a bear?

755
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:19,385
Oh, I do...

756
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:22,019
That's right, it's a funny thing.

757
01:11:31,402 --> 01:11:32,268
How are you, Mr. Judge?

758
01:11:34,353 --> 01:11:35,410
What's happened?

759
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,652
Well... There was a fire, Mr. Judge.

760
01:11:50,772 --> 01:11:54,012
Ernest... You've saved my life.

761
01:11:54,013 --> 01:11:55,013
How can I ever repay you?

762
01:11:55,014 --> 01:11:57,045
It's allright.

763
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,046
It's not allright!

764
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,446
What do you want most in the world?

765
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:01,447
Now?

766
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:02,448
Of course now!

767
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:05,408
To find Celestine.

768
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,214
And stay with her forever.

769
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:11,639
You are free to go.

770
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,610
She saved my life.

771
01:12:37,297 --> 01:12:38,769
Celestine?

772
01:12:40,558 --> 01:12:41,603
Ernest?

773
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,102
No, Ernest.
But yes, Celestine!

774
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:35,935
No, I'm telling you that it's impossible.

775
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:37,877
And I'm saying that it isn't.

776
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:41,001
But think about it. We can't tell our story,

777
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:42,002
it's terrible.

778
01:13:42,003 --> 01:13:46,011
To start, you found me in the bin and wanted to eat me.

779
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:47,804
That's funny!

780
01:13:47,805 --> 01:13:50,388
No, I don't want to tell this.

781
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:53,163
But we could change some things...

782
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:54,164
Imagine:

783
01:13:54,165 --> 01:13:58,563
you were a little baby, left alone in the trash.

784
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:00,436
Your eyes were not opened yet. Draw this!

785
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:09,639
I was a garbage man, and was sweeping the pavement, 

786
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,114
and I suddenly heard a noise comming from the bin.

787
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,298
Was that me?

788
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:14,299
That was you.

789
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,123
And what did you do next?

790
01:14:16,124 --> 01:14:18,984
Well, a bit like in reality, I lifted you from the trash, 

791
01:14:18,985 --> 01:14:22,784
and put you in my warm jacket pocket.

792
01:14:22,785 --> 01:14:23,785
And then I brought you home.

793
01:14:23,786 --> 01:14:24,786
And then?

794
01:14:24,787 --> 01:14:30,669
Well, after that I took care of you and

795
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:31,670
decided to keep you as my own.

796
01:14:31,671 --> 01:14:32,671
And we started living together.

797
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:36,789
This is how we met.

798
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:41,169
And after that? Are we going to tell other stories?

799
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,175
A lot of them, Celestine.
