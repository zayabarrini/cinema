1
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,541
Madam.

2
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,916
Madam.

3
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,249
Madam.

4
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,582
Your glasses fell off.

5
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,082
Madam, can we swap places?

6
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,957
Can we swap places?

7
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,707
You're sleeping and not looking anyway.

8
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,416
Say thank you.

9
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:26,749
Thank you, madam.

10
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,374
This route through Belarus
is a gift from God.

11
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:17,207
It's a thousand times better
than the one over the sea.

12
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,942
Otherwise I wouldn't have come here.

13
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,650
With children?

14
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,707
Never in my life.

15
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,166
In Harasta we lost everything.

16
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,775
Our home and our store.

17
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,916
We escaped the siege
and went to the camp.

18
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,666
For five years.

19
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,291
Sorry, I didn't understand...

20
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,916
what you said now.

21
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,791
What did you say?

22
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,249
So... lady...
She said...

23
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:51,291
war in Syria is very strong, very bad.

24
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:56,957
Tell her the kids couldn't go to school.
And that you used to teach them.

25
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,082
No school in the camp.

26
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:06,874
I teach my grandson, my granddaughter.

27
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,041
Ah, okay, I understand.

28
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,207
Grandpa, I can't see anything.

29
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,291
Yes, darling, because we are
in the middle of a cloud.

30
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,541
A cloud is water, right?

31
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,874
Of course, where does rain come from?

32
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,166
Grandpa, we're getting close to Sweden.

33
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,457
No, darling, this isn't Sweden.

34
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:32,416
- How do you know?
- Because first we are going to Belarus.

35
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:37,916
From Belarus we go to Poland,
and then to your uncle in Sweden.

36
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,541
Nice stay in Belarus.

37
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,749
Look, look, this is Belarus.

38
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,041
Give me the phone, darling.

39
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,582
Nice stay in Belarus.

40
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,207
- Nice stay in Belarus. It's for you.
- Oh, thank you.

41
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,791
<i>Dear passengers,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

42
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,124
<i>Shortly, we are going to commence
our descent and approach to Minsk airport.</i>

43
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,108
<i>The weather down there is quite good,</i>

44
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,124
<i>but it's partly cloudy and
the temperature is minus two degrees.</i>

45
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,317
<i>And it was my pleasure
to have you all on board</i>

46
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,499
<i>and we wish you a very good day.</i>

47
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,916
<i>- Abu Bashir?</i>
- Yes, my darling.

48
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,400
<i>- Did you write it down?</i>
- Yes.

49
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,374
<i>It should be there by now,
a light-colored minibus.</i>

50
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,791
<i>Don't move, he knows where to find you.</i>

51
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,041
<i>Remember, everything is paid for</i>

52
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,400
<i>and he'll take you to
the best border crossing.</i>

53
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,374
- Ok?
- Ok.

54
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,166
Uncle, did you buy me
that game you promised?

55
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,957
<i>Of course, here it is.</i>

56
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,791
<i>It will be waiting for you
when you get here.</i>

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you, uncle.

58
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,624
<i>You're welcome, my darling.
Where is Bashir?</i>

59
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,916
Bashir! Your brother wants to talk to you.

60
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,942
- Hi.
<i>- How are you?</i>

61
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,874
- Alright.
<i>- You'll be in the European Union soon.</i>

62
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:03,957
<i>- Then a quick drive to Malm√∂.</i>
- Alright.

63
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,832
<i>- Amina?</i>
- Yes?

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,832
<i>- Once you get to the border...</i>
- Yes.

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,082
<i>send me your location
so the driver can pick you up.</i>

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,082
Ok.

67
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,192
Thank you.

68
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,832
- Here it is!
- That's our minibus.

69
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,708
Sir?

70
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,957
- Are you going to the border?
- Yes.

71
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,317
Can I come with you?

72
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,207
- What does she want?
- She wants to come with us.

73
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
But we don't know her.

74
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:38,525
- If there are seats, let her come.
- There are, and why shouldn't she come?

75
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,900
- Yes, madam, okay.
- Okay.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,374
Thank you.

77
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,082
Oh God!

78
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,416
$300 now.

79
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,541
He said he wants $300.

80
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,233
$300!

81
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,525
No dollar, no dollar.

82
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,192
Wesam paid him everything.

83
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,582
Sir, please don't get angry.
I'll give you 300 euros.

84
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,582
It's more than dollars, okay?

85
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,332
- Ilya? What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

86
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,832
- Come on, come on.
- Wait.

87
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,707
Wesam paid him everything,
why is she paying again?

88
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:44,874
Let her give it to him,
we don't want any trouble.

89
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,400
What's wrong with them?

90
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,666
Wait here.

91
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,401
- Have we made it to Sweden yet, Grandpa?
- Not yet, my love.

92
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,416
- Mama, I need to pee.
- We'll find a toilet right away, sweetie.

93
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,067
Me too, but I'm not complaining.

94
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,692
- No coverage.
- No coverage?

95
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,291
Why don't you try?

96
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,416
- What was that?
- What is it?

97
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,817
Is here the state border?

98
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,166
It's the border, out, out.
Come on, come on.

99
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,374
Come on, Ghalia!

100
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,249
Is here the state border?

101
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,108
- There's the border.
- Yes, go, go.

102
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,374
Move it, move it.

103
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,207
Run, run, run!

104
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,983
Go, go. That's the border.

105
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,582
Go, go, go.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,124
Go, go, go, faster. Go!

107
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,499
The bag!

108
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,692
Run!

109
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,541
Fucking run!

110
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,999
Run, I said!

111
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,707
Run!

112
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,249
You have to run now. Run, run!

113
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,916
Come on, Dad.

114
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,374
Run into the forest!

115
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,791
Give me a second.

116
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,749
Take your backpack off.

117
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,999
Mama... I peed my pants.

118
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,472
Don't worry, I'll change them.

119
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,233
Come with me.

120
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,233
Nur, darling, what happened?

121
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,499
Why is your hand bleeding?

122
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,207
Poland | Belarus

123
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,999
We're in Poland.

124
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,916
We're in Europe.

125
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,166
We're in the European Union!
We made it!

126
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,416
She said we are in Europe.

127
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,707
We've reached Europe.

128
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,374
Show me your hand.

129
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,791
- It hurts a lot?
- Yes.

130
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,666
Let me clean it for you.

131
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,416
Enough! Be quiet!

132
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,541
I'm...

133
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,582
I'm cold, I can't help it.

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,541
We know!

135
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,542
But...

136
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,707
I'm really cold.

137
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,707
Good morning.

138
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,707
Good morning.

139
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,082
Good morning.

140
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,150
I bear witness that
there is no deity but God,

141
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,685
and I bear witness that
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.

142
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,624
God is the Greatest.

143
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,983
In the name of God, the Most
Gracious, the Most Merciful.

144
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,400
All praise be to God,
Lord of all worlds.

145
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,166
Guide us along the straight path.

146
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,457
Damned fucking mobile.

147
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,817
Dad.

148
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,582
Let's try from your phone.

149
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,708
The path of those you have blessed,
not those you are displeased with.

150
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,374
God is the Greatest.

151
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,108
Dad, let me try to text Wesam
from your phone.

152
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,999
Glory be to my Lord,
the Most Magnificent.

153
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,457
God is the Greatest.

154
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,874
Glory be to my Lord, the Most High.

155
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,416
God is the Greatest.

156
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,124
I seek forgiveness in God!
What's wrong with you, Bashir?

157
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,442
Let me send him a pin.

158
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,666
Instead of praying with me?

159
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,775
The phone's dead,
Ghalia had it on the plane.

160
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,082
She was playing with it
until the battery died.

161
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,233
- What's wrong with you?
- I just want to send Wesam our location.

162
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,666
Bashir, my darling, put the cigarette out.
Come pray with me.

163
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,207
I don't want to pray.

164
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,858
I won't pray.

165
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,874
I seek forgiveness in God,
I seek forgiveness in God.

166
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,207
God is the Greatest.

167
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,499
Nur! Ghalia! Get up!

168
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,916
It's pouring.

169
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,582
It's ok, sweetheart.

170
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,291
It's okay, it's okay.

171
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,582
Come on, come on.

172
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,457
Come on, my dears, come on.

173
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,567
Bashir, Bashir.

174
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,457
Hold it up with me.

175
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,275
Nur.

176
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,375
Thank you.

177
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,291
Amina.

178
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,416
Thank you.

179
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,499
Mama, look! Nur looks like a girl.

180
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,567
And you look like a grandma.

181
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,207
Nura, lovely Nura.

182
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,916
- I don't want to wear it anymore.
- No, no, no! Nur!

183
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:05,442
Nur, keep it on.
You'll get sick. Enough!

184
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,832
- Nura, lovely Nura.
- Nur, look at me, you're the older one.

185
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,483
- Stop it, Ghalia!
- You'll be sorry.

186
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,666
Nur, that's enough, son.

187
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,999
- Amina.
- Yes?

188
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,791
Give me the powerbank.

189
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,874
Take the powerbank from the bag.

190
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,624
That was the only thing
I asked you to do!

191
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,207
Bashir.

192
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,041
Thank you.

193
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,749
Thank you, madam.

194
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,332
It's wet.
Water.

195
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,166
- Water.
- I have a phone.

196
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,249
What will we do now?

197
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,874
There's a road there.

198
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,042
What?

199
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,416
There's a road there.

200
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,582
What did she say?

201
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,291
She said there's a road there.

202
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,791
Mama, I want to drink.

203
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,041
Sweetheart, we'll drink
when we get to the car, ok?

204
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,567
- So when?
- Soon.

205
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,942
Just stop whining!

206
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,291
Nur, Nur!

207
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,832
In a moment, not long.

208
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,082
You look lovely. Come on.

209
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,416
Open your mouth, there's more.

210
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,374
Good girl! Want some more?

211
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,416
Here, open your mouth.

212
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,041
- Amina!
- Mama!

213
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,025
Help me!

214
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,916
- Amina!
- Bashir!

215
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,416
Dad! Hold him.

216
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,250
Bashir!

217
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,483
It's ok, sweetheart, don't worry.

218
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,874
I've got you.

219
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,874
Nothing happened.

220
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,775
Don't be scared, sweetie.

221
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,291
It'll be fine.

222
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,817
Shhh, it's ok, sweetheart.

223
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,067
Mom, are you ok?

224
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,041
Yes, sweetie, I'm fine.

225
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,082
Slowly, slowly.

226
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,916
I think he is hungry.

227
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,666
There, there, darling.
I've got you now.

228
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,457
Come over here, my darlings.

229
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,275
Let's try.

230
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,499
Mahir!

231
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,082
I don't have milk anymore.

232
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,874
Can I help?

233
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,749
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

234
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,124
Thursday, Friday...

235
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,124
Saturday...

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,291
Saturday...

237
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,666
- Sunday.
- Sunday.

238
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,707
Yes, bravo.

239
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,082
You can speak English!

240
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,374
What's your name?

241
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,832
Kylian Mbapp√©.

242
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,124
I don't think so.

243
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,874
My name is Leila.
What's your name?

244
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,167
Nur.

245
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,791
Say: My name is Nur.

00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,749
My name is Nur.

247
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,582
Bravo. Where are you from?

248
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,541
Harasta, Syria.

249
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:42,499
- Say: I'm from Harasta.
- I'm from Harasta.

250
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:46,666
Yes, I'd like to stay in Europe.

251
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:49,707
I'd like to stay in Europe.

252
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,207
Hello, sir.

253
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,458
Sir?

254
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,750
Sir?

255
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,542
Water?

256
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,124
Can you spare me some water, please?

257
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,874
Water.

258
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,083
Water?

259
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:39,917
Okay.

260
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,442
Thank you very much.

261
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,541
- No, keep it.
- Thank you.

262
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,124
Keep it.

263
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,692
Okay.

264
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,916
Do you have some food?

265
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,542
Food?

266
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,041
Thank you.

267
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,817
Want them?

268
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,124
Thank you.

269
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,291
Try over there.

270
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,541
Try there, yeah.

271
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,624
Okay, thank you so much.

272
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,499
Thank you, thank you, sir.

273
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,707
Stop!

274
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,666
Stop!

275
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,457
Wait!

276
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,957
Don't shout! Be quiet!

277
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,957
Leave her alone!

278
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,457
Leave some.

279
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,067
For the kids.
Leave some for the kids.

280
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,858
- Stop, stop.
- The soldiers will come.

281
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,457
What soldiers?

282
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,791
Let's go, let's go!

283
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,957
Please, please, help.

284
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:37,999
Help, help, help.

285
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,483
Stop, Border Guard!

286
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,791
- Mom, what's going on?
- Grab the old one!

287
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,624
Please, please, I...

288
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:45,733
Please.

289
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,082
Backpack!

290
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,983
Stand there!

291
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,249
Hands.

292
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,541
Dad! Dad!
Bashir!

293
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,916
Don't do anything!

294
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:57,650
- No, no, no, I'm not doing anything.
- Are you Polish?

295
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,749
I'm from Afghanistan.

296
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,150
- They're clean.
- Ok.

297
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,832
Easy. Stand up.

298
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,791
Stand up. Easy.

299
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,275
- Reporting a group, zero zero two one.
- It's ok.

300
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,775
Forest road 4.

301
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,916
One mile east of base,
we need transport.

302
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,041
<i>Okay.</i>

303
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,624
<i>We'll pick up some tourists
and come to you.</i>

304
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,125
Oh, no!

305
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,374
Very nice these guys.

306
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,666
Thank you.

307
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,166
You're welcome.

308
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,166
<i>- We can see you.</i>
- Over here.

309
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,457
<i>We're approaching.</i>

310
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,332
Okay, let's go.

311
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,874
Get them loaded up.

312
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,900
Go on, get on the truck.

313
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,525
To Sweden, to Sweden?

314
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,291
Yes, that car goes to Germany.

315
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,832
Then Sweden.

316
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,733
You're a lucky man!

317
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,124
Don't worry, it's alright.

318
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,999
Get on the truck.

319
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,374
Get on, Bashir. Take the kids.

320
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,207
He said they'll take us to Sweden.

321
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,624
Mama, what are they going to do with us?

322
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,874
Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm with you.

323
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,567
Everything is going to be alright.

324
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:00,374
Come sit next to me, darling.

325
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,957
Nur.

326
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,374
Nur.

327
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,999
Hi, what's up?

328
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,542
Working.

329
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,999
What the fuck do I mean?

330
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,291
I'm escorting some darkies, aren't I?

331
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,791
And you?

332
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,541
They stink so bad, it's unbearable.

333
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,750
Yeah.

334
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,041
Two, three hours.
We're heading back to base.

335
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,733
Tonight? Sure, we can meet.

336
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,582
Does anyone have a powerbank?

337
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,207
Battery?

338
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,374
Powerbank?

339
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,249
- Okay.
- Telephone?

340
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
Quick.

341
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,750
Yeah.

342
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,332
Nothing really.

343
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,874
For real, man...

344
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,041
It's alright. What can I tell you?

345
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,499
Please, no Belarus! Please!

346
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,999
Please, no Belarus!

347
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,249
No Belarus.

348
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,957
Hey, get out, get out.

349
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,999
Go, go, now.

350
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,832
Move it!

351
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,625
Come on.

352
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,625
Let's go.

353
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,999
Go, go, go.

354
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,674
Turn the lights off
or the Belarusians will see us.

355
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,332
Get him across right away.

356
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,832
Fucking move it.

357
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,374
Go, go, go.

358
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,775
Push him down.

359
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,692
I escaped from Afghanistan.

360
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:45,332
My brother worked with
the Polish army in Kabul.

361
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:49,207
- I want asylum in Poland.
- Go. Go!

362
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,749
Go, go, go.

363
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,416
Grab that phone off her.

364
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,692
Go, go, go.

365
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,150
- Grab that phone off her.
- No!

366
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,233
You're not allowed to do this.

367
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:05,207
- It's illegal. We're in Europe!
- Mister, she's a lady, mister!

368
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,249
We'll report you!

369
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,666
The damned dog...

370
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,832
Someone left a thermos.

371
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,541
It's not deep.

372
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,583
Whose is this?

373
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,342
Hey!

374
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:33,832
Catch!

375
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,957
Cheers.

376
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,957
Karim! What happened?

377
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,916
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Why?

378
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:57,233
- Are you not human?
- Have you never eaten glass before?

379
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,192
If you came to our town,
we'd invite you in.

380
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,041
- You would be our guest.
- What?

381
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,374
I don't understand.

382
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,499
We would welcome you into our homes.

383
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,042
Why?

384
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,041
Why are you doing this to us?

385
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,207
We need your help!

386
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,666
Ahmad Dia!

387
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,541
- Ali!
- Dad!

388
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,775
- Ali!
- Dad!

389
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,541
- Ali!
- Dad!

390
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,082
Excuse me, sir.

391
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,082
We need water.

392
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,082
Can you give us some water, please?

393
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:04,541
The children need to drink.

394
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,358
- Water.
- Water.

395
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,291
- Yes, please.
- Give me money.

396
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,582
50 euros.

397
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,249
50 euros?

398
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,874
Yes, yes.
Yeah.

399
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,249
Give it to me.

400
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,499
Give it back, please.

401
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:48,400
No!

402
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,300
No!

403
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
No!

404
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,733
No!

405
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,733
- Dad! Where are you going?
- Why, why, why, mister?

406
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,082
Why, mister? Why? Why?

407
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,525
Dad!

408
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,249
Dad!

409
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,707
Grandpa! Grandpa!

410
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,041
Nur!

411
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,041
Enough, enough!

412
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:19,541
- Enough, enough!
- Stop, stop, please.

413
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,499
God!

414
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,249
God!

415
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,041
May God punish them.

416
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,442
Wait, Bashir.

417
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,416
- Why?
- Let me check the mobile isn't broken.

418
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,707
I hope it isn't.

419
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,916
Thank God it's ok.

420
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,541
- Listen.
- Yes?

421
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,882
There is some battery left.

422
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,541
Text your brother,
tell him they sent us back to Belarus.

423
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,749
- Just hide it somewhere.
- Ok.

424
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,567
Are you hurt, my dear?

425
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,942
No, and you, Grandpa?

426
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,374
I'm fine.

427
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,775
There's blood on your face.

428
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,582
Are you ok?

429
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,916
Yes, yes, I am ok.

430
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,791
I'm fine, I'll just go and sit there.

431
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,207
Let the kids drink.

432
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,249
Do you want some water, son?

433
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,457
Nur?

434
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,249
No, I'm fine.

435
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,207
Ghalia.

436
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:24,874
My sweetheart.

437
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,874
There's no signal here,
don't waste your battery.

438
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,249
And hide your mobile.

439
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,791
You'll need it later.
Look what they did to mine.

440
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,812
Look what those motherfuckers did.

441
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:53,692
Listen. The Belarusians
will send us back to Poland.

442
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,624
They already sent me there
five, six times.

443
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,249
And every time, the Poles catch me
and send me back here.

444
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,457
The motherfuckers.

445
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,108
Beating and kicking us.

446
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,900
Let's stick together, but in case
we get separated, take this number.

447
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,582
- Ok.
- Take it quickly.

448
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,666
- Faster.
- Ok, ok.

449
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,207
When you reach Poland,

450
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,457
send a text to this number.

451
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,999
They'll get you whatever you need.
They're good people.

452
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,541
They're good Poles.

453
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:19,791
Go! Go!

454
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,332
Nabil! Nabil!

455
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,166
Nabil! Where are you?

456
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,999
- Nabil! Nabil!
- Amina! Amina!

457
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Dad!

458
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:30,916
Amina!

459
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,249
- Don't shoot!
- Come on, quick.

460
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,042
Bashir!

461
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,707
Move it, move it!
Go, go, go.

462
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,317
Dad! Let's go!

463
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,442
Dad, let's go!

464
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,582
Faster!

465
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,874
Don't stop!

466
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,957
Come on, faster!

467
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,999
Come on!

468
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,582
Come on!

469
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,624
Come on!

470
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,124
Bashir!

471
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,124
You have to show professionalism.

472
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,067
Because if you give them an apple,
they'll just say it was poisoned,

473
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,525
and then what?

474
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,525
This isn't propaganda,
it's a real threat!

475
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,756
One mistake, and in six months we'll have
an attack on the Warsaw subway.

476
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:40,207
Did you hear what Minister Kami≈Ñski
and Minister WƒÖsik said?

477
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:45,541
They were found with terrorist,
pedophile and zoophile materials!

478
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,082
Have you seen the phones they have?

479
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,650
- You couldn't afford...
- What should I do?

480
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,874
- ...half of what they have.
- Pick it up.

481
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,874
And I don't want to hear about their kids!

482
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,233
[Got pains. Come here. I have to go to hospital.]
They hire or buy children,

483
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,707
and then blow smoke in
their eyes to make them cry.

484
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,916
I saw the footage myself.

485
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,541
We're saving them.

486
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,707
You have children of your own.

487
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,457
What father would take
his child down this road?

488
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:17,957
Well?

489
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,582
They want to play on our Polish compassion,

490
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,374
while Lukashenko rubs his hands.

491
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:27,582
Remember, this is classic hybrid warfare.

492
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,999
They aren't people, they are weapons
of Putin and Lukashenko.

493
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,582
They aren't people...

494
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,082
they are live bullets!

495
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,874
You've all had first-aid training
at some point.

496
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,124
Now listen up.

497
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,374
No one is to be found dead
on your watch, ok?

498
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,166
There are to be no dead bodies
lying around.

499
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,582
If you see one, it shouldn't be there,
is that clear?

500
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,541
They say you don't get psychological care,
but that's not true.

501
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,916
This officer here...

502
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,249
- Daria Schitz-Lis.
- Diarrhea Shitless.

503
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,358
Schitz-Lis.

504
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,483
Daria Schitz-Lis.

505
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,541
She's a trained psychologist

506
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,999
whom you can make an appointment to see...

507
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,207
in the usual way,

508
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,332
by the hour, at our expense.

509
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,374
All right, joking aside,

510
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,957
I was sent here to build up your morale,

511
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,916
but I don't care about that.

512
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,817
If you're not ready to wear the uniform,

513
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,416
you now have the chance
to consider it all

514
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:38,499
and leave the room if you want.

515
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,249
Anyone else?

516
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,525
<i>It's ok, I just forgot to drink water
so I probably had colic.</i>

517
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,582
<i>But my movements feel normal.</i>

518
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:59,999
Ok, so drink plenty of water,
and lie down. Ok?

519
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,999
<i>- Don't worry, I'll be at home.</i>
- Ok, I love you.

520
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,999
Bye.

521
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,999
Miss Indecisive?

522
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,957
- No, no, I just had to...
- Sit down.

523
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,332
Learn the grace of God.

524
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:30,832
There you go, a beautiful femur.

525
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,874
What a pretty face.

526
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,874
After daddy.

527
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,416
Come on, show yourself.

528
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,832
Look...

529
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,666
the foot is moving.

530
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,192
- What's going on?
- Why isn't there any sound?

531
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,874
They should pay me extra for working
with equipment like this. It's ok now.

532
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,916
Don't worry, it's fine.

533
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,207
Come on, baby girl.

534
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,291
A girl?

535
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,124
One hundred percent woman, sir.

536
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,666
Daddy's little girl.

537
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,832
Klara?

538
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,582
Or Zosia.

539
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,624
Lewandowski named his daughter Klara.

540
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:27,916
All right.

541
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,624
And when's the baby due?

542
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,082
Well...

543
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:38,749
- It looks like around the end of January.
- Ok.

544
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,957
And more precisely?

545
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,916
Medicine isn't an exact science.

546
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:49,874
A full-term pregnancy runs for 37 weeks.

547
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,442
- That's all I can say.
- Yes, but in your experience...

548
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,967
Geez, Jan, I'm not an incubator
that you can just program.

549
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,291
Get the renovation done
before Christmas, ok?

550
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,817
After you.

551
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:03,416
You were meant to move out
of our place by Christmas.

552
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,582
But now you'll still be with us at Easter.

553
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,124
It would be even sooner
if you helped with the floor panels, Dad.

554
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,358
Flooring isn't really my thing.
Plumbing, yes.

555
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:15,291
Well, if you helped us with the pipes,
we'd move in quicker.

556
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,082
Janek, look.

557
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,124
Someone's fucking been here.

558
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,332
Maybe it's mine.

559
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,541
Right then.

560
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,166
Ok.

561
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:41,166
No, look, someone's fucking been here.

562
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:53,900
Are you alright?

563
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,166
Are you alright?

564
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,015
Does this state of emergency
allow you to use firearms?

565
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,067
In self-defense.

566
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,249
Self-defense! But you have clearance,
I take it?

567
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,624
They count every fucking bullet we fire.

568
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,332
Come on.

569
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,067
Fuck, our moronic boss
really screwed up the rotas.

570
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,317
And now I've got the day shift
with some old fossil.

571
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:02,999
And one more bottle, please.

572
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,832
Did you know the chief's coming to see us?

573
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,541
- Yeah, I heard.
- Could I also have...?

574
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,192
Our friend wants to buy condoms
but is too afraid to ask.

575
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,416
Fuck off!

576
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,317
Emel cigarettes, please.

577
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:17,025
Red or blue?

578
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,817
- Slims! The slimmest ones.
- Shut your mouth.

579
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,275
- Fuck off.
- Fuck off yourself.

580
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:24,275
Gentlemen, maybe you noticed
there's a pregnant woman standing here?

581
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:28,233
I know it doesn't matter to you,
but you should let this lady go first.

582
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,416
How do you know
what matters to us, huh?

583
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,291
But I've already entered these items.

584
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,457
Just cancel them.

585
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:39,624
Apparently, you push pregnant women
over the wires!

586
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,608
My husband works in the Border Guard
and he certainly doesn't do that.

587
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,233
You have no idea about anything!

588
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:49,791
They are Lukashenko's weapons. If we let
them in now, thousands more will follow.

589
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,082
I'll take it.

590
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,650
I understand it's difficult for you,
and I do sympathize.

591
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,233
I'm very proud of my husband.

592
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,416
If you're so smart, you take them in.

593
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,082
A bag, please.

594
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:13,791
I'm here, I'm here.

595
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,457
Quick, so we can still
give you a ride home...

596
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,374
What's wrong, Ka≈õka?

597
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,124
Hormones.

598
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,250
It's ok.

599
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:42,832
Yesterday, I even cried at
a commercial for soap powder.

600
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:44,542
Ok?

601
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:46,708
Come on.

602
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,624
- Get up.
- Thanks.

603
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:54,999
Do you know her?

604
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,333
Quiet!

605
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,957
Careful over the branch.

606
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,650
Is this dog bite?

607
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,124
- Yes, yes. Dog.
- Ok.

608
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
How long?

609
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,291
Many days, many days ago.

610
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,942
Dangerous, doctor?

611
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:00,166
It looks like a
bacterial infection in here.

612
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:03,775
Dangerous?

613
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,400
It could be dangerous, yes.

614
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,249
My God.

615
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:14,624
You need to change
the compress every day, ok?

616
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,025
- Every day.
- I'll give you some.

617
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,125
My God.

618
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,374
Alright.

619
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,041
Thank you.

620
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,192
My wife came back to her parents.

621
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:07,582
But I couldn't take any chances.

622
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,499
I have to have asylum.

623
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,733
- Here, and sign.
- I give you this, please.

624
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,567
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Please, please, you take.

625
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:18,874
Please, please.

626
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,733
It will be good for me
when you take this.

627
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,150
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you for your help.

628
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,666
How are you feeling?
Is the baby okay?

629
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,416
I'll bring you some soup.

630
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:30,999
And paperwork.

631
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,666
Marta, give me some shoes.

632
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,791
- Smaller ones.
- There aren't any others, just these.

633
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,582
No others?

634
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,208
Okay.

635
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,207
Take them.

636
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,541
- What did she say to me?
- Huh?

637
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:46,916
What did she say?

638
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,067
Put on.

639
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:49,374
She said put them on.

640
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,858
Then she won't have shoes for herself.
I won't take them.

641
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,916
You don't have.

642
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,817
No, no... I'm close to my house

643
00:49:57,917 --> 00:50:00,150
and there is a lot of shoes.

644
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,582
She said she lives nearby.
It's ok, take them.

645
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,749
Come on.

646
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,042
Put on.

647
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:09,900
Thank you.

648
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes.

649
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:13,749
Ghalia...

650
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,582
Do you want chocolate?

651
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,707
You want some, Bashir?

652
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,291
Try to eat, ok?

653
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,957
Tell them, Bashir.

654
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,499
ISIS caught him and flogged him.

655
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,733
Just because he was smoking.

656
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,957
Before sunset, during the month of Ramadan.

657
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:54,733
I swear to God, look.

658
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,067
Show them what they did to you.

659
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,275
- Enough, Amina.
- Please, Bashir.

660
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,582
Enough!

661
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,374
Don't bring up this topic again.

662
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:07,067
Why should I show them?

663
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,525
They've been watching our stories
for the past ten years.

664
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,082
Nobody did anything.

665
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,832
Don't bring up this topic again.

666
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:24,374
That's enough, man, stop recording.

667
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,832
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm still human.

668
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,707
They made me an animal here.

669
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,541
My only sin

670
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,749
is to have the world's worst passport.

671
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:40,374
ISIS came.

672
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,749
A bad neighbor reported me for

673
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,791
allegedly living with another man.

674
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,916
They push people off roofs

675
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,666
or stone them for that.

676
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:59,082
My wife and I fled to the mountains.

677
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,082
My wife came back to her parents.

678
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,332
But I couldn't take any chances.

679
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,041
I have to have asylum.

680
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,999
I can't go back there.

681
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:15,957
They will kill me.

682
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,416
The Belarusians beat us
and shoot at us.

683
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,541
Go Poland, go Poland.

684
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:25,082
And you have to be careful
with the Poles near the barbed wire.

685
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,749
They treat us like footballs.

686
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,874
We just want to have
a normal life... to live.

687
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:37,041
I could stay all by myself in Kabul

688
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:39,624
and wait for the Talibans.

689
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:42,041
Or I could run away.

690
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,499
I'd like to stay in Poland.

691
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:50,166
You know, my brother worked
with you Polish people

692
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,624
and praised you so much.

693
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,499
I also want to file a complaint
against border guards.

694
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,999
They don't respect our human rights.

695
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:07,457
Have you seen any animals in the woods?

696
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:15,749
<i>Have you seen any animals in the forest?</i>

697
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:17,499
Yes, I have.

698
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:23,541
Can you remember
which animals you've seen?

699
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,874
<i>Can you remember
which animals you've seen?</i>

700
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:28,417
Yes.

701
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:33,457
Gazelle, antelope, and giraffe.

702
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,874
<i>Gazelle, antelope, and giraffe.</i>

703
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,499
Are you sure you saw a giraffe?

704
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,749
Giraffe? Are you sure you saw a giraffe?

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,166
Yes, I saw a gira...

706
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,041
Yes, I saw a giraffe, with my own eyes.

707
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:01,166
<i>What's your giraffe with my own eyes?</i>

708
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,041
I saw a giraffe with my own eyes.

709
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,082
<i>I saw it through the eyes of my giraffe.</i>

710
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,900
Ok, everybody, listen to me
for a moment, ok?

711
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,457
Come closer, please.
We want to tell you something important.

712
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,749
I'm now going to tell you
what your current situation is.

713
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,025
We want to tell you about
your situation in Poland.

714
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,483
Poland is the first EU country
you have arrived in.

715
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:28,749
You have signed powers of attorney
and asylum applications.

716
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,483
Now our attorney will support you.

717
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,608
Maybe the applications
will be accepted, maybe not,

718
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,926
but until they are reviewed,
you can't leave Poland.

719
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:55,791
And you'll have to stay in
prison-like refugee centers.

720
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,650
The Polish government
doesn't want you here.

721
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,374
It's telling the Polish people
that you are evil.

722
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:12,416
The border guards have orders to throw you
over the wires back into Belarus.

723
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,541
No, no, Belarus.

724
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,983
The dictator of Belarus cheated you.
He invited you on purpose,

725
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:27,124
to use you as a weapon
against the European Union.

726
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:34,650
And now nobody wants
to take responsibility for you here,

727
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,291
neither Belarus nor the EU.

728
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,858
If you apply for asylum,
we'll bring the Border Guard here.

729
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,249
And... even though it's against the law,
they can use pushbacks.

730
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,582
I can't tell you what to decide,
as there are no guarantees.

731
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,942
If you decide to apply
for asylum in Poland,

732
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,775
we'll be forced to call
the Border Guard.

733
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:12,983
But if you don't want to
apply for asylum, then...

734
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:17,166
We'll patch you up and leave you here,
as there's nothing more we can do for you.

735
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:20,832
Because it would be dangerous for us, too.

736
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,983
Please, please.

737
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,374
We want asylum here in Poland.

738
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:29,233
She has a massive hemorrhage
from the genital tract.

739
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,624
- Let's see the ultrasound, okay?
- Okay.

740
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,332
Sara, stay with me.

741
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,041
Stay with me, stay.

742
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:37,832
Relax, relax.

743
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,582
Take it easy.

744
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,749
We're with you, sweetheart, I'm here.

745
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,082
My darling, shhh.

746
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:51,624
The kids are here,
we're all praying for you.

747
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,249
Not all of the placenta is here.

748
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,541
Ok.

749
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,957
Stay with her,
I'll call the ambulance.

750
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,317
- Sorry.
- Yeah, keep calm, ok?

751
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,067
Doctor. Hospital.

752
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,416
She will go to the hospital.
The doctor is calling the ambulance.

753
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:07,582
What is it?

754
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,374
She has a massive hemorrhage
from the genital tract.

755
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:14,624
Possible placenta detachment,
we need to call an ambulance.

756
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:16,775
Ok.

757
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:17,358
Ok.

758
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:19,791
- Guys...
- Everyone, one second, please.

759
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,275
This woman has to go to hospital.

760
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,775
Ambulances are always accompanied
by the Border Guard.

761
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,541
Those who don't want to apply for asylum

762
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:29,207
have some time now to get
as far away as possible.

763
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:35,416
Those who don't want to
apply for asylum in Poland

764
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:40,291
must take their things
and leave right now.

765
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,332
Hello, this is Dr. Pawe≈Ç Kwieci≈Ñski.
I have a patient here with...

766
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:51,608
We want to go to Sweden.
We don't want to stay here.

767
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,416
We don't want to go back to Belarus.

768
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,582
Take the first turn after Brz√≥zki village,
towards the border.

769
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:03,957
What do you mean, you don't go to illegals?
Can you hear yourself?

770
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:10,332
Sir, I have examined the patient,
and her condition is unstable.

771
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,957
She needs to be taken to hospital.
Do you understand?

772
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:21,749
Sir, I'm a doctor.
If you don't come, she will die.

773
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,082
Ok, with the Border Guard...

774
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,332
Where? I can't walk.

775
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,207
My leg is very painful.

776
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:40,291
Excuse me, my wife is
seven months pregnant.

777
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,624
Her belly hurts.

778
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,707
She fell. The Belarusians beat her.

779
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,749
Can you check if she's ok?

780
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,124
Do you speak English? Yeah?
Can you translate? Ok, thanks.

781
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:52,332
I want to stay in Poland, you know?

782
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,457
Ok, so we have to wait and we are
waiting with you and your family now.

783
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,832
Miko≈Çaj...

784
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,067
I have no one.

785
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,416
The ultrasound?

786
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:02,416
- Belarus.
- Belarus, yeah.

787
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:06,332
What happened there?
Did you have a hit?

788
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,999
- She fell over.
- Ok.

789
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Hello?

790
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,249
Hi, honey.

791
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,166
Hey.

792
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:29,416
I'm still at work.

793
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:33,082
With mom?

794
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,249
Well...

795
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,916
just a few more days.

796
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,874
There's the head.

797
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:52,416
And the heart.

798
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:54,416
Beating.

799
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:11,249
- My wife! My wife!
- Hey, it's his wife.

800
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,124
Female, 27 years old,

801
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,025
a massive hemorrhage
from the genital tract.

802
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,166
I'll get the car, I'll be right back.

803
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,483
- That's his wife! Going to hospital!
- Fucking shut up.

804
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,457
What the fuck are you guys doing?!

805
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,499
Careful, there are kids here.

806
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,791
Ghalia!

807
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,525
Nur!

808
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,541
Belarus? Belarus?

809
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:49,124
- Ghalia!
- I peed my pants.

810
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,499
I peed my pants.

811
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,291
- Nur! Ghalia!
- Mom, Ghalia peed her pants.

812
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,499
Please be careful.

813
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,666
What's wrong with you?

814
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,874
Couldn't you say you wanted to pee?

815
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:05,150
Where am I going to get you
clean clothes from?

816
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,041
They've signed the papers
for asylum in Poland.

817
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,041
Ka≈õka?

818
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,499
Fuck!

819
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,332
Can you all shut the fuck up?

820
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Do you have to yell like that
in front of kids?

821
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,332
They don't understand you at all!

822
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,025
Everyone onto the truck. Now!

823
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:27,207
I want asylum in Poland.

824
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:28,749
Go inside!

825
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,025
Please step back!

826
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,483
- What are you going to do with them?
- Stand back, please!

827
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:34,249
They signed the asylum papers.

828
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:38,207
You can't use pushback against them,
do you understand? There are procedures.

829
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,233
I know the procedures, they're none
of your business. Step aside, please.

830
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,650
All we need is the address
of the facility you're going to.

831
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,525
We'll take them to the
nearest Border Guard station.

832
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,233
- Please step aside.
- What's the address?

833
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:51,275
- I'm not talking to you, step aside.
- I am the attorney for these people.

834
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,108
You have to talk to me,
I am their attorney.

835
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,900
Please don't obstruct our work,
or I'll be forced to resort to force.

836
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,666
- Everything is being recorded.
- Please step aside.

837
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,650
- Turn off the camera.
- Please stand back.

838
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,067
- I beg you.
- I know who she is.

839
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:02,883
Address.

840
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,733
I'm under no obligation to provide that.
You can check it yourselves.

841
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:06,233
- The address.
- The nearest Border Guard station.

842
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,817
- The address.
- The nearest Border Guard station.

843
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:09,457
End of discussion.

844
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:38,917
Marta!

845
01:02:57,917 --> 01:02:59,582
Damn, stop the car.

846
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:00,708
The exclusion zone!

847
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,275
Stop! Can't you see
we can't go any further?

848
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,999
Fuck!

849
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:11,166
[AREA UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY]

850
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,749
Hello, hello, are you there?

851
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:13,999
Dinner's ready.

852
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,416
We've got a load of
fucking tourists to deliver.

853
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,041
Get the parcel locker ready, ok?

854
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,499
- Over.
- Ok, standing by.

855
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,666
Now focus, this turn is easy to miss.

856
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:25,650
- I fucking know where to go.
- Just drive.

857
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,457
Why are you so uptight?
Is your wife giving you a hard time?

858
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,858
- What's so funny?
- All right, all right.

859
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:34,900
Do you know how much guys like us
are getting online right now?

860
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,832
One has already brought me
three dinners on duty.

861
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,457
She was a little fat,
but she had great boobs.

862
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:46,166
Make the most of it while you can.

863
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,332
Now.

864
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,124
- I know!
- I didn't know if you did.

865
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,499
Of course I fucking know.

866
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,916
The shit we have to do!

867
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,041
There they are.

868
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,499
You just get pissed off all the time.

869
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,666
Stop!

870
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:23,832
- Ok, ok.
- Stop.

871
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,791
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, go, go.

872
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,082
- Move.
- Move it, move it.

873
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,025
- Move it.
- Faster.

874
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,624
Get the fuck up!

875
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,124
- Faster, faster.
- Come on, fucking grab him.

876
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,749
Come on, move him along.

877
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,707
Go, go, go.

878
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,416
Fucking tell him.
Faster, grab him.

879
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,957
Watch out for those kids.

880
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:45,999
Go, go, go.

881
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,082
Run, run, run.
Take the brats.

882
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,624
Now, go.

883
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,692
Go, go, go.

884
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:53,832
Off you go.

885
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:01,916
Auntie, wait!

886
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:05,708
Nur!

887
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,041
Quick!

888
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:12,917
Stop!

889
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,458
Stop!

890
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:23,582
Shut that kid up over there.

891
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:29,207
- To Sweden.
- Wait, wait, wait!

892
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,874
Come on, my dear!

893
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:37,874
Faster, move it!

894
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,749
Ok, grab her.

895
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,900
Nur! Where is Nur?

896
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,374
My son is on the other side.

897
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,374
I beg you, my son is on the other side.

898
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,249
My son is on the other side. Nur!

899
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,608
Back the fucking truck up!

900
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,775
- Back it up!
- Fucking back it up!

901
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:06,541
- My son is on the other side.
- Nur, my son! Where are you?

902
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,582
- My little boy!
- Nur!

903
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,567
Quiet!

904
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,332
One - two - three!

905
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,750
Quiet!

906
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:32,916
Quiet!

907
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:35,025
Quiet!

908
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,916
Nur! I'm here!

909
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:42,874
<i>Pull back or we'll open fire!</i>

910
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,999
<i>Fucking Poles!
We'll start shooting!</i>

911
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:49,374
Come on, let's go.

912
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:55,166
Get the fuck away, Poles!
Shoot them!

913
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,166
It's over there!

914
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,249
And this one?

915
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,999
Some jerk from the
Territorial Defense Force...

916
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,499
Come on! You want it
to blow up in your face?

917
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:34,817
So your father-in-law doesn't know
you're desecrating his sacred spring...?

918
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,457
My father-in-law and I are pals.

919
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,916
And him?

920
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,275
He's a Russkie.

921
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,916
- Is he?
- Let me see.

922
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:49,832
He's short. You want to have
dwarf kids with ginger hair?

923
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,499
Here, might as well throw the phone
out of the window.

924
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,416
Oh, what are you guys up to?

925
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:58,917
Nothing.

926
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,916
We had an arm wrestle... and he lost!

927
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,275
Screw you.

928
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:08,457
- You better get me a beer.
- Let's have a rematch.

929
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:15,916
- ...with a girl and she was pregnant.
- Now they are all pregnant.

930
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,916
Excuse me, excuse me.

931
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,108
Guys, over here.

932
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,124
The match of the night!

933
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,666
Pour it.

934
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:32,457
Don't you fucking dare lose.

935
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:34,833
Ready?

936
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,791
Three, two, one, go!

937
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:40,442
Go, go!

938
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,999
- Janek, Janek, Janek!
- Ola, Ola, Ola!

939
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,041
Jan?

940
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,291
Hey.

941
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:35,166
What is going on?

942
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:38,207
Hey.

943
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,457
What is going on?

944
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,625
Nothing.

945
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:45,832
You never drink like that.

946
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,707
Everyone drinks nowadays.

947
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,999
The female guards too? Ola?

948
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,374
- Ka≈õka, go to sleep.
- Then tell me why.

949
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,082
Believe me, you wouldn't want to know.

950
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,541
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

951
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,416
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:27,291
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

953
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,541
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,832
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:31,832
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,457
<i>Nur! My son!</i>

957
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:36,457
Zero zero fifty-four.

958
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,166
You know how I recognized you?

959
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:42,207
By the patch on the jacket,
I ironed it on myself.

960
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:47,999
Here.

961
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:51,999
Here.

962
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,166
What the fuck do you think
we're doing out there, huh?

963
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,082
Knitting?

964
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,249
Jan, you don't have to do this.

965
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,082
After all, Wojtek earns
five grand at the supermarket.

966
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,707
It's my duty.

967
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,207
I'm sorry.

968
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,291
Come on.

969
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,832
Come to me.

970
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,499
Maybe Laura?

971
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,999
Lewandowski's second daughter
is called Laura.

972
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:29,916
Ok.

973
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,624
<i>Hey, honey, what's up?</i>

974
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,457
Ba≈õka, look!

975
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,666
<i>I see, a moose, a real moose.</i>

976
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,275
I've never seen a live one before.

977
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,541
<i>And you've been living here for six months!</i>

978
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:27,791
<i>Ok, don't worry. I was the same
when we moved here in the '90s.</i>

979
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,374
Sorry, Ba≈õka, it's the police.
I have to go.

980
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,374
- Good morning, I just...
- ID, please.

981
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,275
- But I live nearby, I'm going to Rysi√≥wka...
- ID.

982
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:47,832
<i>...what's going on in the exclusion zone.</i>

983
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:50,233
<i>Dramatic news has reached us...</i>

984
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:51,499
I'm going to the pharmacy!

01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:58,999
<i>the crisis needs a systemic solution.</i>

987
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:03,416
<i>We need several ambulances...</i>

988
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,400
- Please turn around.
- What's going on?

989
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,207
I told you to turn around.

990
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:10,624
Shouldn't you identify yourself first?
Please show your ID...

991
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,291
You have a fine of 200 zlotys.

992
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,525
Sign it, please.

993
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,233
<i>A few days ago, three adults
were found near the border,</i>

994
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,832
<i>accompanied by children,
wandering about the forests...</i>

995
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,541
What a bitch!

996
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,483
<i>They came to share their know-how
and skills with those...</i>

997
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,775
<i>in the greatest need of help.</i>

998
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,108
<i>It's just one kilometer
from the exclusion zone.</i>

999
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,775
<i>Ten minutes on foot.</i>

1000
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,499
<i>We know these people
are suffering and dying.</i>

1001
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:06,207
Fiona, Lapi, I'm back!

1002
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,832
Yes, come here!

1003
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:15,966
<i>First, Anka got upset that I didn't clean
the air conditioning in the car.</i>

1004
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,207
And you had said you would?

1005
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,624
<i>Yeah but...
is it really so important now?</i>

1006
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:24,916
<i>It's autumn,
and we don't use it now anyway!</i>

1007
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,791
<i>Never mind.</i>

1008
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:29,332
<i>Something made me turn on the TV and...</i>

1009
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:31,791
<i>fuck me!</i>

1010
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,457
<i>Have you heard?</i>

1011
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:39,374
I don't watch TV, I only use
the internet for running sessions.

1012
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,817
I only know what I need to know.
[Mom]

1013
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:46,624
<i>What you need to know is that our state
has taken patronage of a Nazi rally.</i>

1014
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,832
<i>You understand?
A fucking fascist march in the capital,</i>

1015
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,707
<i>in Warsaw,</i>

1016
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,832
<i>under the patronage
of the fucking government!</i>

1017
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:57,041
Providing therapy for the nation
is beyond me.

1018
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,983
We shouldn't address issues
beyond our control.

1019
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:03,217
<i>- For fuck's sake!</i>
- Let's talk about your problems.

1020
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,666
<i>That's just it, they are my problems.</i>

1021
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:08,791
<i>We have racist fuckers
in the government.</i>

1022
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:12,374
<i>I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think.</i>

1023
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,666
<i>My libido is below zero.</i>

1024
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:15,858
<i>Ask Anka.</i>

1025
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:19,457
- Bogdan.
<i>- I'm fucking sick of it all.</i>

1026
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,525
<i>When I see that crooked
little shit's mouth,</i>

1027
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,874
<i>a guy who can't even put words
together in any human language.</i>

1028
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,692
<i>Where the fuck do they get them from?</i>

1029
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,541
<i>Do they breed them?</i>

1030
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,041
- Bogdan!
<i>- Fuck me! What?</i>

1031
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:38,249
What did you take?

1032
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,625
Bogdan?

1033
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:48,999
<i>Braxen... one pill.</i>

1034
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:52,499
It's a breach of abstinence,
and you know the consequences.

1035
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:05,874
If you have any benzodiazepines
at home, get rid of them immediately.

1036
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,957
I'm suspending you from the group
until we've worked through what happened.

1037
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:14,457
We have to finish now.
4pm tomorrow, is that ok for you?

1038
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:21,791
Fuck!

1039
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,124
Hi, Mom!

1040
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:34,832
I was just about to call...

1041
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:38,332
I couldn't say that because
I have a patient at six...

1042
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:40,608
Lapi, Fiona...

1043
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:43,166
Nothing's going on, don't worry.

1044
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,969
You remember about that
medical examination tomorrow?

1045
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,999
No, I can't call back later.
I want to go to bed early.

1046
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,041
I'll call you tomorrow night.

1047
01:17:57,292 --> 01:17:59,457
Okay, bye.

1048
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:01,458
Sleep well.

1049
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:03,625
Help!

1050
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,707
Lapi, Fiona...

1051
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,166
Back inside.

1052
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:28,958
Help!

1053
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,666
Hello?

1054
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:41,833
Hey?

1055
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Help!

1056
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:50,542
Help!

1057
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,166
I'm here.

1058
01:18:58,542 --> 01:18:59,542
Help!

1059
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,041
I'm coming.

1060
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:26,833
Help!

1061
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,916
Help!

1062
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:43,208
I'm coming.

1063
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,041
I'm coming.

1064
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,874
I'll call for help.

1065
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,791
I'm calling for help.

1066
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:20,874
Hello? We need help,
people are drowning in a swamp...

1067
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,541
Yes, right now, I'm here...
can you trace me?

1068
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:28,832
The forest by the road to Bednarka.
Yes, now!

1069
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,124
No!

1070
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:58,875
And?

1071
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:05,166
The firefighters fished out the body.

1072
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:08,291
I'm sorry.

1073
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,707
You'll feel a slight scratch.

1074
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:33,499
You should stay in for observation
until tomorrow.

1075
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,874
No, I have to get back to my dogs.

1076
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,332
- And does she know?
- Yes.

1077
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,666
Can I see her?

1078
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,208
Yes.

1079
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:00,666
To the left.

1080
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:13,082
She is extremely hypothermic,
exhausted and dehydrated...

1081
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:18,874
That's all, I'm finished.

1082
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:21,041
Thank you.

1083
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:25,374
We'll be on our way.

1084
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:29,999
They're friends from a
humanitarian organization.

1085
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:32,957
They brought you both dry clothes.

1086
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,707
They'll take you home.

1087
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,666
The pigs are standing by...

1088
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:52,082
Let them stand there,

1089
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,207
better here than at the border.

1090
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:57,041
You have to sign here, okay?

1091
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:06,957
Thank you very much.

1092
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,916
They found it in the boy's pocket...

1093
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:18,749
Nur...

1094
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,582
<i>Bashir, Amina... I tried.</i>

1095
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,207
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1096
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,832
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1097
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:44,499
<i>I know you won't forgive me.</i>

1098
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,749
<i>My phone didn't work.</i>

1099
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,791
<i>I was calling out.
I was calling for help.</i>

1100
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:58,457
<i>I don't know why it's me who is alive.</i>

1101
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:00,792
<i>Nur...</i>

1102
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,249
<i>was unconscious</i>

1103
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:08,624
<i>when he drowned in front of my eyes.</i>

1104
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:12,874
<i>He didn't suffer.</i>

1105
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,124
<i>He didn't suffer.</i>

1106
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:18,916
<i>He was so beautiful, a sweet boy.</i>

1107
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:21,166
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1108
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:25,624
<i>I hope you will forgive me, please.</i>

1109
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,916
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1110
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,582
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1111
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:35,542
What now?

1112
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:39,692
We've got the signed powers of attorney,
we'll get the interim relief tomorrow.

1113
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:40,733
What's that?

1114
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:43,150
The European Court
of Human Rights prohibits

1115
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,733
Poland from expelling foreigners
for a certain period of time.

1116
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,582
That should keep her from being deported.

1117
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,457
The pigs still respect it, for now...

1118
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:52,166
- Fuck me...
- Hey, can you not make such a mess?

1119
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:54,624
Are you from that "Border" group?

1120
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,582
I'm Marta, group coordinator.

1121
01:24:57,917 --> 01:24:58,917
Julia.

1122
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:00,458
Maciek.

1123
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:04,108
≈ªuku is a bit eccentric,
she takes after dad.

1124
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:06,067
But she knows her stuff.

1125
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,707
Fuck off, Marta.
Hiya.

1126
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,582
- Sisters?
- Yeah, I can't believe it either.

1127
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:15,457
Yes, Marta.

1128
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:18,624
And the next right, thank you very much.

1129
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:19,999
Turn around.

1130
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,249
Turn around.

1131
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,624
- She'll die.
- Hey!

1132
01:25:34,208 --> 01:25:37,082
Do you hear?
She'll die in that forest!

1133
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:40,499
- Move, I said.
- I need my glasses!

1134
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,124
Please step back.

1135
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,749
This is the doctor's discharge form.
Step aside!

1136
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:54,582
- Give her the coat.
- Step back, I said.

1137
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:56,291
Give her the coat.

1138
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,874
Please step back.

1139
01:25:58,208 --> 01:25:59,192
Get in.

1140
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,292
Get in.

1141
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:03,082
- Julia! Move it!
- Get in!

1142
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:07,582
Get in, come on.
Hold this.

1143
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:11,749
Shut the door!

1144
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,124
Go, go, go.

1145
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,457
Fuck!

1146
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,707
You think that'll scare them?

1147
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:23,249
- At least I'm fucking trying.
- Calm down!

1148
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,874
- Drive around it.
- How?

1149
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:33,749
Fiona, relax.

1150
01:26:36,042 --> 01:26:38,041
You can't let them get away with it.

1151
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,832
You have to shout about it.

1152
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,754
Where are the politicians?
And what about the EU?

1153
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,567
You think that's funny?

1154
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:57,082
Don't worry, ≈ªuku is sometimes...

1155
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:01,207
Do you know how many people have died in
the Mediterranean trying to get to Europe?

1156
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:05,124
Since the beginning
of the crisis in 2015? Well?

1157
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,666
- I don't know exactly, but...
- More than 20,000!

1158
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,374
You probably haven't heard about the boats
being turned back, the Frontex actions...

1159
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:17,499
So yeah, I laugh when someone bullshits me
about the sacred EU...

1160
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:18,625
I'm sorry.

1161
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,291
- What?
- No, wait.

1162
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:22,916
Fiona, Lapi, come on!

1163
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:24,541
Bravo.

1164
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,208
Wait.

1165
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:33,249
You're right, that's how it is.
I'm sorry.

1166
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,582
Look, I want to help, too.

1167
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:39,442
I'm sure I'll be useful,
I can do anything...

1168
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:40,916
I'm in pretty good shape.

1169
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,874
Go on, you're doing fine.

1170
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:46,916
I'm a psychologist!
A shrink!

1171
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:49,216
Anyway, I have the tools
to help people in a crisis

1172
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:50,625
and I know first-aid.

1173
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,624
- Do you have a driver's license?
- Yes, and a car.

1174
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,874
And look, quite a lot of free space.

1175
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,400
It's much closer to the border here
than your base in the town.

1176
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,166
You wouldn't be so conspicuous.

1177
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:05,124
There are two rooms upstairs,
with three beds.

1178
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:08,957
The whole house is at your disposal...
except for my bedroom!

1179
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,166
If you have to, please smoke outside.

1180
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:15,374
Look...

1181
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:19,108
It works just like Messenger.
This is Honza, our homie in Czechia.

1182
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:22,300
He helped us once, and his number
has been circulating online ever since.

1183
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,332
Now lots of people
crossing the border know him.

1184
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:28,525
If they need help,
they send a pin to Honza

1185
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:32,499
with their location and what they need,
and Honza sends it to us. Got it?

1186
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:33,875
Alright...

1187
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,749
now the most important thing.

1188
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:39,582
If you want to work with us,
you have to accept the rules:

1189
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:44,291
we give food, water, medicines,
clothes, powerbanks, phones.

1190
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,499
We don't give lifts or guide anyone.

1191
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:49,957
And we don't enter
the exclusion zone, ok?

1192
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,916
We can't give the pigs any excuse,
or they'll hit the whole organization

1193
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:57,291
and those people won't get help anymore.
You understand?

1194
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,249
Get the boxes.

1195
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,374
So funny.

1196
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,291
- Tea?
- No, thanks.

1197
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:49,249
God!

1198
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:55,416
My son!

1199
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,374
<i>Nur, my sweetheart.</i>

1200
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:03,332
Nur!

1201
01:30:03,542 --> 01:30:06,291
<i>She said he didn't...</i>

1202
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:08,207
<i>suffer...</i>

1203
01:30:10,417 --> 01:30:13,249
<i>He was unconscious,</i>

1204
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,381
<i>he didn't feel any pain...</i>

1205
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:24,207
You said the way would be.
quick and easy. You said!

1206
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:26,957
God predetermined it, and did his will.

1207
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:30,791
Pray for him, pray for his soul.

1208
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:34,775
I killed my own son, I killed him.

1209
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:35,983
Amina, Amina.

1210
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,707
- I killed him.
- Amina, calm down.

1211
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,499
Calm down, Amina, you'll scare the kids.

1212
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:54,666
Come here, my darling.

1213
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:03,666
<i>Take care of the mobile, ok?</i>

1214
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,499
<i>Without the mobile, you won't get here.</i>

1215
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:09,858
<i>As soon as you get into Poland</i>

1216
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,916
<i>and cross the exclusion zone,</i>

1217
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,457
<i>send me your location right away.</i>

1218
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,457
<i>There'll be a man waiting for you.</i>

1219
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:20,832
<i>- Then wait for a signal from me, ok?</i>
- Ok.

1220
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,666
<i>May God be with you.</i>

1221
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:26,499
Go, go, go.

1222
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:34,150
The first one has already gone!

1223
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,275
Run! Run! Don't stop!

1224
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,733
No stopping!

1225
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,541
Move it, bitch!

1226
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:47,957
You're all moving like
it's your grandma's funeral.

1227
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,416
Come on, come on.

1228
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,916
Move it.

1229
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:06,233
Faster!

1230
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,416
Hey, move it, don't you understand?

1231
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:13,832
Move it, go on!

1232
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:15,317
No!

1233
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:16,499
Go on!

1234
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:20,082
Dad! Dad!

1235
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,249
Dad!

1236
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,957
- Dad!
- I'm not going!

1237
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:25,150
- Come on! Dad!
- I'm not going!

1238
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,124
- Grandpa!
- Come on, Dad!

1239
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,457
Hello?

1240
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,166
Anybody here?

1241
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:15,957
THANK YOU, SORRY FOR
THE TOILET. BABY IS SICK.

1242
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:30,291
Fuck!

1243
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:33,666
I'm fucking sick of all this patrolling.

1244
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:40,916
Hold on.

1245
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:43,957
- What are you doing?
- I got something good.

1246
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,707
Local quince liquor.

1247
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:49,207
To warm us up, here.

1248
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:55,067
How do I know
you're not the commander's snitch?

1249
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:56,515
What the fuck are you on about?

1250
01:34:57,542 --> 01:34:59,541
- Here.
- I don't want it.

1251
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,957
Ok, give me your phone.

1252
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:04,684
- Why?
- Just give me your phone.

1253
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:11,582
Here you go.

1254
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:18,707
Alright now?

1255
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,750
Hello?

1256
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,749
Is everything ok?

1257
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:33,082
Polish, English?

1258
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,374
Are you ok?

1259
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:37,832
Fuck.

1260
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:06,499
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord.

1261
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:09,692
We have to toss the body over.

1262
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:10,832
It's not far away.

1263
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:12,541
Oh shit.

1264
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:19,541
Hey, man, let's leave her.

1265
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:22,692
Look, I didn't see anything,
and neither did you. Come on.

1266
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:24,025
What the fuck are you on about?

1267
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:26,916
The Russkies threw her over to us.
They're us, and we're them.

1268
01:36:27,417 --> 01:36:28,983
No fucking way.

1269
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:30,083
Holy shit!

1270
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:31,916
Leave it, leave it.

1271
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,207
Check for Belarusians.

1272
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,207
And turn off your flashlight.

1273
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,499
Hey, Russkies, Russkies.

1274
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:08,874
Hey, Poles!

1275
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:12,792
Holy shit!

1276
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,817
<i>Tension on the border
with Belarus is rising.</i>

1277
01:37:28,917 --> 01:37:31,317
<i>Aggressive assaults are on the rise,</i>

1278
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:34,582
<i>along with physical attacks on
Polish soldiers and officers.</i>

1279
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:36,983
<i>A group of about 100 people tried</i>

1280
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:39,650
<i>to cross the state border by force.</i>

1281
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,733
<i>They behaved aggressively,
throwing stones</i>

1282
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:46,525
<i>and tree branches at the officers
on duty...</i>

1283
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:49,858
<i>Polish soldiers, police
and Border Guard officers</i>

1284
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:53,025
<i>continue to firmly and professionally
thwart further attacks,</i>

1285
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,733
<i>refusing to submit to provocation,</i>

1286
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:57,442
<i>for which they were thanked in person
by President Andrzej Duda,</i>

1287
01:37:57,542 --> 01:38:01,166
<i>who visited the soldiers and
officers monitoring our security...</i>

1288
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:51,957
- Just in time for soup.
- Pour it into the thermoses.

1289
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:53,707
Because I just got a pin.

1290
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:01,525
- Maciek, clothes.
- Wet stuff straight to the bathroom.

1291
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:03,416
Maciek, can you sort it out?

1292
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:06,275
- Later, ok?
- What do you have there?

1293
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:07,416
Let me see.

1294
01:39:08,167 --> 01:39:09,166
How many people?

1295
01:39:09,292 --> 01:39:11,332
Four men.

1296
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,442
One sick, something wrong with his leg.

1297
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:16,707
Painkillers, anti-inflammatory pills,
dressings...

1298
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,332
- Kids?
- No.

1299
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:20,957
Shoes.

1300
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:23,025
- What size?
- 41 and 44.

1301
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,707
And dry clothes for everyone.

1302
01:39:28,417 --> 01:39:31,983
Julia, about that Afghan woman...

1303
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:35,332
Leila? We still have no news.

1304
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,457
No one's seen her, and she's not responding
to our messages. She's disappeared.

1305
01:39:40,917 --> 01:39:42,817
But we're in touch with
her brother in the US,

1306
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:45,650
so maybe that will help,
I don't know.

1307
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,750
Thanks.

1308
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,874
Shit, not good.

1309
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,082
They're inside the zone,
they'll have to move.

1310
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,275
See?

1311
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:01,567
- Fuck, it's only a few hundred yards.
- It'll be easier for them to get through.

1312
01:40:01,667 --> 01:40:05,624
Fucking hell, are you stalling on purpose?

1313
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,624
We have no time. If they move,

1314
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,249
we'll be looking for
them all night...

1315
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:11,591
Spare us your words of wisdom, ok?
They don't help.

1316
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:13,166
I'll wait in the car.

1317
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,124
Watch where you step.

1318
01:40:58,542 --> 01:40:59,541
Yeah...

1319
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:02,291
- Watch your step.
- Ok, come on.

1320
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:06,317
It's here.

1321
01:41:06,417 --> 01:41:07,749
Shit, we're late.

1322
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,207
I can't walk.

1323
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:25,957
I can't walk.
The taxi is there.

1324
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:30,166
My friends left me.
Please, I don't want to die.

1325
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,192
It's ok, it's ok.

1326
01:41:32,292 --> 01:41:34,207
He's all wet, he needs to get changed.

1327
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:36,666
It's ok, I'm gonna help you.

1328
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,567
- It's ok, it's ok.
- I don't want to die.

1329
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:42,374
- They left me.
- You won't die.

1330
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,358
I don't think it's broken,
more like sprained.

1331
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:50,916
Look at me, what's your name?

1332
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:53,124
- My name... Ahmad.
- My name is Julia.

1333
01:41:53,417 --> 01:41:55,900
- Everything will be ok.
- Don't let me die, please.

1334
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,479
His details for the interim order.

1335
01:41:57,792 --> 01:41:59,624
Do you have a passport?

1336
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:02,041
Where is it? In your pocket?

1337
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:03,749
It's ok.

1338
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:08,233
Please let me call.
Please. Please.

1339
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:09,733
- Please let me call.
- No.

1340
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,567
No.

1341
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:11,874
Thank you.

1342
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,541
Let me put the jacket on, ok?

1343
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:30,874
Where are you from?
Morocco.

1344
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:33,416
How old are you?

1345
01:42:34,042 --> 01:42:35,624
- 25.
- 25.

1346
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:38,733
- Are you here with anyone?
- They left me.

1347
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:41,207
You mean your friends or family?

1348
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:43,916
You have to be silent, please. Okay?

1349
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:56,791
I think it's for you.

1350
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:00,499
Sabih?

1351
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:03,791
This is Ahmad.

1352
01:43:04,292 --> 01:43:06,358
Thank God, thank God.
Listen...

1353
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:08,499
Those people came to help, they're here.

1354
01:43:08,708 --> 01:43:10,624
Where are you?

1355
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:15,374
Send me your location, please.

1356
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:19,233
Sabih, don't leave without me, please.

1357
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:20,916
Ok, ok.

1358
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:26,999
I have to hang up now.
Send me your location, Sabih.

1359
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:30,707
Thank you.
Look, they are not far.

1360
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:33,358
Just one hour.
The taxi will come, please.

1361
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,858
Please, I have money, I can pay you.

1362
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:37,983
- I have money.
- No one wants your money.

1363
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,983
Please take me there.
Don't leave me here.

1364
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,233
- No one will leave you, ok?
- Julia...

1365
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,041
- For sure we will...
- Julia!

1366
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:46,108
We will do whatever we can, ok?

1367
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:47,916
Give us a moment.

1368
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,416
Look, you can't promise him
things like that.

1369
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:59,108
- It's only a few miles.
- You can't.

1370
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:01,400
They're bound to find us here.
We'll have to go around.

1371
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,817
It's only a few minutes by car.

1372
01:44:02,917 --> 01:44:05,832
And how do you plan
to get him to the car, huh?

1373
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:10,499
If they saw us, we're fucked.

1374
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:12,250
Fuck.

1375
01:44:12,542 --> 01:44:15,666
- Ok, stay with him, and I'll drive closer.
- Are you crazy?

1376
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:18,207
Have you seen how many patrols there are?

1377
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,924
- They'll throw him over the wire.
- Ok, listen up.

1378
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:23,291
Let's try to move him,
it might work.

1379
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,582
Have you ever carried someone
without a stretcher? Because I have.

1380
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:28,108
We barely got here on our own...

1381
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:30,582
- What if we take him on a sleeping bag?
- No.

1382
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:33,633
We have his details for interim relief,
we can come back in the morning.

1383
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:36,983
- But it's freezing at night.
- You know the rules, you agreed!

1384
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:38,900
If we go to jail,
we can't help anyone, right?

1385
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,550
- Go to jail? For what?
- Violating state of emergency rules.

1386
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,567
Even just entering the exclusion zone.

1387
01:44:43,667 --> 01:44:45,832
We can't give them any excuse...
those are the rules.

1388
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:47,442
You think they need an excuse?

1389
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,942
- Ziobro will snap his fingers and...
- We have to leave him here, end of discussion!

1390
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:52,832
Then you go and tell him.

1391
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:54,291
Go on.

1392
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:56,458
Right then.

1393
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:04,832
There's your passport.

1394
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:07,249
We have to leave you now, but...

1395
01:45:10,042 --> 01:45:12,374
Thank you, ok.
Ok, thank you.

1396
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:14,332
Give me a sleeping bag.

1397
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:16,207
And a roll mat.

1398
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:33,083
Thank you.

1399
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,916
The roll mat.

1400
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:51,333
Julia!

1401
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:52,750
Julia!

1402
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:58,082
Where are you going?

1403
01:46:01,333 --> 01:46:02,332
Let me go!

1404
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:03,458
Fuck!

1405
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:05,125
Let me go!

1406
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:10,125
Go!

1407
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:51,583
Ahmad?

1408
01:47:08,042 --> 01:47:09,042
Ahmad...

1409
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:32,874
Hi, Mom, everything's all right.

1410
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:35,832
Do you have a date for the second dose?

1411
01:47:38,958 --> 01:47:42,832
Mom, I have to go now.
Don't get upset, I'll call you back.

1412
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,207
- Police, get out of the car!
- Yes? But what are you doing?

1413
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:49,291
Hand!

1414
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:50,791
The other one.

1415
01:47:51,167 --> 01:47:52,167
Your other hand.

1416
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:59,999
- You entered the exclusion zone.
- I don't think so.

1417
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:04,124
If you admit to it, the prosecutor
will drop the sanctions...

1418
01:48:05,292 --> 01:48:07,124
Are you kidding? What sanctions?

1419
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,207
Even if I entered the zone,
it's only a misdemeanor.

1420
01:48:11,167 --> 01:48:14,332
Then how about assisting
with people trafficking?

1421
01:48:14,917 --> 01:48:19,124
Article 264 of the Criminal Code,
with up to eight years in prison.

1422
01:48:21,667 --> 01:48:23,494
I want to make a phone call,
it's my right.

1423
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:26,499
Spread your legs.

1424
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:31,666
I have to call my seriously ill mother.
She won't answer a strange number.

1425
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,832
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1426
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:51,499
Hello, Mom, I'm sorry.
I was out of range...

1427
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:53,832
For a walk...

1428
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:55,666
Yes, at night.

1429
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,499
Mom, honestly, I'm tired
of checking in every night!

1430
01:49:01,917 --> 01:49:03,957
Just tell me,
did you go for those tests?

1431
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:07,999
How am I supposed to take care of myself
when you don't do the same for yourself?

1432
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:09,499
Time to wrap it up.

1433
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:13,624
Yes, you heard right,
it was a man's voice!

1434
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:18,332
Mom, Szymon's been dead for over a year!
I have the right to my own life!

1435
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:19,541
That's enough.

1436
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:22,707
I'll call you back, ok? Bye.

1437
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:29,983
Now you've done it.

1438
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:35,124
I'm a shrink, a psychologist,
and I need to protect my patients' data.

1439
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Iza!

1440
01:49:39,292 --> 01:49:40,666
Come and do the full body...

1441
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:42,875
Iza!

1442
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:50,332
Take your clothes off.

1443
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:02,125
Strip.

1444
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:05,541
- You must be joking!
- Quickly!

1445
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:10,832
Come on, quickly!

1446
01:51:08,042 --> 01:51:10,249
Our commander is on leave.

1447
01:51:10,667 --> 01:51:13,499
That son of a bitch has got
under everyone's skin here.

1448
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,624
- And no one revolts?
- You know, it is what it is.

1449
01:51:19,042 --> 01:51:20,042
Over there.

1450
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:34,707
I can notify your foundation's lawyer
that you are here.

1451
01:51:35,292 --> 01:51:37,541
- I don't know the number.
- It's ok.

1452
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,499
Thank you.

1453
01:52:08,833 --> 01:52:11,067
We will file a complaint
against your detention.

1454
01:52:11,167 --> 01:52:12,167
Thank you.

1455
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,291
- Sign here, please.
- Here?

1456
01:52:19,542 --> 01:52:21,291
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1457
01:52:21,875 --> 01:52:26,416
I'd change your phone, just in case.
And the sim card.

1458
01:52:31,167 --> 01:52:32,167
Fuck!

1459
01:52:39,875 --> 01:52:41,791
[FUCK OFF!]

1460
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:55,041
I'll get a tow truck for you.

1461
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:01,192
No, thank you, I don't have the strength.
I'll take care of it later.

1462
01:53:01,292 --> 01:53:02,957
He's a good friend of mine.

1463
01:53:04,542 --> 01:53:06,249
I'm sure he won't charge you anything.

1464
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:08,916
- I'll send you his number.
- Thank you.

1465
01:53:10,167 --> 01:53:12,541
- Could you give me a ride home now?
- Sure.

1466
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:17,457
Yes, here I am.
Come on, Fiona, come here.

1467
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:22,791
Everything's ok.

1468
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:32,874
≈ªuku, can you not fucking smoke
in here? It's too much.

1469
01:53:33,125 --> 01:53:34,499
Ok, sorry.

1470
01:53:36,167 --> 01:53:39,582
- Whose car is that?
- Mine. I mean, partly mine.

1471
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:41,541
A few of us bought it together.

1472
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,457
Come on, come here.

1473
01:53:44,833 --> 01:53:46,041
I already gave them some.

1474
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:48,042
Oh, thanks.

1475
01:53:48,375 --> 01:53:50,291
So they can get a second helping, ok?

1476
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:53,374
I thought they'd locked you up.

1477
01:53:53,625 --> 01:53:54,525
They did.

1478
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:56,483
<i>...border guards supported
by Polish soldiers...</i>

1479
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:57,666
Thought so...

1480
01:53:57,833 --> 01:53:59,400
<i>...police officers...</i>

1481
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:02,082
Marta and Maciek have gone back
to the old base.

1482
01:54:02,917 --> 01:54:03,957
I see.

1483
01:54:05,667 --> 01:54:08,124
You know I have to apologize again?

1484
01:54:09,833 --> 01:54:13,249
- You don't, just smoke outside...
- Not about the cigarettes.

1485
01:54:14,917 --> 01:54:18,567
I thought you were just
a common, petty liberal,

1486
01:54:18,667 --> 01:54:22,999
looking to boost your self-esteem...
I was wrong, respect!

1487
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:27,791
I have good self-esteem.
Apart from that, I agree with you.

1488
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:32,957
<i>They are supported by troops from the
18th Mechanized Division.</i>

1489
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:36,942
<i>The soldiers carry out their difficult
service on a daily basis...</i>

1490
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:39,999
<i>Indeed, as the President says,
it is demanding work.</i>

1491
01:54:40,292 --> 01:54:41,707
Bastards!

1492
01:54:46,833 --> 01:54:50,291
I take it that since you stayed,
we'll do it together, our way?

1493
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,500
Sure.

1494
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:56,625
Great.

1495
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:01,166
I'll never leave anyone
in the woods again!

1496
01:55:02,917 --> 01:55:04,666
Wait, wait!

1497
01:55:04,792 --> 01:55:07,858
Fuck, ≈ªuku, how many times have I said
that no one should sleep in my bedroom?

1498
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:10,067
What's wrong with you people?

1499
01:55:10,167 --> 01:55:12,832
This is Sasha...
And that's Ula.

1500
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:17,374
Julia. Look, nobody sleeps in my bed,
or eats out of my bowl, ok?

1501
01:55:18,292 --> 01:55:20,291
I invited them because
we'll need support...

1502
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:21,417
Alright.

1503
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,874
You have two bedrooms upstairs!

1504
01:55:34,875 --> 01:55:36,749
We have to use two cars.

1505
01:55:37,167 --> 01:55:40,374
One in front, as the lookout,
to spot the checkpoints.

1506
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:44,457
I saw that some guy gave you a ride.
What happened to your car?

1507
01:55:45,208 --> 01:55:46,999
I don't have a car for the time being.

1508
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:49,083
Ok.

1509
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:52,124
And we can't bring them here.

1510
01:55:52,833 --> 01:55:54,832
- You know they're keeping an eye on you?
- I know.

1511
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,082
They'll track us.

1512
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:02,999
Handsome.

1513
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:06,749
- He died of Covid.
- Fuck, sorry.

1514
01:56:07,708 --> 01:56:08,708
It's alright.

1515
01:56:12,625 --> 01:56:14,207
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Ba≈õka.

1516
01:56:14,583 --> 01:56:16,749
<i>Geez, I thought it was Szymon calling.</i>

1517
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:19,666
Listen, could you lend me your SUV?
My car's off the road...

1518
01:56:20,708 --> 01:56:23,582
<i>- I can.</i>
- As soon as possible would be best.

1519
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:26,108
- Could you come now?
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>

1520
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:28,499
Thank you so much. Thanks.

1521
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:35,567
Sorry, give me a moment, will you?

1522
01:56:35,667 --> 01:56:37,499
I have to speak to a patient.

1523
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:38,525
Sure.

1524
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:40,374
You can go upstairs.

1525
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:41,583
Thanks.

1526
01:56:50,042 --> 01:56:50,983
<i>Hi.</i>

1527
01:56:51,083 --> 01:56:52,666
Hi Bogdan, how's it going?

1528
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:54,983
<i>Do we have a session today?</i>

1529
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:57,291
No, the day after tomorrow at 4pm.

1530
01:56:57,708 --> 01:57:00,041
It will be free. Interested?

1531
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:02,916
<i>Well, at your rates, of course.</i>

1532
01:57:03,042 --> 01:57:05,374
I'm glad you appreciate the gesture.

1533
01:57:07,292 --> 01:57:09,108
I have some business, we need to meet.

1534
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:12,374
And by the way, how is your outrage
at our reactionary regime?

1535
01:57:15,292 --> 01:57:16,499
You've got half a tank of gas.

1536
01:57:16,625 --> 01:57:18,666
It's an automatic,
but that shouldn't be a problem.

1537
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:21,082
- Thank you.
- You always did drive like a lunatic.

1538
01:57:21,375 --> 01:57:23,150
It's good that you're ok.

1539
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:26,207
I said my car's off the road,
it doesn't mean I had an accident.

1540
01:57:26,542 --> 01:57:29,207
- Oh hi! Julia, we got a pin.
- Get ready, I'm coming.

1541
01:57:31,042 --> 01:57:32,666
What is really going on?

1542
01:57:33,208 --> 01:57:36,643
We want to take people out of the woods
and put them up somewhere in the area...

1543
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,500
What?

1544
01:57:41,292 --> 01:57:43,499
- You mean migrants?
- Refugees.

1545
01:57:44,208 --> 01:57:46,582
They need to get themselves together,
somewhere safe.

1546
01:57:47,292 --> 01:57:50,358
- Do you have any AAA batteries?
- Bottom drawer of the desk.

1547
01:57:50,458 --> 01:57:53,666
Holy crap, what a cool car!
And local plates!

1548
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:56,749
We can take it to the forest
and use the Opel as the lookout!

1549
01:57:57,125 --> 01:57:58,582
Let me have a minute to talk, ok?

1550
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:02,749
I'll show you something.

1551
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:13,666
No, I'm sorry, I can't watch things like that...
It just gets to me and...

1552
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:16,457
This is the woman I dragged out
of the swamp...

1553
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:20,041
Julka, my dear, you know me...

1554
01:58:21,125 --> 01:58:22,650
I always voted for Civic Platform.

1555
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:25,400
I stood outside the courts with a candle
when it was necessary,

1556
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,499
but this...

1557
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:30,957
I have to make a living, work,
you know?

1558
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,582
Everyone has to.

1559
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,624
That's easy for you to say,
you have no family.

1560
01:58:36,625 --> 01:58:38,666
Yes, my husband died.

1561
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:41,207
I'm sorry.

1562
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:45,707
I have a mother, and my dogs.

1563
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:46,916
Ba≈õka...

1564
01:58:47,375 --> 01:58:48,916
Will you lend me the car or not?

1565
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:51,483
What if they catch you and tie it to me?

1566
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,541
Helping is not illegal!

1567
01:58:56,875 --> 01:58:58,666
What world do you live in!

1568
01:59:00,917 --> 01:59:02,249
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1569
01:59:03,125 --> 01:59:04,125
No.

1570
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:10,041
And don't ask me for such
things again! Understand?

1571
01:59:10,417 --> 01:59:12,541
I don't understand, but I heard you.

1572
01:59:14,875 --> 01:59:16,124
Bye-bye.

1573
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:20,957
So much for the SUV.

1574
01:59:21,417 --> 01:59:22,417
All right, let's go.

1575
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:30,666
It's good they're close to the road.

1576
01:59:31,292 --> 01:59:32,292
Damn.

1577
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:34,832
My car is really close.

1578
01:59:35,667 --> 01:59:37,150
It makes no sense to me.

1579
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,400
It just sucks, it's a disaster.

1580
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,358
When I used to drive,
they never wanted a ride.

1581
01:59:42,458 --> 01:59:44,400
- Because we didn't ask.
- What do you mean?

1582
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:47,150
- Those Kurds said they already had a taxi.
- Did you ask everyone?

1583
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:50,291
This is no time for squabbling.
We have to consider every option.

1584
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,733
We can put them in the back
and cover them with blankets.

1585
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:54,567
I'll take them away
and come back for you...

1586
01:59:54,667 --> 01:59:57,150
- Or not.
- Ok... I'll drive, it's my Opel!

1587
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,317
- It's a Toyota!
- I think I know what I drive.

1588
01:59:59,417 --> 02:00:02,624
- So what do you think you drive?
- An Opel.

1589
02:00:02,792 --> 02:00:03,832
What model?

1590
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:05,374
Opel Toyota.

1591
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,942
But the car is registered to me!

1592
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:10,082
- I did my part, didn't I?
- Calm down, now!

1593
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,750
I'll drive.

1594
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:14,608
I'm the oldest and, with all due respect,

1595
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:17,832
the only one
who doesn't look like an anarchist.

1596
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:20,483
- The old lady will drive.
- That's right.

1597
02:00:20,583 --> 02:00:23,957
Well, I've managed to lose the police
in a chase a few times.

1598
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:26,707
Really?

1599
02:00:28,625 --> 02:00:29,625
Geez...

1600
02:00:30,917 --> 02:00:32,041
Fuck!

1601
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:40,041
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing?

1602
02:00:41,667 --> 02:00:42,791
That was a portal.

1603
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:46,374
Pull over!

1604
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,500
And keep calm.

1605
02:00:55,125 --> 02:00:56,707
Stay calm.

1606
02:01:01,083 --> 02:01:02,749
Where are you all heading?

1607
02:01:03,375 --> 02:01:06,249
We're out of the exclusion zone.
Can't we go where we like?

1608
02:01:07,042 --> 02:01:09,442
You could at least say
you're going to the store.

1609
02:01:09,542 --> 02:01:11,525
Ok, we're going to the store.
Is that better, sir?

1610
02:01:11,625 --> 02:01:12,625
Yes.

1611
02:01:20,833 --> 02:01:22,499
And the lady next to you,

1612
02:01:24,042 --> 02:01:25,957
with the dark face...

1613
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:27,957
Does she speak Polish?

1614
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:30,750
She does.

1615
02:01:31,875 --> 02:01:33,416
Then why doesn't she say something?

1616
02:01:34,292 --> 02:01:37,624
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name

1617
02:01:37,958 --> 02:01:39,025
Thy kingdom come,

1618
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,900
Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven...

1619
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,983
Ok, on your way.

1620
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:44,400
Give us this day our daily bread

1621
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:46,317
And forgive us our trespasses...

1622
02:01:46,417 --> 02:01:48,525
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

1623
02:01:48,625 --> 02:01:49,608
And lead us not...

1624
02:01:49,708 --> 02:01:51,499
- Fuck off, I said!
- We are.

1625
02:01:55,417 --> 02:01:56,707
Sons of bitches!

1626
02:02:04,167 --> 02:02:05,249
Hello?

1627
02:02:06,042 --> 02:02:10,041
Yes, thank you for calling me back.
I'm a friend of attorney Jankowski.

1628
02:02:12,667 --> 02:02:15,758
Yes, it's about picking up a broken-down
car and taking it to the workshop.

1629
02:02:15,958 --> 02:02:18,832
It's on a side road,
I'll send you a pin. Hello?

1630
02:02:19,917 --> 02:02:23,207
That's great, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1631
02:03:07,125 --> 02:03:08,332
35.2 degrees.

1632
02:03:13,833 --> 02:03:14,874
Here.

1633
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:18,124
Super, ok.

1634
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:20,900
There are dry shoes
in the backpack.

1635
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,332
- Get the tea.
- Here.

1636
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:28,457
- There's soup too.
- In a moment, tea first. He is weak.

1637
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:33,582
Here.

1638
02:03:35,667 --> 02:03:36,916
It's ok.

1639
02:03:37,917 --> 02:03:40,374
Just a second, then we can pick him up.

1640
02:03:44,875 --> 02:03:47,791
Ok, now...
One, two, three.

1641
02:03:48,458 --> 02:03:49,458
Perfect.

1642
02:03:50,208 --> 02:03:51,957
You can give us that soup now.

1643
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,250
Oh, great.

1644
02:03:54,917 --> 02:03:55,917
Soup?

1645
02:03:59,708 --> 02:04:01,374
Very good.

1646
02:04:14,042 --> 02:04:16,582
- It's 11pm. What do we do?
- We stick to the plan.

1647
02:04:16,792 --> 02:04:18,567
I'm staying till morning.

1648
02:04:18,667 --> 02:04:20,249
- Don't go.
- Keep calm.

1649
02:04:21,667 --> 02:04:24,666
Take my backpack, leave me
the sleeping bag and a powerbank.

1650
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:30,958
Let's get going.

1651
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:32,832
Flashlights.

1652
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:53,457
This is me.

1653
02:04:55,625 --> 02:04:58,374
And this is my little brother.

1654
02:05:00,333 --> 02:05:03,082
- I miss him.
- Very beautiful.

1655
02:05:03,292 --> 02:05:05,957
Thanks, I hope they'll come.

1656
02:06:13,083 --> 02:06:14,749
Hey, look! Record it!

1657
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:17,582
Fuck!

1658
02:06:43,208 --> 02:06:45,643
- Say goodbye to the little girl.
- Goodbye, little girl.

1659
02:06:46,042 --> 02:06:47,042
Let's go.

1660
02:06:47,667 --> 02:06:49,082
Give me a piece.

1661
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:00,957
Don't eat it all.

1662
02:07:03,542 --> 02:07:05,207
Mama! Mama!

1663
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:13,125
Mama!

1664
02:07:19,417 --> 02:07:23,166
[The taxi will be here!]

1665
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:25,999
We should get going. Let's go.

1666
02:07:29,417 --> 02:07:31,082
We should get going.

1667
02:07:36,833 --> 02:07:38,124
Give it to me, Ghalia.

1668
02:07:38,708 --> 02:07:39,708
Ghalia...

1669
02:07:49,042 --> 02:07:50,666
No need to be upset.

1670
02:07:51,458 --> 02:07:54,666
You can buy the headlamps and
windows at a salvage yard.

1671
02:07:56,667 --> 02:08:00,749
It's just the paintwork,
and that'll be covered by insurance.

1672
02:08:01,917 --> 02:08:03,900
So you'll still come out ahead.

1673
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,374
Please get in the front, madam.

1674
02:08:16,042 --> 02:08:19,082
We're just about to set off.
Take care, please.

1675
02:09:29,375 --> 02:09:31,582
Hold tight.

1676
02:09:44,417 --> 02:09:46,249
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1677
02:10:11,083 --> 02:10:13,916
Show me your hands,
show me your hands.

1678
02:10:14,208 --> 02:10:16,207
Get out.

1679
02:10:16,875 --> 02:10:17,999
Alright!

1680
02:10:18,667 --> 02:10:20,416
Gently, I'm a lady.

1681
02:10:22,583 --> 02:10:25,249
Ula, Ula, Ula!

1682
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,250
Good morning.

1683
02:10:29,208 --> 02:10:30,567
- How did it go?
- Hi.

1684
02:10:30,667 --> 02:10:32,582
- Alright?
- Hi.

1685
02:10:46,333 --> 02:10:47,791
Boys, come on.

1686
02:10:59,083 --> 02:11:00,874
Right here. Inside.

1687
02:11:01,125 --> 02:11:02,874
- Hello.
- You too?

1688
02:11:03,208 --> 02:11:04,874
Come on, come here.

1689
02:11:06,083 --> 02:11:09,374
- Franek, thank you very much.
- Where should I drop your car?

1690
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,108
Could you take it to the workshop?

1691
02:11:11,208 --> 02:11:13,775
Sure, but it'll be 200 zlotys then.
I can't do too much for free.

1692
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:16,749
What are you doing? I was kidding...
Quick, get in... let's go.

1693
02:11:18,083 --> 02:11:19,624
See you online on Wednesday.

1694
02:11:20,458 --> 02:11:22,416
Thank you!

1695
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:28,858
You know, Julia, my wife and I
have been thinking. Whatever you need...

1696
02:11:28,958 --> 02:11:31,374
I'd always be happy to...
I can give lifts, pick people up...

1697
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:32,541
You know what I mean?

1698
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:34,832
Aren't you afraid they might
shut your company down?

1699
02:11:34,958 --> 02:11:39,067
No... I get on very well with the guards.
I went to school with the chief.

1700
02:11:39,167 --> 02:11:42,207
And the police? With all the patrol cars
I've hauled out of ditches?

1701
02:11:43,542 --> 02:11:44,999
You'll sleep here.

1702
02:11:45,292 --> 02:11:46,874
These are your beds.

1703
02:11:47,083 --> 02:11:49,582
Here are towels and some clothes.

1704
02:11:50,125 --> 02:11:51,442
The bathroom is through there...

1705
02:11:51,542 --> 02:11:53,166
And the laundry basket.

1706
02:11:53,917 --> 02:11:56,166
I wrote down the wi-fi password.

1707
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:57,582
And the network name.

1708
02:11:58,292 --> 02:11:59,874
You have Canal Plus.

1709
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,999
So, if you want to watch something,
feel free.

1710
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:04,749
Thank you.

1711
02:12:05,708 --> 02:12:09,207
Can... can the military find us here?

1712
02:12:10,292 --> 02:12:11,999
Mom doesn't speak French.

1713
02:12:12,625 --> 02:12:15,666
But you are safe here, I swear.

1714
02:12:16,708 --> 02:12:19,666
- I'm going, see you upstairs.
- Ok, thanks.

1715
02:12:21,917 --> 02:12:23,582
What a room!

1716
02:12:23,708 --> 02:12:25,207
Great room.

1717
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:28,124
Really cool.

1718
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:34,525
Guys, I think this is going to be my bed.

1719
02:12:34,625 --> 02:12:37,358
- What are you doing?
- Lying down.

1720
02:12:37,458 --> 02:12:40,791
- But I'm the tallest. What are you doing?
- A room at last, our own room.

1721
02:12:41,917 --> 02:12:44,874
The bath is super nice,
good temperature. Perfect.

1722
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,624
I am so good.

1723
02:12:48,625 --> 02:12:51,124
- I am so good in here.
- We were smelly.

1724
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:53,249
- What did you say?
- We were smelly.

1725
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:55,916
We were smelly!

1726
02:12:56,333 --> 02:12:58,291
- What?
- We were smelly!

1727
02:13:05,208 --> 02:13:06,916
Give me the baby.

1728
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:12,957
Don't be scared.

1729
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:18,082
Help me with the other one.

1730
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:21,916
It's heavy.

1731
02:13:30,292 --> 02:13:31,957
Move in, move in.

1732
02:13:43,208 --> 02:13:44,208
Go, go.

1733
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,218
The supervisor is screwing me over,
giving that bitch all the night shifts.

1734
02:13:59,667 --> 02:14:01,874
You don't have anything to do at night?

1735
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,957
I prefer daytime patrols,
at least the sun is shining.

1736
02:14:06,125 --> 02:14:07,457
Alright, let's go.

1737
02:14:23,292 --> 02:14:25,666
- Papers, please
- I knew you'd stop me.

1738
02:14:26,792 --> 02:14:27,999
Papers.

1739
02:14:29,333 --> 02:14:30,333
Here.

1740
02:14:30,583 --> 02:14:31,583
Log book.

1741
02:14:32,208 --> 02:14:34,666
And this is... for the goods.

1742
02:14:38,458 --> 02:14:40,207
My two loves.

1743
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:43,750
Check him.

1744
02:14:44,208 --> 02:14:46,457
I know how I must look...

1745
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:10,082
I don't fucking believe him,
but the papers are in order.

1746
02:15:10,958 --> 02:15:13,499
Let him go, or he'll drop dead
from a heart attack.

1747
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:15,791
Clear.

1748
02:15:17,667 --> 02:15:18,667
On your way.

1749
02:15:19,375 --> 02:15:20,832
Thank you very much.

1750
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,041
Want some?

1751
02:15:47,292 --> 02:15:49,400
- Mom, will you pour him some?
- Sure.

1752
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:52,483
Excuse me... I...

1753
02:15:52,583 --> 02:15:53,900
Miss...

1754
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,874
We are Muslims.

1755
02:15:56,042 --> 02:16:00,332
I know, Mom prepared chicken because...

1756
02:16:00,833 --> 02:16:02,832
she thought it would be ok.
Is the chicken ok?

1757
02:16:03,375 --> 02:16:07,457
- Yes, it's delicious.
- You didn't even taste it yet.

1758
02:16:07,833 --> 02:16:11,249
- Miss, it's halal.
- Stop calling me miss.

1759
02:16:12,083 --> 02:16:15,999
If you continue, I'll call you Mister Alan.

1760
02:16:16,208 --> 02:16:18,817
- That would be a bit weird, no?
- Yeah, don't...

1761
02:16:18,917 --> 02:16:22,041
- See, so stop it.
- I'll try.

1762
02:16:23,167 --> 02:16:25,249
- What's up?
- Nothing, everything is fine.

1763
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:27,457
Mom, help yourself to something.

1764
02:16:27,875 --> 02:16:30,499
It looks weird,
like you poisoned the food.

1765
02:16:32,708 --> 02:16:34,400
- Would you like more?
- No, thank you.

1766
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:37,567
Give them more, they need to eat well.
Serve him some rice and salad.

1767
02:16:37,667 --> 02:16:40,124
Don't give him more,
he can't eat any more now.

1768
02:16:40,375 --> 02:16:43,608
He hasn't eaten anything
for a couple of weeks, so...

1769
02:16:43,708 --> 02:16:45,567
- He'd get sick, I read about it.
- So maybe...

1770
02:16:45,667 --> 02:16:48,442
- Mom, why do you force people to eat?
- Calm down, sweetie, hey

1771
02:16:48,542 --> 02:16:49,608
Just offer more.

1772
02:16:49,708 --> 02:16:51,082
- Can you stop?
- Ok.

1773
02:16:51,292 --> 02:16:52,666
Everything good?

1774
02:16:52,833 --> 02:16:54,374
- Good.
- Ok.

1775
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:55,875
Cheers!

1776
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:57,874
Na zdrowie!

1777
02:16:58,250 --> 02:16:59,999
- Salut!
- Super weird, Dad.

1778
02:17:00,667 --> 02:17:02,499
You know Papa Wemba?

1779
02:17:02,708 --> 02:17:03,900
Koffee?

1780
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,249
No, but Papaoutai. Stromae?

1781
02:17:05,417 --> 02:17:07,207
- Stromae.
- Stromae is well-known.

1782
02:17:07,375 --> 02:17:09,332
It's old but we used to listen to it.

1783
02:17:09,583 --> 02:17:11,817
Wojtek makes music, but Polish.

1784
02:17:11,917 --> 02:17:13,400
Oh really? You rap?
Will you do it?

1785
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,275
- Go on.
- Sure, if you want.

1786
02:17:15,375 --> 02:17:17,192
I'll beatbox and you go, ok?

1787
02:17:17,292 --> 02:17:18,582
- Now?
- Sure, now.

1788
02:17:18,708 --> 02:17:20,291
- You're good?
- Yeah, ok.

1789
02:17:20,417 --> 02:17:21,874
Three, two, one...

1790
02:17:29,458 --> 02:17:31,666
Yo, check it out

1791
02:17:31,792 --> 02:17:34,082
One, two, three -
everyone did time in the woods

1792
02:17:34,708 --> 02:17:37,916
But don't worry about them,
they're safe now

1793
02:17:38,042 --> 02:17:42,233
White and black, like yin and yang,
that's our new gang

1794
02:17:42,333 --> 02:17:46,650
Us and the beatbox, us and the hip hop

1795
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:47,692
Wow!

1796
02:17:47,792 --> 02:17:50,374
- It's phat.
- He's really not bad.

1797
02:17:50,625 --> 02:17:52,499
He's phat! You know how to do that?

1798
02:17:52,833 --> 02:17:54,624
We know how. Let's play together.

1799
02:17:54,917 --> 02:17:57,858
Guys, do you know "Dying a Thousand Times"?

1800
02:17:57,958 --> 02:17:59,067
- Of course.
- It's really good.

1801
02:17:59,167 --> 02:18:00,457
It's on my playlist.

1802
02:18:00,583 --> 02:18:02,332
- I don't know it.
- Stop it!

1803
02:18:03,208 --> 02:18:04,457
Everybody knows it.

1804
02:18:04,792 --> 02:18:06,707
"Dying a Thousand Times"

1805
02:18:08,583 --> 02:18:10,983
It sounds familiar,
but I don't know the words.

1806
02:18:11,083 --> 02:18:13,499

so I die when you die"</i>

1810
02:18:21,792 --> 02:18:24,249
<i>"Between the stage and the mosque,
I carry a lot of remorse"</i>

1811
02:18:24,375 --> 02:18:26,775

would I have a double death?"</i>

1812
02:18:26,875 --> 02:18:28,858

what they can see"</i>

I feel like I'm dying a thousand times"</i>

Excuse me?

1826
02:21:22,958 --> 02:21:24,666
Everything will be fine.

1827
02:21:25,542 --> 02:21:26,707
Easy!

1828
02:21:26,958 --> 02:21:28,291
It's going to be ok, Maria!

1829
02:21:28,417 --> 02:21:30,874
I can't cross, I have to stay.

1830
02:21:31,167 --> 02:21:33,874
Go! Hurry up!
Everything will be fine!

1831
02:21:34,750 --> 02:21:37,124
Hold on a second! Take care!

1832
02:21:41,667 --> 02:21:44,666
- Are you crossing?
- No, I'm staying!

1833
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:05,291
Why are you crying, auntie?

1834
02:22:06,875 --> 02:22:10,166
God! Help us, God!
We have no home, my dear!

1835
02:22:14,375 --> 02:22:19,233
We have no home, my dear!
What should I do? I don't know what to do.

1836
02:22:19,333 --> 02:22:20,733
What is it?

1837
02:22:20,833 --> 02:22:23,666
- To Warsaw.
- To Warsaw? This way.

1838
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:26,166
Come on, I'll show you.

1839
02:22:26,958 --> 02:22:28,108
Don't worry.

1840
02:22:28,208 --> 02:22:31,275
As soon as we get to Warsaw,
we'll let you know.

1841
02:22:31,375 --> 02:22:34,916
- We crossed without any problems.
- Katowice? That way.

1842
02:22:36,542 --> 02:22:37,707
Katowice.

1843
02:22:40,125 --> 02:22:41,416
Come forward, please.

1844
02:22:42,583 --> 02:22:44,666
I've got a little kid, excuse me.

1845
02:22:48,167 --> 02:22:49,457
Hop on.

1846
02:22:50,542 --> 02:22:51,707
Next, please.

1847
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,124
Everything will be fine.

1848
02:23:00,458 --> 02:23:02,150
Too bad you weren't such a caring dad

1849
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:04,457
to those kids on
the Belarusian border, you dick!

1850
02:23:06,583 --> 02:23:07,957
I was never there.

1851
02:23:09,917 --> 02:23:11,832
On you get, please.

1852
02:23:15,917 --> 02:23:17,192
Where are you going, madam?

1853
02:23:17,292 --> 02:23:19,999
Sorry, my bird's freezing.
It can't bear the cold.

1854
02:23:20,208 --> 02:23:21,733
- You're going to Warsaw?
- Yes.

1855
02:23:21,833 --> 02:23:23,582
Ok, get on.
Katowice?

1856
02:23:23,708 --> 02:23:25,791
That way, over there.

1857
02:23:29,625 --> 02:23:31,999
- There you go. Warsaw!
- Warsaw?
