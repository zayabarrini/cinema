There are spirits...
They are all around us...

11
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:54,506
They have driven me
from hearth and home,

00:02:54,674 --> 00:03:00,012
from wife and child...

13
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,263
That is my fiancée...

14
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:10,582
What she and I have lived through is stranger
still than what you have lived through...

27
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:30,337

28
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,384
A somnambulist.

Murder!
The town clerk has been killed.

35
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:30,451
Stabbed in the side
with a strange pointed instrument...

36
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:40,605
Step rrrrright in! Presenting here
for the first time... Cesare the Somnambulist!

37
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:47,612
The miraculous Cesare...

Right before your eyes Cesare will awaken
from his death-like trance...

41
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:58,469
Cesare! Can you hear me?
Cesare, I am calling you...

42
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:11,774
I... Dr. Caligari... your master...
Awaken for a moment from your dark night...

and sees the future...

47
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,159
Judge for yourselves...

48

54
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:26,065
We'll leave the choice up to her...

55
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:35,866

we shall remain friends...

The somnambulist's prophecy?!

61

ACT IV

69
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:46,614
Worried because her father
has been away so long...

70
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:39,292
I had nothing to do with the two murders...
So help me God...

71
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:56,726
The old woman... It's true...
I tried to kill her...

72
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:06,528
by stabbing her in the side
with a similar knife...

73
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:15,537
to throw suspicion
on the mysterious murderer...

74
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:34,908
Is my father... Dr. Olfen here?

75

It couldn't have been Cesare...

78
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:25,104

LUNATIC ASYLUM

Do you have a patient
by the name of Dr. Caligari?

85
00:55:54,768 --> 00:56:05,110
The director returned earlier today...
Perhaps you should speak to him personally...

86
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:19,726
He... himself... and none other...
is Caligari...

87

THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.

93
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,977
In the year 1783,
a mystic by the name of Caligari

94
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:30,941
toured the fairs of numerous villages
in northern Italy,

95
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,737
accompanied by a somnambulist
named Cesare.

96
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:47,874
...for months he sowed panic
amongst village folks

97
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:56,008
through a series of foul murders committed
under almost identical circumstances...

98
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:22,659
...he had entirely subjugated to his will
a somnambulist named Cesare,

99
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:30,917
whom he did compel
to carry out his nefarious schemes.

100
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:38,717
A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare,
and which took his place in a cabinet,

101
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:48,602
allowed him to divert any suspicion
that might fall on the somnambulist.

102
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,901
My diary.

103
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,745
12 March... Finally... finally!

104
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:14,461
A somnambulist has been brought
to the asylum for admission...

105
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:06,656
Afternoon ‒ My desire... I shall be able
to satisfy my life's unwavering wish!

106
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:13,121
Now I shall unravel
the psychiatric secrets of this Caligari!

107
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,541
Now I shall discover if it is true

108
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:21,379
that a somnambulist
can be compelled to perform acts

109
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:25,550
that in a walking state
he would never commit

110
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:30,514
and would be repugnant to him...

111
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:39,314
Whether it is true that a sleepwalker
can be led to commit even murder...

112
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,499
An obsession.

113
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:39,499
I must know everything... I must penetrate
his secrets. I must become Caligari...

114
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:09,613
YOU MUST BECOME CALIGARI

115

ACT VI

117
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:46,584
We found the sleepwalker out in the fields...

118
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:13,505
Mr. Director - unmask yourself.
You are Dr. Caligari!

119
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:10,807
...and from that day on,
the madman never again left his cell.

120
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:38,728
Look... there's Cesare... never allow him
to tell your fortune, or you're dead...

121
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:23,481
Jane... I love you...
won't you be my wife at last?

122
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:41,457
We queens are not free to answer
the call of our heart...

123
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:25,585
You all think that ‒ I'm insane!

124
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:32,175
It isn't true...
It's the director who's insane!!

125
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:40,600
He is Caligari... Caligari... Caligari!

126
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:56,425
At last I understand his delusion.
He thinks I am that mystic, Caligari!

127
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,428
Now I know exactly how to cure him...

128
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,445
THE END
