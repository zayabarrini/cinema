1
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,274
Hope you stick in the mud.

2
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:09,122
God, boy, you stink as a driver!

3
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,340
- <i>Hey. Hold it, fellas. Wait.</i>
- <i>Quiet!</i>

4
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,869
- <i>Quiet down.</i>
- <i>No, you're kidding.</i>

5
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:28,940
<i>No. No. I gotta...</i> - l... -

6
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:31,008
<i>I'm with my family tonight.</i>

7
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,011
<i>I'm with my family.</i>

8
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:38,820
<i>Forget about it.</i>

9
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,829
<i>No, they're...</i> -
<i>These men aren't going out again.</i>

10
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:44,593
I want you to punch us out.
I don't wanna come in.

11
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,861
I got an unbreakable date.

12
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,869
With my wife.

13
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:50,928
My wife.

14
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,906
With my wife, you moron.

15
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,241
My wife!

16
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,606
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

17
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,710
<i>The Palisades caved in.</i>

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,558
<i>All night we gotta work.</i>

19
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,857
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>
- No way. Forget about it.

20
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:16,854
Forget about it.

21
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,890
No way!

22
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:24,936
Hey, Chick, there is no way
we're gonna work tonight.

23
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,332
Right.

24
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:39,051
<i>Bravo!</i>

25
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,489
<i>Last one out's a rotten egg!</i>

26
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:50,022
<i>Shh.</i>

27
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:53,226
Oh, Tony, don't yell at the kids.
I don't want anything to go wrong.

28
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,361
Your mother's terribly nervous.
Get in the car.

29
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,667
Don't yell at the kids.
Please. Don't yell.

30
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,730
Everybody takes it out... -
Maria, get in that car.

31
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,504
- Angelo, where are your shoes?
- <i>Get in the car. Come on, Maria.</i>

32
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,875
You can't go without your shoes. Here.

33
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:08,006
Hey, Tony, bring another sweater too.
A heavier sweater.

34
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,916
- Maria, have you got your pajamas?
- <i>I've got the pajamas.</i>

35
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:15,082
Okay. Oh, Tony, get Angelo's bicycle
from in back too, will ya?

36
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:18,752
- I don't think he heard ya.
- Okay. I'll get it. I'll get it. Never mind.

37
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,065
Come on. Get in there.
Sit down. All right.

38
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,068
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- Sit back in the seat.

39
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:30,127
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- She's gone to get Angelo's bicycle.

40
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,709
Here. You get the back.

41
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,438
Got it? Okay.
How about it? All right?

42
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,571
- Yeah.
- Watch your fingers.

43
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,276
- Want it closed?
- Wheel. It's that wheel. It's... -

44
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,410
- Keep the trunk... -
- Oh, well. That's all right.

45
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,420
- I'll drive.
- Okay. Get in the car, kids.

46
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,479
- <i>All right. Watch your fingers.</i>
- Everybody in now.

47
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,491
- <i>I don't wanna go.</i>
- Get in the backseat.

48
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,824
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
- Okay, Mom. We're all set.

49
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,829
- Okay, okay.
- <i>Bye, Mom.</i>

50
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,058
Get your fingers in.
Good-bye. Get your fingers.

51
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait a minute, Mother.

52
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,932
Mom, listen.
If anything happens... -

53
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:07,998
Anything. I mean, if they're impossible,
I want you to call me.

54
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:10,237
I don't care if it's day or night.
Do you understand?

55
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:13,406
- <i>Yes. All right.</i>
- You hear what I'm saying, Ma?

56
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,814
- Yes.
- Because I don't want any slipups on this.

57
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:18,079
I don't want you getting chickenshit
and not calling me.

58
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,781
- Darling, I can take care of them.
- I don't want you saying...

59
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:23,586
"Mabel's having a wonderful time.
I don't want to disturb her"...

60
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:25,649
while one of my kids
is lying there bleeding.

61
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,285
- All right.
- Okay?

62
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,330
- All right.
- All right. Take off. Let's go.

63
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:32,196
Don't break my head. Sit down.
Everybody back. Everybody back.

64
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,600
Okay. All right.
Get back. Sit back.

65
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,661
- Everybody in?
- <i>Go.</i>

66
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,500
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Turn your wheel. Okay.</i>

67
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,669
- <i>Mom.</i>
- Okay.

68
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,977
Okay. All right.
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:50,643
Okay. Go. All right.
All right. Go.

70
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,153
<i>Go. Good-bye. Go.</i>

71
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:55,519
- Go.
- <i>Bye, Mom.</i>

72
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,990
That's it. Go.

73
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:00,857
Shouldn't have let 'em go.
I don't know.

74
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,863
I shouldn't have let 'em go.

75
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,922
I shouldn't have let 'em go. Damn.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,991
I shouldn't have let 'em go.

77
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,905
Hey. Easy, easy, easy.

78
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,857
<i>Keep walking. Keep moving.</i>

79
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,166
Oh! Oh!

80
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:22,032
Vito, go out there and get 'em started.
I wanna talk to Eddie.

81
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:24,367
What's wrong?
You worried about somethin', Nick?

82
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,566
Yeah, yeah. He's got somethin'
on his mind.

83
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,632
Why don't you go.
I want to talk to him.

84
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,510
- Okay. But if you need a good ear.
- Right. Thanks.

85
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:36,483
Come on. That's right.

86
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,418
I promised her on my life
I'd be home tonight.

87
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:43,890
I promised her that this night was gonna be
a love night, a special night, somethin'.

88
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,621
I didn't know this goddamn thing
was gonna happen.

89
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,686
Water main in the middle of the night.

90
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,632
<i>Bet you didn't even call her.</i>

91
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,396
I can't call her.
How am I gonna call her?

92
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,494
She already sent the kids
to her mother's.

93
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,972
She'll climb the walls,
break dishes, scream.

94
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,475
Mabel's a delicate, sensitive woman.

95
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:04,876
Mabel's not crazy.

96
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:09,542
She's unusual.
She's not crazy, so don't say she's crazy.

97
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:13,884
This woman cooks, sews,
makes the bed, washes the bathroom.

98
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,889
What the hell is crazy about that?

99
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:18,289
I don't understand what she's doing.
I admit that.

100
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,555
But I think I know.
She's mad at me.

101
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:25,759
- Well, call her.
- You see, there's something wrong
with her, Eddie.

102
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,859
- Call her.
- She's not like a normal person.

103
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,372
This woman, you know,
she could get hit by a car...

104
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,373
burn down the house.

105
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,171
Jesus Christ.
I don't know what she can do.

106
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,704
Hi, baby.

107
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:07,799
Listen, I'm in trouble down here.
The... - The water main downtown here burst.

108
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:10,208
The thing busted.
The whole thing is busted...

109
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:12,508
and there's water all over the place.

110
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,571
So... -

111
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:19,476
I'm down here now.
I love ya.

112
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:23,582
It's fine, Nick.
Please believe me. It's fine.

113
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,521
You all right?

114
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:38,238
Yeah.

115
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:42,709
Baby, I'm gonna make this up to ya.
I'm not goin' to work tomorrow.

116
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:46,042
I'm gonna take the day off tomorrow,
and we're gonna be together tomorrow.

117
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:48,605
All day.
All right, sweetheart?

118
00:09:48,683 --> 00:09:51,243
Yeah.

119
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,020
Okay, sweetheart.

120
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,081
You're my girl.

121
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:02,121
<i>Hey, Nick! Come on, Nick! Come on!</i>

122
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:04,131
<i>Get on there. Come on!</i>

123
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:49,461
<i>Sometimes it looks that way,</i>
<i>and sometimes it doesn't.</i>

124
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,115
- Hee.
- Hi.

125
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,174
Hi.

126
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,265
Hey, you know Nick stood me up tonight?

127
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,861
After I got the kids
over at my mother's and everything.

128
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:26,202
Why do I care?

129
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:31,236
My name is... Garson Cross.

130
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,780
- Yeah, I know.
- You... - You know?

131
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,214
I know, Garson.
You got a light?

132
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,844
- Sure.
- And a drink?

133
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,411
Sure. I just got paid.
I'm loaded.

134
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,582
What's your pleasure?

135
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,694
Seagram's.

136
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:49,059
Seagram's and what?

137
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,428
Seven Crowns.

138
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,865
Seagram's and Seven Crowns and what?

139
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,870
In the bottle.

140
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,874
Bartender, give me a glass of ice.

141
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,309
- <i>There we go. Over here?</i>
- Put it right there.

142
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:11,477
- And, uh, take that Seagram Seven...
- <i>Seagram Seven.</i>

143
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:14,282
- And pour the lady a drink.
- <i>Pour the lady a drink.</i>

144
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,224
- How's that?
- Keep goin'.

145
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,658
- Keep goin'?
- Keep goin'.

146
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,718
Okay.

147
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:26,727
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

148
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,577
Ah.

149
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,642
Boy, you were thirsty.

Listen. Why don't we go to someplace
where it's a little quieter?

160
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,474
I, uh... -

161
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,601
I'd take you to my place, but, uh...

162
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:45,908
it's not very tidy.

163
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,406
Could we go to your place?

164
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,446
We could get some fresh air
and get out of this smoke.

165
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,852
Why don't we go to your place?

- Hmm?
- Yes. Yes.

167
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:06,433
Okay.

168
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,628
Why don't we just do that.

169
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:13,231
- What do I owe you, bartender?
- <i>$3.50.</i>

170
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,672
Good luck.

171
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:52,779
Are you all right, sweetheart?

172
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,021
Oh, please don't be sick.

173
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:11,031
Just lean on me.

174
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:14,262
Can you open your eyes?
There you are. You're up now.

175
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,464
- This is the place, right?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,608
What... -

177
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,218
Hey, cut it out.

178
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,723
Listen, buddy.
Knock it off.

179
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,732
Hey, don't! Put... - Put me... -

180

Cut it out.

00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,634
Let me go.

182
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:02,009
Let... go.

183
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,066
Funny thing.
Just a funny thing.

184
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,973
Nick!

185
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,067
No, uh, Garson. Garson Cross.

186
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:06,011
<i>I'm the one that</i>
<i>brought you home last night.</i>

187
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:16,081
You don't have to get up.
It's, uh...

188
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:18,887
pretty early in the morning.

189
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,155
I... - I'm sorry if I disturbed ya.

190
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:25,029
I... - I like to get up early in the morning,
walk around and talk to myself.

191
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,432
Are you in there?

192
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,274
Who... - Who's Nick?

193
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:41,372
You're not married, are ya?

194
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:48,218
I'm gonna have to leave
in a minute now.

195
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,416
Listen, if this Nick fella's on your mind...

196
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,426
and you consider me
some kind of a threat to him...

197
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:58,158
or if you're trying to punish him with me
or me with him, forget it!

198
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,564
I never met the man.

199
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:03,763
And don't blame yourself for me
if that's what you're doin'.

200
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:09,665
Are you in the shower?

201
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:12,474
Okay, as long as the shower's runnin',
then you're all right.

202
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,006
At least I hope you're all right.

203
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,121
What's the matter?

204
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,885
I'm not in the mood for games, Nick.

205
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:30,157
Nick Longhetti. Mabel Longhetti.

206
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:54,182
Want a cup of coffee?

207
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,348
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

208
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,425
I just don't understand that woman.

209
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,998
It's my fault.

210
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,061
Been divorced twice.

211
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:15,703
I just can't seem to keep a woman.

212
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,071
Mama?

213
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:27,349
Well, what do you think of him?

214
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,686
I mean, I know you can't like him.
He's not your son, but... -

215
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:44,996
Mama!

216
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:47,063
Kids?

217
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,842
Kids! Kids, where are you?

218
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,142
Nick. Nick, where are my kids?

219
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:24,038
- <i>Come on.</i>

00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,031
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Mabel?</i>

224
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:16,524
- Make yourselves at home.
- Nick, can I get a glass of water?

225
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,963
Yeah. Eddie, help 'em
make themselves at home.

226
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,160
Find a seat, fellas.
Make yourselves comfortable.

227
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:27,964
Mabel.

228
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:35,008
- Hey, Nick, can I use a glass?
- Yeah.

229
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,128
What's the matter?

230
00:22:57,204 --> 00:22:59,468
Hey.

231
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,474

Aw, Nick, you must be starving.

236
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,519
Mm-hmm.

237

Good. Come on, fellas.
Sit down and relax.

248
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,571
- She don't have one of her headaches?
- No. Don't be silly. Sit down.
Don't worry about it.

249
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,703
Let's go, fellas.
Make yourselves at home here.

250

<i>I don't want no bread. No.</i>

310
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:50,195
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- Help... - Help yourselves.

311
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,536
- What's your name?
- <i>You don't remember me?</i>

312
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,372
<i>I was here three weeks ago with Nick.</i>

313
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,539
<i>We had dinner.</i>

314
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:11,778
- Bread?
- Veronica is my wife.

315
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:16,848
The kids were playing outside.
You don't remember that?

316
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:20,418
I remember your wife.
I don't remember you.

317
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,120
Hey, Nick, guess what she is.

318
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:27,326
<i>"Crazy."</i>

319
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,335
- <i>Want a beer?</i>
- <i>Sit down.</i>

320
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,963
- Who wants beer? Billy? Morton?
- <i>No. No, thanks.</i>

321
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,098
- Aldo? James?
- <i>No, I'm drinking wine.</i>

322
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,911
<i>How's the sauce?</i>

323
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,470
- What's your name?
- <i>Terrific.</i>

324
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,974
Grimaldi. Vito Grimaldi.
A friend of Nick's.

325
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:49,216
Thanks. Hey, pass the sauce. Why not?

326
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:51,257
Need a little more sauce, boys.

327
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,520
<i>Give me the sauce.</i>

328
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:55,585
<i>I gotta play catch-up here.</i>

329
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,257
<i>I'm having trouble.</i>

330
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,904
Billy.

331
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:06,906
Twirl it.
Use the spoon.

332
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,272
Twirl it against the spoon.

333
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,444
- <i>Like that?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

334
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:16,911
- Oh, man. Come on.
- <i>Oh, no!</i>

335
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:19,748
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>
- It's all over my shoes.

336
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,687
- Christ's sake!
- Can't take you anyplace.

337
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:24,747
Shit.

338
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:27,760
- <i>Now eat it. Go ahead and eat it.</i>
- Look at ya.

339
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:29,762
<i>You want another plate?</i>

340
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,923
- <i>That's dirty. Here. Give him some more.</i>
- Please.

341
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,502
- <i>There. That's good. Here. Here.</i>
- There. Get rid of this.

342
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,130
Get rid of that.
Get rid of that.

343
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:47,470
- Pass the cheese here.
- Here's some more junk, man.

344
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,540
Whoo!

345
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:54,314
- <i>Now, where was I?</i>
- <i>Take some cheese.</i>

346
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:00,424
- <i>Cheese.</i>
- What's your name?

347
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,063
Me? Oh, uh, uh, Morton.

348
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,067
Joseph.

349
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,069
- Cheese?
- <i>I'm Mabel.</i>

350
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:14,772
- How are you?
- <i>All right. How about you?</i>

351
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,832
I'll hold it.

352
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:21,308
And, uh, uh...

353
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:23,372

00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:33,724
I'm Mabel Longhetti.
I live with Nick.

357
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,420
<i>Take that.</i>

00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,291
And you... - handsome.

359
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:44,735
Yeah. You.

360
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:46,932
Billy. Billy Tidrow.

361
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:48,941
- <i>Billy Tidrow.</i>
- Yeah.

362
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,943
- <i>Billy Tidrow.</i>
- Can I have some bread?

363
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:52,672
- Tidrow.
- <i>Tidrow.</i>

364
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:54,338
- Tidrow.
- <i>Tidrow. Right.</i>

365
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:57,349
- Right. Right.
- And they call me Mighty Mouse.

366
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,284
Mickey Mouse.

367
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:02,345
<i>Mighty Mouse.</i>

368
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:08,518
Raise 'em.

369
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:12,531
Here's to everybody.
Welcome. God bless you.

370
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,762
Um, eat a lot and live a long time.

371
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,770
Hey.

372
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,772
<i>To Mabel.</i>

373
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,707
To Mabel!

374
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:36,178
<i>Don't worry.</i>

375
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,884
Aren't you gonna ask
where the kids are?

376
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,753
They're at your mother's.

377
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,424
<i>How many kids do you have?</i>

378
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:50,470
- Three.
- Three.

379
00:31:50,537 --> 00:31:52,471
Isn't that right, Nick?

380
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,473
<i>As far as I know.</i>

381
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,270
- I've got seven.
- Seven?

382
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:58,277
- Seven.
- <i>Seven!</i>

383
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:00,779
- Seven kids.
- <i>That's what he said. Seven.</i>

384
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:03,247
Handsome, how many you have?

385
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:06,513
<i>Me? I got a bunch of 'em.</i>

386
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,520
<i>Let's see.</i>

387
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:14,154
I got Robert,
I got William.

388
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,661
I got, uh, Mary.

389
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,392
Um... -

390
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:21,832
I got Pee-Wee.

391
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:24,632
Um, I left one out.

392
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:27,229
Pee-Wee's 14.

393
00:32:27,307 --> 00:32:29,275
There's one more somewhere.

394
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:32,505
Um, I got John.

395
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,310
<i>That's a good Irish-Catholic boy, huh?</i>

396
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:38,317
<i>He's a good somethin;</i>

397
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:41,650
<i>You know, I've been noticing</i>
<i>that the neighborhood has a lot more kids.</i>

398
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,689
Did you notice that?

399
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:45,725
All up and down the street.
All up and down.

400
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,283
Little kids, baby carriages,
kids crawlin'.

401
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:52,322
What is that when there's a lot of kids?
Is that in the air?

402
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,333
- It's somewhere.
- Hmm?

403
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:56,995
I mean, you go eight, nine months,
you don't see a kid.

404
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,265
A couple years pass by, never see a kid.

405
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:02,934
All of a sudden,
I see a lot of baby carriages, a lot of babies.

406
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:05,409
- I think it's in the air.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

407
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,607
- No, the moon.
- What?

408
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:11,845
Yeah. Remember when
the two astronauts went up to the moon?

409
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:14,011
They went and played golf.
They played golf.

410
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:16,180
So, some of the dust came down.

411
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,816
"Stronzium" or, uh... -

412
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:23,023
Maybe the woman smell that.

413
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,842
The moon.

414
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,903
Ah, the moon.

415
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:50,679
No.

416
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:54,488
Listen, what I mean is you can go
eight, nine months, you won't see a kid.

417
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,997
- <i>Well, it takes that long.</i>
- No. I never see a kid a couple of years...

418
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:01,795
all of a sudden I see a lot of baby carriages,
a lot of babies.

419
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:03,859
<i>A couple of 'em gotta be mine.</i>

420
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,930
No, I think that's in the air.

421
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,000
- <i>Well, that'll</i> be... -
- No, think back nine months ago.

422
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:13,409
- There has to be some romance going on.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

423
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,414
<i>I don't know.</i>

424
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:18,110
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

425
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:21,579
No?

426
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,646
I think it's in the air.

427
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,763
- <i>Oh, ho, ho, ho.</i>
- <i>"In the air."</i>

428
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,200
<i>Well, that is where it is.</i>

429
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,962
<i>Well, that is where it is.</i>

430
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:36,161
<i>Billy, where's that?</i>

431
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:41,264
- <i>How about that, Billy?</i>
- <i>They was really gettin' down.</i>

432
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:28,777
Bravo! Bravo!

433
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,748
Bravo, Willie!

434
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:37,363
<i>Encore!</i>

435
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:38,451
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

436
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:42,052
Bravo! Bravo!

437
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:46,690
Word, word, word.
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Now a song from you, Billy Tidrow.</i>

438
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:49,291
No, I can't sing.
I can't sing a note.

439
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:51,633
<i>Well, come on and dance then.</i>
<i>Anybody can dance.</i>

440
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:53,639
No, that ain't too cool.

441
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:57,370
<i>I love this face.</i>
<i>I love that face.</i>

442
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:01,380
Nick, this is what I call
a really handsome face.

443
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,609
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- Okay. Come on. Let's dance.

444
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:05,617
- Nah, nah, nah.
- Look at this muscle.

445
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:08,518
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- I never saw such muscles.
I bet he doesn't fit in a suit.

446
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:11,648
- Yeah, I fit.
- <i>Mabel, you had your fun. That's enough.</i>

447
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,023
Come on. Come on.
Let's dance, Aldo.

448
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:16,585
- <i>Come on.</i>
- All right. Everybody's tired. That's enough.

449
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,133
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>You wanna dance?</i>

450
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,192
- <i>No.</i>
- Um... -

451
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:28,904
- Vito Grimaldi.
- <i>Get your ass down!</i>

452
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:23,855
Hello. Hi, Ma.

453
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,125
Hello, Mama!

454
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:29,532
No, we're not doing anything.
We're just eating.

455
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:32,400
What's the matter?
What do you feel?

456
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:34,838
Where? In your abdomen?

457
00:38:34,908 --> 00:38:38,139
What does that mean?
Did you call a doctor?

458
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:41,374
Look, Ma.
Don't get stubborn about doctors.

459
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,646
It's my mother.
She's got a pain in her abdomen.

460
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:01,824
Hmm. HO3-7399. So call them.

461
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:05,166
Ma, I can't call them.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

462
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:08,730
You gotta call 'em. You gotta explain to 'em
where the pain came from.

463
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,340
<i>Ma, did you eat somethin' bad?</i>

464
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:15,347
<i>You ate fish?</i>

465
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:17,576
<i>You ate fish in a restaurant.</i>

466
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:20,943
<i>What restaurant?</i>

467
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:25,721
You ate fish at Hamburger Heaven.
What did you do that for, Ma?

468
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,499
<i>Uh, thank you for the dinner, Mabel.</i>
<i>It was very nice.</i>

469
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:36,797
<i>You’re just like a baby. You know that?</i>

470
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,804
- Look, I'll be over.
- See you later.

471
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:40,965
- I'm comin' over. I'll be right over.
- Thanks for everything.

472
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
You want Mabel? Huh?

473
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,412
- All right. I'll be over.
- See you later, Nick.

474
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,674
- All right, darling. Comin' over.
- See ya, Mabel.

475
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:50,682
- Hey, listen.
- See you later, Nick.

476
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,843
- When your mother gets sick, boy...
- Take it easy.

477
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:55,786
It often comes to mind
they're not gonna last forever.

478
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,462
Yeah.

479
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:45,837
- Right.
- <i>I was trying to be nice.</i>

480
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:49,773
- Wacko!
- I like your friends.

481
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,833
I know it.

482
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:55,107
I'm a warm person. I was... -

483
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:59,447
- I know that.
- <i>I'm not one of those stiffs that you like...</i>

484
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,453
<i>with their noses up in the air.</i>

485
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,989
Bung, bung.
With their noses up in the air.

486
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:06,389
Oh, oh, how awfully nice.

487
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,223
Oh. Mmm. Thank you. Oh.

488
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:13,061
<i>I know how to treat those guys.</i>
<i>I want them to feel...</i> -

489
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:18,069
I love those guys. I love 'em.
I love anybody you bring in the house, Nick.

490
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:22,631
- I know that!
- I want 'em to feel comfortable.

491
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:26,770
I want 'em to feel... - They just sit there like
a bunch of... - I want to... -

492
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,908
What in the hell are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.

493
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:35,080
- <i>It was just the way you was lookin'...</i> -
- "Sit down, Mabel!"

494
00:41:35,154 --> 00:41:38,180
- "Sit down!"
- <i>Billy was looking at you this way.</i>

495
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:42,216
<i>He don't know you don't do any harm.</i>

496
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:45,025
It's the way the guy looked at ya.

497
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:47,396
Here's the guy.
He's looking at you like this.

498
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:51,369
He don't know what to do.
This monkey don't know what to do.

499
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:53,564
He thinks you mean somethin'.

500
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,631
He don't know you don't mean it.

501
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:04,072
<i>I don't mind you being a lunatic.</i>

502
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,084
Nicky.

503
00:42:07,086 --> 00:42:09,077
<i>Not lunatic.</i>

504
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,795
I didn't do anything wrong?

505
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:37,039
What, Nicky?

506
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:41,081
Nicky, tell me. Just... -

507
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:43,782
Nicky, don't be afraid
to hurt my feelings.

508
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,689
Tell me what you want me to... -
how you want me to be.

509
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:48,727
I can be that.

510
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:51,855
I can be anything.
You tell me, Nicky.

511
00:45:01,928 --> 00:45:03,862
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Pop.

512
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:07,489
What are you doing here?

513
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,161
- How did you get in here?
- <i>Through the window.</i>

514
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,900
Are Maria and Angelo here too?
My mother? Everybody?

515
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:18,239
Well, your father's trying to get
a little sleep. I mean, he's... -

516
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:20,973
Should I let them in,
or should I take the books and get out?

517
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:23,515
Oh.

518
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:29,351
- She goes crazy.
- Tony, come here.

519
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:41,600
- <i>Is everything all right?</i>
- <i>Couldn't be better. Come on in.</i>

520
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:43,658
<i>Come in and shut that door.</i>

521
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:57,816
Oh, Nick. I'm sorry to wake you up.
Really I am.

522
00:45:57,884 --> 00:46:00,478
Where's Mabel?

523
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:02,612
- Bathroom.
- <i>Is she angry?</i>

524
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:04,622
No, I think she's washing.

525
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,090
Oh.

526
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,150
My... -

527
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:13,097
They... - They worked you
awfully hard last night, didn't they?

528
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:16,293
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>That was a heck of a long shift.</i>

529
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:18,303
Mmm.

530
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:23,832
Well, I'll tell you. I'll go make you a nice cup
of hot coffee. How about that?

531
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,346
- No, darling. I'm gonna try and get some rest.
- <i>Hello, Ma.</i>

532
00:46:27,413 --> 00:46:29,779
Hello. Hi.

533
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:33,410
- Where are the kids?
- <i>Uh, upstairs.</i>

534
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:36,751
- Why are they upstairs?
- Uh, books. Uh, h-he had to come back... -

535
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:42,158
- Tony had to have his books.
- Didn't we take all of that last night?
We piled the whole car full of everything.

536
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:44,492
Could we have this discussion
in the living room?

537
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:46,531
Because I'm trying
to get some sleep.

538
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,295
No offense,
but I'd really like to get some sleep.

539
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:51,734
Sorry, sweetheart.

540
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:00,511
Guess what, Pop.

541
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:03,878
I just learned how to whistle
back and forth like this.

542
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,117
And I whistle with two fingers
stuck in my mouth.

543
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:14,850
- And I whistle lots of other ways too.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

544
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:16,519
You learn fast, Angie.

545
00:47:16,595 --> 00:47:19,120
<i>We're gonna watch the ball game</i>
<i>on TV tonight, aren't we, Dad?</i>

546
00:47:19,198 --> 00:47:22,258
- I don't know, Tony. I'm tired.
I'm trying to get some rest.
- How about it, Pop?

547
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,566
- How about what?
- How about my whistling? Can you do it?

548
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:35,711
<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>
<i>These kids are supposed to be in school.</i>

549
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:37,749
- Maria, get up. On your feet.
- It's okay.

550
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,650
On your feet.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

551
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,314
Come on. Maria.
Will you come on.

552
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:47,189
<i>Mama.</i>
- Don't call me Ma, Nick. My name is Mabel.
I don't like to be called Ma.

553
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:49,784
- Come over here anyway.
- N... - They've gotta go to school.

554
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:51,796
Come over here anyway.

555
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:57,368
All right, kids. Back in bed.

556
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,734
All you kids, back in bed.

557
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,370
Back up here.
All together now.

558
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,835
Come on now.
All together again.

559
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:14,219
"Jingle Bells."

560
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:18,789
No good whistling.
Just air, just air.

561
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:27,731
<i>Grandma, where are you?</i>

562
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,065
- Grandma, where are you?
- Grandma, where are you?
Grandma, where are you?

563
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:33,071
- <i>Is something wrong?</i>
- Grandma, in bed.

564
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:35,073
- No, I'm gonna make the coffee.
- In bed.

565
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:38,338
- You didn't want any,
but I'm gonna make some now.
- Come on. Everybody in bed.

566
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:41,744
- I just don't think I can.
- Come on, Grandma. In bed.

567
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:43,748
- Everybody in bed.
- I... - I'll just sit, Nick.

568
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:45,841
- You gonna come back with us?
- No.

569
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:48,409
Come on.
Here comes Grandma.

570
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:50,421
Here comes Grandma.
Here's Grandma.

571
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:52,423
- Hi.
- All right.

572
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:55,426
Hi, sweetheart.
How are all of you?

573
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:57,428
I'm glad to see you.

574
00:48:57,496 --> 00:49:00,124
It's a nice family, isn't it?

575
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:02,133
So, what'd you do last night?

576
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,294
Oh, we had fun.

577
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:08,204
We baked a cake,
and he rode his bicycle, and... -

578
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:10,708
I got a great idea.

579
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:14,007
When you get home from school,
we're gonna have a party.

580
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,710
We're gonna <i>talk</i> about terrific things, and we're
gonna do some very interesting, important things...

581
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:20,718
after you get back from school, okay?

582
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:22,981
- <i>But I can't find my darn books.</i>
- Well, uh... -

583
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:25,751
- I'll find 'em if it takes all my darn life.
- Yeah.

584
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:28,157
I'll be in the car.

585
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:30,286
- Mom, you gonna drive 'em or not?
- Sure.

586
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:33,160
- Sure, I'll... - I can take them right now.
- Okay.

587
00:49:33,232 --> 00:49:35,359
- I'll get 'em. We'll... - We'll go.
- Yeah.

588
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,494
- Oh, Nick, I'm so sorry... to wake you up.
- It's all right, darling.

589
00:49:38,571 --> 00:49:40,766
- No, it was nothing.
- Yeah, it... - it was something.

590
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,001
- You were trying to rest.
- Don't worry about it.

591
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:45,305
- Good-bye, sweetheart.
- Good-bye, darling.

592
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,311
- And sleep now and rest.
- Yeah.

593
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:49,438
She'll bring you the coffee later.

594
00:49:49,515 --> 00:49:51,449
- All right, darling.
- I won't do it again.

595
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:54,452
We're going to school now,
and I'm gonna take 'em.

596
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,216
- And we'll be gone so you-all can rest.
- Terrific. Terrific.

597
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:00,019
Okay. Bye.

598
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:02,390
Tony, come on.

599
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,397
Okay, kids. Chop-chop.

600
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:09,491
<i>Five, four, three, two, one,</i>
<i>zero, blast off!</i>

601
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:20,011
Hello?

602
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:23,641
Hello?

603
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:27,174
Nick, it's the city.
They need you.

604
00:50:27,253 --> 00:50:29,278
Tell 'em I'm not comin' in.

605
00:50:29,355 --> 00:50:31,516
He says he's not comin' in.

606
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,558
Tell 'em I'm not Superman!

607
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:35,890
What the hell
do they think I am? Superman?

608
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:37,952
He says he's not Superman.

609
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,362
<i>What the heck</i>
<i>do you think he is? Superman?</i>

610
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:46,666
What did you do? You hung up?

611
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:51,074
Oh.

612
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:53,270
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

613
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:57,042
After work I'm gonna
see my mother. I got the guilts.

614
00:50:57,116 --> 00:50:59,050
Okay.

615
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,212
You gonna be all right?

616
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:08,888
Why do you keep asking me that?

617
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:11,896
Think there's something
wrong with me or something?

618
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:14,194
That I'm wacko or something?

619
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:20,638
Boy, I can hardly wait
for the kids to come home.

620
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:26,475
All of a sudden I miss everyone.

621
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:28,513
I don't know why.

622
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,311
What time is it, please?
'Cause I'm waiting for my kids in school...

623
00:51:59,378 --> 00:52:01,369
and I don't know what time the school... -

624
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:04,814
Hey, you.
Hey, you've got a watch on.

625
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,817
Will you tell me the time?

626
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:09,115
I'll go get some of
those chains on your shoes.

627
00:52:09,188 --> 00:52:11,588
Big deal.

628
00:52:11,657 --> 00:52:15,388
Geez, Louise. Do you have the time, please?
'Cause I'm wait... -

629
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:18,760
Hey, listen, you birds.
I'm waitin' for my kids at school.

630
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:21,299
Do you mind giving me the time? Do ya?

631
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,369
What's the matter with you?
What's the... -

632
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,372
Do you have your tongues?

633
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,034
Big... -

634
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:35,531
Babies, come on.

635
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:38,201
Come on, babies.
Come on, sweethearts.

636
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:42,212
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

637
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,511
That's it.
Come on.

638
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,574
Vroom!

639
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,883
Okay, come on. Hey, sweetheart.
Hello, hello, hello.

640
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:54,187
How are you?
Mrs. Jensen's coming over with the kids.

641
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:56,227
I thought we'd have some fun.

642
00:53:57,296 --> 00:53:59,321
Maria, hi.

643
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:01,332
Thank you. Thank you.

644
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,334
Oh.

645
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:05,802
Go. Whoo-hoo!

646
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,143
Look who won.
Did you win, or did Angelo win?

647
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:21,744
Oh! Cheater.

648
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,922
Oh! Oh!

649
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:30,393
Whoo! Whoo! Oh!

650
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:35,356
Oh, I hope you kids
never grow up. Never.

651
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:40,837
You know, I never did anything
in my whole life...

652
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:43,466
that was anything
except I made you guys.

653
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,170
I made you and you and you.

654
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,839
Oh!

655
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:50,905
Oh, my head.
What a headache.

656
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:53,144
- Let me rub your back, Mom.
- Whoo! Help.

657
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:56,654
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
That feels good.

658
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:59,919
Why do hands feel so good?
Do you know?

659
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:03,291
Hey, listen, can I ask you kids
a question about me?

660
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:05,557
Huh? Can I?

661
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:09,328
When you see me, you know,
do you feel...

662
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:12,063
"Oh, I know her. That's Mom"?

663
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:16,233
Or do you ever think... -
I mean, do you ever think of me as, uh... -

664
00:55:16,308 --> 00:55:21,211
as, uh, dopey or mean or... - or, uh... -

665
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,942
No, you're smart, you're pretty...

666
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:26,041
you're nervous too.

667
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,587
Oh.

668
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:32,681
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

669
00:55:33,759 --> 00:55:36,455
Give me your hand here, would ya?

670
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:40,157
Hey, look at that. I didn't even know
what a big hand you had.

671
00:55:40,232 --> 00:55:43,133
- I play ball.
- Look at these lines.

672
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:46,365
Lookit.
I had no idea you had all these lines.

673
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:48,963
And you got a great big wrist.

674
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,477
- Boy. Hey, make a muscle for me, will ya?
- Ah, Ma, for Goďs sake.

675
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:55,980
<i>Please. Come on. Remember the way</i>
<i>you used to do your arm like that?</i>

676
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:58,516
Okay. There it is. Solid flab.

677
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:01,348
<i>Okay. Now let me feel it, huh?</i>

678
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,685
- Is that the best you can do?
- It's the best I can do, Mom.

679
00:56:04,756 --> 00:56:07,247
You see how good this whole thing is?

680
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:09,385
You see how good it is
we're talkin' like this?

681
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:13,363
- Do you see how good it is? Do ya?
- Hey, there's the Jensens' car!

682
00:56:13,432 --> 00:56:16,458
Oh, hey, come on. Inside. Come on.
Everybody inside. Let's go.

683
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:19,299
Come on. Come on, Maria.
Let's go. That's it.

684
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:23,072
Okay, take off your coats.

685
00:56:27,446 --> 00:56:29,505
Okay, keep down.
Keep down.

686
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,048
Okay. Okay.

687
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,110
Here they come.

688
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:41,284
Hello! Hello!

689
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,796
- Uh, I'm Harold Jensen. Uh, my son John... -
- Yeah, come on inside.

690
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:49,232
Don't just stand there on the outside.
This is a house where people come in. Hello, hello.

691
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:52,236
- My wife couldn't make it.
- Oh, yes. Well, I'm sorry.

692
00:56:52,304 --> 00:56:56,400
Tony, you know the kids.
And, uh... - And this is Mr. Jensen, right?

693
00:56:56,475 --> 00:56:58,409
<i>¿Cómo está usted?</i>

694
00:56:58,477 --> 00:57:01,344
- <i>He's speaking Spanish.</i>
- Bien, bien.

695
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:04,041
<i>Hey. Hey. How about that?</i>
<i>Do you want some tea?</i>

696
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:06,584
No, thank you.
I just thought I'd drop the kids off.

697
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:09,621
- <i>I have to pick up something</i>
<i>down at the stationers.</i>
- Ah.

698
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:11,815
- You're uncomfortable, aren't you?
- <i>Well, no.</i>

699
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,051
Yeah, you are.
Just a little bit uncomfortable.

700
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:17,926
Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on.

701
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,987
Hey, that's a nice ring.

702
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:23,364
Come on. Come on. A little smile.
Come on. Come on. Let's have some fun.

703
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:25,403
Hey, that's it. Come on.

704
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,200
Let's have a little fun.
You wanna play with the kids?

705
00:57:28,273 --> 00:57:31,436
<i>All right. Careful, Angela. Don't drop it.</i>

706
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,172
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

707
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:37,682
<i>Okay. That's it, Tony.</i>
<i>Put it right over on the table, honey.</i>

708
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,013
- Wow!
- What do you think, huh? Huh?

709
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:42,019
- <i>Wow!</i>
- Yeah.

710
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:46,023
Okay, put it right next to the punch.
Right on the table. Okay?

711
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,150
- <i>Okay.</i>
- That's it. Be careful.

712
00:57:48,226 --> 00:57:50,319
That's it. That's it.

713
00:57:51,897 --> 00:57:55,492
Terrific. Right there.
Bravo! Great.

714
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:01,495
Do you dance?

715
00:58:01,573 --> 00:58:03,541
Oh, that's too bad, because... -

716
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,702
Hey, kids, it's time to dance.

717
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:09,909
You see that? Once they get together,
they're not interested in anything.

718
00:58:09,982 --> 00:58:14,112
That's what you have to break. You have to break
through that and make 'em interested in things.

719
00:58:14,186 --> 00:58:17,678
In, uh, languages,
in singing, dancing.

720
00:58:17,756 --> 00:58:21,055
- Jokes even. Fun, everything.
- <i>Can I have my tea now?</i>

721
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,458
Oh, screw the tea.
What's the matter with you?

722
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:28,957
Hey, you hear that?

723
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:32,265
You don't believe in miracles?
That's <i>Swan Lake.</i>

724
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:34,396
That's perfect.
That's perfect!

725
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,738
Hey, kids. Kids. Girls.
This is <i>Swan Lake.</i>

726
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:39,777
You remember the dying swan?

727
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:42,143
Come on. That's... -
Come and die for Mr. Jensen.

728
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:45,342
Come on, guys. We'll be the chorus.
Come on. You take Tony's hand.

729
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:47,408
Here. Come on. Come on.

730
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,420
Come on. Tony. Come on.

731
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:52,423
We'll go around this way,
and we'll be the chorus for 'em.

732
00:58:55,494 --> 00:58:58,156
Come on.

733
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,926
Come on.
Die for Mr. Jensen.

734
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,933
Okay. Come on.

735
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:05,469
Come on, girls.
Die for Mr. Jensen. Come on.

736
00:59:05,537 --> 00:59:08,438
Come on, Maria. You know the dying swan.
Come on. Come on.

737
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,532
That's it. That's it.

738
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:14,545
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

739
00:59:14,613 --> 00:59:17,776
Bravo! Come on!
They just died for you. Come on.

740
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:21,945
Yeah. I love you too.
Hold on.

741
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,954
I'll get her.

742
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,013
<i>Mama, Pa's on the telephone.</i>

743
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:28,423
Well, tell him we're in the middle of a party.

744
00:59:28,493 --> 00:59:30,791
Okay. I'll tell him
you don't wanna talk to him.

745
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:34,059
<i>No. Don't tell him that.</i>
<i>That's not what I said. Wait a minute.</i>

746
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:36,362
<i>Here. I'll get it.</i>
<i>Never mind. I'll get it.</i>

747
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,702
Hello, Nick? Hello.
It's working.

748
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:43,536
Oh. I'm sorry.
I'm out of breath.

749
00:59:43,608 --> 00:59:47,009
It's working.
Listen, I'm a great mother.

750
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:49,445
I not only... - I not only love our kids...

751
00:59:49,514 --> 00:59:52,449
I love the Jensen kids,
I love Mr. Jensen.

752
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:54,781
Ah, they're all wonderful.
They're beautiful.

753
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:57,048
I'm never gonna be mean again. Never.

754
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,685
Yeah. Mr. Jensen. Oh, he was
such a stiff when he came over...

755
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,694
but I got him loosened up.

756
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:07,061
You know, I got him dancing,
and I got him singing.

757
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:09,965
- Hello? Hello?
- What's the matter, Mom?

758
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:16,864
Damn telephones!

759
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:26,183
Okay.

760
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,846
Okay, now we've got
one of two choices.

761
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:32,515
We can, uh, do our homework...

762
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,786
<i>or we could, uh, make costumes.</i>

763
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,794
Yea!

764
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:39,023
You want to make costumes? Okay.

765
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:43,056
All right. Maria, you take the girls up
and put on some eye shadow and lipstick...

766
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,603
and some of those crazy,
you know, costumes you do.

767
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:48,935
And, uh, Tony, you, um,
do the pirate thing...

768
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:53,239
with the... - with the patch on the eye
and some, uh, earrings and scarves.

769
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:55,802
You know which ones
I mean, don't you? Okay?

770
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:33,083
What's your name again?

771
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,711
- Harold.
- <i>Harold.</i>

772
01:01:35,787 --> 01:01:37,778
<i>Your first name?</i>

773
01:01:37,856 --> 01:01:39,790
Harold.

774
01:01:39,858 --> 01:01:42,349
Harold? Oh, you poor thing.

775
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:45,920
You can't name somebody Harold.

776
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,859
<i>Hey, would you dance with me?</i>

777
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:52,631
Hmm?

778
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,101
I'm worried about the kids... -
about leaving them here with you.

779
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,907
Which kids?

780
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,177
About the... - my kids,
leaving them here.

781
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,718
And the reason
I'm worried is that...

782
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:10,277
you've been actin' a little strange.

783
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:13,813
Uh, I... - I wonder if you've been
aware of that or not.

784
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:30,073
Who did all this? Where did all these... -
Who took all these clothes out?

785
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:32,701
- <i>Who did this?</i>
- Me.

786
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:35,507
<i>Who took...</i> - <i>You?</i>

787
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,639
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

788
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:39,775
<i>Why?</i>

789
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:43,412
Why? This is not your house.

790
01:02:43,488 --> 01:02:45,422
<i>Come on. Get up. Get up.</i>

791
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,549
Now get dressed!
Don't stand there! Get dressed!

792
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:50,094
Take this off and get dressed.
Come on.

793
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:52,356
Put it on.
Pick this all up now.

794
01:02:53,632 --> 01:02:55,759
Where's your brother John?

795
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:57,768
John.

796
01:02:57,836 --> 01:03:00,304
John.

797
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:05,576
Adrienne, take off those clothes.
Come on. We're going home.

798
01:03:05,644 --> 01:03:08,374
Daddy will help you dress.

799
01:03:08,446 --> 01:03:10,641
- John, where's your clothes?
- Downstairs.

800
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:12,740
- Go downstairs and get 'em.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:14,910
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Yes.

802
01:03:14,986 --> 01:03:16,977
I really wanted it to be nice.

803
01:03:17,055 --> 01:03:19,080
<i>I know you did.</i>

804
01:03:29,134 --> 01:03:32,433
Maria. Maria, where are you going, Maria?

805
01:03:33,638 --> 01:03:36,163
- Maria. Come here, Maria.
- Maria, come here. Come over... -

806
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:40,200
- Maria, come here.
- Please, Maria.

807
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:42,906
Why aren't you having
any clothes on, darling?

808
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,381
Who took your clothes?
This kid is naked.

809
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,078
All right, Mama. Come here.
Now, who took off your clothes?

810
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:50,178
Tell Daddy.
Who took off your clothes? Hmm?

811
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:53,520
Who took off your clothes?
Please tell Daddy.

812
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:56,253
- Mama.
- Who? Mommy?

813
01:03:56,328 --> 01:03:58,421
Mommy took your clothes off, darling?

814
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,192
All right. Come on.
We'll get some clothes on.

815
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,234
Hurry up.

816
01:04:04,235 --> 01:04:08,171
<i>All right. That's it.</i>
<i>Just...</i> - <i>Just leave her alone. Leave her alone!</i>

817
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,902
What the hell is goin' on here?
What are you doin' in my room?

818
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:14,207
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Get out!

819
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:16,213
Nick.

820
01:04:21,286 --> 01:04:23,618
See what you made me do? Huh?

821
01:04:24,689 --> 01:04:27,954
Having a party?
Get out of here.

822
01:04:28,026 --> 01:04:30,187
Take your kids and get out of here.

823
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,091
- John, where's your shoes?
- Upstairs.

824
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:39,762
Go up... - Go upstairs,
find 'em, put 'em on.

825
01:04:40,872 --> 01:04:42,863
<i>Adrienne, help pick this stuff up.</i>

826
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,200
Good. All right.
Come on. Clean up.

827
01:04:46,277 --> 01:04:48,643
<i>Forget about that.</i>
<i>Just get out.</i>

828
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:53,246
<i>Come on, honey.</i>
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

829
01:04:54,419 --> 01:04:56,853
John.

830
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:59,617
- <i>What?</i>
- John. Well, come on. Where's your shoes?

831
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:01,625
<i>I can't find 'em.</i>

832
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:03,752
Where you goin'?

833
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:07,127
Look, I'm fed up with you,
your kids, your wife and your whole family!

834
01:05:07,198 --> 01:05:09,189
I'm gonna get my kid!

835
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,436
<i>Ooh! Stop it!</i>

836
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:20,444
<i>Nicky! Nicky! Nicky!</i>

837
01:05:20,512 --> 01:05:23,743
- Mama, for Christ's sake!
- <i>You're gonna kill him! Stop!</i>

838
01:05:23,815 --> 01:05:26,784
<i>Get out of here!</i>
<i>Get out of here!</i>

839
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:30,150
- <i>Get out! I'll kill you and your kids!</i>
- John, come on.

840
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,553
Now get outta here
and stay on your side!

841
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:34,615
What the hell are you doin'?

842
01:05:34,692 --> 01:05:37,354
Get outta here!
What are you doin'? Get out!

843
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,627
<i>Is Dr. Zepp there?</i>

844
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:44,566
<i>Who's this?</i>
<i>Katherine, where's Dr. Zepp?</i>

845
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:49,299
<i>Well, I've been waiting. He's not here.</i>

846
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:53,104
<i>Well, where could he be, Katherine?</i>

847
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:55,146
<i>No, nobody's sick.</i>
<i>Mabel's crazy.</i>

848
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:57,147
<i>Where's Dr. Zepp?</i>

849
01:05:58,216 --> 01:06:00,707
- I mean, where is he, Katherine?
- He's on his way.

850
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:03,913
- Well, goddamn it, he's not here!
- Please don't talk to me like that.

851
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:07,287
I'm sorry, Katherine.
Now, could he stop off anyplace or what?

852
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:11,590
- No.
- I mean, is it gonna be five minutes
or 10 minutes? What is it gonna be?

853
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:16,228
Jesus Christ!

854
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:19,426
Jesus Christ!

855
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:28,212
Never mind.

856
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,770
Don't get up. Don't move.
You don't move.

857
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:35,685
Ma!

858
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:39,720
<i>Ma! Ma!</i>

859
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,658
<i>No. Just stay there, or I'll kill ya!</i>

860
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:47,022
Don't need your help!
Get my own cigarettes.

861
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:52,429
Don't need anybody's help.

862
01:06:52,504 --> 01:06:54,495
My own.

863
01:07:00,678 --> 01:07:03,238
You're gonna be committed.

864
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:05,544
Goin' to the hospital
until you get better.

865
01:07:11,756 --> 01:07:14,748
You just, uh... -

866
01:07:14,826 --> 01:07:19,092
You got embarrassed,
and you made a jerk of yourself. That's all.

867
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:26,926
I make a jerk of myself every day. I'm... -

868
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,707
<i>I'm not sore at you.</i>

869
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:42,345
<i>I mean, you hit me.</i>
<i>You never did that before.</i> L... -

870
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,322
<i>Didn't feel that, if that's what you...</i> -

871
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:48,325
<i>you feel bad about.</i>

872
01:07:48,393 --> 01:07:50,554
<i>L... -

873
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,999
I always understood you,
and you always understood me...

874
01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:57,057
and that was always just...

875
01:07:57,135 --> 01:07:59,433
how it was, and that's it.

876
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,900
"Till death do us part," Nick.
You said it.

877
01:08:06,978 --> 01:08:10,106
<i>Remember? He said, "Do you,</i>
<i>Mabel Mortensen, take this man?"</i>

878
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:12,615
<i>"I do." "I do,"Nick.</i>

879
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:14,652
<i>"I do."</i>

880
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,880
<i>Remember, I said...</i>

881
01:08:16,955 --> 01:08:19,048
<i>"It's gonna work</i>
<i>because I'm already pregnant. "

882
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:21,250
Don't let that mind
run away on you now.

883
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:23,556
<i>Remember how you laughed?</i>

884
01:08:23,628 --> 01:08:26,256
- Don't, Mabel.
- <i>Nick. You laughed.</i>

885
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,322
- Don't.
- <i>Don't you remember?</i>

886
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,234
<i>And he was mad as a big toad.</i>

887
01:08:33,304 --> 01:08:35,829
Don't do that.

888
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,898
Hey, don't be sad.

889
01:08:40,144 --> 01:08:42,112
I know you love me.

890
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,241
- Hey.
- <i>We had plenty of time</i>
<i>to find that out, didn't we?</i>

891
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,780
You and I know.

892
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:56,892
You see that, Nick?
That's how close we are.

893
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:00,362
And they can't pull us apart.
They can't force us apart.

894
01:09:02,634 --> 01:09:05,068
'Cause...

895
01:09:05,136 --> 01:09:07,127
we're together.

896
01:09:07,205 --> 01:09:09,537
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

897
01:09:13,778 --> 01:09:15,769
Don't say that, honey.

898
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:22,315
I'm not sore at you.
I'm not mad or anything.

899
01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:25,623
Mabel...

900
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,681
don't.

901
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:46,375
<i>You sit there and pretend you...</i> -

902
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:48,878
<i>All of that doesn't mean...</i> -
<i>And you know.</i>

903
01:09:48,946 --> 01:09:51,312
You know.

904
01:09:51,382 --> 01:09:53,316
It's us.

905
01:09:53,384 --> 01:09:56,012
- You're going with them out there on the outside.
- <i>Be still.</i>

906
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:59,352
- And we're supposed to be on the inside.
We were always there.
- Shut up!

907
01:10:00,425 --> 01:10:02,359
You little...

908
01:10:02,427 --> 01:10:04,588
teeny...

909
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:07,256
skinny, little...

910
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,323
<i>bug!</i>

911
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:33,753
<i>Nick. What's wrong?</i>

912
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:37,226
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>It's all over.</i>

913
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:41,655
Hello, Mabel.

914
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,569
Oh, Mabel.
Gee, you're beautiful.

915
01:10:49,907 --> 01:10:52,034
- Hello, Margaret.
- Hello.

916
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:55,102
- You look great.
- <i>How are ya?</i>

917
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:57,170
What's up?

918
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,980
Nobody here needs a doctor.

919
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:11,483
I had the hiccups a little while ago,
but I got rid of 'em.

920
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:15,799
What's up?

921
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,338
Has she been drinking?

922
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:23,340
Sure.

923
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,968
Oh, sure. I've been drinking.
This is a drink, huh?

924
01:11:26,043 --> 01:11:28,034
Sure.

925
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:33,146
Mabel, did you take a pill?

926
01:11:33,217 --> 01:11:35,777
Did you take any pills?

927
01:11:35,853 --> 01:11:38,014
- A pill?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

928
01:11:39,724 --> 01:11:41,715
Ah.

929
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:43,784
- Is morphine a pill?
- <i>Mmm.</i>

930
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:48,891
Sure, I've taken pills. I've...

931
01:11:48,966 --> 01:11:51,764
taken vitamin pills and, uh...

932
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:53,827
sleeping pills.

933
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:56,703
Uppers, downers, inners, outers.

934
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,571
What did you tell him, Mama?
That I drink?

935
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:03,637
Yes. You drink.

936
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:07,947
<i>Listen, Zepp.</i>
<i>L... - I am a little upset.</i> L... -

937
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:11,284
<i>That's why</i> l... - l... - <i>I act upset</i>
<i>a little bit, I guess...</i>

938
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:13,414
and I look upset, but...

939
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:16,359
occasionally I calm down.

940
01:12:16,427 --> 01:12:18,418
You do calm down.

941
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:21,898
I do have anxieties, though.

942
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:30,964
Don't let this woman in my house.

943
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:34,274
By the staircase.

944
01:12:34,345 --> 01:12:37,007
She's guarding that staircase.

945
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,572
Up above are my children
in my house.

946
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:42,619
This. This. This. This. That.

947
01:12:46,524 --> 01:12:49,254
<i>Mabel, what's troubling you?</i>

948
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:52,752
What trouble?

949
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,560
<i>Well, you said you were upset.</i>

950
01:12:55,633 --> 01:12:58,363
<i>Did you and Nick have a fight?</i>

951
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:09,672
Nick, I get... -
I get the idea there's...

952
01:13:09,747 --> 01:13:12,545
some kind of a conspiracy going on here.

953
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:16,685
I mean, you've been looking at me
so quiet-like and, uh... -

954
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,886
- He's got something in that bag.
- <i>Don't be concerned about this bag.</i>

955
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:27,556
He's going to try to imprison me
with something in that bag.

956
01:13:27,632 --> 01:13:29,896
- Don't be concerned about this bag.
- Am I right?

957
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:32,060
- Don't be concerned about this bag.
- Am I right, Nick?

958
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:34,730
Am I right, Nick?

959
01:13:36,474 --> 01:13:38,465
<i>Am I right, Nick?</i>

960
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:42,638
<i>Mabel, would you please</i>
<i>make me a drink?</i>

961
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:47,549
Ah!

962
01:13:47,618 --> 01:13:50,246
- You... - You want a drink, Zepp?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

963
01:13:50,321 --> 01:13:52,380
- You want a martini, Zepp?
- <i>Yeah. Mm-hmm.</i>

964
01:13:52,456 --> 01:13:56,085
- You wanna have a little fun?
You don't mind making a drink?
- No, I don't mind.

965
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,628
Nah! You want a drink, Zepp?

966
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:02,622
Okay.

967
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,999
The ice is in the kitchen and... -
and the vermouth is in the... -

968
01:14:08,806 --> 01:14:11,366
It's right past her.

969
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:15,940
Vodka. On the left there.

970
01:14:16,013 --> 01:14:20,040
You make the drink, Zepp,
and... I'll watch them.

971
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:23,814
<i>Doctor. Doctor, aren't you</i>
<i>gonna give her a shot?</i>

972
01:14:23,888 --> 01:14:26,152
No! No!

973
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,520
<i>Mabel, we're trying to help you.</i>

974
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,758
Is that what you're trying to do?

975
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:36,766
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Is that what you're trying to do?

976
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:39,462
- Is that what she's trying to do, Nick?
- <i>We're trying to help you!</i>

977
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:49,203
You be quiet.

978
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:53,463
for what?

979
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,524
There's no reason.

980
01:14:57,938 --> 01:15:01,271
The man's here on a call... - a social call.

981
01:15:01,341 --> 01:15:03,434
Nobody is sick.

982
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:11,212
Why are you so insecure?

983
01:15:11,284 --> 01:15:13,275
Hmm?

984
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:16,779
Everybody loves ya.

985
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,692
Do you love me, Nick?

986
01:15:25,265 --> 01:15:29,133
This woman... - This woman has to go!

987
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:31,136
- I love ya.
- Nick.

988
01:15:31,204 --> 01:15:33,365
- That's right. I love ya.
- Think of the children!

989
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,432
This woman can't stay
in this house anymore!

990
01:15:36,509 --> 01:15:38,443
You can't stay here!

991
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:41,412
- For Christ's sakes... -
- Listen. Doctor.

992
01:15:41,481 --> 01:15:43,415
- Doctor!
- Hey. Let go of me.

993
01:15:43,483 --> 01:15:46,145
- My son tells me stories.
- <i>Just don't grab my bathrobe.</i>

994
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:49,484
He tells me stories of the talk... -

995
01:15:49,556 --> 01:15:51,683
the small talk, the little things...

996
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:53,692
The insecurity.

997
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,490
- Mabel.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

998
01:15:56,563 --> 01:15:59,498
Tell me what your son says.
Go ahead. Tell me what he says.

999
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:02,399
- Go ahead.
- I'll tell you what he says.

1000
01:16:02,469 --> 01:16:05,097
- He says you give him nothing!
- Hey.

1001
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:07,401
- You're empty inside.
- <i>Ma.</i>

1002
01:16:07,474 --> 01:16:10,875
- Your children are naked! They're hungry!
- <i>Ma.</i>

1003
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:13,037
That's what he said!

1004
01:16:14,147 --> 01:16:16,445
Doctor.

1005
01:16:16,516 --> 01:16:19,144
Last night you brought a man in the house!

1006
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:22,686
My son is a good boy, Doctor.

1007
01:16:22,756 --> 01:16:25,452
He's a good boy!
He never says anything!

1008
01:16:25,525 --> 01:16:27,891
- He doesn't say anything!
- <i>I never said that.</i>

1009
01:16:27,961 --> 01:16:29,986
- <i>I didn't say that.</i>
- Margaret. Margaret.

1010
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:32,054
- This woman is crazy!
- Margaret.

1011
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:34,066
- Margaret.
- She's crazy!

1012
01:16:34,134 --> 01:16:36,432
- <i>Will you go upstairs?</i>
- Please, Margaret.

1013
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:38,437
- <i>Now, go upstairs.</i>
- Listen to me.

1014
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:41,997
- She's a grown person.
- I won't go... - I won't go upstairs!

1015
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:45,837
- She's a grown person.
- Doctor.

1016
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:48,642
- <i>Doc, take her upstairs.</i>
- She's a grown person. Please.

1017
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:53,584
- Doctor, she's crazy!
- She's an adult,
and I would like to talk to her. Please.

1018
01:17:08,168 --> 01:17:10,363
I have five points, Nick.

1019
01:17:10,437 --> 01:17:12,530
I figured it out, and... -

1020
01:17:12,605 --> 01:17:14,971
They're for me.

1021
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:17,805
- For us.
- <i>Mabel.</i>

1022
01:17:17,877 --> 01:17:20,175
One is love.

1023
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:23,439
Two is...

1024
01:17:25,618 --> 01:17:27,950
friendship, and three is...

1025
01:17:29,622 --> 01:17:32,090
our...

1026
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:34,388
comfort.

1027
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:36,452
And four is...

1028
01:17:40,967 --> 01:17:42,935
I'm a good mother, Nicky, and... -

1029
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:48,663
Mabel, I love you.

1030
01:17:50,877 --> 01:17:52,868
Um... -

1031
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:57,376
I belong to you.
That's it.

1032
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,918
Those are my five points.
That's what I... -

1033
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:02,250
I have five points. One.

1034
01:18:02,322 --> 01:18:05,120
F-Five... points.

1035
01:18:10,196 --> 01:18:12,460
Come here. Now listen to me.

1036
01:18:48,768 --> 01:18:50,929
Baby...

1037
01:18:52,505 --> 01:18:55,372
you know how I feel about you.

1038
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:58,638
<i>You're a great mother.</i>

1039
01:18:58,711 --> 01:19:02,169
<i>Take deep breaths.</i>
<i>Take deep breaths. I love you.</i>

1040
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:05,308
You've made me happy.
Take a deep breath.

1041
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:07,376
Take deep breaths.

1042
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:10,854
- And if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
- <i>Nick.</i>

1043
01:19:10,924 --> 01:19:13,290
- Nick. Nick, I need... -
- Sit down!

1044
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:16,157
I'll knock you right on your ass!

1045
01:19:21,734 --> 01:19:23,725
Mabel.

1046
01:19:25,371 --> 01:19:27,430
Baby.

1047
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:29,441
I love you.

1048
01:19:31,511 --> 01:19:34,912
<i>I'd like to give you a little sedative</i>
<i>to calm you down.</i>

1049
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:39,146
- <i>Please.</i>
- Relax.

1050
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,813
- Mabel, it won't hurt you.
- Doc.

1051
01:19:41,888 --> 01:19:43,856
- Hey, Doc, Drac, back.
- <i>Mabel.</i>

1052
01:19:43,923 --> 01:19:46,483
- Get back to your coffin. Get back.
- Mabel, this... -

1053
01:19:46,559 --> 01:19:49,027
- I will never hurt you.
- Back. Back!

1054
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:51,529
- Leave me alone.
- I won't hurt you.

1055
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:54,761
<i>My God, I'm part of this family.</i>
<i>Would I hurt you?</i>

1056
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:56,768
- <i>Mabel.</i>
- Back.

1057
01:19:56,836 --> 01:19:58,827
Mabel...

1058
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,200
this'll make you rest,
this little sedative.

1059
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:06,940
- <i>It'll calm you down.</i>
- I'm calm.

1060
01:20:08,348 --> 01:20:10,373
<i>You're</i> sick!

1061
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:13,544
You're sick. You need a rest.
Your eyes are terrible.

1062
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,781
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Lie down. Lie down here.

1063
01:20:15,855 --> 01:20:19,188
You're awful! You're sick!
Get a doctor for him!

1064
01:20:19,259 --> 01:20:21,989
He's a very sick man!
Get him!

1065
01:20:22,061 --> 01:20:23,995
- Get him! Get him!
- Mabel.

1066
01:20:24,063 --> 01:20:26,691
Mabel, you're gonna have
a nervous breakdown.
- No!

1067
01:20:26,766 --> 01:20:28,791
Get him away from... -

1068
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:31,564
- You must go to the hospital.
- Hospital!

1069
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:33,230
Don't, baby. Stop that!

1070
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:35,934
Nick! Nick! Don't let him! Please!

1071
01:20:36,009 --> 01:20:40,036
I... - I promise. I won't want anything.
Just let me stay in my house, please.

1072
01:20:40,113 --> 01:20:42,240
Nicky, I promise.
I don't want anything.

1073
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:44,647
I'll be... - I'll be content.

1074
01:20:44,717 --> 01:20:47,777
Please. Please, Nick. Please.

1075
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:50,084
- Okay.
- Okay.

1076
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,251
- Okay.
- What about my children?

1077
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,657
- What about the children?
- I love you.

1078
01:20:59,732 --> 01:21:01,791
- Can they go with me?
- I love you.

1079
01:21:01,868 --> 01:21:03,995
Please don't say no, Doctor, please.

1080
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:06,698
Listen, they need help.
They... - They need care.

1081
01:21:08,408 --> 01:21:10,501
- The children.
- All right, darling.

1082
01:21:10,576 --> 01:21:12,806
- Let them come with me because... -
- Listen to me.

1083
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:15,074
- No. They've gotta be protected.
- Listen to me.

1084
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:17,514
- I want to protect my children.
- I love you.

1085
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,608
They're subject to insanity.

1086
01:21:19,686 --> 01:21:23,144
- Try, baby. Stop that.
- Insanity, morning, noon and night.

1087
01:21:23,222 --> 01:21:26,055
- Stop talking.
- Morning, get up.

1088
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,253
Go to bed. Go to sleep.
That's insanity, isn't it?

1089
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:31,661
No. No. I'm gonna take 'em with me.

1090
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:34,825
No. No, I'm gonna take 'em with me
because I'm gonna protect 'em.

1091
01:21:34,901 --> 01:21:38,234
You understand me? They're mine,
and I'm gonna protect 'em!

1092
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,966
I love you!

1093
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,407
I love you. I'll lay down
on the railroad track for you.

1094
01:21:44,477 --> 01:21:46,638
If I made a mistake,
which I did, I'm sorry.

1095
01:21:46,713 --> 01:21:48,806
But so what?
What's the difference? I love you.

1096
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:51,076
- Now relax. Come back to me.
- <i>Nick.</i>

1097
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,084
- Relax and come back to me.
- <i>Nick.</i>

1098
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,144
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

1099
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:58,213
I'll kill ya!
Don't touch me.

1100
01:21:58,291 --> 01:22:01,454
You're not gonna make me.
Taking me anyplace.

1101
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:05,361
And you! You're gonna
let him take me. I'll kill... -

1102
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:08,059
Yes.

1103
01:22:16,342 --> 01:22:18,367
Nick, I need your help now.

1104
01:22:18,444 --> 01:22:21,004
<i>You cannot come in here!</i>
<i>Leave those children alone!</i>

1105
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,412
<i>Leave those children alone!</i>

1106
01:22:39,799 --> 01:22:42,791
<i>Please. You cannot take...</i> -
<i>Don't take the children.</i>

1107
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:45,167
<i>I'm not mad at you.</i>
<i>Please. I understand.</i>

1108
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:47,172
<i>Please, let me handle this.</i>

1109
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,333
- <i>I know, but...</i> -
- <i>Let me handle this!</i>

1110
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:52,537
<i>Mabel, be calm. Be calm, Mabel. Mabel.</i>

1111
01:22:52,612 --> 01:22:55,046
<i>Let me handle this. Mabel, please.</i>

1112
01:22:55,114 --> 01:22:57,639
- <i>Let me handle this.</i>
- <i>I understand you, Mabel.</i>

1113
01:22:57,717 --> 01:23:00,481
- <i>No, no. You can't have the child.</i>
- <i>Leave my mother alone.</i>

1114
01:23:00,553 --> 01:23:03,181
- <i>Let her take them.</i>
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1115
01:23:03,256 --> 01:23:05,486
- <i>Mabel. Mabel.</i>
- <i>Mabel, don't.</i>

1116
01:23:05,558 --> 01:23:07,549
<i>Where are my children?</i>

1117
01:23:07,627 --> 01:23:10,494
<i>Oh, Mabel. Oh.</i>

1118
01:23:10,563 --> 01:23:13,225
- Help!
- <i>Don't handle her! She's sick!</i>

1119
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:15,665
- Nicky, help me! Nicky!
- Please.

1120
01:23:15,735 --> 01:23:17,726
<i>All right!</i>

1121
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:19,499
<i>All right!</i>
<i>That's enough!</i>

1122
01:23:19,572 --> 01:23:21,540
<i>Please. Please.</i>

1123
01:23:22,542 --> 01:23:26,273
<i>Here. Here. Please, Nick. Nick.</i>

1124
01:23:28,081 --> 01:23:30,481
- <i>Please, children. Children.</i>
- <i>Mabel.</i>

1125
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,314
- Mabel, I gotta talk to you.
- <i>Please. Please.</i>

1126
01:23:33,386 --> 01:23:35,513
- <i>Let the child go, please.</i>
- <i>Please.</i>

1127
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,351
Mabel.

1128
01:23:39,425 --> 01:23:41,484
Mabel, look at me.

1129
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:43,756
I have a piece of paper here that says... -

1130
01:24:05,852 --> 01:24:08,150
Hey, what do you say, Nick?

1131
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:10,155
What time is it?

1132
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:13,158
- I heard you had some trouble at home.
- <i>Cut it out.</i>

1133
01:24:13,226 --> 01:24:15,387
What? Something to do
with the kids or somethin'.

1134
01:24:16,462 --> 01:24:19,158
I don't want anybody discussing my affairs.

1135
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,532
- All right, Nick.
- Is that clear?

1136
01:24:22,602 --> 01:24:25,366
Well, yeah. Yeah.
But I'm not the only one.

1137
01:24:26,506 --> 01:24:28,804
Don't discuss my affairs!

1138
01:24:30,776 --> 01:24:32,767
Well, all right, then. Okay.

1139
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,871
I'm sorry.

1140
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:52,127
- What are you bananas doin'?
- Hey, Nick. What's with you and Mabel?
What happened?

1141
01:25:23,229 --> 01:25:25,254
<i>Hey, Nick. What's the story?</i>

1142
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:28,459
Anything I can do for ya?
Anything Angie and I can do for ya?

1143
01:25:28,534 --> 01:25:31,833
I called your house last night. Tony answered.
He give you the message?

1144
01:25:31,904 --> 01:25:34,896
He said something about, uh,
Mabel being in a nuthouse. Is that right?

1145
01:25:34,974 --> 01:25:39,502
She got a screw loose. She needs some time, okay?
Is that what you want to hear, you asshole?

1146
01:25:39,579 --> 01:25:41,570
Ah, fuck off.

1147
01:26:03,035 --> 01:26:05,560
I gotta find another way to make a living.

1148
01:26:23,055 --> 01:26:25,785
- <i>Nobody say nothin' about Mabel.</i>
- Yeah.

1149
01:26:25,858 --> 01:26:29,885
<i>I'll be getting to work pretty soon.</i>
<i>Please don't say nothin' about Mabel.</i>

1150
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:43,632
Bring it on, baby.

1151
01:27:22,682 --> 01:27:25,116
You're a silent son of a bitch.

1152
01:27:26,252 --> 01:27:28,186
Don't give me that shit!

1153
01:27:28,254 --> 01:27:31,417
From the moment I got here, that's all
anybody's been talkin' about... - Mabel.

1154
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:36,753
Well, don't say you don't know
when you do know!

1155
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:38,854
<i>I didn't say I don't know.</i>

1156
01:27:38,931 --> 01:27:42,526
You goddamn Mexican Indian,
don't you walk away from me!

1157
01:27:43,769 --> 01:27:45,862
You got something to say to me, say it!

1158
01:27:45,938 --> 01:27:47,906
But don't you walk away from me!

1159
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:52,335
<i>Hey, he just went over!</i>

1160
01:28:53,139 --> 01:28:56,472
I want to stop off at my kids' school
and pick up my kids.

1161
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:58,510
Comes to mind, I don't know my kids.

1162
01:28:58,577 --> 01:29:00,511
I'm never with 'em.

1163
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:04,037
They're a little shook right now.
I want to take them to the beach.

1164
01:29:05,751 --> 01:29:07,742
You want me to go with ya, Nick?

1165
01:29:11,891 --> 01:29:13,882
I'll go with ya.

1166
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:24,562
- Thank you very much, Miss... -
- Miss Hinkley. I'm the school principal.

1167
01:29:24,637 --> 01:29:27,299
Where's Tony?
The other lady was gonna get him.

1168
01:29:27,373 --> 01:29:29,466
- Mrs. Flowers.
- What time is it?

1169
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:31,806
What time is it?
This dame don't have the time.

1170
01:29:31,877 --> 01:29:34,175
- It was 10:00 when we got here.
- Never mind. Here he is.

1171
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:36,646
<i>Tony.</i>

1172
01:29:36,715 --> 01:29:39,309
- What's up, Pop?
- <i>Tony, get in the back of the truck.</i>

1173
01:29:39,385 --> 01:29:41,319
- Are they going... -
- Take these two kids... - Yes.

1174
01:29:41,387 --> 01:29:44,220
Put 'em in the back of the truck.
Don't let 'em fall down.

1175
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,724
Put that safety bar up.
Stay by the back.

1176
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:49,784
- And no kidding around back there.
- Are they gonna be here tomorrow?

1177
01:29:49,862 --> 01:29:51,352
- Yeah!
- Oh.

1178
01:29:53,599 --> 01:29:57,126
Here. These should fit ya.
See if they're your size.

1179
01:29:57,203 --> 01:29:59,569
Whatever they are, I'll wear 'em, Nick.

1180
01:29:59,638 --> 01:30:01,765
Hurry up and get dressed.

1181
01:30:03,175 --> 01:30:05,609
And make sure you bring
a shirt and a sweater.

1182
01:30:05,678 --> 01:30:09,239
And a pair of shoes.
Nobody gets pneumonia when I'm the father.

1183
01:30:09,315 --> 01:30:11,306
Kids!

1184
01:30:17,857 --> 01:30:20,018
How's this, Pop?

1185
01:30:20,092 --> 01:30:22,026
Hello, Dad.

1186
01:30:45,784 --> 01:30:50,187
What a day, Nick. I haven't been
to the beach without my wife in 12 years.

1187
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:53,522
We used to live in the water
when I was a kid.

1188
01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:56,425
"Fish" they called me.

1189
01:30:56,495 --> 01:30:58,895
I was thin, see.

1190
01:30:58,964 --> 01:31:01,398
Lips all blue.

1191
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:04,527
Shakin'. I was always lookin' for girls.

1192
01:31:06,438 --> 01:31:09,339
My kids, they're all grown up now.

1193
01:31:09,408 --> 01:31:11,899
My brother, Marco,
he's a college graduate.

1194
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:15,543
Communist. Couldn't keep a job.

1195
01:31:16,549 --> 01:31:18,676
Too many big ideas.

1196
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:22,016
Reads too much.
I say let the girls read.

1197
01:31:22,087 --> 01:31:25,022
They love to read.
You know what I mean?

1198
01:31:27,459 --> 01:31:29,757
- Okay, let's enjoy ourselves, okay?
- Okay.

1199
01:31:29,828 --> 01:31:32,763
- Yes.
- I want to talk to my kids too.

1200
01:31:32,831 --> 01:31:35,732
Talk to your kids?
They never listen.

1201
01:31:35,801 --> 01:31:38,463
Why should they listen?
I never listened.

1202
01:31:38,537 --> 01:31:40,528
Did you listen?

1203
01:31:40,606 --> 01:31:43,166
- I mean, did you listen?
- All right. Right here.

1204
01:31:43,242 --> 01:31:46,006
Come on. Up here.
We'll plop down right here. Come on.

1205
01:31:46,078 --> 01:31:48,808
Come on. Come on.

1206
01:31:50,382 --> 01:31:52,373
Come on.

1207
01:31:54,687 --> 01:31:58,020
Hey, Nick.
I'm usually a lot of fun, right?

1208
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:01,457
But to see a guy like Eddie
fall and break all his bones... -

1209
01:32:01,527 --> 01:32:05,395
- Holy shit. I mean, what a fall.
- All right. Knock it off, will ya?

1210
01:32:05,464 --> 01:32:08,365
I mean, we're here to have a good time.
We're having a good time.

1211
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:11,267
We came to play with the kids.
So let's play with the kids.

1212
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:14,101
Otherwise we go home!

1213
01:32:14,173 --> 01:32:17,370
- Come here.
- You're right, Nick. I'm sorry. You're right.

1214
01:32:17,443 --> 01:32:19,934
Come on.
You wanna go play?

1215
01:32:20,012 --> 01:32:23,345
Come on. Let's go.
We'll go build... a castle.

1216
01:32:23,415 --> 01:32:25,474
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>What do you think? Here?</i>

1217
01:32:25,551 --> 01:32:27,542
<i>Right here.</i>

1218
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,683
Maria! Maria!

1219
01:32:35,694 --> 01:32:37,753
<i>Maria!</i>

1220
01:32:40,366 --> 01:32:43,494
Pack it. Pack it.
Dig deep and get the... -

1221
01:32:48,841 --> 01:32:50,832
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

1222
01:33:10,462 --> 01:33:12,396
<i>Hey, Nick.</i>

1223
01:33:12,464 --> 01:33:14,728
- You want a beer?
- <i>No. No beer for me. Thanks.</i>

1224
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,564
I'm going in the back.
I'm gonna ride with the kids.

1225
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,281
Can I have a taste, Pop?

1226
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:17,752
Sure. Here.

1227
01:34:18,931 --> 01:34:21,297
Not too much now.

1228
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:30,875
Okay, Tony. That's enough.

1229
01:34:30,943 --> 01:34:32,968
Can I have some, Pop?

1230
01:34:33,045 --> 01:34:36,537
All right. Just a sip.
Not like your brother.

1231
01:34:36,615 --> 01:34:38,606
Can I have some, Dad?

1232
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:42,110
All right.

1233
01:34:43,222 --> 01:34:45,690
Just a little bit.
Not too much now.

1234
01:34:46,959 --> 01:34:49,689
See, you gotta be careful
on a funny day like today.

1235
01:34:49,762 --> 01:34:51,821
We could all get too... - too drunk.

1236
01:34:52,865 --> 01:34:55,857
But, you know, a little beer, it's good.
You sleep like rocks.

1237
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:00,261
There you go, Tony.

1238
01:35:00,339 --> 01:35:03,331
- <i>Not too much now.</i>
- <i>Can I have some, Pop?</i>

1239
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:09,570
<i>That's enough now.</i>

1240
01:35:12,518 --> 01:35:16,284
I'm sorry I had to send your mother away.
I'm sorry for everything.

1241
01:35:48,554 --> 01:35:50,545
<i>Yahoo!</i>

1242
01:35:56,595 --> 01:35:59,029
All right. Now be careful.

1243
01:36:04,436 --> 01:36:06,700
Come here. All right.
Come on now.

1244
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,402
Can you walk?

1245
01:36:11,476 --> 01:36:13,467
All right. All right.

1246
01:36:13,545 --> 01:36:15,604
Get that stuff. All right.

1247
01:36:15,681 --> 01:36:18,343
- Get that stuff.
- <i>I'll put it here for you, Nick.</i>

1248
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:20,783
- <i>Let me put it here.</i>
- Get those things there.

1249
01:36:20,853 --> 01:36:23,321
All right. Okay.

1250
01:36:23,388 --> 01:36:26,118
Come on, darling.
Better get inside because...

1251
01:36:26,191 --> 01:36:28,386
you're gonna fall down.

1252
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,951
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

1253
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:34,726
- <i>You're coming to work tomorrow, right, Nick?</i>
- Huh? Yeah, I'll be there. Let's go. Up.

1254
01:36:52,784 --> 01:36:54,843
All right. Turn around, son.

1255
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,945
There we go.

1256
01:37:02,494 --> 01:37:04,621
Angelo, are you hungry?

1257
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:10,657
You don't want to eat?

1258
01:37:10,736 --> 01:37:12,795
I'm going downstairs.
I'm gonna grab something.

1259
01:37:12,871 --> 01:37:14,862
<i>You don't wanna come?</i>

1260
01:37:17,509 --> 01:37:19,443
Come on.

1261
01:37:19,511 --> 01:37:21,502
You and me.

1262
01:37:22,748 --> 01:37:25,012
You want to sleep.

1263
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,074
You banana, you.

1264
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:31,147
All right.

1265
01:37:31,223 --> 01:37:33,214
Good night, son.

1266
01:37:34,393 --> 01:37:36,384
What about you, Tony?
You hungry?

1267
01:37:38,263 --> 01:37:41,061
You wanna take off your clothes?

1268
01:37:42,434 --> 01:37:44,425
What? Do you feel dizzy?

1269
01:37:46,305 --> 01:37:48,603
You want to sleep, huh?

1270
01:37:48,674 --> 01:37:52,166
All right. All right.
See you in the morning.

1271
01:37:58,083 --> 01:38:00,483
Maria, you hungry?

1272
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:10,027
Well, listen, I'm goin' downstairs, and if you
wanna keep me company, you're welcome.

1273
01:38:11,763 --> 01:38:13,924
No?

1274
01:38:13,999 --> 01:38:15,990
Lay down on the bed with me.

1275
01:38:48,367 --> 01:38:50,892
Hey, Nick.

1276
01:38:50,969 --> 01:38:52,960
Come on.

1277
01:38:59,411 --> 01:39:01,402
Take your clothes off.

1278
01:39:03,081 --> 01:39:05,311
- Go ahead. Take off!

All right. I'm goin'.
You don't wanna come?

1284
01:39:49,661 --> 01:39:52,494
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, Eddie.</i>
<i>You sure you don't wanna come home?</i>

1285
01:39:52,564 --> 01:39:54,828
- <i>There's plenty of room there.</i>
- Nah.

1286
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,232
<i>All right.</i>

1287
01:39:57,302 --> 01:39:59,270
<i>All right. That's it?</i>

1288
01:39:59,337 --> 01:40:01,305
She'll follow you.

1289
01:40:07,779 --> 01:40:10,475
All right.

01:40:12,651 --> 01:40:14,585
Here's what we're gonna do.

1291
01:40:14,653 --> 01:40:16,883
She's gonna follow the truck... - Betty.

1292
01:40:16,955 --> 01:40:19,822
Now you follow Betty.
That way you'll get to the house.

1293
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:22,826
- All right. You all right here?
- Yeah.

1294

Oh, yeah! How are ya?

Jesus Christ!
You're a terrific kisser.

01:42:51,943 --> 01:42:54,810
- Thank you. Listen, darling.
- <i>You got a lot of people here.</i>

1321
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:57,848
There's nothing to drink here.
No wine, no beer, no Coke. Nothing.

1322
01:42:57,916 --> 01:43:01,215
Yeah. Uh, well, she had a lot of friends.

1323
01:43:01,286 --> 01:43:05,552
With Mabel coming home and all,
don't you think you ought to have
at least a little something?

1324
01:43:05,624 --> 01:43:08,184
- All right. I'll take care of that.
- All right, darling.

1325
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:10,524
Good thought, Nick.
Good thought.

1326
01:43:10,595 --> 01:43:14,326
<i>Hey, Nicky, baby.</i>
<i>How are ya, you little fruitcake?</i>

01:43:22,941 --> 01:43:25,136
Hello, Nick.

1331
01:43:29,914 --> 01:43:31,882
Nick.

1332
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:34,418
Dino's looking for you,
says he's got a message.

1333
01:43:34,486 --> 01:43:36,420
- What kind of message?
- I don't know.

1334
01:43:36,488 --> 01:43:39,582
- What's the message?
- He just said it's a message.

1335
01:43:39,658 --> 01:43:41,649
Good message? Bad message?

1336
01:43:43,395 --> 01:43:45,829
Where's my mother?

1337
01:43:45,897 --> 01:43:48,388
- Mama?
- Come over here.

1338
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:52,192
Come over here.

1339
01:43:56,641 --> 01:44:00,475
What is all this? Are you crazy?
Have you gone out of your mind?

1340
01:44:00,545 --> 01:44:04,641
Mama, we said we were gonna have a party
when Mabel came home, right?

1341
01:44:04,716 --> 01:44:08,049
What party? The family.
Only the family.

1342
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:11,384
What the hell kind of a party is this?
There's no Coca-Cola in the house.

1343
01:44:11,456 --> 01:44:15,256
- No wine, no beer, nothing.
- What are you talking about, Coca-Cola?

1344
01:44:15,327 --> 01:44:17,261
- Coca-Cola.
- <i>What's going on here?</i>

1345
01:44:17,329 --> 01:44:20,526
Hello, Adolph.
You're one of the family.

1346
01:44:24,836 --> 01:44:26,827
Nancy.

1347
01:44:27,906 --> 01:44:29,840
Hello.

1348
01:44:31,643 --> 01:44:34,510
- What are you doin' here?
- You called me.

1349
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:36,672
You told me to be here. Remember?

1350
01:44:36,748 --> 01:44:38,682
Eddie's not here.

1351
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,741
You know Eddie.

1352
01:44:43,121 --> 01:44:45,112
- <i>Oh, you came.</i>
- Yes.

1353
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:47,556
I love Mabel.

1354
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,520
I know you do.
I love Mabel.

1355
01:44:51,596 --> 01:44:53,928
You think this is all right?
All these people here?

1356
01:44:53,998 --> 01:44:56,466
- Yes.
- You don't think it's too much?

1357
01:44:56,534 --> 01:44:59,435
You really want to know what I think?
You're a shit.

1358
01:45:01,373 --> 01:45:03,705
You sent her away.
You could have picked her up.

1359
01:45:03,775 --> 01:45:06,471
It is too much.

1360
01:45:35,306 --> 01:45:37,570
Hey, Nick.
Can I talk to you a minute?

1361
01:45:38,877 --> 01:45:41,243
- Can I talk to you?
- What's the matter?

1362
01:45:42,947 --> 01:45:45,279
Look, I don't think I oughta stay here.

1363
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:49,616
I don't know Mabel, and I don't know too many
of the people inside... - especially their wives.

1364
01:45:50,622 --> 01:45:52,613
What do you think?

1365
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:54,681
Hey.

1366
01:45:54,759 --> 01:45:57,023
Everybody back inside!

1367
01:45:57,095 --> 01:45:59,393
You can't stand out on the porch!

1368
01:45:59,464 --> 01:46:03,093
<i>Surprise party!</i>
<i>Everybody's gonna be lookin'?</i>

1369
01:46:03,168 --> 01:46:05,102
Can't stand out there!

1370
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:08,003
Hey, you! Come on! Inside!

1371
01:46:08,072 --> 01:46:10,063
Let's do it right!

1372
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:15,002
- Nick, your mama has to talk to you.
- What about?

1373
01:46:15,079 --> 01:46:18,310
Nick, these people can't stay here.
They gotta go.

1374
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:21,216
All right. You do it!

1375
01:46:21,286 --> 01:46:23,220
- Okay. Okay.
- I know it's wrong!

1376
01:46:23,288 --> 01:46:27,748
I can't do it!
Can't tell 'em not to go... - to go.

1377
01:46:27,826 --> 01:46:29,760
- Okay.
- You do it. Go ahead.

1378
01:46:29,828 --> 01:46:33,161
- Okay.
- Mama, you want me to do it?

1379
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:35,290
- I'll do it.
- <i>Do it.</i>

1380
01:46:35,366 --> 01:46:37,357
Stop sweating.

1381
01:46:44,943 --> 01:46:48,208
Everybody, quiet.
Please, quiet.

1382
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:50,577
- Please, everybody.
- Quiet!

1383
01:46:50,648 --> 01:46:52,639
- Mama has an announcement.
- Hey. Shut up.

1384
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:55,709
- Shh.
- Quiet! Everybody, please.

1385
01:46:55,787 --> 01:46:57,755
<i>Shut up!</i>

1386
01:46:57,822 --> 01:47:00,188
Quiet in here, please.

1387
01:47:00,258 --> 01:47:05,218
Now, you know that Nicky loves you all.

1388
01:47:05,296 --> 01:47:10,598
I love you all. Now, you should know better
to come here on a day like this...

1389
01:47:10,668 --> 01:47:12,693
when Mabel's
coming out of the hospital.

1390
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:16,729
I'm not blaming you,
but I'm saying the girl'll be here any minute.

1391
01:47:16,808 --> 01:47:19,038
And you must go home. Immediately.

1392
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:21,101
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Please.

1393
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:24,876
Wait a minute. I want to
thank you all for coming.

1394
01:47:24,949 --> 01:47:29,750
Thank you very much. And I'm gonna give
my respect to Mabel from every one of ya.

1395
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:32,449
I'm sorry I got you over here,
suits and ties and... -

1396
01:47:32,524 --> 01:47:35,220
But Mama's right.
Just too many.

1397
01:47:35,293 --> 01:47:37,284
All right.

1398
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:42,092
<i>See ya tomorrow.</i>

1399
01:47:42,166 --> 01:47:44,157
Thank you very much.

1400
01:47:44,235 --> 01:47:46,294
Thank you very much.

1401
01:47:46,371 --> 01:47:48,339
<i>Bye-bye. Bye-bye.</i>

1402
01:47:48,406 --> 01:47:50,397
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1403
01:47:50,475 --> 01:47:52,466
I'll go get the car, okay?

1404
01:48:02,854 --> 01:48:06,017
If you don't wanna go, don't go.
But I'm saying if you wanna come, come.

1405
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:08,024
Yeah, I'll come.

1406
01:48:08,092 --> 01:48:10,583
Let's go have a drink. Come on.

1407
01:48:10,662 --> 01:48:12,892
Come on and have a drink.
We'll see you later.

1408
01:48:12,964 --> 01:48:14,955
- Thanks a lot, Nick.
- Okay, Nick.

1409
01:48:18,736 --> 01:48:20,670
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye-bye.

1410
01:48:20,738 --> 01:48:23,468
- Are you getting the car?
- Good night, Nick.

1411
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:25,475
Bye-bye.

1412
01:48:27,545 --> 01:48:29,479
- <i>Arrivederci.</i>
- <i>Arrivederci.</i>

1413
01:48:30,615 --> 01:48:32,606
<i>Take care, Gino.</i>

1414
01:48:47,165 --> 01:48:49,156
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- All right.

1415
01:48:49,233 --> 01:48:51,463
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1416
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:25,592
<i>Hey, Nick. Hey, Nick.</i>

1417
01:49:30,808 --> 01:49:34,300
Hello, Mabel.
How are ya, sweetie? Take care, honey.

1418
01:49:34,379 --> 01:49:36,540
Anytime. Whenever you want.
I'll pick you up.

1419
01:49:36,614 --> 01:49:38,582
- You will love it.
- See ya, honey.

1420
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:41,141
Hi, Mabel. I know you don't know me...

1421
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:43,585
<i>But I'm a friend of, uh, Nick's.</i>

1422
01:49:43,655 --> 01:49:45,782
<i>Vito. You know Vito. Grimaldi.</i>

1423
01:49:45,857 --> 01:49:47,791
<i>I'm Mary, his wife.</i>

1424
01:49:47,859 --> 01:49:50,191
<i>And if you...</i> -
<i>Anything you need, just let me know.</i>

1425
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:52,252
<i>Please let me know.</i>

1426
01:49:53,297 --> 01:49:57,393
<i>It's really wet out here.</i>
<i>Oh, Mabel, darling. You look wonderful.</i>

1427
01:49:57,468 --> 01:50:00,369
<i>God love ya. You look terrific.</i>
<i>I love you, sweetheart.</i>

1428
01:50:00,438 --> 01:50:03,566
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- How are ya?

1429
01:50:42,547 --> 01:50:44,742
<i>Boy. Phew.</i>

1430
01:50:51,656 --> 01:50:55,387
Mabel. You look fine.

1431
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:58,020
Rested.

1432
01:50:58,096 --> 01:51:01,224
I'm so happy to see you, darling.

1433
01:51:01,299 --> 01:51:03,927
Oh!

1434
01:51:04,001 --> 01:51:07,232
Are you hungry?
Would you want something to eat?

1435
01:51:07,305 --> 01:51:09,239
- No.
- No?

1436
01:51:09,307 --> 01:51:12,071
Well, will you say hel... -
your hellos to everybody?

1437
01:51:12,143 --> 01:51:14,373
- You saw Nick?
- Here are all the people.

1438
01:51:14,445 --> 01:51:17,437
- Nick.
- I'm very happy to see you, Mabel.

1439
01:51:18,449 --> 01:51:20,440
Must have been hard.

1440
01:51:20,518 --> 01:51:23,316
I'm sorry to have been the one
to have done the committing.

1441
01:51:23,387 --> 01:51:25,548
- I know.
- But I know that you know...

1442
01:51:25,623 --> 01:51:27,557
that it was the best thing.

1443
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:29,616
So I hope we can be friends again.

1444
01:51:29,694 --> 01:51:31,719
Don't talk about the past, Doctor.

1445
01:51:31,796 --> 01:51:33,730
<i>Hello, Mabel.</i>

1446
01:51:33,798 --> 01:51:37,029
<i>It's Tina. Hi, Mabel.</i>
<i>You look great. Great.</i>

1447
01:51:37,101 --> 01:51:41,299
The children have been fine. No calls, no fever.

1448
01:51:41,372 --> 01:51:44,864
- Hello, Mabel.
- Mama's good, and Nicky's always healthy.

1449
01:51:44,942 --> 01:51:47,911
You look wonderful.
Just wonderful.

1450
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:50,675
And we're happy to see you again...

1451
01:51:50,748 --> 01:51:55,549
and let us all
cut our welcoming speeches short...

1452
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,815
because I'm very, very hungry...

1453
01:51:57,889 --> 01:52:01,290
and I'm sure you must be hungry too.

1454
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:03,725
Okay, Adolph.
We're all going to eat.

1455
01:52:03,795 --> 01:52:05,729
<i>You look great.</i>
<i>You really look good.</i>

1456
01:52:05,797 --> 01:52:08,960
<i>How do you do? I'm Mabel's mother.</i>
- You look good. God, you look sexy.

1457
01:52:09,033 --> 01:52:12,025
- <i>And this is her father George.</i>
- <i>She looks wonderful.</i>

1458
01:52:12,103 --> 01:52:14,333
- <i>She does look wonderful.</i>
- Oh.

1459
01:52:14,405 --> 01:52:16,396
<i>Very, very good.</i>

1460
01:52:17,575 --> 01:52:20,237
<i>And we'll go to lunch, or go to a movie, huh?</i>

1461
01:52:20,311 --> 01:52:23,337
- <i>We'll go, right? Okay?</i>
- <i>I could use a nice, hot cup of coffee.</i>

1462
01:52:23,414 --> 01:52:25,348
<i>And I'm sure that you are, like me...</i>

1463
01:52:25,416 --> 01:52:27,714
- All right?
- <i>a man of breeds...</i>

1464
01:52:27,785 --> 01:52:29,810
<i>that is hungry.</i>

1465
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:31,946
<i>Let's see if we can find a cup of coffee.</i>

1466
01:52:32,023 --> 01:52:34,457
<i>Of course you're hungry.</i>
<i>We'll do something about that.</i>

1467
01:52:34,525 --> 01:52:38,757
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
- <i>I don't think the young people</i>
<i>think enough about how important food is.</i>

1468
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,298
- Could I see the children?
- <i>They go about eating like birds.</i>

1469
01:52:41,365 --> 01:52:44,630
Why don't you wait a minute?
You go in there, they're gonna start to cry...

1470
01:52:44,702 --> 01:52:47,694
and you're gonna start to cry,
and everybody's gonna get so emotional.

1471
01:52:47,772 --> 01:52:51,264
- I think it's better. Sweetie.
- I've gotta see the children now.

1472
01:52:51,342 --> 01:52:53,367
- Yes. You can see them.
- Where are they?

1473
01:52:53,444 --> 01:52:56,277
They're in there.
Go ahead, dear. Go in.

1474
01:52:57,782 --> 01:53:01,309
<i>Why shouldn't she see the children?</i>
- <i>You do think she looks good?</i>

1475
01:53:03,855 --> 01:53:06,187
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1476
01:53:07,692 --> 01:53:09,683
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1477
01:53:10,828 --> 01:53:12,819
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1478
01:53:14,065 --> 01:53:16,056
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

1479
01:53:20,705 --> 01:53:23,902
- <i>I love you, Mama.</i>
- Okay. Enough now.

1480
01:53:27,378 --> 01:53:29,312
I'm sorry.

1481
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:31,746
<i>Is everything okay, Mom?</i>

1482
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:35,542
Yes.

1483
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:42,588
It's just been such a long time.

1484
01:53:50,201 --> 01:53:52,431
Oh, hello, banana.

1485
01:53:54,772 --> 01:53:56,740
Hello, my little banana.
How are ya?

1486
01:53:56,807 --> 01:53:58,832
<i>I missed you.</i>

1487
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:00,901
<i>Where's Maria?</i>

1488
01:54:02,813 --> 01:54:04,838
Maria, come on over here
and see me.

1489
01:54:04,916 --> 01:54:07,077
You want me to come over to you?

1490
01:54:07,151 --> 01:54:10,518
- If you want to.
- You want me?

1491
01:54:10,588 --> 01:54:12,954
If you want to.

1492
01:54:13,024 --> 01:54:15,959
All right.
I'll just stay here then.

1493
01:54:20,631 --> 01:54:22,622
<i>Are you feeling better, Mom?</i>

1494
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:24,930
<i>Haven't got any more stomachaches?</i>

1495
01:54:25,002 --> 01:54:27,129
<i>I mean, haven't got any more headaches?</i>

1496
01:54:28,572 --> 01:54:33,373
<i>No.</i> L... - <i>I'm just trying very hard</i>
<i>not to get excited.</i>

1497
01:54:42,186 --> 01:54:44,416
Okay.

1498
01:54:44,488 --> 01:54:48,219
No emotions now.
I really want to be calm.

1499
01:54:48,292 --> 01:54:50,283
<i>I really did miss...</i> -

1500
01:54:52,763 --> 01:54:56,130
- That's enough now.
- <i>Are you tired or anything?</i>

1501
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,191
<i>You look great, Mom.</i>
<i>How are ya?</i>

1502
01:54:58,269 --> 01:55:01,500
I'm gonna kiss your hand.

1503
01:55:01,572 --> 01:55:04,040
<i>How you...</i> -
<i>Did you miss us?</i>

1504
01:56:02,366 --> 01:56:04,493
- Oh, Doc.
- Oh. No, it's... -

1505
01:56:04,568 --> 01:56:07,799
- Gee, I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

1506
01:56:07,872 --> 01:56:10,807
No, I pulled the chair out,
and I thought you saw me.

1507
01:56:13,778 --> 01:56:16,144
Look, hon.

1508
01:56:16,213 --> 01:56:21,276
Everybody is having a good time here,
but I think we should leave you alone...

1509
01:56:21,352 --> 01:56:23,343
so that you can relax.

1510
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:28,181
You're staying for dinner.

1511
01:56:29,193 --> 01:56:31,661
I would stay for dinner...

1512
01:56:31,729 --> 01:56:34,562
but, uh, uh, it's unbelievable.

1513
01:56:34,632 --> 01:56:37,032
If you're gonna have spaghetti,
I can't stay.

1514
01:56:37,101 --> 01:56:39,729
- George.
- I can't stay because I can't eat it.

1515
01:56:39,804 --> 01:56:42,068
- Sit down!
- No offense. I just don't like spaghetti.

1516
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,107
- I'm not a spaghetti man.
- Sit down, George!

1517
01:56:44,175 --> 01:56:46,735
- Don't you tell me to sit down!
- Dad.

1518
01:56:48,813 --> 01:56:50,804
Hey.

1519
01:56:54,552 --> 01:56:56,543
Come on.

1520
01:56:59,457 --> 01:57:01,789
I'll sit down here with you, Dad.

1521
01:57:01,859 --> 01:57:04,589
You can sit anywhere you like, hon.

1522
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:13,063
I'm very happy to see my family.

1523
01:57:19,543 --> 01:57:21,568
Do I look pretty, Dad?

1524
01:57:21,645 --> 01:57:23,670
You look beautiful, hon.

1525
01:57:28,285 --> 01:57:31,015
- You think I'm gonna be all right?
- You're gonna be fine.

1526
01:57:32,022 --> 01:57:34,013
Just fine.

1527
01:58:05,156 --> 01:58:07,886
Mabel, honey.

1528
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:11,291
Why don't you go over
and sit with your mother?

1529
01:58:11,362 --> 01:58:13,353
Go sit with your mother, hon.

1530
01:58:29,847 --> 01:58:31,815
Come on. Excuse us for a minute.

1531
01:58:31,882 --> 01:58:34,350
Come on. Don't worry.
It's all right.

1532
01:58:41,325 --> 01:58:44,726
- I'm with you. There's nothing you can do wrong.
- <i>I don't know what to do.</i>

1533
01:58:44,795 --> 01:58:47,320
- There's nothing you can do wrong.
- <i>I don't know what you want.</i>

1534
01:58:47,398 --> 01:58:49,923
I just want you to be yourself.
This is your house.

1535
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,663
- The hell with them: Up theirs! The hell with them:
- <i>don 't know what</i> to... - <i>can 't.</i>

1536
01:58:53,737 --> 01:58:56,069
- Just be yourself. Be yourself.
- Can't.

1537
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:59,405
<i>Come on.</i>

1538
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,654
Be happy. Come on.

1539
01:59:11,722 --> 01:59:13,713
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

1540
01:59:14,992 --> 01:59:17,552
<i>Come on.</i>

1541
01:59:17,628 --> 01:59:19,994
<i>That's right. That-a-girl.</i>

1542
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,965
<i>Look.</i>

1543
01:59:24,535 --> 01:59:27,732
<i>Ba! Ba! Ba!</i>
<i>That's it, huh?</i>

1544
01:59:37,915 --> 01:59:40,042
<i>All right. Give me a "ba-ba."</i>

1545
01:59:40,117 --> 01:59:42,176
Ba-ba.

1546
01:59:42,253 --> 01:59:44,312
<i>Give me another "ba-ba."</i>

1547
01:59:44,388 --> 01:59:46,322
Ba-ba.

1548
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:48,654
- Give me a better "ba-ba."
- Ba-ba.

1549
01:59:48,726 --> 01:59:51,217
No! A real "ba-ba."

1550
01:59:51,295 --> 01:59:53,786
Come on.

1551
02:00:12,249 --> 02:00:15,446
All right. Everybody in the dining room.
We're gonna have a party.

1552
02:00:15,519 --> 02:00:17,453
Come on.

1553
02:00:17,521 --> 02:00:20,581
Come on. Come on.
Let's make it like a house. Come on.

1554
02:00:20,658 --> 02:00:22,683
Let's enjoy ourselves.

1555
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:24,694
Let's have a little warmth here.

1556
02:00:24,762 --> 02:00:26,696
Tina, you ready?
We're ready.

1557
02:00:26,764 --> 02:00:28,698
Go on in, Doc. Come on.

1558
02:00:28,766 --> 02:00:31,166
- Mama, talk to the people. Be a host.
- Okay, okay.

1559
02:00:31,502 --> 02:00:33,163
- Hi. Hi, Zepp.
- Hi.

1560
02:00:33,237 --> 02:00:35,569
- Hi, Dr. Zepp!
- Hello, Tony.

1561
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:38,233
- Hi. Hi, Tony.
- Hi!

1562
02:00:40,144 --> 02:00:42,738
- Hi, Maria.
- Hi, Angelo.

1563
02:00:44,214 --> 02:00:46,409
Hello, sweetheart.

1564
02:00:46,483 --> 02:00:48,474
Hi, Maria.

1565
02:00:48,552 --> 02:00:51,180
- Okay.
- Hello, darling.

1566
02:00:51,255 --> 02:00:55,089
- I'll get this one, Dr. Zepp.
- Sure, sweetheart.

1567
02:00:55,159 --> 02:00:57,093
- I... - I... -
- She's a great helper.

1568
02:00:57,161 --> 02:01:00,597
- <i>Maybe they need water.</i>
- I think so.

1569
02:01:00,664 --> 02:01:02,791
- Here.
- Here's a chair. Here.

1570
02:01:02,866 --> 02:01:05,266
Have you got a chair?
You're a good girl.

1571
02:01:05,336 --> 02:01:07,827
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

1572
02:01:09,073 --> 02:01:11,132
<i>Everybody sit down.</i>

1573
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:13,574
- Here's another chair.
- Adolph, you sit here.

1574
02:01:13,644 --> 02:01:15,635
There you are.

1575
02:01:15,713 --> 02:01:17,647
Thank you.

1576
02:01:17,715 --> 02:01:19,649
Can I help you out, Maria?

1577
02:01:19,717 --> 02:01:22,151
- I'll get here. You get over there.
- Zepp, you're here.

1578
02:01:22,219 --> 02:01:25,313
- Thank you.
- Watch your bag.

1579
02:01:25,389 --> 02:01:27,448
Mabel.

1580
02:01:27,524 --> 02:01:29,719
<i>Thank you, Tony.</i>

1581
02:01:29,793 --> 02:01:31,727
- All right.
- All right. Here we are.

1582
02:01:31,795 --> 02:01:36,630
Tina, we're ready.
Stop acting like strangers. All right.

1583
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,430
So, what was it like up there? Terrible?

1584
02:01:39,503 --> 02:01:41,494
Good? Bad? What?

1585
02:01:50,381 --> 02:01:52,372
Everybody's here.

1586
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,911
Seems like a party.

1587
02:02:02,292 --> 02:02:05,125
You should have seen it before.
We had 60 people here.

1588
02:02:05,195 --> 02:02:08,562
- Nobody thought it was a good idea
to have a lot of people...
- That's right.

1589
02:02:08,632 --> 02:02:10,998
But I thought it was a good idea.

1590
02:02:11,068 --> 02:02:13,400
'Cause I think friends are a good idea.

1591
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:15,734
And good times are a good idea.

1592
02:02:15,806 --> 02:02:17,740
- Right, Zepp?
- Right on.

1593
02:02:17,808 --> 02:02:20,276
- Right, Adolph?
- Absolutely so.

1594
02:02:20,344 --> 02:02:23,040
You see?

1595
02:02:23,113 --> 02:02:26,173
I mean, uh, no sense
talking about the past.

1596
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,343
The past is the past.
That's dead.

1597
02:02:28,419 --> 02:02:30,387
Forget about that.

1598
02:02:30,454 --> 02:02:32,445
Good times from now on.

1599
02:02:33,524 --> 02:02:35,458
That's what we're gonna have.

1600
02:02:35,526 --> 02:02:37,756
Things are gonna get
better and better and better...

1601
02:02:37,828 --> 02:02:40,797
and then they'll get better than that,
and then they'll get better.

1602
02:02:40,864 --> 02:02:42,923
Yea!

1603
02:02:47,137 --> 02:02:49,503
Tony, did you see that?

1604
02:02:49,573 --> 02:02:51,632
Did you see your mother wink at me?

1605
02:02:56,980 --> 02:03:00,006
- Could I have a cup of tea?
- <i>Yes, dear.</i>

1606
02:03:00,083 --> 02:03:03,382
<i>Tina's preparing some things</i>
<i>in the kitchen, if you'd like.</i>

1607
02:03:03,454 --> 02:03:05,445
I'm gonna go in there a minute.

1608
02:03:25,242 --> 02:03:28,575
Zepp, uh, do you think she's all right?

1609
02:03:28,645 --> 02:03:32,103
- She's a little crazy in... -
- Oh, Mama.

1610
02:03:32,182 --> 02:03:35,845
- The girl's fine.
- They gave her a release, you know. They gave... -

1611
02:03:35,919 --> 02:03:38,979
- Ma, but did you see her wink at me?
- Yeah, I saw her.

1612
02:03:39,056 --> 02:03:41,718
- But something in her eyes, you know.
- <i>Tina!</i>

1613
02:03:41,792 --> 02:03:44,784
- Oh, no, don't. Don't.
- <i>You're so fat!</i>

1614
02:03:44,862 --> 02:03:50,425
- <i>My God, girl!</i>
<i>You were 120 pounds when I left.</i>
- All right, Mama. That's enough.

1615
02:03:50,501 --> 02:03:54,062
<i>You were...</i> - <i>What happ...</i> -
<i>How did you get so fat?</i>

1616
02:03:54,137 --> 02:03:58,403
<i>Oh, Tina, you've gotta go to one of those places</i>
<i>and take some of that off.</i>

1617
02:03:58,475 --> 02:04:02,036
<i>Look at your ass, Tina!</i>
<i>Oh, my God, Tina!</i>

1618
02:04:02,112 --> 02:04:04,910
<i>That's fantastic! That's...</i> -
<i>Did they see...</i> -

1619
02:04:04,982 --> 02:04:08,543
Did you see Tina's ass?
Nick, that ass is as... -

1620
02:04:08,619 --> 02:04:11,486
I've never seen anything so... -
Oh. Tha... -

1621
02:04:11,555 --> 02:04:16,390
Her ass is this big, Nick. And when
I went away it was... - it was this big.

1622
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:19,327
Did you see that ass?
Did you see it?

1623
02:04:19,396 --> 02:04:22,126
You can hurt Tina's feelings
by talking about her ass.

1624
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:24,827
It's okay. I do have a big ass.

1625
02:04:27,838 --> 02:04:29,772
I wish I had some.

1626
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,276
Well, there's nothing like 'em.
They're all beautiful. Fat or small.

1627
02:04:33,343 --> 02:04:36,437
- Don't worry about the asses.
- Can I have some water?

1628
02:04:36,513 --> 02:04:40,108
Mabel. I've got a big ass.
She has a big ass.

1629
02:04:40,183 --> 02:04:42,708
Mommy has a big... -
We all have big asses. So what?

1630
02:04:42,786 --> 02:04:45,619
Did you hear that? Isn't she a bitch?

1631
02:04:45,689 --> 02:04:49,284
- <i>Aunt Betty has got a small one.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I wish I had some ass.</i>

1632
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:53,125
I... - I wish... -
I wish you'd all... go home.

1633
02:04:53,196 --> 02:04:57,496
<i>Oh, we came for a party.</i>
<i>We'd like to stay for a party.</i>

1634
02:04:57,568 --> 02:05:00,560
- Nick and I want to go to bed together.
- <i>Oh, Mabel.</i>

1635
02:05:00,637 --> 02:05:04,801
Mabel, calm down.
- Mabel, darling, the children are here.
Don't talk like that.

1636
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:07,639
- Calm down, Mabel.
- Let me... - Let me start over.

1637
02:05:08,679 --> 02:05:10,670
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

1638
02:05:10,747 --> 02:05:12,681
- Hello, uh, Mama.
- That's better. That's better.

1639
02:05:12,749 --> 02:05:14,740
Hello, darling.
Now, take it easy, won't you?

1640
02:05:14,818 --> 02:05:17,116
- Hello, Tina.
- Hello.

1641
02:05:17,187 --> 02:05:19,121
Hello, Mama.

1642
02:05:19,189 --> 02:05:21,123
- Hello.
- Hi, Mabel.

1643
02:05:21,191 --> 02:05:23,125
- How do you do, Adolph?
- Fine. Wonderful.

1644
02:05:23,193 --> 02:05:25,127
- Hello, Dr. Zepp.
- Hi.

1645
02:05:25,195 --> 02:05:27,186
Hello, Angelo.

1646
02:05:27,264 --> 02:05:30,597
- Hello, bananas.
- <i>Hi.</i>

1647
02:05:30,667 --> 02:05:34,296
How am I doin'? Okay.

1648
02:05:34,371 --> 02:05:37,272
Listen, I really wish
that you would go home, though...

1649
02:05:37,341 --> 02:05:40,708
because Nick and I
do want to go to bed together.

1650
02:05:40,777 --> 02:05:43,507
You know, we can't talk or anything
while you're still here.

1651
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,571
<i>Now, watch your language.</i>

1652
02:05:45,649 --> 02:05:48,117
- George, I think we should go.
- Just sit down.

1653
02:05:48,185 --> 02:05:50,585
I told you to sit down.
It's not the right time.

1654
02:05:50,654 --> 02:05:53,179
- Oh, horse manure.
- It's time to go, George.

1655
02:05:53,256 --> 02:05:55,816
- It is not.
- Mabel, take it easy.

1656
02:05:55,892 --> 02:05:57,985
Let's just... - Your... - It's your first day...

1657
02:05:58,061 --> 02:06:00,586
and you're letting yourself go,
and you know that's not good.

1658
02:06:00,664 --> 02:06:03,360
- Naughty Mommy.
- Fish party.

1659
02:06:03,433 --> 02:06:05,731
- "Fish party"?
- That's funny.

1660
02:06:05,802 --> 02:06:08,066
"Fish party." That's funny, Mabel.

1661
02:06:08,138 --> 02:06:10,698
- Naughty, naughty, naughty.
- <i>Naughty.</i>

1662
02:06:10,774 --> 02:06:13,368
- Mabel, everyone here's your friend.
- I got a joke.

1663
02:06:13,443 --> 02:06:16,810
- This jo... - Oh, Nick, this is funny.
- Mabel, relax and calm down.

1664
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,213
Let me tell this one.
And it's nothing bad or anything.

1665
02:06:20,283 --> 02:06:23,411
Um, this is a joke, uh, uh...

1666
02:06:23,487 --> 02:06:26,945
about a census taker who was, uh...

1667
02:06:27,024 --> 02:06:30,357
up in the Ozark Mountains and, uh...

1668
02:06:30,427 --> 02:06:33,828
he went up to this... -
to this little shack, you know...

1669
02:06:33,897 --> 02:06:35,831
and he knocked on the door and... -

1670
02:06:35,899 --> 02:06:37,890
<i>In the Ozarks? In the Ozarks?</i>

1671
02:06:37,968 --> 02:06:40,562
- Yeah. Like any kind of mountains.
- <i>I know that joke.</i>

1672
02:06:40,637 --> 02:06:42,571
- Kind of a hillbilly.
- <i>We know the joke.</i>

1673
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:44,800
- <i>We don't know it.</i>
- <i>Well, I know it.</i>

1674
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:48,140
<i>That's funny.</i>

1675
02:06:48,211 --> 02:06:50,202
<i>That's very funny.</i>

1676
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:53,647
Too... - Too exciting.
Too much excitement.

1677
02:06:53,717 --> 02:06:55,776
Do you like it, Nick?

1678
02:06:55,919 --> 02:06:57,614
Uh, uh...

1679
02:06:57,688 --> 02:06:59,622
- It's all right.
- Then, uh...

1680
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:01,624
- <i>Hold on, Mabel.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

1681
02:07:01,692 --> 02:07:03,683
<i>He said...</i> -

1682
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:18,831
<i>Relax. Be calm.</i>

1683
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:26,778
You must pay the rent.
You must pay the rent.

1684
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:29,080
- You must pay the rent today.
- <i>Funny.</i>

1685
02:07:29,152 --> 02:07:32,986
I can't pay the rent. I can't pay the rent.
I can't pay the rent today.

1686
02:07:33,056 --> 02:07:35,524
You must pay the rent.
You must pay the rent.

1687
02:07:35,592 --> 02:07:37,526
You must pay the rent today.

1688
02:07:37,594 --> 02:07:41,223
I can't pay the rent. I can't pay the rent.
I can't pay the rent today.

1689
02:07:41,298 --> 02:07:43,232
I'll pay the rent.

1690
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:46,326
My hero.
Curses. Foiled again.

1691
02:07:53,577 --> 02:07:55,807
That's enough of that. No more.

1692
02:07:55,879 --> 02:07:58,507
No more jokes.
That's enough. All right. Sit down.

1693
02:07:58,582 --> 02:08:01,380
Sit down.
All right. That's the end of the jokes.

1694
02:08:01,451 --> 02:08:03,942
Sit down!
That's the end of the jokes!

1695
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:06,853
Now we kill the jokes,
and we just talk!

1696
02:08:06,923 --> 02:08:09,790
"Hello, how are you?" Conversation.

1697
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:11,953
Weather. Conversation.

1698
02:08:12,028 --> 02:08:14,861
<i>Conversation.</i>
<i>Look what's talking about conversation.</i>

1699
02:08:14,931 --> 02:08:17,126
<i>He doesn't know how to</i>
<i>put two words together.</i>

1700
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:20,533
<i>Conversation. "How are you?"</i>
<i>It's conversation. "What have you been doing?"</i>

1701
02:08:20,604 --> 02:08:23,368
- <i>Jokes are conversation.</i>
- <i>"Who did you see?"It's conversation.</i>

1702
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,465
Yes. Oh, she likes pretty clothes.

1703
02:08:25,542 --> 02:08:28,136
- Normal conversation.
- <i>What normal conversation?</i>

1704
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:30,236
- Stay out of this.
- <i>I will not.</i>

1705
02:08:30,313 --> 02:08:34,147
- Normal talk. Conversation. Weather.
- <i>Let her tell jokes. She's good.</i>

1706
02:08:34,217 --> 02:08:37,983
- "How are you?" "Where you been?" "Hello."
- <i>Let her tell stories.</i>

1707
02:08:38,054 --> 02:08:40,522
- "Too hot." "Too cold."
- Don't you understand?

1708
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:45,527
<i>I don't know how to make it. At the hospital,</i>
<i>they come in every morning and give you a shot.</i>

1709
02:08:45,595 --> 02:08:48,063
<i>Please, Mabel, don't talk about those things.</i>

1710
02:08:48,131 --> 02:08:50,759
<i>Then the nurse takes you</i>
<i>to the toilet, and they,</i> uh... -

1711
02:08:50,834 --> 02:08:53,769
<i>Then you, uh, go to, uh, uh...</i>

1712
02:08:53,837 --> 02:08:56,328
<i>work therapy,</i>
<i>where they teach you games...</i>

1713
02:08:56,406 --> 02:08:58,874
<i>and...</i> - <i>and how to weave things.</i>

1714
02:08:58,942 --> 02:09:02,241
<i>And, uh, they gave us shock treatments...</i>

1715
02:09:02,312 --> 02:09:06,749
<i>which are...</i> - <i>Those are where electricity goes</i>
<i>through your head and is supposed</i> to... -

1716
02:09:06,817 --> 02:09:08,808
Be yourself.

1717
02:09:11,254 --> 02:09:13,848
Be yourself.

1718
02:09:13,924 --> 02:09:15,915
Go ahead.

1719
02:09:17,294 --> 02:09:19,819
Go ahead.

1720
02:09:19,896 --> 02:09:21,864
Simple talk.

1721
02:09:22,866 --> 02:09:24,857
Dad...

1722
02:09:26,436 --> 02:09:29,166
will you stand up for me?

1723
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:31,935
<i>Sure.</i>

1724
02:09:32,008 --> 02:09:33,942
No, I don't mean that.

1725
02:09:34,010 --> 02:09:36,001
Sit down, Dad.

1726
02:09:38,882 --> 02:09:41,214
Will you please stand up for me?

1727
02:09:46,423 --> 02:09:49,517
Mabel, I don't, uh,
know what you want me to do.

1728
02:09:51,595 --> 02:09:54,359
Honey, I... - I don't understand this game.

1729
02:09:55,932 --> 02:09:57,923
Will you just stand up for me?

1730
02:10:06,376 --> 02:10:09,209
Don't you hear what she's saying?

1731
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:11,770
Don't you understand
what she's trying to tell us?

1732
02:10:16,086 --> 02:10:18,054
- Sit down.
- Oh, Geor... -

1733
02:10:18,121 --> 02:10:20,112
- <i>Sit down. Sit down.</i>
- <i>Oh.</i>

1734
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:22,852
I can't.

1735
02:10:22,926 --> 02:10:25,224
I can't.

1736
02:10:25,295 --> 02:10:28,287
- Please.
- Please, Mabel. Please, darling.

1737
02:10:28,365 --> 02:10:30,890
- Mama, make 'em go away, please.
- Please.

1738
02:10:30,967 --> 02:10:33,299
- I can't do it. I'm so tired.
- Please don't cry.

1739
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:36,498
- Please. I think we all better go home, huh?
- Mama, make them go away.

1740
02:10:36,573 --> 02:10:38,564
All right.

1741
02:10:38,642 --> 02:10:40,837
- Good-bye, everybody.
- <i>Please, everybody.</i>

1742
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:42,845

- Thank you very much for coming.
- Thank you.

1744
02:10:44,915 --> 02:10:46,906
- Mama, get the people's coats.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1745
02:10:48,752 --> 02:10:51,312
<i>Angela, thank you very much.</i>

1746
02:10:54,758 --> 02:10:56,749
<i>Come on.</i>

1747
02:10:58,695 --> 02:11:01,721
- <i>Oh, Mabel, please calm down.</i>
- Leave me alone!

1748
02:11:01,798 --> 02:11:05,564
<i>For Goďs sakes, enough! Enough!</i>

1749
02:11:05,635 --> 02:11:07,626
Mabel, please.

1750
02:11:08,705 --> 02:11:13,506
<i>Mabel, get down off that couch,

Leave my daughter alone, you!

1752
02:11:24,688 --> 02:11:26,781
It was nice having you here.

1753
02:11:26,856 --> 02:11:28,847
Excuse us.

1754
02:11:28,925 --> 02:11:30,859
Zepp, we're going to bed.

1755
02:11:31,861 --> 02:11:34,659
All right. I want everybody
out of this house this instant.

1756
02:11:34,731 --> 02:11:37,666
<i>No long speeches, no good-byes.</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1757
02:11:37,734 --> 02:11:41,966
<i>Mama, where's your clothes?</i>
<i>Get the coats. Help the people out.</i>

Bye-bye, Nick. Bye.

Mama, what's the matter?

1763
02:12:31,087 --> 02:12:33,214
Mabel.

1764
02:12:33,289 --> 02:12:35,280
Mabel, get off the couch.

- Mom.
- <i>Mama, please.</i>

1773
02:13:32,215 --> 02:13:35,048
- <i>Mom. What's the matter, Mom?</i>
- I don't understand.

1774
02:13:36,119 --> 02:13:38,314
- <i>Mom?</i>

<i>I don't understand, Mom.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

<i>Mom?</i>

1778
02:13:44,594 --> 02:13:46,858
- Mom?

1779
02:13:46,930 --> 02:13:49,797
- <i>Mommy, what's the matter?</i>

Stop what you're doin'.

If you don't get down off the couch,
I'm gonna knock you down.

1784

<i>I don't wanna have to do that.</i>

<i>and no talking and go right to sleep.</i>

1860
02:21:20,216 --> 02:21:22,275
<i>This is your father talking, so you obey me.</i>

1861
02:21:22,351 --> 02:21:25,616
<i>I remember before, when you were</i>
<i>punching me in favor of your mother.</i>

1862
02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:43,265

Tell me about it.

I don't even know
how this whole thing got started.

1865
02:21:48,678 --> 02:21:51,841
Don't worry about it. Let me see that hand.

1866

I think I was just so tired, you know.

Gotta get some food in this house.
