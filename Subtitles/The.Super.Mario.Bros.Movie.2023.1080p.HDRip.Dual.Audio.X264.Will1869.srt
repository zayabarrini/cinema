Do you yield?

I do not.

I finally found it.

That is not a commercial!

33
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,915
That is cinema.

34
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:58,874
Eh, what about the accents?

35
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,624
Is it...

Yeah, "It's-a me"!

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,749
Have you even gotten one call, since
you left me to start your dumb company?

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,665
As a matter of fact, Spike...

51
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,874
We have.

52
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:31,874
Wow, really?

53
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,124
Uh, yeah.

54
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,874
Our mom called and she said,

55
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:37,874
"Oh, boys! That's the best
commercial I've ever seen."

56
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,415
And I said,
"Thank you very much, mother.

57
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,874
We're very proud of it."

58
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,415

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,040
Good luck running a
business with this idiot.

Say that again about my brother,
and you're gonna regret it.

00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,665
Oh, yeah?

62
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,624
Get this through
your tiny brain, Mario.

63
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,249
You're a joke!

64
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,999
And you always will be.

65
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,332

68
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,290
You know, you can't
be scared all the time.

69
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,999
Mmm, you'd be surprised.

70
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:29,499
Hello, Super Mario Brothers.

71
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,832
Uh-huh.

can be there and we can fix it right away.

Hey!

87
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,832
Get off from there!

88
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,040
You can't be here!

89
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,457
I know!

90
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,915

00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,540

at the end of the hall.

98
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,207
Very confident, sir.

99
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,123
You'll be careful about making a mess.

00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,415

What?!

140
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:25,081
It's supposed to be funny.

141
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,040
Can someone pass the bread?

142
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,748
Yeah, but what's
with the outfits?

143
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,665
Plumbers wearing white gloves?

144
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:31,248

You gotta have a trademark.

00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:32,165
Gotta stand out.

00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,040
I think you're nuts.

152
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:46,665
You don't leave a steady job
for some crazy dream.

153
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,081

154
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,790

00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,248
We got to get to
that pressure valve.

187
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,623
Mario, really?

188
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:24,956
I knew saving Brooklyn was a bad idea.

189
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,206
Come on.

190
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,664
Woah!

191
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,789
What is this place?

192
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:13,081
Looks like nobody's been
down here for years.

193
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,623
Luigi?

194
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,914
Luigi, are you in there?

195
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,289
Luigi!

196
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,831
What?

197
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:03,539
Luigi!

198
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:04,748
Mario!

199
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:09,914
Gimme your hand!

200
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,748
It's all gonna be okay!

201
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,331
How is this gonna be okay?!

202
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,289
I'm telling you!

203
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,873
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together!

204
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:21,498
Mario!

205
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,831
Luigi!

206
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,956
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

207
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:06,247
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,706
That one's perfectly fine.

209
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:09,414
Ah, it's a little mushroom man.

210
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,289
A little mushroom man,
talking to me.

211
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,247
Pleased to meet ya!

212
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,539
I'm Toad.

213
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,497
Uh, Mario.

214
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,247
So this uh...

215
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,664
This is, this is not a dream?

216
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:23,497
That hurt, right?

217
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,497
Yes!

218
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:25,789
Definitely, not a dream.

219
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:27,289
Then, then...

220
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:31,164
- This place is...
- The Mushroom Kingdom!

221
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,872
Mushrooms, really?

222
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,581
Now, that is a cruel twist of fate.

223
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:41,539
Hello.

224
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:45,247
Yeah, I'm actually looking for somebody.

225
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,497
My brother, in fact.

226
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:49,622
He looks exactly like me,
but tall, and skinny, and green.

227
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,289
See, last time I saw him,
he was falling through a pipe.

228
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,497
It was foggy and I believe there was lava.

229
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,122
Uh, that is not good.

230
00:17:58,122 --> 00:17:59,122
Umm...

231
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:02,497
Your brother has landed in the Dark Lands.

232
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,622
They're under Bowser's control.

233
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,331
Bowser?

234
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:10,872
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

235
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:16,914
I'm taking you to see the princess.

236
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:17,914
She can help.

237
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,539
She can do anything.

238
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:21,414
Princess?

239
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,539
Come on, Mario!

240
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,914
Our big adventure begins now!

241
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,372
Hang on, Luigi.

242
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,331
Mario?

243
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,789
Mario?

244
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,122
Where are you?

245
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,497
Huh?

246
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:45,997
Haha!

247
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,039
Yes!

248
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,914
You just got a-Luigi'd.

249
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,122
This way, Mario!

250
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,705
The princess is right up that hill.

251
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,372
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

252
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,164
Got a big adventure happening, right now.

253
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:24,830
Clear a path for us.

254
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:25,955
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

255
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,164
Excuse me.

256
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:29,664
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

257
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,122
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

258
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,289
Out of the way, please!

259
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:35,914
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

260
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,247
He's gonna be fine.

261
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:38,289
- Shake Shroom!
- Morning!

262
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,872
Nice to see ya, bud.

263
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,914
Does this thing work?

264
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:44,830
Yeah, it works great.

265
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,997
Hey, you just have to blow into it.

266
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:49,580
And...
Up, we go.

267
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:50,789
Wait, up?

268
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,289
Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here?

269
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,247
Just pop in this pipe
and we're on our way.

270
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:17,997
The only way to fly, man.

271
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:22,955
Oh, wow.
Love these pipes.

272
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,247
Aw, come on!

273
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:51,497
Here we are.

274
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,247
Palace doors.

275
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,289
Bing, bang, boom.

276
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:57,789
Come on, haha.

277
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,164
Woo!

278
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,705
Woah.

279
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:09,247
Pretty impressive,
am I right?

280
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,789
Hold it right there, you two.

281
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,664
Oh, hey.

282
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,747
I need to see the princess.

283
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:18,914
It's an emergency.

284
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:22,372
What princess?

285
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:24,247
I never heard of any princess.

286
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:25,372
Oh, wait.
I did.

287
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:27,664
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

288
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,080
Oh, yeah. That's right.

289
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:30,955
You should try
another castle, maybe.

290
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:32,955
She ain't in this one.

291
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:33,705
Huh?

292
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,539
Okay, so they're
messing with you.

293
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,289
And...

294
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,622
I don't like it.

295
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,664
What do you guys, um...

296
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:43,872
What you wanna eat?

297
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,747
Anything your heart desires.

298
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:46,372
Go!

299
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,914
And we're gonna scramble it up.

300
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,330
- Hey!
- Intruder!

301
00:23:58,372 --> 00:23:59,747
Stop him!

302
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,913
- Intruder!
- Stop him!

303
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:03,830
Back to work!
We know!

304
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,288
Stop him!

305
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,872
Council, your attention!

306
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:26,455
Bowser has found the Super Star
and is headed toward our Kingdom.

307
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,580
Its power will
make him invincible.

308
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
We will be destroyed.

309
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,205
Princess, what are we gonna do?

310
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:38,497
I will not let him hurt you.

311
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,913
We are going to stop Bowser.

312
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:47,705
How?

313
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:48,663
Look at us...

314
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:50,330
We're adorable.

315
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,288
I'm going to convince the
great Kong Army to help us.

316
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,247
Together, we'll annihilate that monster.

317
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,997
Their mad king doesn't make alliances.

318
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,288
The Kongs will never agree.

319
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:04,247
I can convince him.

320
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:06,705
I'll leave for the Jungle Kingdom,
in the morning.

321
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:09,580
Good luck, Princess.

322
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,413
For all our sakes.

323
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:24,913
Princess...

324
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:30,205
Princess, I...

325
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:35,163
Wait!
Release him.

326
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,330
Are you...

327
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:44,413
He's a human!

328
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:46,205
I mean...
You are human, right?

329
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,747
- It's just, you're so small.
- Hey!

330
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,372
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go back.

331
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,705
Where did you come from?

332
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:53,997
Me and my little brother, Luigi.

333
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:55,622
We fell down this pipe.

334
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:58,330
And now, he's lost,
somewhere in the Dark Lands.

335
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:02,247
Then, it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

336
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:03,622
But you're in luck.

337
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,413
I'm on my way to stop him.

338
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:06,997
Well, take me with you.

339
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,580
This guy's a lunatic.

340
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,997
A psycho.

341
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:12,122
He will eat you for breakfast.

342
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:14,247
He won't even notice it probably.

343
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:16,955
Cause you're very, very small.

344
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:18,997
You know what,
make fun of me all you want.

345
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,872
But you're gonna help me find my brother.

346
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:23,705
Please?

347
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:26,497
Okay.

348
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:28,288
Let's see what you're made of.

349
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,622
Is that a yes?

350
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,288
No.

351
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,788
That's a, "Let's see what you're made of".

352
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,996
If you can finish this,

353
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:26,413
you're coming with me.

354
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,205
Watch and learn.

355
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:12,705
That was amazing.

356
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:13,371
Wait...

357
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,871
How am I supposed to do that?

358
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,288
With the power-ups.

359
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,705
They give us special abilities.

360
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:21,955
Ugh!

361
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:22,955
Really?!

362
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:23,871
Go on...

363
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:24,913
Eat it.

364
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,538
Ugh!

365
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,163
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

366
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:33,496
Cause I just,
hate mushrooms and...

367
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:35,371
Okay, okay...

368
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,996
Are you sure
there's not like a...

369
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:41,371
Down the hatch!
Yep, there it is. And all gone.

370
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:44,996
Not cool!

371
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,663
I'm tall.

372
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:02,871
And strong.

373
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,246
And, you can jump.

374
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,580
I got this.
No problem.

375
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:24,288
Oh, yeah.

376
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,830
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

377
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:29,955
Great...

378
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,246
Come on, try again.

379
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:49,163
Well...

380
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:52,496
We have a long journey
ahead of us, moustache.

381
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:53,746
But I didn't make it.

382
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,121
You almost did.

383
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:56,871
No one gets it right away.

384
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:58,871
How many tries did it take you?

385
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:00,871
Oh! So many...

386
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,038
I was not good at it.

387
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,621
Worse than you.

388
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:06,163
You got it right away, didn't you?

389
00:31:06,204 --> 00:31:08,746
I got it right away, but I grew up here.

390
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:09,371
Okay.

391
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:10,996
Now, you're just trying
to make me feel better.

392
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,204
No!

393
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,829
No...

394
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:15,788
Is it working?

395
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:18,121
A little bit, yeah.

396
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:49,079
My army!

397
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:50,954
Koopas!

398
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:52,496
Goombas!

399
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,663
Whatever those things are.

400
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:59,829
After years of searching for
the Super Star, it is finally ours!

401
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:03,746
I am now, the most
powerful turtle in the world!

402
00:32:04,746 --> 00:32:07,538
Soon, we will arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom.

403
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:11,413
Where after years of being sworn enemies,

404
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:16,704
I will ask their princess to
marry me in a fairy tale wedding!

405
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,788
Yeah...

406
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:22,996
Did he say marry their princess?

407
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:24,663
Doesn't she hate you?

408
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:26,746
Of course, she hates me.

409
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:29,454
But that makes me love her, all the more.

410
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:31,454
Her heart-shaped bangs.

411
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,954
The way she floats in the breeze.

412
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,163
Her immovable tiara.

413
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,246
And when she sees this Star...

414
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:41,288
Oh, ho, ho, ho,
wedding bells.

415
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:43,079
Well, what if she says no?

416
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:49,663
Then, I will power up with this Star
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom.

417
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:53,621
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

418
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,204
It's gonna rock!

419
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:08,038
They're all counting on us.

420
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,829
No pressure.

421
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:22,871
My toads!

422
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:25,871
Our days of terror are almost over.

423
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:27,954
With the help of the Kong Army,

424
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,704
we will stop...

425
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,829
Uh...
Who's he?

426
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,912
He's not important!

427
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:54,079
Nervous?

428
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,079
Who, me?

429
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:56,579
Yes...

430
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:57,412

What?

458
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:01,079
A report from our intelligence.

459
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,496
A mustachioed human has
arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom.

460
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:08,996
The princess has been training him.

461
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:11,537
They are up to something, sire.

462
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,829
Sit...

463
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,537
Jam with me.

464
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:23,454
This human...

465
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,037
Where did he come from?

466
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,037
We...

467
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,621
aren't sure?

468
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,371
Does the princess like him?

469
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:31,412
Sire...

470
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:32,912
Look in the mirror!

471
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:35,329
You have nothing to worry about.

472
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,329
I know that.

473
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:38,079
I'm not threatened.

474
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:44,287
Find out who he is,
and what they're plotting!

475
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,537
I'm on it, sire.

476
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,787
May I lift the cover?

477
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:49,704
Not yet.

478
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,912
Pain is the best teacher.

479
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,495
Thinking about your brother?

480
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:06,995
We've never been apart this long.

481
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,329
Don't worry...

482
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,787
We're going to save him.

483
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:28,579
You don't seem,
like you're from here.

484
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:31,287
I don't know where I'm from.

485
00:38:31,495 --> 00:38:32,329
Really?

486
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,620
Yep.

487
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:36,954
My earliest memory is arriving.

488
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,829
I was so lucky they found me.

489
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:47,745
They took me in...

490
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,662
Raised me, like one of their own...

491
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:55,037
And, when I was ready...

492
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:58,995
they made me their princess.

493
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:04,329
Hey, maybe, you're from my world.

494
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,537
There's a huge universe out there,
with a lot of galaxies.

495
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,620
We found him in the Dark Lands.

496
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:04,287
Leave him to me.

497
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:15,120
What is your name?

498
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,287
Uh...

499
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,662
Luigi.

500
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:20,912
Not sure if you know who I am,

501
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:24,579
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

502
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:25,870
Wow!

503
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,954
Yay...

504
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,787
But there's one problem, Luigi.

505
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,870
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

506
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,079
Has a mustache,
just like you.

507
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,745
Do you know him?

508
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:40,870
No.

509
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:41,829
No!

510
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:43,870
Ah! A tough one, I see.

511
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,620
Maybe, this will get you to talk.

512
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,829
Do you think I know every
human being with a mustache,

513
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,870
wearing an identical outfit, with a hat
with the letter of his first name on it?

514
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:54,370
Because I don't.

515
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,870
- Do you know him?!
- Yes!

516
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:58,870
Stop! Stop!

517
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,829
That's how I know him.

518
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,579
Yes, I know him.

519
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,037
Yeah.
He's my brother, Mario.

520
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:04,579
And he's the best guy in the world!

521
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,162
Do princesses find him attractive?

522
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:10,370
They do, if we have good teeth!

523
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:13,454
Get him out of my sight!

524
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:17,870
We'll see how tough this Mario is,
when he watches me kill his brother!

525
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:32,287
Where am I?

526
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:37,537
Home.

527
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,578
Pay him no heed.

528
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,578
He is cute,
but he is...

529
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:47,995
In an insane world,
it is the sane who is called crazy.

530
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:54,328
How long you guys been in here?

531
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,287
Time...

532
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:57,870
Like hope, is an illusion.

533
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,953
Please, we are depressed enough!

534
00:42:00,328 --> 00:42:02,203
There's gotta be a way out of here.

535
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:03,787
There's no escape.

536
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:05,495
The only hope,

537
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:07,870
is the sweet relief of death.

538
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,828
No!

539
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:11,203
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

540
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:36,287
You ready?

541
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,037
Eh...

542
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:38,203
Sure?

543
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:48,703
What...

544
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:50,912
How you doing?

545
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:53,620
We are here to see the king.

546
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,912
Follow me.

547
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,203
That gorilla's
wearing a sports cup.

548
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,995
I feel underdressed.

549
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:08,370
Hop in.

550
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:22,870
Oh, by all means, come in.

551
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,162
Great and mighty Cranky Kong.

552
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:40,037
So, I heard you want my army.

553
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,745
Yes, your Highness.

554
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:46,703
Without your help,
the Mushroom Kingdom will be annihilated.

555
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:52,036
What makes you think,
you're worthy of fighting alongside,

556
00:44:52,078 --> 00:44:57,078
the greatest army in the world!

557
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:58,911
Because we have heart.

558
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:00,536
And with your strength...

559
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:02,411
We can win.

560
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,203
Okay, fine.

561
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:04,995
That's it?

562
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,453
No, that's not it.

563
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,286
The answer is no.

564
00:45:08,328 --> 00:45:09,161
Goodbye.

565
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,036
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls,

566
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:12,786
the Jungle Kingdom is next.

567
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:16,453
We're not leaving,
without your army.

568
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:20,870
Who is this guy?

569
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,536
Oh, he makes me laugh.

570
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,286
Alright, tough guy.

571
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:29,078
You want my army so badly.

572
00:45:29,078 --> 00:45:34,453
Defeat my son,
in the great ring of Kong!

573
00:45:36,161 --> 00:45:37,620
Give us a second.

574
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,370
This is a really, really bad idea.

575
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,495
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

576
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,828
Are you two done whispering?

577
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,620
It's a little rude.

578
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,703
You, sir, have a deal.

579
00:45:50,703 --> 00:45:53,286
I'll fight your son, and win.

580
00:45:53,328 --> 00:45:55,161
I'm sure you will.

581
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:47,161
I'm DK.

582
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:49,161
I'm Donkey Kong.

583
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:51,495
Oh, yeah.

584
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:53,245
Hi, dad!

585
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,411
No, don't!

586
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,703
Don't do that!

587
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:57,120
Dad, wave back!

588
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,286
Enough with the showboating!

589
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,370
What do you mean?!
They like it!

590
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,120
It's what they came here for!

591
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:05,328
Dancing pecs!

592
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:08,203
Okay, simmer down.

593
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,203
I said, simmer down!

594
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,120
DK! DK!

595
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,870
That means you, Diddy Kong!

596
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,745
D...

597
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:14,953
Sorry.

598
00:47:14,995 --> 00:47:15,911
Now...

599
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:20,078
Since I want this fight to
last more than five seconds,

600
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:23,245
I put power-ups
around the arena.

601
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:25,245
You're welcome, Mario.

602
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:30,411
I don't need anything special
to break every bone in your tiny body.

603
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,453
All right.

604
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:52,786
Oh, my...

605
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,703
Okay...

606
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,953
Guess you're not getting my army.

607
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,411
Is this what you came for?!

608
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:05,411
I love you, DK!

609
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:10,120
Hi, dad!
Love you!

610
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:18,328
It is on,
like Donkey Kong!

611
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,744
You're about to pick on
someone, your own size.

612
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,494
I guess, he got the wrong mushroom.

613
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:07,828
Get up, Mario!

614
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:36,328
Had enough?

615
00:49:36,328 --> 00:49:39,619
Not even close.

616
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:53,036
Mario...

617
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:55,911
It's-a me...

618
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,453
The box...

619
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,161
He looks adorable.

620
00:50:18,203 --> 00:50:19,453
He really does.

621
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:22,328
Oh, what?
I'm a cat?

622
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,244
You got the cat box!

623
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:25,578
Oh, my...

624
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:28,203
Oh, I'm sorry...

625
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:29,078
I'm sorry.

626
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,036
Okay...

627
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:30,953
Now, you die.

628
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,744
I'm a cat.

629
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,703
Meow.

630
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,411
Had enough?

631
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:22,661
Not even close.

632
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:26,619
I'll take that as a yes.

633
00:51:34,244 --> 00:51:35,203
Yes!

634
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:36,786
That's my best friend!

635
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:40,744
Mario! Mario! Mario!

636
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:43,244
Yeah, yeah...

637
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,994
That was incredible!

638
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:53,202
He kept beating you senseless,
and you just kept getting back up?

639
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,202
You just don't know when to quit.

640
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:55,911
Huh...

641
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:57,869
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

642
00:51:57,869 --> 00:51:59,786
It's a great thing.

643
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:00,952
Thanks.

644
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:01,869
I...

645
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:04,244
I let him win,
just for the record.

646
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:06,077
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

647
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,369
You want to know why?

648
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:10,452
It's, mind your own business,
that's why!

649
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,661
Alright, giant monkey.

650
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:13,077
Enough!

651
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,661
Get inside!

652
00:52:16,452 --> 00:52:18,911
We've located Bowser's ship.

653
00:52:18,952 --> 00:52:23,077
He's gonna arrive at
the Mushroom Kingdom, by sundown.

654
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:24,702
Lucky for you, guys.

655
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,536
I got a shortcut.

656
00:52:26,536 --> 00:52:29,369
We beat him there and ambush him.

657
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:31,952
Yeah, I know.

658
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:35,869
That's why, we're gonna need karts!

659
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,411
Well, what are you waiting for?

660
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:59,077
Pick your karts!

661
00:53:57,744 --> 00:53:59,411
I hate you.

662
00:53:59,411 --> 00:54:03,494
To the Mushroom Kingdom,
and the biggest fight of our lives.

663
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:05,494
Here we go!

664
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:25,827
Princess Peach...

665
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,577
Here we are...

666
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:31,369
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

667
00:54:35,286 --> 00:54:38,369
Let's rule the world, together.

668
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:39,661
Forever...

669
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:41,827
Will you marry me?

670
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,494
Oh, yes!

671
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:46,744
What?!

672
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:50,119
We have found the princess
and the mustachioed human.

673
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:54,286
He has defeated Donkey Kong,
and won the Kong Army.

674
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:56,411
So, like Peach was
super impressed?

675
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:58,286
It appears so, yes.

676
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:00,577
They are heading
toward the secret passage!

677
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:03,202
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

678
00:55:03,244 --> 00:55:05,369
Two can play at that game.

679
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,369
Um...

680
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,785
No one panic,
but the road is about to end.

681
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:35,910
Well then, you better step
on the gas and buckle up!

682
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,077
Woo-hoo!

683
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,535
Is there anything like this, in your world?

684
00:56:09,535 --> 00:56:10,577
What?!

685
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:13,910
Is there anything like this, in your world?!

686
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:15,827
No...

687
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:17,910
We don't drive on rainbows.

688
00:56:17,952 --> 00:56:19,660
What are you gonna tell me next?

689
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:21,369
That the turtles aren't evil?

690
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:22,452
No, no.

691
00:56:22,452 --> 00:56:23,869
They're usually pets.

692
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:25,160
No way!

693
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:27,202
Yeah! Come to Brooklyn,
I'll buy you a turtle.

694
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:30,160
Maybe, I will.

695
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:32,452
Dude, is this you flirting?!

696
00:56:32,494 --> 00:56:33,535
This is painful!

697
00:56:33,577 --> 00:56:35,119
Listen, I was trying to be nice.

698
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,744
You are so embarrassing!

699
00:56:36,744 --> 00:56:39,035
A princess would never go out with you!

700
00:56:39,077 --> 00:56:39,994
Yes, she would!

701
00:56:40,035 --> 00:56:41,285
I guarantee, she would!

702
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:42,285
Guys!

703
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:43,119
Enough!

704
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,244
Alright, alright.

705
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,535
Charge!

706
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,035
It's an ambush!

707
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:11,119
Defensive position!

708
00:57:26,702 --> 00:57:27,619
Mario...

709
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,202
You're a dead man!

710
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,202
Split up!

711
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:37,910
Mario!

712
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:56,785
Haha!

713
00:58:53,785 --> 00:58:56,160
I'm too cute to die!

714
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:08,577
That is how you princess!

715
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,327
Time to die, Mario.

716
00:59:43,243 --> 00:59:44,910
See ya!

717
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:46,785
No!

718
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:51,660
Woo-hoo!

719
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:52,493
Haha!

720
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:53,827
Yeah!

721
01:00:00,535 --> 01:00:03,702
You, can't escape me.

722
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:04,827
What?

723
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,035
Blue shell!

724
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,702
No!

725
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:25,910
No, Mario...

726
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:28,327
No!

727
01:00:28,535 --> 01:00:29,493
No...

728
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,827
No!

729
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:31,618
Oh, no!

730
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:33,493
No...

731
01:00:35,702 --> 01:00:38,702
Get your clown claws off of me!

732
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:43,618
Goodbye, Mario.

733
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:45,952
We have to get home.

734
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,493
Hey, this is your fault!

735
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:56,452
My fault?

736
01:00:56,493 --> 01:00:57,827
- You're the one...
- Stop talking!

737
01:00:57,827 --> 01:01:01,368
I don't want the last thing I hear,
before I die, to be your...

738
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:33,452
Mario...

739
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:34,952
You saved my life.

740
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:36,035
Yeah, well...

741
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:37,160
I won't tell anyone.

742
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:38,827
Good, please don't.

743
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:39,577
Okay...

744
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:42,410
Uh...

745
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,952
Did you just feel something?

746
01:01:47,368 --> 01:01:48,077
Swim!

747
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:06,993
Browser's on his way.

748
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:08,993
You have to evacuate.

749
01:02:11,243 --> 01:02:11,951
Hurry!

750
01:02:11,993 --> 01:02:14,160
Get out of the city!

751
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,118
Princess?

752
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:32,368
We lost the Army,
and Mario's gone.

753
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,243
Bowser is coming.

754
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,493
Head into the forest!

755
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:38,993
I'll buy you some time.

756
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,118
You heard her!

757
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,826
Evacuate the city!

758
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:44,868
Go with the others.

759
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:47,493
I said, I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

760
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,660
Just leave it!
There's no time!

761
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:56,868
Princess Peach...

762
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:59,201
Brave as ever.

763
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:04,701
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

764
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:07,243
If you're going to use it...

765
01:04:07,285 --> 01:04:08,910
Use it now!

766
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:13,118
No, Princess...

767
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,951
I stole this Star for us.

768
01:04:15,993 --> 01:04:20,160
I guess, love really makes
a guy come out of his shell.

769
01:04:22,285 --> 01:04:24,410
I told you that line wouldn't work.

770
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,451
You're doing great!

771
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:31,076
Peaches, with this Star,
we will be invincible.

772
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:35,451
We can rule the world together, forever.

773
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,243
Will you marry me?

774
01:04:37,493 --> 01:04:38,910
Marry you?

775
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:40,326
Are you insane?!

776
01:04:40,368 --> 01:04:42,576
I would never marry you!

777
01:04:43,118 --> 01:04:45,535
Maybe, you should reconsider.

778
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,201
No!

779
01:04:50,201 --> 01:04:51,743
Stop!

780
01:04:52,618 --> 01:04:53,743
Please, stop!

781
01:04:53,785 --> 01:04:56,743
I'll marry you,
just don't hurt my toads!

782
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,535
You have my word.

783
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:13,493
Haha, time for a wedding!

784
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:27,993
♪ Life is sad ♪

785
01:05:28,035 --> 01:05:29,660
♪ Prison is sad ♪

786
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:34,910
♪ Life and prison is very, very sad ♪

787
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:44,034
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

788
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:46,618
Who's this ray of sunshine?

789
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:48,243
There's no sunshine...

790
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:49,659
only darkness.

791
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:51,993
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

792
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:54,284
Hello, prisoners...

793
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:59,159
You don't deserve this, but you're
invited to the Royal Wedding!

794
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,659
Yay!

795
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:04,701
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed.

796
01:06:07,618 --> 01:06:09,118
Oh, no, no, no.

797
01:06:09,118 --> 01:06:11,576
Finally, mercy.

798
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:14,743
Mario...

799
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:28,951
So, this is the end...

800
01:06:28,993 --> 01:06:32,909
Being slowly digested by an eel,
next to an idiot in overalls.

801
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:35,618
Well, at least, your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

802
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,284
Least, you're not gonna die,
with your dad thinking you're a joke.

803
01:06:38,784 --> 01:06:41,243
Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a joke too.

804
01:06:41,409 --> 01:06:43,243
Yeah, well...

805
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:44,326
Your dad's right!

806
01:06:44,326 --> 01:06:46,201
You know what,
I feel bad enough.

807
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:47,493
Just, just, leave me alone.

808
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:50,034
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant!

809
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:53,284
Just go in a corner and
smash some stuff, smash monkey.

810
01:06:54,159 --> 01:07:00,368
I, am, more, than a guy,
who smashes things!

811
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:29,784
That was amazing!

812
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:33,409
Now, we're even.

813
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:01,784
Princess...

814
01:08:01,826 --> 01:08:02,743
I got it!

815
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:03,784
Great job.

816
01:08:03,784 --> 01:08:06,576
Couldn't have you going out
there without your bouquet.

817
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:08,076
It's perfect.

818
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:37,493
I'll be sacrificing them in your honor.

819
01:08:38,826 --> 01:08:40,493
Lower the prisoners!

820
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:50,326
Dearly beloved...

821
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,284
Huh?

822
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:53,951
Drama...

823
01:08:53,951 --> 01:08:56,493
You really thought
I'd marry you?

824
01:08:57,326 --> 01:08:58,076
Kinda...

825
01:08:58,118 --> 01:09:00,576
I'd never marry a monster.

826
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:05,284
Then we are breaking up, right now!

827
01:09:30,451 --> 01:09:31,867
They gotta be up there.

828
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:35,826
Fire!

829
01:09:44,409 --> 01:09:45,492
You wanna do this?

830
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:47,034
Yes, I do.

831
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:57,242
Yes!

832
01:09:57,284 --> 01:09:58,909
Fire!

833
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,117
This is fun!

834
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:18,992
Ha, loser!

835
01:10:23,701 --> 01:10:25,076
Hey, what does this do?

836
01:10:34,617 --> 01:10:36,117
Cool raccoon suit.

837
01:10:36,117 --> 01:10:37,909
- Really?
- Not at all!

838
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:12,576
Whee!

839
01:11:26,242 --> 01:11:27,701
Boo...

840
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,409
- Lou!
- Mario?!

841
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:46,992
I told ya!

842
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:47,492
See...

843
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:51,451
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

844
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,409
Mario, why do you look like a bear?
What is this?

845
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:02,242
Ya did good, kid.

846
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:04,951
Make your pecs dance,
you deserve it.

847
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:07,451
No time now.
Definitely, later.

848
01:12:20,326 --> 01:12:24,951
Launch the Bomber Bill and
destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!

849
01:12:36,075 --> 01:12:37,992
No...

850
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:46,117
Hey, hey...

851
01:12:46,117 --> 01:12:47,159
Hey, over here.

852
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,200
You asked for it.

853
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:09,784
Hello...

854
01:13:34,117 --> 01:13:35,159
Really?

855
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,409
Follow me.

856
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,450
Come on...

857
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,367
Little closer...

858
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:56,700
Mamma Mia!

859
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:08,617
Huh?

860
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:36,867
That's beautiful.

861
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:37,700
You make this right.

862
01:14:40,492 --> 01:14:42,242
Huh?

863
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:04,450
Huh?

864
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:05,909
Brooklyn?

865
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,909
Mario?!

866
01:15:09,617 --> 01:15:10,784
You almost dented my...

867
01:15:43,034 --> 01:15:44,867
Mario!

868
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:52,450
Don't you want this?

869
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,033
You ruined my wedding!

870
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:08,783
I was finally gonna be happy!

871
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:13,450
Now, you will suffer...

872
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:15,825
like me!

873
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,825
You really thought you could stop me?

874
01:16:33,867 --> 01:16:36,867
You worthless, weak little nothing.

875
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,908
Come out and fight!

876
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:41,033
Or are you too scared?

877
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:47,033
Just what I thought.

878
01:17:05,658 --> 01:17:07,700
Mamma Mia!

879
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:10,408
That's why the
Super Mario Brothers are here.

880
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:11,867
Out to save Brooklyn...

881
01:17:11,908 --> 01:17:12,950
Save Brooklyn...

882
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:13,742
Brooklyn...

883
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:14,950
Save Brooklyn...

884
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:34,825
Let's-a go.

885
01:17:40,367 --> 01:17:41,367
Hey!

886
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,908
Leave him alone.

887
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:46,200
Mario...

888
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,158
You just don't know when you quit.

889
01:17:49,742 --> 01:17:50,617
Yeah...

890
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:52,075
I've been told that before.

891
01:17:55,908 --> 01:17:56,783
Mario!

892
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:01,992
The Star!

893
01:18:02,033 --> 01:18:02,783
No!

894
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:03,908
That's mine!

895
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,200
Lou...

896
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:30,408
Nothing can hurt us,
as long as we're together.

897
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:42,283
No!

898
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,742
Rip 'em to pieces!

899
01:19:17,742 --> 01:19:19,408
Oh, hey, Spike.

900
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:20,367
Luigi?!

901
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:39,783
Mamma Mia.

902
01:20:30,825 --> 01:20:31,741
Peaches...

903
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:35,116
Listen, this is not the way I pictured it,

904
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:36,866
but give me one more chance.

905
01:20:37,283 --> 01:20:39,033
Ew, no.

906
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:40,450
No, no, no, no.

907
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:42,825
Hey...

908
01:20:42,866 --> 01:20:43,533
Hey!

909
01:20:43,575 --> 01:20:45,033
That is not cool!

910
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:47,366
Ah, he got the blue mushroom!

911
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:48,158
See...

912
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,741
Told you, I'd get you a pet turtle.

913
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:52,700
Not bad, mustache.

914
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:55,908
And Luigi,
you're so brave.

915
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,241
Oh, thanks.

916
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:58,866
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

917
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:00,616
Ah, my boys!

918
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:03,533
- My heroes!
- Wahoo!

919
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:04,408
Mario...

920
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,866
You were amazing!

921
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:09,033
Thanks, dad.

922
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,616
Ah, bring it in!

923
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:23,283
Let's hear it, for
the Super Mario Brothers!

924
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:33,450
These are my boys!

925
01:21:33,491 --> 01:21:35,450
Ha-hey!

926
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,616
Wahoo!

927
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:42,283
- Hey!
- Hey!

928
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:48,283
BROOKLYN SAVED

929
01:22:14,866 --> 01:22:16,700
- Morning!
- Hello!

930
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:42,491
Now, that's a happy ending.

931
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:43,908
Or is it?

932
01:22:43,908 --> 01:22:45,866
