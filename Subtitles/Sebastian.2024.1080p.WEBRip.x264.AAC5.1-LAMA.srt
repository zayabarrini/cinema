3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,291
So...

4
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,541
tell me about yourself.

5
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,750
What would you like to know?

6
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,333
I don't know, just the basics.

7
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,458
Erm...

8
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,041
Where are you from,
what do you do in life...

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,000
besides...

10
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,750
Erm...

11
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,541
Well, my name's Sebastian.

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm twenty-four.

13
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,166
- From Edinburgh.
- Oh...

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,333
I thought I heard an accent.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,291
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,083
Oh yeah.

17
00:02:55,625 --> 00:03:01,250
Yeah. Good. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
- Get on your back.

18
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,166
Oh yeah.

19
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
I'm getting close.
Do you want me to come?

20
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,208
Oh fuck, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?

21
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,833
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,083
Oh yeah.

23
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,208
So tell me about yourself.

24
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,041
What would you like to know?

25
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,916
Oh, I don't know,
just the basics. Erm...

26
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,166
I must admit,
I was a bit worried

27
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,583
when you wouldn't
send a face pic, but...

28
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,541
you're very handsome.

29
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,583
Are you quite new to this?

30
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,333
Max, how is
the Marloan review coming along?

31
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,083
You'll have it by Friday.
Let's just say...

32
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,166
sophomore slump
is a kind way of putting it.

33
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:18,250
For LLF, they've
just announced Alina Casaro.

34
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,833
I would love to...
- There's been some indication

35
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,166
she might give an interview,
but we've all heard that before.

36
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,875
As for Easton Ellis,

37
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,666
his people
just confirmed this morning.

38
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,916
I think this one's for you.
- But didn't I ask first?

39
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,750
Actually, I think Max beat you
to it, but in any case,

40
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,541
I do think it best

41
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,208
that queer writers cover
queer authors.

42
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,916
Shouldn't anyone
be able to write about anything?

43
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,583
That's a very
cis-hetero response.

44
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,583
What does cis
have to do with it?

45
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,458
I thought that the priority here
was quality reporting,

46
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,666
not optics.

47
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,083
It's not about optics.

48
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,250
It's about sensibility,

49
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,250
sensitivity.

50
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,916
Just do me the favor and run
those questions by me, Max.

51
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,875
I trust that you know what
to ask, but I need to see them

52
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,958
because we may lead with it.

53
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,458
<i>They're not that apparent to me.</i>

54
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,875
I really tend not
to write about my life at all.

55
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,000
People point to the story in <i>The
Informers</i> called <i>In the Islands</i>,

56
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,958
which is about a father who
takes his son...

57
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,333
♪ My heart, it felt complete and ♪

58
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:55,125
♪ Everything was
Perfectly aligned [alright] ♪

59
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,708
♪ It happened just like that ♪

60
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,291
♪ We found ♪

61
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:07,166
♪ Our satellites ♪

62
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,291
Seriously, it's like
a religious experience,

63
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,333
the new one.

64
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,750
Reading it I really
feel changed as a person.

65
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,875
Sorry,
I know I sound like a twat.

66
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,166
She's only given one interview
in, like, eight years.

67
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,708
Dunno how her publisher
let her get away with it?

68
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,750
I think the mystique
is part of it.

69
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,916
Like, you actually have to read
any of her work

70
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,250
to understand
anything about her.

71
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,791
It should be out today.

72
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,083
Wow.

73
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,875
So fucking cool.

74
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,166
I just don't think
it stands out.

75
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,416
It's so unpolished.
- What?

76
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,208
No.

77
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,166
It's exactly that rawness
that makes it work so well.

78
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,083
The way you capture the intimacy
between the lovers and...

79
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,416
you know, then how
it suddenly turns to distance.

80
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,125
Yeah, collapsing those two
timeframes together like that

81
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,125
in one moment is...

82
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,416
fantastic.

83
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,416
I mean, yeah,
it's atmospheric, sure, but...

84
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,083
Is it really saying anything?
- Max...

85
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,458
Not everything needs to be
some grand statement

86
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,041
if it's well-observed,
if it's truthful.

87
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
This comes from the heart.

88
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,541
And that's why it works.

89
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,416
I really don't think this
could've been written by someone

90
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,500
who... hadn't lived it.

91
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,041
I can't just be stuck
writing short stories

92
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,250
and reviewing
other people's work

93
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,666
for the rest of my life, Amna.

94
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,375
Do you know how old
Bret Easton Ellis was

95
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,000
when he published
his first novel?

96
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,708
Twenty-one.

97
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,875
Zadie Smith?

98
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,291
I'm already late.

99
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,625
Hi.

100
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,833
Come on in.

101
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,375
Okay.

102
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,750
You're a great kisser.

103
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,666
Thanks.

104
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,541
Sorry, it's a bit messy in here.

105
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
The cleaner is coming tomorrow.

106
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,666
Just got back
from New York this morning.

107
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:02,291
Oh, nice. Erm...
Business or pleasure?

108
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,708
Business, unfortunately.

109
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,750
Always business.

110
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,083
Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, I'd love one.

111
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Wine?

112
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,416
Whatever you're having is great.

113
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,416
Okay, kid.

114
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,708
You've got a beautiful place.
- Thank you.

115
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:36,500
It's just for work days.
The weekends I spend in Kent.

116
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,125
With the family, you know.

117
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh yeah.

118
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,875
Are you gonna make me come?
- Yeah.

119
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,500
Keep going.

120
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,375
Keep going.

121
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,375
[Daniel] Do you
always have sex like that?

122
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,833
Did you like it?

123
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:51,125
You know
the answer.

124
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,291
Do you know...

125
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,375
most of the people
on that website are just awful.

126
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,750
Have you...
had bad experiences?

127
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,875
Disappointments.
- Hm.

128
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,375
It's so rare to find
someone like you on there.

129
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,208
I mean...

130
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,708
people lie about their age.

131
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,750
Or height or dick size.

132
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,083
It's all exaggeration.

133
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,166
Some of them aren't even gay.

134
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,500
Can't get it hard with a man.

135
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:46,041
It's so nice that
not everyone is deceptive.

136
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,250
"Sebastian
stood by the window over London,

137
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,041
looking at both the city and
himself with a new perspective.

138
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,958
As Daniel
casually mentioned his family,

139
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,541
he felt suddenly
complicit in a cliché,

140
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,791
acting out another role, but
one he hadn't cast himself in.

141
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,375
Daniel's hands found him and
pulled at his skin and flesh

142
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,958
as hungrily as a mouth
seeking water in the desert.

143
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,500
He didn't just want [pause],
he needed.

144
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,541
This was the relief he had
from his family,

145
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,500
his job, his other life.

146
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,583
Sebastian in that moment felt
that he was living

147
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,375
more authentically than Daniel."

148
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,208
That's good.
So good.

149
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,583
Did you speak to actual
prostitutes for your research?

150
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,958
I think Gloria
means sex workers.

151
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,916
Yeah. Absolutely.

152
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,875
What initially
drew me to the topic

153
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,333
was a piece I did
for Wall Magazine last year

154
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,125
on students who escort.

155
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,375
I guess I was struck by
how casually some of them

156
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,250
talked about the work. Erm...

157
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,083
They weren't
really ashamed of it at all.

158
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,541
They saw very little stigma
in it anymore.

159
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,250
And some of them had such
a sense of professionalism

160
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:12,208
in the way that they set
themselves up as entrepreneurs

161
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,500
or market themselves online.

162
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,250
There was almost
this erm... sense of pride.

163
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,916
Anyway, I couldn't stop
thinking about

164
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,458
some of the people
I interviewed

165
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,375
and just felt like
I had to write about it.

166
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,041
I thought it was all
OnlyFans now.

167
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,208
Yeah. People do that, too.

168
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,875
But a screen will
never replace touch.

169
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,625
Hm... It's an easier way
to earn though.

170
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,833
Hm,
to cultivate an audience

171
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,750
that'll make you
any significant money

172
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,541
takes a lot of work.
Yeah.

173
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,083
But you don't
physically need to interact.

174
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,541
Yeah, but some people do
just really enjoy sex though.

175
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,708
They might not want videos
of themselves online forever.

176
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,666
I know someone
that used to do it,

177
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,083
when they were young of course.

178
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,750
They didn't mind it.

179
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,916
And I asked her honestly

180
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,625
whether she didn't find
some of the men repulsive.

181
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,166
For her, it wasn't about them,
the clients.

182
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,916
It was about her.
That's just...

183
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,166
The idea that I'm like Patrick
Bateman because I described

184
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,833
a woman-hating man,
that I am that man as well,

185
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,583
is just a load of... bunk.

186
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,625
The book that I had
problems with was the first one

187
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,833
because everyone assumed
it was autobiographical

188
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,625
and my family is really nothing
like the family in that book.

189
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,541
So that was the one I felt
might have been the hardest

190
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,916
for you and Dad to take
because it was erm...

191
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,458
To an outsider it was
the most autobiographical.

192
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,458
I don't think the content
upset me.

193
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,041
The fact that
it was such a tremendous hit

194
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,750
and it affected you so much
at such an early age,

195
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,083
that had much more impact on me

196
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,625
than the content
of what you'd written.

197
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,583
Listen, as a writer

198
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,291
I guess I tend to be a bit of
a sociologist and I guess I tend

199
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,583
to be drawn to things that
are happening in the culture

200
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,000
and incorporate...

201
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,708
I know it's superficial,

202
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,125
but you are a young,
not unattractive guy

203
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,875
and you shouldn't be afraid
to use that.

204
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,750
It's just...

205
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm not really big
on social media.

206
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,458
I find it to be a distraction.

207
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,583
I don't want
anything complicated,

208
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,916
just a couple of quality posts
every week.

209
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,750
I'm afraid nobody gets to say
they're above it these days.

210
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,833
And what about the... novel?

211
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,166
Did you get a chance
to look at the pages?

212
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
I have to say, I wasn't thrilled

213
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,208
when you said you were writing
about sex work.

214
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,958
You're aware there's no shortage
of treatises on the topic.

215
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,208
But...

216
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,083
I think it is alive.

217
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,416
Really intimate.

218
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,458
And you might have found
a fresh perspective on it.

219
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,750
I do realize it is a sort of...

220
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,333
stock character
of queer literature, but...

221
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,000
this new generation
of sex workers

222
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,375
are all using technology.

223
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,708
The digital hustler.

224
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,625
Yeah. Something like that.
- Hm.

225
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,625
Unfortunately,
I can't offer you an advance,

226
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,500
but it would be fantastic
if after the stories

227
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,125
we can get your debut novel
published already next year.

228
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,666
How soon do you think
you could get me a full draft?

229
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,958
Erm... Couple of months?
- Oh really. That soon?

230
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,166
Don't want to rush it.
- Yeah.

231
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,750
I've got to do more research.
Erm, interviews.

232
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,333
Yes. I understand.

233
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,583
Sorry.

234
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,250
Did you have any notes
on the pages?

235
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:13,166
Yes.

236
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,583
There was one bigger thing
I've been wondering about.

237
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,791
Have you thought about
setting it in the first person?

238
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,666
Almost like a memoir.

239
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,083
A pseudo memoir.

240
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,791
It's not something
I'd thought about.

241
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,125
I mean, it might not work.

242
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,916
I just think
there's something there.

243
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,500
♪ Dancing,
Dancing with the lights out ♪

244

00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,250

00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,708
- Get the door. Get the door.
- I got it.

250
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:10,083
This calls for celebration.

251
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,250
It's just a couple
of chapters so far.

252
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,791
Max, it's gonna be amazing.

253
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,500
I have faith in you.

Hi.

258
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,083
Have we met?

259
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,291
Don't think so.

260
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,666
Where do you go to uni?
You look so familiar.

261
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,041
UCL, but I finished
a while ago, so...

262
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,791
What's your name?

263
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,500
Erm... Max. I'm Max.

264
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,250
Are you sure?

265
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,708
Hey. Let me just grab my jacket.
I'll come for a smoke.

266
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,125
Erm... Actually,
I'm gonna have to go.

267
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,833
I just remembered
I've got a deadline.

268
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:38,250
Oh... Grindr calls.
- It's... It's not that.

269
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,791
Well,
it was very nice to meet you.

270
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,416
So, I read your new pages.

271
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,958
I think the character
is really intriguing

272
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,375
and your prose is vivid as ever,

273
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:20,500
but I just wonder if
it gets a little repetitive.

274
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,708
This series of the same kinds
of erm... encounters

275
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,583
with generally
always older men.

276
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,916
I'm just wondering
what it might look like

277
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,125
to see him in a slightly
different situation.

278
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,875
Only to give it
a bit more variety

279
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:38,416
and maybe to explore how
he might react to a new context.

280
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,083
Also, I was just a little thrown

281
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,000
by the bit
about Sebastian's erm...

282
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,250
intermittent feelings
of shame and the erm...

283
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,000
how did you put it...

284
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,750
shame about shame,
which definitely makes sense,

285
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,583
but it's just
that I thought you said

286
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,875
you were struck by
how little shame

287
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,791
your interviewers felt.

288
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,125
I'll send you
my new chapters tonight.

289
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:03,291
Anxious to get your thoughts
before the submission.

290
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,875
Hey, Sebastian.
- Hi.

291
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,958
Glad you could make it.
Come on through.

292
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,250
We got friends over.
I hope you don't mind.

293
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:23,333
Oh... Nice, Sam.
Hello.

294
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,916
What's your name, son?
Come on in.

295
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,625
Can I fix you a drink?

296
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,958
We have vodka,
gin, wine. Erm, I think...

297
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,208
Or would you prefer a shot?

298
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,333
Actually, I think I'm gonna go.

299
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,583
No. No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

300
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,708
Stay. Please.

301
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:49,333
You didn't tell me it was
a group thing. I don't do that.

302
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,958
Why not?

303
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,333
Please, stay.

304
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,500
I'll make it
worth your while

305
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,583
if that's what
you're worried about.

306
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,166
It's late.

307
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,166
We'll have fun. I promise.

308
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,125
You didn't want it?

309
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,125
You put more
in yours.

310
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:25,916
Okay. I don't see well.
And after, you drink slowly.

311
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,416
So erm... where did you
come from tonight?

312
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:34,083
Just from home.
And where's home?

313
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,000
Erm... East.

314
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,875
Phone, please.
You get it back when you go.

315
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,083
We put them away
when we party. House rules.

316
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,208
Just so everyone can
relax. It's to protect us all.

317
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,333
Yeah, you know.
From any sneaky pornographers.

318
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,375
Or rather, it's because
our lovely hosts here

319
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:58,000
wouldn't want to be pictured
with the likes of you, Jacopo.

320
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,125
Fuck you.
- Hey, whoa. Careful. Come on.

321
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,625
Turn it off if you want.

322
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,875
I'm just going
to put it in a drawer.

323
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,916
Okay.

324
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,750
Want some?

325
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,541
What is it?

326
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,791
Mephedrone.

327
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,375
Do you notice the difference?

328
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,375
I didn't say.

329
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:41,208
The other one wasn't bad, but
this stuff is a lot speedier.

330
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,833
Are you okay?
You weren't in the meeting.

331
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:34,083
I need your piece ASAP
and your questions for Bret.

332
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,500
Are you not coming in
at all today?

333
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,875
Give me a call
when you get this, please.

334
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,125
So tell us, where
did you come from tonight?

335
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,375
Fuck him. Fuck him.

336
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,708
Like it, Carlo?

337
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,291
Oh fuck.
- It's good, right? Yeah.

338
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,125
I think
they enjoyed that.

339
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,500
You're new to this, aren't you?

340
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,916
So have you erm...

341
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,458
been here before?

342
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,166
Yeah, I've been over
a couple of times.

343
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,750
They like to get trashed
once a month or so.

344
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,583
Who are they?

345
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,000
Like, what do they do?

346
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,833
Both lawyers.
Hence the phones.

347
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,333
I have no idea what kind, but...

348
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,875
they can afford to be generous.

349
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,708
Where did he find you?

350
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,583
Erm...

351
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:13,083
Dreamy... guys.

352
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,791
Yeah, I can see
why he picked you.

353
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,916
We should collab, you know.

354
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,875
OnlyFans.

355
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,166
I don't think I want
to be that erm... public.

356
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,708
You'd do so well though.

357
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,833
Do you think so?
- Hm.

358
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,166
Yeah.

359
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:50,458
You've got that wholesome
boy-next-door thing going on.

360
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,333
But it's all filth underneath.

361
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,291
Why don't you think about it.
Hm?

362
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,750
What I find interesting now

363
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:23,083
is that there is this kind
of anti-sex thing going on

364
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,458
in a way in terms of... In a
lot of the reviews in America,

365
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,083
they complained about
how much sex was in the book,

366
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,958
which surprised me because
I don't think it was that much.

367
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,166
Morning.
- Hey.

368
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:40,000
Max. Good to see you.
- Hi.

369
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:43,750
Meeting's in five.
- Yeah. Thanks.

370
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,166
Amna is doing
the Rachel Cusk interview,

371
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:49,083
Fazel has
the Design Biennale. Max...

372
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:52,041
Erm... I've got Bret.
Change of plans.

373
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:55,750
You're going to Ecotec today
for the app launch.

374
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,125
Erm...
But I'm interviewing Bret.

375
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,375
No. James
is taking care of Bret.

376
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,833
But erm...
Max is like an expert.

377
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,166
He was here on Friday
for the LLF meeting

378
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,500
and has prepared for it.

379
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,541
But that's not even our section.

380
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:17,333
What makes the existence
of this magazine possible?

381
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,833
Do you think
literature pays for itself?

382
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,250
And please hurry up
with the Slimani review.

383
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,750
It should've gone up by now.

384
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,250
I know, it's fucked up.

385
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:34,500
But... why didn't you
come in on Friday?

386
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,666
I told you.

387
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,708
I hooked up with someone and
I fell asleep at their place.

388
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:48,875
You know, I really could've
used your feedback on my pages.

389
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,375
Fuck, erm...

390
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:58,916
I'm sorry. I'll look at them
tonight. I promise.

391
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:03,166
I've already submitted it.
The deadline was yesterday?

392
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,291
...intuitive interface,

393
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,208
so all you'll be doing
is swiping left or right,

394
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,500
which I'm sure
you can all manage.

395
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,083
This time the best part is
that you won't even have

396
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,541
to take an awkward stranger
out for a drink.

397
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,875
Now, we have spots
in our software

398
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:31,250
where you can share ideas,
brainstorm,

399
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,000
make parking lots for
your research and development...

400
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,166
So this is Max
from Wall Magazine.

401
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,666
Joan, our Head Developer.

402
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,250
Pleasure to meet you, Max.
- Hi.

403
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,583
Shall we sit down over here?

404
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,166
Yeah.

405
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,791
Where do we begin?

406
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,250
Has anybody demonstrated
to you how the app works?

407
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,958
Yeah, they have.

408
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,916
I can tell you more about
the development process

409
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:13,208
or how we came about our
user interface, or the design.

410
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,041
Actually, I think erm...

411
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,125
I've got enough.

412
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,166
Oh no, you really want
to talk to Joan about this.

413
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,166
She pretty much spearheaded
the project.

414
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,916
It's not necessary.
The presentation

415
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,583
covered everything, so...
I'm gonna have to be off.

416
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,166
Thank you so much.

417
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,458
No. I'm sorry.
We're not done here.

418
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,791
Joan needs
to be a part of this piece.

419
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,208
Did you find
your way here okay?

420
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,208
Yeah. No problems.

421
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:12,250
I know it can be a little
unintuitive from the station.

422
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,833
Where did you say
you live again?

423
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,916
In Hackney.
- Oh right, yes.

424
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,250
Hackney has really come up,
hasn't it?

425
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,583
It wasn't that long ago
no one wanted to go near it,

426
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,166
let alone live there.

427
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:29,750
I remember when it was just
gangs and drug dealers and...

428
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,958
Can I offer you a drink?

429
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:38,000
I've opened some Primitivo.

430
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,708
I'm grateful to have had
my career when I did.

431
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,708
Starting out in the seventies
was an absolute joy.

432
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,791
Tertiary education was free.

433
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:54,833
The pursuit of knowledge was
regarded as an end in itself.

434
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:00,166
Speaking
with post-doctorates now,

435
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,250
the situation seems just dire.

436
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:06,166
I don't know how they manage
to cope with all that...

437
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,625
uncertainty and debt.

438
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,916
You're erm...
studying, aren't you?

439
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,083
I thought
your profile mentioned that.

440
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,333
Yeah, erm...

441
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm doing my masters.
- Oh, what in?

442
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,458
French literature.

443
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,125
That's wonderful.

444
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:40,583
I used to lecture
in comparative literature.

445
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,208
Do you know what you're going
to do your thesis on yet?

446
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,166
Yeah. I think so, erm...

447
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,333
But I don't want to bore you.
- Oh, you couldn't.

448
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,041
I live for that stuff.

449
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,416
I haven't...

450
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:13,708
Sorry, could we just
keep talking for now?

451
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:21,125
Are you sure?

452
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,958
Please.

453
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:44,083
I just want to get to know you
better first. There's no rush.

454
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:46,000
I hope you're all as excited
and as honored as I am

455
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,500
to welcome
onto the stage tonight

456
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,916
an author whose
decade-spanning body of work

457
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,375
has not only left
an indelible mark

458
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,208
on 20th
and 21st century literature,

459
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,791
but someone who I can also say

460
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,333
has had a profound influence
on the way

461
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,458
many writers of my generation,
myself included,

462
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,916
have come to view the role
of the writer in society.

463
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,958
Please join me
in welcoming onto the stage

464
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:15,958
the winner of both the
Goncourt and Booker Prizes,

465
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,416
the author of the devastatingly
brilliant Blackwater,

466
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:23,833
her 18th novel, Alina Casaro.

467
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,916
I mean,

468
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,666
you were fucking incredible.

469
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:39,250
That question
about the influence of erm...

470
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,708
Oh no no no.
I don't want to talk to her.

471
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,416
After she rejected
my manuscript. So embarrassing.

472
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,375
Max, hi.
- Hi.

473
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,833
Erm... Amna, is it?
- Yes.

474
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,000
Brilliant job on that Q&A.
- Oh, thank you.

475
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,541
You really managed
to drill down deeply.

476
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,000
Thanks.

477
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:04,083
I've got to ask.
How did you randle that?

478
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,833
Oh well...
I interviewed her for Wall

479
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,583
and then she asked me
to interview her here.

480
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,166
Max, I've got a couple of people
indoor

481
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,625
that I'd really love you
to meet,

482
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,041
if you can spare him
for a moment.

483
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,208
Yes, be my guest.
- Okay.

484
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:24,208
Erm... Amna, why don't you
come by the office.

485
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,916
We can have a chat about
whatever you're working on.

486
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,250
Yeah. That'd be great.

487
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,333
I'm always on the lookout
for a fresh voice like yours.

488
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,875
Brilliant.

489
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,750
Ready?

490
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,750
Just so you're aware,

491
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:43,583
Joy is on the panel
for the Polari Prize. Okay?

492
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:48,083
Hi. Can I please introduce Max.

493
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,750
He's one
of our latest discoveries.

494
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,083
Ian.
- Hi.

495
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,541
Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

496
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,750
Ian runs the London Review.
- Wow.

497
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:56,208
Dionne
is being far too generous.

498
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,041
I merely oversee it nowadays.

499
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,291
I leave the daily business to...

500
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,791
well, to the younger generation.

501
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:04,500
Joy is with the Arts Council.
- Hello.

502
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:06,458
Lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

503
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,791
So, what are you working on?
- A couple of things

504
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,583
at the moment. Erm...

505
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,166
We're really proud
to be publishing

506
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,541
some of Max's short stories.

507
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:20,041
He's already had one in Granta
a few months ago

508
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:24,375
and another has been
nominated for the Bridport.

509
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,583
That's wonderful.
- Oh, good. Well done.

510
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,500
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

511
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,291
And currently, he's working hard
on quite a tantalizing novel

512
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:35,333
that we're hoping to publish
next year, all going well.

513
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,708
No doubt we'll be covering
you on our pages soon.

514
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,708
Certainly one for the radar.

515
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,500
You look awfully young
to be getting published.

516
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,583
How old are you, Max?
- I am twenty-five.

517
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,041
Oh... Well, perfection.

518
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,875
So, what's your novel about?

519
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:58,500
Erm, it's about a student
who erm...

520
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,916
who...

521
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:08,750
It's about sex work
in the digital age.

522
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,916
Good, good.

523
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,958
Max is exploring it
as perhaps just another job

524
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:17,375
amongst many other jobs
in the gig economy.

525
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:22,583
Erm... I... I just remembered
that I've left something.

526
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,416
I'm so sorry, I will have
to excuse myself, erm...

527
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:29,208
I'm sorry. Thanks.

528
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,416
...it's not very fluffy.
What can she do?

529
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,791
So that's Emily's idea
of a dilemma, is it?

530
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,791
She's got a busy life,

531
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,541
she wants to make
a nice cake for her party.

532
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,375
So in the morning,
she's bothering people

533
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,041
with that sponge cake.

534
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,958
Oh, you know...
It is true.

535
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,708
Hi, Mum.

536
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,750
Yeah, I'm good.

537
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:52,958
How are you?

538
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,375
You're already in bed?

539
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:09,625
All right then. Yeah, that's
fine. I can call tomorrow.

540
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:16,333
No. Nothing's the matter.
Don't worry.

541
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:25,833
Yeah. Okay.

542
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,500
Good night.

543
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:33,916
Love you.

544
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,458
Yeah, it had
almost a dystopian vibe to it.

545
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,416
Yeah.

546
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:55,583
I thought it was very honest.
So thank you for that, Joel.

547
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:01,333
Okay, let's move on to Max.

548
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:04,708
What do you have for us today?

549
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:09,125
"Although no one seemed
to have been able

550
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,541
to detect the signs
leading up to it,

551
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,958
they were all afterwards
in mournful apprehension

552
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,875
that they had been there.

553
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,750
Everywhere. Undetected like
an odorless, poisonous gas.

554
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,375
The morning had been routine.

555
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,333
Another identical link

556
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,208
in a chain of silvery
summer days at Dunbar."

557
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,625
There we go, guys. Cheers.

558
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:34,833
I liked your poem.

559
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,541
Yeah?

560
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,125
Yeah.

561
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:43,041
It captured that sense
of urban loneliness really well.

562
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:48,875
Did it... resonate with you?

563
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:55,500
I doubt those feelings
are entirely foreign to anyone

564
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,083
who's single in London.

565
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,125
What happened to...

566
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,750
what was his name? Sebastian.

567
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,083
I don't know. I just...

568
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:18,333
I felt like that story
wasn't going anywhere new.

569
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,458
I didn't know
where to take it next.

570
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,291
I wanted to hear more.

571
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,791
Do you like that?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

572
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:33,166
Do you like my cock?
- Yeah, fuck me.

573
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,500
Stop.

574
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:49,416
Please, stop.
Stop, stop. Slow down.

575
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,125
Sorry.
That's okay.

576
00:53:54,416 --> 00:54:00,791
It's all right. Don't worry.

577
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:12,416
It's not a porno.

578
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,291
Did you and Dad
get round to watching that show

579
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,250
I told you about?

580
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:03,833
We started it, but I had to turn
it off after fifteen minutes.

581
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,625
I don't know why every program
nowadays has to be like that.

582
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,250
Just so vulgar.

583
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:12,083
Oh, Mum.
You should have stuck with it.

584
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,541
Do you have anything
for the wash?

585
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,208
No.

586
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,541
I read your story.

587
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,416
I thought it was very beautiful.

588
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,708
Which one do you mean?

589
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,958
<i>His Breath</i>.
The one in the magazine.

590
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,166
How did you...

591
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,541
I do know how to use
the internet, you know.

592
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:04,416
I thought it was very touching.

593
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,625
But...

594
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:13,541
It made me worry about you.

595
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,250
But it's fiction, Mum.

596
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,916
But it has to come
from somewhere, doesn't it?

597
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:30,958
I just worry about you

598
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,250
being by yourself in London.

599
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,541
I have friends.

600
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:44,375
Has there been
anybody else since...

601
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,833
You never talk
about these things.

602
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:55,458
No, because I have honestly
got to focus on work right now.

603
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,083
I should be staff
at the magazine soon.

604
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,500
They've got a new position
coming up.

605
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:08,083
Do you have to write
about such personal things?

606
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:13,875
You do have the right
to keep some things

607
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:16,125
just for yourself, you know.

608
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,583
Hey.

609
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,541
I've sent you the version
with the latest edits.

610
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,833
We've picked the images
and they're in Proof now.

611
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:36,041
I'll get started
with the Husmann review next.

612
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:38,083
Max, come in.

613
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,375
I've got some
not great news for you.

614
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,833
Our editorial board, now that
we have a new staff editor...

615
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,791
You mean James.

616
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:03,916
They are looking to shift their
emphasis away from freelancers.

617
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:08,375
So unfortunately, the pieces
that we discussed for next month

618
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:12,375
are going to be done in-house.
- Right.

619
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:16,416
So is there anything
for me to do?

620
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,291
I'm afraid not.

621
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,791
Sorry, but wasn't my piece
one of the most read last month

622
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,541
and the month before that too?

623
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:31,291
Max, I get the feeling
that our magazine

624
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:34,041
hasn't exactly been
your top priority of late,

625
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,833
so I wouldn't want us
to keep you

626
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:40,125
away from whatever it is
you'd rather be doing.

627
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:44,416
I'm sorry this didn't work out.

628
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,416
I get the sense
that she can't handle

629
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:57,750
having anyone with any
other prospects on the team,

630
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,958
like anyone with anything other
than a shitty collection

631
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,833
of poetry to their name.

632
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,708
You could ask Steven if
they've got anything at Glamour.

633
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:12,791
I know it's not exactly
Granta, but... it's money.

634
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,750
Do you really think that will
go down well with my publisher?

635
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:17,958
Glamour isn't exactly compatible

636
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,791
with being a serious writer,
is it?

637
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,666
Hm... Yeah.

638
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,500
You know what,
you should erm...

639
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,833
I think you should use
a pseudonym.

640
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:31,958
No one need know after all
it's by the Max Williamson.

641
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,250
I've got to focus
on my fiction anyway.

642
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,208
And live on what?

643
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,375
It's not like you've got
an advance or anything.

644
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,708
What did you see tonight?

645
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:18,291
It was <i>The Goat</i> by Edward Albee.

646
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,833
Oh yeah.
- Are you familiar?

647
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,208
No. I've...

648
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,333
not had a chance to see it yet.

649
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,166
I'd like to though.

650
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:33,541
But I couldn't help thinking
that for all its ingenuity

651
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:37,375
and brilliant allusion
to Greek tragedy,

652
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,708
the play just didn't move me.

653
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:44,166
Whereas with
Tennessee Williams, well...

654
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,875
I saw yet another production of
<i>The Glass Menagerie</i> last week.

655
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,333
Seeing their work
almost back-to-back

656
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,125
forces you to compare.

657
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,791
Is this a...

658
01:01:57,791 --> 01:01:59,875
a Schiele?

659
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:02,958
A very lucky find back in
the day.

660
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,916
I like all of your pictures.

661
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,708
I've managed to collect
a few things over the years.

662
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,333
But really, it's a wealthier
person's hobby.

663
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:19,250
No, no. You...
You've got a beautiful home.

664
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,875
It's a bit big for one, but...

665
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,625
I've decided to stay.

666
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:33,083
So, you write as well then.

667
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:38,208
Or are you more of
an aficionado, like me?

668
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:42,208
I'm studying. I told you that.

669
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,250
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

670
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:53,000
I mean, I had quite a shock
myself that night.

671
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:56,083
I have been offline for a bit.
- I noticed.

672
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,541
I hope not on my account.

673
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:05,875
And it goes without saying
that this is between us.

674
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:11,250
Nothing leaves this room,
this house. So don't worry.

675
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,083
To be honest erm...

676
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,375
I was a little surprised
to hear from you again.

677
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:26,500
That night that I was here,
erm... I'm sorry...

678
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:29,250
No. No need to apologies.

679
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:32,666
I was on edge myself.
Too tense.

680
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,750
I'm pretty much of a novice

681
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:40,500
in case you didn't realize.

682
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,125
So...

683
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,541
Is it poetry or prose you write?

684
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,375
I still do occasional work
editing textbooks.

685
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:03,500
I still get invited
to these things.

686
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,833
I'm only asking out of
genuine interest, you know.

687
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,791
I do write.

688
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:18,750
Mainly just short stories.

689
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,166
Anything I can read?

690
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,333
Not so fast.

691
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:34,083
I need to get to know you
a little better first.

692
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,375
Touché.

693
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:57,750
You remind me of someone. Thirty
years ago, when he was your age.

694
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,458
It's something
about the way you laugh.

695
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,458
The tenor of your voice.

696
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,333
Chin up a little bit.

697
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:12,500
Okay. No, not
so sultry. Thoughtful, not sexy.

698
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,583
It's a serious subject
you're writing about, yeah?

699
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,291
Yeah.

700
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:20,541
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

701
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,458
Oh, that's stunning.
I love this one.

702
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,500
Can we get a couple more
very close up?

703
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,375
Yeah, sure.

704
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:35,875
Yeah.
Max, what's your Insta?

705
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:39,875
Erm... It's @maximes.

706
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,833
But I've not really got many
followers or anything, so...

707
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,208
We're going to fix that.

708
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:47,291
We'll do a big feature
on our Instagram.

709
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,125
Once this comes out,

710
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,375
your face is gonna be
on the top of everyone's feed.

711
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,541
Les Nuits Fauves.

712
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,958
Oh, that certainly
sparked debate in my seminars.

713
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,333
I know some people
view him as immoral.

714
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,458
Or selfish.

715
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,666
Unlikable.

716
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:36,833
But I think it's a beautiful
account of a kind of... joy.

717
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,333
Even in the face of death,

718
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:43,666
against the tyranny of Aids
and homophobia...

719
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:50,958
I think there's great beauty in
his refusal to give up on life.

720
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:56,291
His continued desire
to taste everything until the...

721
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:59,000
very end.

722
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,000
What?

723
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,083
Can I ask you a question?

724
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,166
Why is it that you do this?

725
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:32,291
I don't imagine there are
many boys on that website

726
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:37,833
who are published in Granta or
nominated for literary prizes.

727
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:43,875
Are you saying
that I shouldn't be here?

728
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:47,833
No. No, not at all.

729
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:54,291
You know, there's not much
money in writing fiction.

730
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,750
Or writing full stop.

731
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,416
No, I don't imagine there is.

732
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:06,208
But is it really just
about the money for you?

733
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,833
Erm...

734
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,916
No.

735
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:18,416
It's not that simple.

736
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:32,166
We met in California
in the early nineties.

737
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:35,666
I still wasn't out.

738
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,208
The only time I plucked up
courage to meet anyone

739
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,375
was on work trips.

740
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:44,416
That too became a frightening
business because of Aids.

741
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,791
Yeah, of course.

742
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:54,791
So how did you meet?

743
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,791
I had the afternoon off
from my conference

744
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:03,250
and had gone to spend it
at the Getty Villa.

745
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,833
It really is a marvellous place.

746
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,625
You should go
if you haven't been.

747
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:15,041
I was looking at this sculpture,
the Victorious Youth,

748
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:17,500
lost in admiration,

749
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,166
when suddenly I heard,

750
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,625
"Cute ass, isn't it?"

751
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,208
Turning round,

752
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,625
I saw David for the first time.

753
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:33,833
Smiling his cheeky smile.
So handsome.

754
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,875
We got into conversation,

755
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:40,666
went for lunch, had drinks,

756
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,333
an unforgettable night
in my hotel.

757
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,625
Three days later,

758
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:54,208
I flew back to London
and David came with me,

759
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,458
and never left.

760
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:01,375
Until one day,
twenty-nine years later,

761
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:04,000
he was taken away.

762
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:11,583
It'll be three years
next month.

763
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,375
A stroke.

764
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,125
He went as suddenly
as he had appeared.

765
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:35,458
Oh... Our time is almost over.

766
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,750
I'd like to stay.

767
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:47,083
Well, you know I'd love that,
but really I can't afford...

768
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,708
Not him.

769
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,125
Me.

770
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:22,083
I've seen the proofs
from the Evening Standard piece.

771
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,041
Really good shots,
don't you think?

772
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,333
They're great. I'll see if we
can get one for the dust jacket.

773
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,333
The interview's good too.

774
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,500
I love that thing you said...
What was it?

775
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,500
"I carve out my existence in the
world using words. They are..."

776
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:35,833
They are the footsteps
I leave in my wake.

777
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,208
Beautiful.
- Yeah.

778
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:41,291
It's not too lyrical?

779
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,750
No, it's just what we needed.

780
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,041
Fingers crossed
it gets the review it deserves.

781
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,625
Shouldn't be a problem.
Larry is doing it.

782
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,833
I think he'll have a real
appreciation for your style.

783
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:56,250
So have you read the draft?
- Yes.

784
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,041
Ben's had a look at it too.

785
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,333
I'm gonna be honest because

786
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,291
we want to get this out
as soon as possible

787
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,375
after the short stories
while you're still fresh

788
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,375
in everybody's mind.

789
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:13,708
This erm...
whole new thread with...

790
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:17,041
Oh, what's the character's name?
The older gentleman.

791
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,083
Jonathan.

792
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,208
I'm not sure about it.

793
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,625
But it's the heart...
- Don't you think it's...

794
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:29,083
somehow too romantic in a way?

795
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:34,791
Is Sebastian, who has been
so consumed by sex until now,

796
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:38,500
really about to become all
<i>Harold and Maude</i> with this guy?

797
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:42,583
I'm trying to show that
he's moved beyond that initial,

798
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,541
more superficial interest

799
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:49,541
in sex work to... to this deeper
appreciation of its meaning.

800
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,458
I can see
that's what you're trying to do.

801
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:56,291
But you spend so much time now
on this one relationship,

802
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:58,791
I fear it's losing focus.

803
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:02,416
Don't get me wrong.
It started off brilliantly.

804
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:03,916
Really exciting stuff.

805
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:07,000
I'd just like you
to continue in that vein.

806
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:11,875
It's just, I really feel
like I'm discovering...

807
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,916
something deeper here.

808
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:20,208
These exchanges between
escorts and their clients.

809
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:21,625
They are really important,

810
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,000
connecting generations
of gay men

811
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:29,166
that might have not had
much to do with each other

812
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:33,500
and thus they're transmitting
queer history and culture and...

813
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,000
That's something
I want to talk about.

814
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:38,916
But that's not what we
discussed originally, is it?

815
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,416
You've veered
from your proposal.

816
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:43,916
An authentic portrait
of contemporary sex work.

817
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,916
The reality
of what life is like...

818
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:49,750
But it's grounded in reality.
It's all based on research.

819
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,500
From my interviews.

820
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:58,583
I'm sorry. I just don't think
our audiences will like it.

821
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,750
You need to bring
something more to it, Max.

822
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:06,416
Find a way to raise the stakes.
- I don't want it to be

823
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:10,208
just another tragic
sex worker's story. Not at all.

824
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:12,375
And nobody is asking you
to do that.

825
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:19,083
Look, we already know that
you've mastered the short story.

826
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:22,000
But this is a novel.
You have to remember that.

827
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,791
It is a different beast
entirely.

828
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:30,625
As it is,
I'm afraid it's not working.

829
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:35,000
It scares me. I don't know...

830
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,708
It's as if I have a cold heart.

831
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,000
Have you never fallen
in love with a boy?

832
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:43,500
Yes.

833
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,500
Then why aren't you with him?

834
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:49,958
I don't know. It's my fault.
I didn't know what I was doing.

835
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,250
Think of him a lot?

836
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,750
Sometimes.
I don't want to talk about it.

837
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,583
If I were you,
I'd listen to the people

838
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,000
who've done this
100 times before

839
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,750
and are giving you
this opportunity.

840
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,333
Yeah, but I don't think
that she actually gets it.

841
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,375
They're drawn
to totally different aspects,

842
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:11,000
to this more
superficial version.

843
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,500
Sure, but it really
doesn't matter

844
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:13,916
how amazing your version is

845
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,625
if no one gets to read it.

846
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,916
That'll be 28 pounds
when you're ready.

847
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:53,541
Sorry.

848
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,000
Thanks.

849
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:24,166
There's something
I really think we should see,

850
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:25,666
erm...

851
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:28,375
The week after next
it's coming on.

852
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:31,791
I think it...

853
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,500
The inside pocket
of your jacket.

854
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,583
I'll see you again
next Thursday.

855
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,875
Next week erm...

856
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:12,291
may be a bit tricky.

857
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:19,250
I've got a lot of work on at the
moment with the writing, so...

858
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:23,958
Of course.

859
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:28,166
But I'll let you know though.

860
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,916
Whenever it suits.

861
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,916
Welcome
aboard the 10:45 Eurostar

862
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,458
to Brussels Midi.

863
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,250
The restaurant-bar
is located in carriage 4.

864
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:53,000
We will arrive
at our destination

865
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,625
at 1:45 p.m.

866
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:57,333
We wish you a pleasant journey.

867
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,250
It's really good to see you.

868
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:29,958
Ah, Mr Larson.
Nice to see you again.

869
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:32,791
Just follow me, please.

870
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:37,041
How are you?
- Very good. Thank you.

871
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,041
So they all know you here.

872
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:06,125
Yeah.

873
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:12,291
I like to come here
whenever I'm in town.

874
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,375
Yeah, I love their food.

875
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:21,291
Though I always seem
to have the same meal. Yeah.

876
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,000
But never the same company.

877
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:30,041
No, erm...

878
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:32,083
Well...

879
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,375
If I find something I like,

880
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,041
I want to have it again.

881
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,750
So what are your family doing
this weekend?

882
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:53,916
Just...

883
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:57,166
keeping themselves company,
I suppose.

884
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,875
Have they ever been to Brussels?

885
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:06,208
Well...

886
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:11,708
I don't think
they're very interested.

887
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,500
Would you like some more wine?

888
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,791
Yes, please.

889
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:20,208
Thank you.

890
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,500
Perhaps another bottle?

891
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:25,541
Erm...

892
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:27,458
Why not.

893
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:02,625
Sorry, I'm not feeling too well.

894
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:06,166
I think I had
a bit too much to drink.

895
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:10,833
Go get
some water then.

896
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:13,500
I'm tired.

897
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:20,625
It's okay. It's okay.

898
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,375
Can we just wait until morning?

899
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,791
Do I have to remind
you who is paying for this?

900
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,958
Can you at least get a condom?

901
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,291
Please.

902
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:18,875
Max?

903
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:20,458
Max!

904
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:26,708
We haven't got all day.

905
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:52,625
Can you at least get a condom?

906
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:32,291
What the fuck is this?

907
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,583
Oh fuck. Erm...

908
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,458
"And in that moment,
Sebastian realised

909
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:45,291
that to try to fight back

910
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:49,250
would have been fruitless,
or dangerous even."

911
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:53,625
That is not what happened!
What the fuck is this?

912
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,500
It's just for myself.
It's nothing.

913
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:58,125
I should have known.
Never trust a whore.

914
01:29:58,291 --> 01:29:59,541
Sorry. Give my laptop.
- Get out.

915
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,125
It's nothing.
- Please. Get out.

916
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:03,333
Give my laptop back.
- Get the fuck out.

917
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,291
Can I have my laptop?
- Get the fuck out.

918
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:08,625
Just give it.
- Now!

919
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:12,208
- Get... out!

920
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,875
Give me my stuff.
- I'll give you your stuff.

921
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:19,750
- Out. Now.

922
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:25,000
Fucking whore!

923
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:50,541
Fuck.

924
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,416
Do you have my wallet?
I need it.

925
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:13,000
Daniel!

926
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,916
Sir? Sir, please.

927
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,416
You need to stop.
You are disturbing the guests.

928
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:25,541
I left my wallet.
- Sir, please.

929
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,291
I want you to leave.
Reception can sort it out.

930
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,333
I need to get in...

931
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,625
Good afternoon, Mr Larson.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

932
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,166
I have a young man
in front of me

933
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:38,208
who wants access to your room.

934
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:41,708
He's looking for his wallet.
He says his name is Sebastian.

935
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:43,166
Do you know him?

936
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,750
No?

937
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:50,083
No, he's lying.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

938
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,875
I'm so sorry to have
disturbed you. Thank you. Bye.

939
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:56,250
There's nothing more I can do.
- He's a liar.

940
01:31:56,416 --> 01:31:59,000
Your colleagues have literally
seen me here before.

941
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,875
I'm sorry.
If you're not booking a room,

942
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,416
I have to ask you to leave.

943
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,875
Are you kidding?
That's fucking ridiculous.

944
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,666
I've been here before!
- Please, sir, calm down.

945
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:11,416
Sorry. I can't do anything.
- Call him again.

946
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,750
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

947
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,583
Hi, Mum.

948
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:06,958
<i>Hi, Max.
Why are you not picking up?</i>

949
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:10,500
<i>I've been trying
to get through to you.</i>

950
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:12,958
I was just in the cinema.

951
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:17,291
<i>Why am I getting
a strange dialling tone?</i>

952
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:19,708
<i>Where are you?</i>

953
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:25,958
Erm...
I'm in Brussels, with Amna.

954
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:28,125
<i>In Brussels?</i>

955
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:33,250
Sorry, I didn't get the chance
to tell you.

956
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:36,833
It was so last minute. Erm...

957
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:40,500
Amna got a deal on
Eurostar tickets, so... erm...

958
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,875
She took me here
for the weekend.

959
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:46,416
A late birthday present.

960
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,958
<i>That was really nice of her.</i>

961
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,166
<i>Listen, your dad and I
were just calling to say</i>

962
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:56,750
<i>that we had read that piece
in the Evening Standard.</i>

963
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:01,625
<i>You came across
really, really well.</i>

964
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:07,166
<i>I am so proud of you, Max.</i>

965
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:10,666
Yeah.

966
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,708
That's great.

967
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,375
<i>You spoke so beautifully.</i>

968
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:20,166
Bye.
- <i>Bye, darling.</i>

969
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:27,083
Closing time.

970
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,916
Closing time.

971
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,416
Get going. We are closing up.

972
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,208
Move along. We're closing.

It's not far.

996

Yes. I'd like that.

01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:23,250
But that'll be 200.

998
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,666
What?

999
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:29,250
It's 200.

1000
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,583
Hey, this is Amna.

1001
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,958
I can't pick up now,
but please leave a message

1002
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:54,500
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Thanks.

1003
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,875
Hello?

1004
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:29,166
Sebastian?

1005
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:32,958
Are you there?

1006
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:35,875
Is everything all right?

1007
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:05,750
I've always been rather
fond of the name Jonathan.

1008
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,041
I'm going to tell my publisher

1009
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,166
that I'm scrapping
the whole project.

1010
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:17,125
They never even liked
that section anyway.

1011
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,125
Do you not hate me?

1012
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:35,416
For using you like that?

1013
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:39,041
No, I don't.

1014
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:46,583
You need to carry on
and finish it.

1015
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
What I would hate you for
is not publishing it.

1016
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:55,500
And...

1017
01:40:56,416 --> 01:41:00,833
if I can help in any way,
and heaven forbid,

1018
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:05,750
be an inspiration to you,

1019
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:08,666
I couldn't be more thrilled.

1020
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:14,875
It's good.

1021
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:38,750
There are fresh towels
in the bathroom.

1022
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:14,666
Really nice to meet you, Max.
- You too.

1023
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:25,000
Have a good rest of the day.

1024
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:39,333
I'm really excited
about our conversation.

1025
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,750
Your book is one of
my favorites of this year.

1026
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:45,583
Thank you.

1027
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:49,375
I'll begin by introducing
and welcoming everyone

1028
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,875
and then if you just want
to follow out after me

1029
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:53,250
and get seated

1030
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:55,458
once I introduce you.
- Yeah.

1031
01:45:55,708 --> 01:45:58,125
Did you get a chance
to look at the questions?

1032
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:02,208
I did, yeah.
- And did they all seem okay?

1033
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:04,500
I mean, if there is anything
you don't feel

1034
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:06,041
comfortable discussing...

1035
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:11,416
or if anything feels
too personal, please tell me.

1036
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,875
