like I'm nagging at you ,

105

but don't you think it's time

106
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:42,004
I met your friend
down at the Onyx?

107
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:46,208
It's been a month
since you told him about me.

108
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:50,604
And I know
'cause that was the night

00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:54,050
Velma Kelly plugged
her husband and her sister.

110
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:58,881
You know they say that she found
'em in the kip together?

111
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:02,825
Gosh , if I ever found Amos
slipping it to somebody else. . .

112
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:06,763
I'd throw him a great big
going-away party.

113
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,493
It's getting late.

114
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,660
I have been thinking a lot
about my act.

115
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:14,331
Whenever I get a good idea
I write it in my diary.

116
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:17,034
It occurred to me the other day

117
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:21,045
that all the really, really
knockout acts have

118
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:23,842
something a little different
going on .

119
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,044
Like a signature bit.

120
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:33,820
And I thought that my thing
could be aloof, you know?

121
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,326
Give 'em just enough
to get 'em good and hungry,

122
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,489
but always leave 'em
wantin' more.

123
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,860
Hey, once I get a name
for myself,

124
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:46,132
maybe we could open up a club
of our own .

125
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:50,335
You could run it,
and I could be the headliner.

126
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,740
What's the idea?

127
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,109
Wake up, kiddo. You ain't
never gonna have an act.

128
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:56,738
Says who?

129
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,909
Face it. You're a two-bit talent
with skinny legs.

130
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:01,782
I'm just a furniture salesman .

131
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,788
Yeah , but you got connections.

132
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,086
-That guy at the club.
-There is no guy.

133
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,489
That night. . .

134
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,584
It was the first time
I set foot in that joint.

135
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,357
I was collecting on a bet
from the trombone player.

136
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,662
So you never
told anyone about me?

137
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,964
Sugar, you were hot stuff.

138
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:21,028
I would have said anything
to get a piece of that.

139
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:24,099
And now? Now?

140
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,940
We had some laughs.
Let's just leave it at that.

141
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,950
You can't do this to me.

142
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:34,679
Would you get off?

143
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,119
You touch me again ,
I'll put your lights out!

144
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:46,587
-Wait.
-Your husband will be home soon .

145
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,496
Wash yourself before hitting
those sheets again .

146
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,159
You're a liar, Fred .

147
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:51,793
Yeah , yeah , so what?

148
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,668
You lied to me.

149
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,776
That's life, sweetheart.
That's life.

150
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:02,041
You son of a bitch !
You son of a bitch !

151
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:13,148

154
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,997
Why you bothering , Sal?
This one's all wrapped up.

155
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,665
It's a new city record .

156

SGT. FOGARTY: Where did you get
the murder weapon?

158
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,279
AMOS : I keep a gun
in the underwear drawer.

159
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:38,748
Just in case of trouble.

160
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,479
That's just fine.
Sign right there, Mr. Hart.

161
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:44,078
Freely and gladly.

162
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:46,556
Don't say we beat it out of you
when you get on the stand .

163
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,526
No, I gave myself up.
Surrendered of my own free will .

164
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,324
Isn't he the cheerful murderer?

165
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:53,523
ROXIE :
Shootin' a burglar ain't murder.

166
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,362
Just last week,
a jury thanked a man .

167
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,664
I'm grateful for citizens
who know the law.

168
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:59,761
Get in there.

169
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,601
You too.

170
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,201
Sit down .

171
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,146
Okay. From the top.

172
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,809
A man's got a right to protect
his home and loved ones, right?

173
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:14,978
Of course he has.

174
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,645
I come home from the garage,

175
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,986
and I see him climbing
through the window

176
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,025
with my wife, Roxie,
laying there,

177
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,458
sleeping like an angel .

178
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:23,755
That true, Mrs. Hart?

179
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,319
It's the God's honest truth .

180
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,160
My wife had nothing
to do with it.

181
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,598
She wouldn't hurt a worm ,
not even a worm .

182
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,260
It wasn't till I fired
the first shot

183
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,201
she even opened her eyes.

184
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,467
I always said she could sleep

185
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,804
through
the St. Paddy's Day Parade.

186
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,400
When I think of
what would have happened

187
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:43,005
if I went out for a beer
instead of coming home.

188
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,777
It makes you sick
even thinking about it.

189
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,342
BANDLEADER: For her first
number, Miss Roxie Hart

190
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,446
would like to sing a song
of love and devotion

191
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:55,152
dedicated
to her dear husband , Amos.

192
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,827
* Sometimes l'm right *

193
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,332
* Sometimes I'm wrong *

194
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:05,461
* But he doesn't care *

195
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:08,938
* He'll string along *

196
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:11,840
* He loves me so *

197
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,542
* That funny honey of mine *

198
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,518
* Sometimes Im down *

199
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,181
* Sometimes Im up *

200
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,452
* But he follows round *

201
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:31,963
* Like some droopy-eyed pup *

202
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,158
* He loves me so *

203
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:38,225
* That funny honey of mine *

204
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,897
After I shot him ,
he kept coming at me,

205
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:43,134
so I had to pull
the trigger again .

206
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,006
* He ain't no sheik *

207
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,046
* That's no great physique *

208
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:52,846
* And Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

209
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,483
* But look at that soul *

210
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,115
* l tell you, that whole *

211
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:06,461
* Is a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts *

212
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:13,337
* And if you knew him like me *

213
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:18,035
* l know you'd agree *

214
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,877
* What if the world
slandered my name? *

215
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:30,752
* Why, he'd be right there
taking the blame *

216
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,950
* He loves me so *

217
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:40,625
* And it all suits me fine *

218
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:45,830
* That funny, sunny honey *

219
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,771
* Hubby of mine *

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,970
Supposing , just supposing ,
he had violated her.

221
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,639
-You know what I mean?
-I know what you mean .

222
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,205
Think how terrible
that would have been .

223
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,773
It's a good thing I got home
from work on time.

224
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:02,684
* He loves me so *

225
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:06,417
* That funny honey of mine *

226
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,425
Name of deceased ,
Fred Casely.

227
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,859
Fred ?
How could he be a burglar?

228
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:14,421
My wife knows him .
He sold us our furniture.

229
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,694
He gave us 1 0% off.

230
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:20,465
* Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

231
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:21,801
You told me he was a burglar.

232
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,534
He was dead when you got home?

233
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,905
She had him covered in a sheet,

234
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,911
and she's telling me
some cock-and-bull story

235
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,971
and how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.

236
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,483
''''Help me, Amos,'' she says.
''It's my goddamn hour of need .''

237
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,952
* Now he shot off his trap *

238
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:39,548
* l can't stand that sap *

239
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,319
- * Look at him go *
-And I believed her.

240
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:43,657
- * Rattin' on me *
-That cheap little tramp.

241
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,593
She was two-timing me, huh?

242
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,393
I'm through protecting her now.

243
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,434
She can swing for all I care.

244
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:52,664
I'm down at the garage
working 1 4 hours a day,

245
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,967
and she's up here
munching on bonbons

246
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,770
and tramping around
Like some goddamn floozy!

247
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,401
Thought she could pull
the wool over my eyes.

248
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,469
- * That scummy, crummy *
-Well , I wasn't born yesterday.

249
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,741
- * Dummy *
-Some things a man can't take.

250
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,407
- * Hubby of mine *
-She pushed me too far.

251
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,475
That little chiseler.

252
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:10,077
Boy, what a sap I was!

253
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,420
You double-crosser!
You big blabbermouth !

254
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:15,357
You promised you'd stick.

255
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,327
You been stringin' me,
Roxanne!

256
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,794
You told me he was a burglar!

257
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,889
The whole time,
you been up here jazzin' him .

258
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,367
You are a disloyal husband !

259
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:29,069
Look, it's true.
I shot him .

260
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:32,008
But it was self-defense.
He was trying to burgle me.

261
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:33,772
From what I hear,
he's been burgling you

262
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,336
three times a week
for the Last month .

263
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:38,609
So what do you say, Missus?

264
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:39,843
That's him , all right.

265
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,283
Thank you .

266
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:43,548
Your story doesn't wash ,
Mrs. Hart. . .

267
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:45,021
so try this on for size.

268
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,024
Fred  was a good time
on the side

269
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,753
with Goofy here
as a meal ticket.

270
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,523
Meal ticket?
He couldnt buy my liquor.

271
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:52,722
Fred Casely could?

272
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,765
With a wife
and five little Caselys?

273
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,733
Or did he forget
to mention them?

274
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,661
What?

275
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,001
All his.

276
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,167
Oh , that bastard .

277
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,541
That bastard !

278
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:09,978
Yeah , I killed him .
I would kill him again .

279
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,276
Once was enough , dearie.

280
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,408
Take her downtown . Come on !

281
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,320
This is it. 264 1 /2 .

282
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:19,584
Here they come.
This way, honey.

283
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:22,252
It's a shame to hide
such a beautiful face.

284
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:23,225
Why'd you shoot him?

285
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,092
Give us a profile with a smile

286
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,721
Like the girl from
the toothpaste ad .

287
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,766
Enjoy it while you can .
Take this down .

288
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,767
Assistant District Attorney
Harrison

289
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:32,234
says this is a hanging case.

290
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,862
I'm ready to go
to the jury tomorrow.

291
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,031
What do you mean , hanging?

292
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,300
Not so tough anymore, are you?

293
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:37,841
Take her down
to the Cook County Jail .

294
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,809
We need a headline.
Why'd you shoot him?

295
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,778
Was he cruel? Did he beat you?

296
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:45,577
Hey, what do you mean ,
hanging?

297
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,827
Morphine, opium , cocaine?

298
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:10,603
-Arm length . 3 1 inches.
-Arm length . 3 1 inches.

299

Height. 66 inches.

300
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:18,715
The Matron's on her way,
so don't get too cozy.

301
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,552
Put out that cigarette!

302
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:27,286
Ever had Morton before?

303
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,162
She's fine.
Long as you keep her happy.

304
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:38,260
[ Drumroll ]

305
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:41,237
And now , ladies and gentlemen . . .

306
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,298
the Keeper of the Keys,
the Countess of the Clink. . .

00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:47,004
the Mistress of Murderess Row. . .

308

Matron Mama Morton !

On your feet.

315

Welcome, ladies.

316
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:34,487

* Always sees me through *

* Mama's good to you *

320
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,901
You might think I'm here
to make your Life a living hell ,

321
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,402
but it's just not true.

322
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:50,031
* There's a lot of favors *

323
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,770
* Im prepared to do *

324
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,210

* She'll do one for you *

I'd Like to be your friend ,

00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:03,917
or makes you unhappy
in any way. . .

329

don't shoot your fat-ass mouth
off to me

330
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,749
'cause I don't give a shit.

331
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,818
* They say that life

Let's go.

340
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:39,887
You must be Hart.

341
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,751
Ain't you the pretty one.

342
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,294
Thank you , ma'am .

343
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,125
Oh , no, call me Mama.

344
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,529
I'm here to take care of you .

345
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,296
You'll be habitatin'
down in the east bloc.

346
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,200
Murderess Row, we call it.

347
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,536
Is that nicer?

348
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,180
I don't think I belong in here.

349
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,152
I didn't actually
do anything wrong .

350
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,187
No need to tell me.

351
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:11,984
I never heard

00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:39,623
You could say we broke up
because of artistic differences.

529
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,851
He saw himself as alive. . .

530
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:44,622
and I saw him dead .

531
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:48,256
* The dirty bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum *

532
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:51,893

538
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,572

-Pop that gum one more time. . .
-Single, my ass.

546

1 0 times!

547
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,226
Number 1 7.
The spread eagle.

548
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:27,600
Artistic differences.

549
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,502
Pop.

550
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:31,438
Six.

551
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:33,534
Squish .

552
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,480
Cicero.

553
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,675
Lipschitz.

554
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:47,321
Who belongs to them?

555
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:48,756
What's it to you?

556
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:50,054
Nothing .

557
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,389
Heard they were Velmas.

558
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:54,795
The Hunyak does her laundry
for a buck a week.

559
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,675
Fresh towels for the can .

560
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,439
Make it quick.

561
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:12,741
MAMA MORTON :
I'm gonna take care of you now.

562
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,308
I know a couple of things.
Hear me out.

563
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,877
Billy Flynns set
your trial for March 5th .

564
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:19,422
March 7 th you'll be acquitted .

565
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:25,190
March 8th , Mama is gonna put you
on the vaudeville circuit.

566
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:26,957
VELMA:
Now you're an agent, too?

567
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:29,591
MAMA MORTON : Until Ma Bell
installs a line in your cell. . .

568
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,134
all the calls
have gotta go through me.

569
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:32,999
What kind of dough
are we taking about?

570
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,731
It's a crazy world .

571
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,466
Babe Ruth is wearing rouge

572
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,474
and playing the Palace
for $5,000 a week.

573
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:40,942
Yeah . What about someone
with real talent?

574
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,844
I been talking to the boys
over at William Morris.

575
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,973
Due to your recent
sensational activities. . .

576
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,211
they think
they can get you $2 ,500.

577
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:49,513
$2 ,500?

578
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:52,112
Jeez, the most me
and Veronica made was $350.

579
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:56,216
That's what happens when you
have the right representation .

580
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:59,160
I always wanted to play
Big Jim Colosimo's.

581
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,221
Do you think
you can get me that?

582
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:02,595
-Big Jim's?
-Yeah .

583
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,601
I don't know. That's gonna
take another phone call .

584
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,500
How much is that gonna cost?

585
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,596
You know how I feel about you .

586
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:12,608
You're like family to me.
You're like one of my own .

587
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:16,442
-I'll do it for 50 bucks.
-50 bucks for a phone call?

588
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:19,608
You must get a lot
of wrong numbers, Mama.

589
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:27,146
Oh , Miss Kelly,
got your personals.

590
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:29,215
Freshly pressed
by yours truly.

591
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,851
No, it's my pleasure.

592
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:36,159
Hey, listen ,
can I ask you something?

593
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,894
You know that Harrison guy?

594
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:40,402
He said that what I done
is a hanging case

595
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:43,565
and that he's prepared to ask
for the maximum penalty.

596
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,872
-Yeah , so?
-So I'm scared .

597
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:49,412
I sure would appreciate
some advice.

598
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,211
Especially from someone
I admire as much as you .

599
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:56,685
Since I can remember, I have
wanted to be on the stage.

600
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:59,314
What's your talent?
Washing and drying?

601
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,688
No. I danced in the chorus.

602
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,818
That was before
I met my husband , Amos.

603
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,089
Look, honey,
you want some advice?

604
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,495
Here it is.
Direct from me to you .

605
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:12,525
Keep your paws
off my underwear, okay?

606
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:16,268
Yeah , okay.

607
00:33:17,508 --> 00:33:19,169
Thanks.

608
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:22,607
For nothing' .

609
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,739
She's something , ain't she?

610
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:28,046
No matter how big she gets,
she's still as common as ever.

611
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:30,450
I'd Like to help you , dearie.

612
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:34,086
Take a load off.

613
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:39,254
So, what do you figure
on using for grounds?

614
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,297
Grounds?

615
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:41,626
What are you gonna tell
the jury?

616
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,860
I just figured
I'd tell them the truth .

617
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,959
-The truth?
-Yeah .

618
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,435
That's a one-way ticket
to the death house.

619
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:48,903
Holy Mother of God .

620
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,133
Oh , relax.

621
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:53,142
In this town , murder's
a form of entertainment.

622
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,939
Besides, in 4 7 years,

623
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,310
Cook County ain't never hung
a woman yet.

624
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,475
So the odds are 4 7 to one
that they won't hang you .

625
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,314
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph .

626
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:03,819
You're talking
to the wrong people.

627
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,651
What you need is Billy Flynn .

628
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:08,658
-Who?
-Billy Flynn .

629
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:10,819
He's only the best
criminal lawyer in Illinois.

630
00:34:10,894 --> 00:34:13,920
What he don't know
about juries and women . . .

631
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:15,488
How do you get Billy Flynn?

632
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:17,363
Well , not by praying , dearie.

633
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:20,301
First, you give me $ 100.
Then I make a phone call .

634
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:22,771
$ 100?
Well , you just. . .

635
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,332
I mean , it seems pretty steep
for a phone call .

636
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,002
He's worth every cent.

637
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:31,909
He's never lost a case
for a female client yet.

638
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:34,348
With a sweet Little puss
Like yours. . .

639
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:37,581
Lets just say justice
ain't so blind in Chicago.

640
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,316
He's never lost a case?

641
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,322
Never.

642
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:41,688
Every girl in this place

643
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:44,250

Billy Flynn represent her.

Excuse me, gentlemen .

677
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,433
Miss Kelly, do you remember
anything at all about that night?

678
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:11,599
I passed out completely.
I can't remember a thing .

679
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:12,972
Only that I didn't do it.

680
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:14,340
Any idea who did , dear?

681
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:16,641
No, but my client is offering
a substantial reward

682
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:18,647
to anyone with information
about this crime.

683
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:20,273
How much is the reward ,
Miss Kelly?

684
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,408
I don't know. How much?

685
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,816
We'll work it out
after the trial .

What's this about a reward?

689
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:33,260
Awfully dumb, reporters.
They'll write it up wrong .

690
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,992

Oh , yeah , right.
The cute one.

I was hoping
that you might represent me.

You got $5,000?

697
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:52,106
Gee, that's a lot of money.

698
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,147
Mama didn't say anything
about $5,000.

699
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,712
Look it, Mr. Flynn ,
I'm not very good at this. . .

700
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,657
but maybe we could

701
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:05,820
make some sort of
arrangement between us?

702
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,330
I can be an awfully good sport.

703
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:11,231
Good , you got that
out of your system .

704
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:13,565
You mean just one thing to me.

705
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:16,128
You call me
when you got $5,000.

706
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,800
* All he cares about is love *

707
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:23,210
* Show me long raven hair *

708
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,875
* ' down about to there *

709
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,647
* When I see her runnin' free *

710
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,589
* Keep your money,
that's enough for me *

711
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,028
* I don't care
for drivin' Packard cars *

712
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:45,694
* Or smoking long buck cigars *

713
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,396
* No, no, not me *

714
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:51,637
* All l care about
is doin' the guy in *

715
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,938
* Who's pickin' on you *

716
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:59,449
* Twistin' the wrist
that's turnin' the screw *

717
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:05,986
- * All he cares about *
- * All I care about *

718
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:16,364
* Is love *

719
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:23,902
Oh , he'll see you now.

720
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:29,441
Well , hello, Andy.

721
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:31,413
My name is Amos.

722
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,506
That's right.
Take a seat.

723
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:37,413
You're a remarkable man .

724
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:39,546
Your wife two-times you . . .

725
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,215
plugs the guy,
then tries to pin it on you .

726
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,883
Most men would let
a dame like that swing .

727
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,951
But, no, you're sticking by her.

728
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:46,655
Makes you a hero in my eyes.

729
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,460
That's right.
I'm a hero.

730
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,501
Did you bring the money?

731
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:53,964
I didn't do as well as I hoped .

732
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:57,438
But I will , Mr. Flynn .

733
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,776
This is only a thousand .

734
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:04,837
Plus there's $300 I borrowed
from the guys at the garage.

735
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:08,908
There's $ 7 00 from
the building-and-loan fund .

736
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,317
$2 ,000.

737
00:40:10,387 --> 00:40:12,378
And that's all I got so far.

738
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:15,448
But I'll give you $20
off my salary every week.

739
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,858
I'll give you notes with
interest. Double. Triple.

740
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,658
When you came to me yesterday. . .

741
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:22,790
I didn't ask if she was
guilty or innocent.

742
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:26,302
I didn't ask if she was
a drunk or a dope fiend . No.

743
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,498
I said , ''Do you have $5,000?''
You said yes.

744
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,541
But you don't have $5,000.

745
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:33,269
I figure you're a dirty liar.

746
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:36,005
I don't waste my time
with dirty liars.

747
00:40:40,617 --> 00:40:45,145
Look. I'm real sorry,
Mr. Flynn .

748
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:47,822
On the other hand . . .

749
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:51,520
your devotion to your wife
is really very, very touching .

750
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:54,496
I took your wife's case,
and I'll keep it. . .

751
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:56,054
because I play square.

752
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,534
Now, look, Hart. . .

753
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:01,798
I don't like to blow
my own horn ,

754
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,841
but if Jesus Christ
had lived in Chicago today

755
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:07,342
and if he had $5,000
and he'd come to me,

756
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:10,073
things would have
turned out differently.

757
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:12,544
All right, this is what
we're gonna do.

758
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,413
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name

759
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:16,475
on the front page
of every newspaper in town .

760
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:20,216
''Sweetest little jazz killer
ever to hit Chicago.''

761
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,190
That's the angle I'm after.

762
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:24,784
You make an announcement
we're gonna have an auction .

763
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:26,795
We got to raise money
for her defense.

764
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:29,855
They'll buy everything
she's ever touched .

765
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:32,629
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear.

766
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,102
ROXIE :
And Victoria records.

767
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,503
Like the one I was playing
when I shot the bastard .

768
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:37,665
BILLY:
I didn't hear that.

769
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,709
Not that I didn't have grounds.

770
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,767
-Hey, what are they?
-That's for trial .

771
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:43,779
Nobody's gonna care a lick

772
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:46,042
what your defense is
unless they care about you .

773
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:49,051
The first thing we do is work up
sympathy from the press.

774
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,950
They're not all pushovers
like Mary Sunshine.

775
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,854
But there's one thing
that they can never resist. . .

776
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:57,121
and that is a reformed sinner.

777
00:41:57,194 --> 00:42:00,129
So, what was your
favorite subject in school?

778
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:02,563
Oh , I was a real dummy.

779
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:04,395
There must have been something
you were really good at.

780
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:06,561
I got high marks
on courtesy and hygiene.

781
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:08,365
Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun .

782
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:10,201
A nun?

783
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:11,297
Where were you born?

784
00:42:11,374 --> 00:42:13,535
On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.

785
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,374
Southern home filled with
every luxury and refinement.

786
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:17,572
Where are your parents?

787
00:42:17,647 --> 00:42:20,138
Probably on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.

788
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:21,309
Parents dead .

789
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:22,681
Family fortune swept away.

790
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:25,119
You were educated
at the Sacred Heart.

791
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:27,315
Then you fell
into a runaway marriage.

792
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,483
Left you miserable,
alone, unhappy.

793
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,528
You got all swept up
in the mad whirl of the city.

794
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:34,427
Jazz, cabarets, liquor.

795
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,830
You were drawn
like a moth to the flame.

796
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,868
Now the mad whirl has ceased .

797
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:42,496
You are a butterfly
crushed on the wheel .

798
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:45,234
Which is it? Is it the moth
or the butterfly?

799
00:42:45,308 --> 00:42:47,401
You have sinned ,
and you are sorry.

800
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,240
God , that's beautiful .

801
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:51,509
Cut out God .

802
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:53,572
Stay where
you're better acquainted .

803
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,279
Kid , when I'm through with you ,
not only will you be acquitted ,

804
00:42:57,354 --> 00:42:58,719
every man on that jury

805
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,053
will want to take you home
to meet his mother.

806
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,059
[ Southern accent ] I was born
on a beautiful Southern convent.

807
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:05,116
What?

808
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:06,924
[ Normal voice ]
Oh , holy shit!

809
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:08,862
I'm never gonna get
this straight.

810
00:43:08,932 --> 00:43:10,365
Pipe down on the swearing .

811
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,459
From here on , you say nothing
rougher than ''Oh , dear.''

812
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:14,299
Try again .

813
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:16,430
I was born on a. . .

814
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:48,429
VELMA: I came up with more to do
on the witness stand .

815
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:50,439
I thought I'd get all teary-eyed

816
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:52,475
and ask to borrow
your handkerchief.

817
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:55,477
Then I thought I'd take a peek
at the jury like this.

818
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:58,673
Flash 'em a bit of thigh , huh?
What do you think?

819
00:43:58,748 --> 00:43:59,874
Sounds great.

820
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:07,088
Don't you want
to hear the rest?

821
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:09,921
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my list.

822
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,824
Well , well , well .

823
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:16,127
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn .

824
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,860
Hope you weren't too bored .

825
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:19,695
I like it.

826
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:24,837
I like it.

827
00:44:26,877 --> 00:44:29,209
Hey, Pollyanna. . .

828
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,577
I heard your press conference
is tomorrow.

829
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,343
Yeah , what's it to you?

830
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,350
Well , you wanted
my advice, right?

831
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:36,976
Well , here it is.

832
00:44:37,053 --> 00:44:39,544
Don't forget
Billy Flynn's number-one client

833
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:41,716
is Billy Flynn .

834
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,520
Meaning what?

835
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:48,457
Meaning don't let him
hog the spotlight.

836
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:50,761
You're the one
they pay to see.

837
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:56,866
We can only sell them
one idea at a time.

838
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,601
I can still see him coming at me

839
00:44:58,675 --> 00:45:00,108
with that awful look
in his eyes.

840
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:01,108
And?

841
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:02,838
And we both reached
for the gun .

842
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:05,404
That's right.
You both reached for the gun .

843
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,042
Ready?

844
00:45:07,117 --> 00:45:08,311
Yeah .

845
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:10,885
-Miss Hart!
-Miss Hart!

846
00:45:17,894 --> 00:45:18,986
Good day, gentlemen .

847
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:20,154
Gentlemen , Miss Sunshine.

848
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,926
My client has just entered
a plea of not guilty.

849
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:25,399
We look forward to a trial
at the earliest possible date.

850
00:45:25,468 --> 00:45:27,368
Are there any questions?

851
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,472
Miss Sunshine.

852
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,202
As you know, my paper is dry.

853
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,005
Do you have any advice
for young girls

854
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:37,239
seeking to avoid
a life of jazz and drink?

855
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:38,303
Absolutely, yes.

856
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:40,781
Mrs. Hart feels that
it was the tragic combination

857
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,148
of liquor and jazz
which led to her downfall .

858
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:44,311
Next question , please.

859
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,786
Ladies and gentlemen . . .

860
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,880
I would like to say
how flattered I am

861
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,118
that y'all came to see me.

862
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:50,454
Mrs. Hart is very pleased --

863
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:52,995
I was a moth
crushed on the wheel .

864
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:56,191
You know, a butterfly
drawn to the. . .

865
00:45:58,368 --> 00:46:01,599
I bet you want to know
why I shot the bastard .

866
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:03,437
Shut up, dummy.

867
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:07,302
BANDLEADER: Mr. Billy Flynn
in ''The Press Conference Rag .''

868
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,104
Notice how his mouth
never moves.

869
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,511
Almost.

870
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,549
Where'd you come from?

1386
01:13:27,148 --> 01:13:30,709
* And never know I'm there *

1387
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:33,015
* I tell ya *

1388
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:34,851
* Cellophane *

1389
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:37,687
* Mister Cellophane *

1390
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:40,523
* Shoulda been my name *

1391
01:13:40,595 --> 01:13:43,029
* Mister Cellophane *

1392
01:13:43,098 --> 01:13:46,465
* 'Cause you can look
right through me *

1393
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:49,662
* Walk right by me *

1394
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:55,199
* And never know I'm there *

1395
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,268
* Never even *

1396
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:03,978
* Know *

1397
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:09,756
* I'm there *

1398
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:18,155
I hope I didn't take up
too much of your time.

1399
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:24,231
I've been waiting 10 minutes.
Don't do that again .

1400
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:27,331
This dress makes me look like
a Woolworth's lampshade.

1401
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:28,467
I'm not wearing this.

1402
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:30,477
You're wearing it
because I tell you to wear it.

1403
01:14:30,545 --> 01:14:32,740
When Andy's on the stand ,
I want you to be knitting .

1404
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:34,907
Knitting?
Oh , for Christ sakes.

1405
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:36,848
-A baby garment.
-I don't know how to knit!

1406
01:14:36,918 --> 01:14:37,316
Then learn .

1407
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:39,853
That is no way
to win a jury's sympathy.

1408
01:14:39,921 --> 01:14:41,513
Oh , you don't need advice
anymore.

1409
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:44,023
Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece. . .

1410
01:14:44,092 --> 01:14:47,255
it seems to me
that I am the one

1411
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:48,818
who's coming up
with the good ideas.

1412
01:14:48,897 --> 01:14:51,024
I am sick of everybody
telling me what to do.

1413
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:53,192
You treat me like dirt.

1414
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:56,101
You treat me like I'm some
dumb common criminal.

1415
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:58,036
But you are.

1416
01:14:58,106 --> 01:15:01,166
Well, it's better than being
a greasy Mick lawyer.

1417
01:15:01,242 --> 01:15:02,937
Who happens to be
saving your ass!

1418
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,206
Who's out for all he can steal !

1419
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,305
Maybe you'd like
to appear in court without me.

1420
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:08,644
Well, maybe I could .

1421
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:09,979
Have you read
the morning papers?

1422
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:11,143
They love me!

1423
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:13,779
Wise up! They'd love you
a lot more if you were hanged .

1424
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,982
You know why?
'Cause they'd sell more papers.

1425
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:17,046
You're fired.

1426
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,217
I quit.

1427
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,821
Any lawyer in this town
would die to have my case.

1428
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:25,832
You are a phony celebrity.
You're a flash in the pan .

1429
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:29,097
In a couple of weeks, no one's
gonna give a shit about you .

1430
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,763
That's Chicago.

1431
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:42,341
What happened?

1432
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:44,009
It's the Hunyak.

1433
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:45,985
She lost her last appeal.

1434
01:15:46,054 --> 01:15:47,453
So what's that mean?

1435
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:53,152
Well , that means that next week,
she's gonna. . .

1436
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:09,307
This is Mary Sunshine coming to
you from the Cook County Jail . . .

1437
01:16:09,377 --> 01:16:12,141
where history
will be made today.

1438
01:16:12,213 --> 01:16:15,307
Katalin Helinski
will become the first woman

1439
01:16:15,383 --> 01:16:18,841
in the state of Illinois
to be executed .

1440
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,148
And so, ladies and gentlemen . . .

1441
01:16:20,221 --> 01:16:21,984
And now,
ladies and gentlemen . . .

1442
01:16:22,056 --> 01:16:24,286
for your pleasure
and your entertainment. . .

1443
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:27,192
we proudly present
Katalin Helinski

1444
01:16:27,262 --> 01:16:31,198
and her famous
Hungarian disappearing act.

1445
01:18:07,795 --> 01:18:11,458
You know,
it's really not that bad .

1446
01:18:11,532 --> 01:18:13,295
You clear about everything
we agreed on?

1447
01:18:13,368 --> 01:18:15,859
Yep. I've been up all night
rehearsing .

1448
01:18:15,937 --> 01:18:18,132
What do you do when Harrison
starts coming after you?

1449
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:20,071
I sit still
and look straight ahead . . .

1450
01:18:20,141 --> 01:18:21,130
never at the jury.

1451
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:23,643
-And?
-And I look modest.

1452
01:18:23,711 --> 01:18:26,236
-And?
-And . . .

1453
01:18:26,314 --> 01:18:28,214
-And say nothing .
-That's right.

1454
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:29,807
-That was the deal , right?
-Right.

1455
01:18:29,884 --> 01:18:32,318
You asked me back.
I do all the talking this time.

1456
01:18:32,387 --> 01:18:34,947
Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.

1457
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:37,355
Mr. Flynn .
His Honor's here.

1458
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:38,756
Thank you .

1459
01:18:39,727 --> 01:18:41,854
You ready?

1460
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,591
Yeah .

1461
01:18:50,071 --> 01:18:52,164
I'm scared .

1462
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:56,508
Ah, don't be.

1463
01:18:56,577 --> 01:18:57,976
I've been around a long time.

1464
01:18:58,046 --> 01:19:00,514
Believe me. You got
nothing to worry about.

1465
01:19:03,017 --> 01:19:06,783
It's all a circus.
A three-ring circus.

1466
01:19:06,854 --> 01:19:10,813
These trials, the whole world .

1467
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:12,951
It's all show business.

1468
01:19:14,529 --> 01:19:16,156
But, kid . . .

1469
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:19,697
You're working with a star.

1470
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:30,134
* Give 'em
the old razzle dazzle *

1471
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:32,008
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1472
01:19:33,881 --> 01:19:37,817
* Give 'em an act
with lots of flash in it *

1473
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:41,616
* And the reaction
will be passionate *

1474
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:45,785
* Give 'em
the old hocus pocus *

1475
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,919
* Bead and feather 'em *

1476
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:56,466
* How can they see
with sequins in their eyes? *

1477
01:19:57,472 --> 01:20:01,238
* What if your hinges
all are rusting? *

1478
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:05,211
* What if, in fact,
you're just disgusting? *

1479
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:07,679
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1480
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:11,708
* And they'll never catch wise *

1481
01:20:24,932 --> 01:20:29,335
* Give 'em
the old razzle dazzle *

1482
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:32,100
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1483
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:36,870
* Give 'em a show
that's so splendiferous *

1484
01:20:36,944 --> 01:20:40,937
* Row after row
will grow vociferous *

1485
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:45,042
* Give 'em
the old flimflam flummo x *

1486
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:47,246
* Fool and fracture 'em *

1487
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:54,018
* How can they hear the truth
above the roar? *

1488
01:20:56,631 --> 01:21:00,397
* Throw 'em a fake
and a finagle *

1489
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:04,268
* They'll never know
you're just a bagel *

1490
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:06,669
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1491
01:21:06,741 --> 01:21:11,906
* And they'll beg you for more *

1492
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,880
-I object!
-Sustained .

1493
01:21:13,948 --> 01:21:16,849
Your Honor, I haven't even
asked the question yet.

1494
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:31,727
* Give 'em
the old double whammy *

1495
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:34,324
* Daze and dizzy 'em *

1496
01:21:35,002 --> 01:21:38,961
* Back since the days
of old Methuselah *

1497
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:43,568
* Everyone loves
the big bamboozler *

1498
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:48,480
* Give 'em
the old three-ring circus *

1499
01:21:48,549 --> 01:21:51,211
* Stun and stagger 'em *

1500
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:58,657
* When you're in trouble,
go into your dance *

1501
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:03,661
* Though you are stiffer
than a girder *

1502
01:22:03,731 --> 01:22:07,827
* They'll let you get away
with murder *

1503
01:22:07,902 --> 01:22:09,836
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1504
01:22:09,904 --> 01:22:13,305
* And you got a romance *

1505
01:22:14,175 --> 01:22:15,335
Hello, Amos.

1506
01:22:16,077 --> 01:22:17,442
Amos.

1507
01:22:17,512 --> 01:22:19,309
That's right, Mr. Flynn .
Amos.

1508
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:22,178
Amos, when did you file suit
for divorce?

1509
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,342
A month ago.

1510
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:25,681
Was there any reason
at this time?

1511
01:22:25,753 --> 01:22:26,685
I'll say.

1512
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:30,121
The newspapers said Roxie
was expecting a little stranger.

1513
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:32,557
That's hardly grounds
for divorce, is it?

1514
01:22:32,627 --> 01:22:34,925
A little too much
of a stranger.

1515
01:22:35,429 --> 01:22:39,058
You mean you doubted
the paternity of the child .

1516
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:40,065
Well , sure.

1517
01:22:40,134 --> 01:22:42,466
Tell me, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?

1518
01:22:42,537 --> 01:22:43,697
Yes, sir, every night.

1519
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,204
And you expect
this jury to believe

1520
01:22:45,273 --> 01:22:48,731
that you slept
next to this woman every night

1521
01:22:48,809 --> 01:22:50,538
without exercising your rights
as a husband?

1522
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,238
Well , I could've
if I wanted to.

1523
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:54,178
-Oh , but you didn't.
-No, I did .

1524
01:22:54,248 --> 01:22:55,510
-Did what?
-Want to.

1525
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,073
-But you didn't.
-Didn't what?

1526
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:59,813
-What you wanted .
-Wait. I'm getting confused .

1527
01:22:59,887 --> 01:23:03,983
Did you ever question
Roxie herself?

1528
01:23:04,058 --> 01:23:06,891
Did you ask her if you were
the father of her child?

1529
01:23:06,961 --> 01:23:08,121
No, sir.

1530
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:10,562
But if you became convinced
that you were wrong . . .

1531
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:12,861
you'd be man enough to admit it.

1532
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:16,062
You'd take her back
if Roxie swore

1533
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,764
that you were the father.

1534
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:19,567
-Which she does.
-She does?

1535
01:23:22,577 --> 01:23:24,909
She does! She does!

1536
01:23:24,979 --> 01:23:26,446
No more questions!

1537
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:28,414
You can step down now.

1538
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:31,007
Well done, Andy.

1539
01:23:31,085 --> 01:23:33,553
Oh , Roxie, I'm so sorry.

1540
01:23:39,093 --> 01:23:40,287
ALL: Aw!

1541
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:41,453
[ Applause ]

1542
01:23:46,367 --> 01:23:50,531
* Give 'em
the old razzle dazzle *

1543
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:53,472
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1544
01:23:53,941 --> 01:24:00,574
* Show 'em the first-rate
sorcerer you are *

1545
01:24:01,549 --> 01:24:05,315
* Long as you keep 'em
way off balance *

1546
01:24:05,386 --> 01:24:09,823
* How can they spot
you got no talents? *

1547
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,824
* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1548
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:18,994
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1549
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:21,796
Roxie Hart
finally takes the stand

1550
01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:23,427
in her own defense.

1551
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:33,741
* And they'll make you
a star *

1552
01:24:35,816 --> 01:24:37,443
Order! Order!

1553
01:24:40,855 --> 01:24:42,220
Proceed , Mr. Flynn .

1554
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:43,951
Roxie,
I have here a statement

illicit relations

1556

Fred.

1557
01:24:48,596 --> 01:24:50,029
Is this true or false?

1558
01:24:50,097 --> 01:24:51,496
I'm afraid that's true.

1559

You're an honest girl , Roxie.

1560
01:24:53,567 --> 01:24:56,365
When did you first meet
Fred?

1561
01:24:56,437 --> 01:24:58,871
When he sold Amos and me
our furniture.

1562
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:00,804
Your personal relationship
with him --

1563
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:02,536
could you tell the jury
when that began?

1564
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,841
When I permitted him
to escort me home one night.

1565
01:25:05,913 --> 01:25:07,847
I don't think
I would've gone with him

quarrelled that very morning .

-Quarrelled?
-Yes, sir.

1568

Well , I suppose
it was his fault.

1569

Oh , no, sir.
It was my fault.

1570
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:20,627
I suppose I just couldn't stop
pestering him .

1571

Pestering him?
About what?

1572
01:25:22,396 --> 01:25:25,331
I didn't like him working
those long hours at the garage.

1573

and iron his shirts.

into this illicit relationship

1577

at home.

were gonna have a baby.

Could you tell the audience --

1601

Well , in his passion ,
he tore off my robe. . .

So you didn't find
this diary in Roxie's cell?

1725
01:32:09,536 --> 01:32:11,163
No.

1726
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:13,934
Mama -- Miss Morton
gave it to me.

1727
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:15,702
She said someone sent it to her.

1728
01:32:15,776 --> 01:32:19,371
Someone? Any idea who this
mysterious benefactor might be?

1729
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:20,879
No. She didn't know.

1730
01:32:20,948 --> 01:32:22,882
All right, let's see
if we can work this out.

1731
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:27,944
Someone who writes
about reneging on pledges

1732
01:32:28,021 --> 01:32:31,047
and erroneous charges.

1733
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:33,525
Call me crazy. Doesn't that
sound like a lawyer?

1734
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:38,759
A lawyer who had a sample
of my client's handwriting .

1735
01:32:38,832 --> 01:32:40,561
Mr. Harrison ,
didn't you ask Roxie

1736
01:32:40,634 --> 01:32:42,397
to write out a confession?

1737
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:45,336
Yes. You're not suggesting
I tampered with evidence?

1738
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:47,965
No. I wouldn't.
Don't be ridiculous.

1739
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:51,636
No. That's thoroughly
and utterly absurd.

1740
01:32:51,712 --> 01:32:53,009
Now that you mention it. . .

1741
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,308
Your Honor,
this is outrageous!

1742
01:32:54,381 --> 01:32:56,042
I know. I agree.

1743
01:32:56,116 --> 01:32:57,879
To even suggest
that the prosecutor

1744
01:32:57,951 --> 01:33:00,818
would make a thieves' bargain
with Velma Kelly. . .

1745
01:33:00,888 --> 01:33:03,584
then fabricate the very evidence
that set her free!

1746
01:33:03,657 --> 01:33:05,750
Just so you can win
another case

1747
01:33:05,826 --> 01:33:08,158
and move one step closer
to the Governor's Mansion !

1748
01:33:08,228 --> 01:33:11,789
Why, it's simply beyond
all imagining !

1749
01:33:11,865 --> 01:33:13,093
I'll hold you in contempt!

1750
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:15,601
No, it is not even conceivable!

1751
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:18,001
But if it were,
wouldn't it be time to say:

1752
01:33:18,071 --> 01:33:20,869
''Come clean , Mr. Harrison''?

1753
01:33:20,941 --> 01:33:23,842
Even in Chicago, this kind
of corruption cannot stand !

1754
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:25,378
Will not stand !

1755
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:26,935
That's enough , Mr. Flynn !

1756
01:33:27,014 --> 01:33:28,641
I agree, Your Honor!

1757
01:33:28,715 --> 01:33:30,376
It is enough !

1758
01:33:31,685 --> 01:33:33,516
The defense rests.

finally draws to a close.

has in store for her.

And now a hush
falls over the courtroom . . .

We have, Your Honor.

The jury has reached
a verdict.

1773

01:34:22,569 --> 01:34:25,060
What is your verdict?

Not only one little lady.
But two.

You've read about them
in the papers.

Okay, you babes of jazz,
let's pick up the pace.

1923
01:43:01,354 --> 01:43:03,982
Let's make the parties longer,
the skirts shorter.
