1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,120
I didn't know you owned a cottage.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,800
Why did you two never live there?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,040
I visited once,
but I never cared for it.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,720
Anyway, it was your grandfather's.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,120
It was really all very basic.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,840
Goodnight.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Goodnight, dear.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,840
My dear Flora, your photograph
is getting pretty battered

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,440
with all the travelling
around in my breast pocket.

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,120
I can't tell you where we are or
much of what we're doing, of course.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,360
Much of the countryside
is so beautiful that

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
I have to remind the men that
we're not here on holiday,

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,960
but then merry hell
breaks out again.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,560
I'll spare you the details...

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,720
Aim at the olive groves, until the
others get through to relieve us.

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
Yes, sir!

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,320
Bastards got the supply lorry before
it could get through the gates, sir!

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,160
It's the driver, sir.
Another dead with him.

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,000
They shot out the tyres,

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,960
and it's tipped over in the ditch.
Put him with the others, quickly!

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,240
We need the MO! I think this one's
still with us, sir.

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
The MO's dead.

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
Put him with the rest. Quickly!

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,200
Not another? He was in
the back with the supplies.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Oh, Christ.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,120
Set him down gently.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,560
I need you back at the gatehouse.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,320
We can't have the others ambushed.
Do you understand? Sir...

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,240
Well, don't just sit there!
Help him!

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
With me!

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
With me, come on!

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,280
Sugar...

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
The lorry's full of bloody sugar.

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,600
March.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
Thomas March!

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
March, stay with me.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,640
Stay with me! March!

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
Captain.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
You were lucky.

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,600
No, your lot saved my life.

41
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,560
This...

42
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
This was your real life-saver.

43
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,080
I need to get your sketchpads
back from our CO.

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,080
He... He's not exactly artistic.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,480
Berryman?

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,160
Was I a beast to you at school?

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Berryman!

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,320
Er, well, actually,
you were always very kind.

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,200
Has anyone seen Captain Berryman?

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,280
What a relief.

51
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Berryman, a word.

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,520
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,800
Yes. All right, then. Pass it.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Almost. Stay on it.

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,540
Left! Left! Push it, push it! Hey!

56
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,040
Come on! Come on, get stuck in!

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
<i Down in my heart
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy...</i>

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
Who are you writing to?

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,040
Oh, um, a girl back home, Flora.

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,320
She's a teacher.

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,600
Here, James!

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,040
Oh.

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
I've known her all my life.
She's almost like a sister.

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,400
Come over here! Over here!

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,340
But not entirely.

66
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,280
Two left feet, you.

67
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,080
She, um... She lost her parents
in an air raid, just like me.

68
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Almost there, almost there...

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,640
Goal!

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
Listen up, men.

71
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,960
This is Captain March.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
He's an official war artist.

73
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,640
Now, you're not to mind him
drawing you.

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
His work is good for morale.

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,040
Sir?

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,160
Sir, is it true that the Hun lay on
tarts for their soldiers?

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,020
Yeah, how come they get tarts
and we get artists?

78
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,680
It's the morale back home
that art can raise.

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,440
It's for your wives and girlfriends,
your children...

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,120
Don't let them cheek you.

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
Sir?

82
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,060
Go on, sir...

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,760
Paint me!

84
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,040
Put it away, Bates.

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
But he's raising my morale, sir!

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,040
Ready to move? Yes, sir.

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,880
Yeah? Everybody here...

88
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,840
Bates will drive you to
a rendezvous point,

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,400
and then you'll be driven
back down to the boat from there.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
So, how far to the handover?

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,000
An hour at least,
depending on the state of the road.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,960
Well, in that case, nature calls.
ENGINE PURRS

93
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,680
Are we likely to come under fire?

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
Hopefully not.

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Save fuel, man. As you were.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Yeah, come on.

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,560
The area should have been
cleared, so it's...

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,840
I could...

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,920
It's bloody embarrassing but I can't
button my fly single-handed.

100
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Oh.

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,840
Promise me that
you'll come and find me?

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
I mean it.

103
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
Captain.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
Captain Berryman!

105
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,800
We ought to be off, sir. Rendezvous
time's not that long away.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Of course, Bates. Good man.

107
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,400
Thank you, Bates!

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
Good luck.

109
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,400
What's so amusing, Travis?

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Patroclus, miss.
Patroclus and Achilles.

111
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,800
I don't understand.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,960
Your closest friend is
butchered in a battle

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,240
in which he wore your armour
because you disdained to fight.

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,660
You lament -
perfectly understandable.

115
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,080
But they're not just friends,
are they?

116
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,240
Greek for friendship, Wykeham.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
Erm... Agape, miss.

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,400
Love between heroes was regarded as
surpassing the love within marriage,

119
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
but in Sparta's...

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
Class rise.

121
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,040
Miss Talbot,

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
boys,

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
we have just heard that Mr Churchill
has accepted Germany's surrender.

124
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
The war in Europe is at an end!

125
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
You may cheer, boys.

126
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,960
No more bloody war!

127
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
Eddie!

128
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
Oh!

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Hello.

130
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Are you lost?

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,520
I... I was...
I was looking for Captain March,

132
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,460
but perhaps I have
his address wrong.

133
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,400
No, no, no.
He has the studio upstairs.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
We share an entrance.

135
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Oh.

136
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
I don't bite, unless you pay extra.

137
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,920
I'm Lucien...

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
landlord, watchdog,
purveyor of shade to the gentry.

139
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Who are you?

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm, um... My name's Berryman.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
Michael Berryman.

142
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,040
Enter, Michael Berryman.

143
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,760
You came.

144
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,800
We were only demobbed
from Colchester this morning.

145
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,520
Erm... If it's...
If it's not convenient.

146
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,400
No, don't... Don't be silly. It's...

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
Erm...

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,080
Ah...

149
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,880
So, what are your plans?

150
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,760
For the rest of the evening?

151
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,320
Bugger all.

152
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,880
Oh, good.

153
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,600
And what about...?

154
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
Sorry, I've forgotten her name.

155
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,480
Flora.

156
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,400
Flora Talbot. She...

157
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,960
She doesn't know I'm back yet.

158
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Left here!

159
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,120
Left!

160
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
I haven't been here
since my parents died.

161
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I should have written.

162
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm a coward.

163
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,280
I wrote to you in my head
every bloody day, but I...

164
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I wrote to you.

165
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,880
Really?

166
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,400
Nothing ever got through.

167
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,400
I never said I'd posted them.

168
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,920
Tea!

169
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Very old tea.

170
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,240
Fuck, it feels cold.

171
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,800
I also found...

172
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,080
an unopened tin of shortbread.

173
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,720
It must be pre-war. Mmm.

174
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Morning, March.

175
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Captain.

176
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,160
Erm, how much is that going to be?
Shall we go for six?

177
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,280
Thank you so much.

178
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,520
You've not mentioned her all week.

179
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,280
It was scarcely appropriate.

180
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Do you love her?

181
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,120
I...

182
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,120
You'll love her too.

183
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,160
How cosy!

184
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Please, Thomas.

185
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,840
Yeah, I don't understand how you can
be so matter-of-fact.

186
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,160
Does she love you?

187
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,240
I imagine so, or she wouldn't have
agreed to marry me.

188
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,560
Please say yes, Tom.

189
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,720
Say you'll be there, at least,
please.

190
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,520
I... I've no family.

191
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,800
I don't want to be
your bloody family.

192
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
I...

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
Hmm?

194
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
Please...

195
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
You have no idea, have you?

196
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,920
What about, Thomas?

197
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,520
You surely didn't think that
we could set up house together

198
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,320
like man and wife? Please.

199
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
Just... Just be quiet.

200
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,320
Just...
Let's just get back to London.

201
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,800
Nearly there.

202
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm so glad you wore Mummy's brooch.

203
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
Oh, bloody hell.

204
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,920
You are not to cry.

205
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh, there he is. Thomas!

206
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,360
Hello. Erm, you must be...

207
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,600
Daphne - older sister,
matron of honour and all that.

208
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
Thomas March. How do you do?

209
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,120
Michael says you're an artist.
How very romantic.

210
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,280
Oh, hardly.

211
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Flora, how do you do?

212
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,840
Hello, Thomas.

213
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,640
You look wonderful. Worth the wait.

214
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Thank you.

215
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,760
Oh, sorry that I couldn't come
to your supper party.

216
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,940
I am horribly unsociable
when I'm working.

217
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,120
Talking of which,
I brought you something -

218
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,760
a wedding present.

219
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,200
Oh. That's so sweet.

220
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,640
We should probably...

221
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,880
Yes. Michael?

222
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Yes.

223
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,320
You came.

224
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
Of course I came.

225
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,320
The fucking best man has to.

226
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,280
If any man or woman knows just cause
or impediment why these two

227
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,480
should not be joined together,
let him now speak,

228
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,120
or else hereafter
forever hold his peace.

229
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,200
Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman,
take Flora Agnes Talbot

230
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
to be your wedded wife?

231
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,840
I do.

232
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,720
Do you, Flora Agnes...

233
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,000
It seems wrong,
having no-one in tears.

234
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,040
Well, I'd hope so.

235
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,560
Oh, I don't think we...

236
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,660
Compliments of Mr March, sir.

237
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,760
Thomas, you shouldn't have.

238
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,480
You can't get married
and not have bubbles.

239
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,600
Thank you.

240
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,440
Thank you.

241
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,680
So, to the bride and groom.

242
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,720
Bless you, Thomas.

243
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,400
Oh, please, no speeches, anyone,
or I shall cry.

244
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,520
So, are you...

245
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,760
Are you really not having
a honeymoon?

246
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,880
We haven't a bean until Michael's
salary from the bank comes through.

247
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,000
We used pretty much all of our
savings on the deposit for the flat.

248
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,120
So not even a weekend
in your cottage?

249
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,660
Erm...

250
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, dear.

251
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,480
Not until it has a boiler,
a new bathroom and no mice.

252
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,600
The flat is darling, though -
right on the park.

253
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,840
You must come for supper.

254
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, you must.

255
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Apparently, Thomas's pad in Soho
was unreconstructed Hogarth.

256
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,740
How marvellous.

257
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,880
Not really.

258
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,200
So, won't you miss your teaching?

259
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,240
Hardly. All those dirty-minded
little boys.

260
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,080
Ah, food!

261
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,240
Daphne could eat a horse.

262
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
Naughty!

263
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,480
Thanks so much, Thomas,
for everything.

264
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,240
You, um...

265
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,200
You've... You've been brilliant.

266
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,960
Haven't I?

267
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,960
Thomas, I, um...

268
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,640
Thomas I, um...

269
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,680
I really...

270
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
What?

271
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,000
What? What do you really?

272
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,000
I just...

273
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,520
Just give us a bloody minute,
will you?

274
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Of course.

275
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,960
You don't have to
go through with this.

276
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,720
Of course I do.

277
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,960
If you have either sense or decency,

278
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,000
you'll do the same.

279
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
Well, I'll go and settle up.

280
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,000
You're perfection.

281
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,740
I feel a bit of a fraud.

282
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,880
Oh, darling, you'll be fine.

283
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,240
You'll see.

284
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,360
I bet he's a real goer,
but sensitive with it.

285
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,680
It's...

286
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
What?

287
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Tell me.

288
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,800
It's a lot nicer
if he lets you ride up top.

289
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,640
Oh, Daphne!

290
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm... I'm told it gets better.

291
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,320
Yes. I heard that too.

292
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
Mrs Berryman.

293
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,100
Actually, do you mind just...?

294
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,920
Oh, of course. Sorry, darling.

295
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,920
Now, if I snore,
you're to throw a book at me.

296
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,000
Goodnight.

297
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Back to work, Berryman.

298
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
So, who else shall we invite?

299
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,360
If we simply have Daphne
and this new chap of hers,

300
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,000
the poor man will feel
he's being auditioned.

301
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,840
Well, isn't he?

302
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,280
She rather implied
she'd already auditioned him,

303
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,200
and he'd passed with flying colours.

304
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,600
Sorry, what was that?
I was miles away.

305
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,560
I said, who else shall we invite?

306
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,600
Er, well, I ran into
Richard Tremaine

307
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,640
at Blackfriars the other day.

308
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,460
You know, from the regiment.
We could have him and his wife.

309
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,280
What about poor Thomas? We haven't
seen him since the wedding.

310
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Daphne thought
he was a bit of all right,

311
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,560
and has all sorts of eager spinsters
lined up for him.

312
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
No, I don't think so.

313
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
Why ever not?

314
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Well, he's not terribly sociable,
really.

315
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,080
He'd only be a dead weight.

316
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,840
And you can tell Daphne
he's a confirmed bachelor.

317
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,080
She'd only take that
as a personal challenge.

318
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,360
Ah...

319
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,920
Daphne.

320
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,680
Thank God. I'm starving.

321
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,040
Me too.

322
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,160
Oh, of course you are. Poor darling.

323
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,040
How many weeks to go?

324
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
Two or three.

325
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,160
Ooh. Let's find you a nice bench.

326
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,000
Such a drama this morning.

327
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,880
Hmm?

328
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,340
Bill Gladstone.

329
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,600
Which is he?

330
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,680
Victorian watercolours and china.
Lives with his mother.

331
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
He was arrested,
first thing this morning.

332
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,440
No! Why?

333
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,680
It turns out he was also
living with the man upstairs.

334
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
One of their neighbours had sneaked,

335
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,480
and the police showed up at dawn
and caught them together in bed.

336
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,280
Will he go to prison?

337
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,880
Almost certainly,

338
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,480
and Bill has a prior history
of gross indecency,

339
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,680
which isn't as bad as buggery,
but it's almost as bad.

340
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,800
No more handling
Lady Downing's bristols for him!

341
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,880
Gross indecency?
You mean...exposing himself?

342
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,320
No. You know, public lavatories.

343
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,440
Oh.

344
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Now, darling, tell.

345
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,560
You sounded all shaky when you rang,

346
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,840
and I was quite worried.

347
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,720
It's nothing.

348
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,620
Hormones running riot, probably -

349
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,520
making me feel like a caged beast.

350
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,920
It is good to see you.

351
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,500
You know you can tell me.

352
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,690
You can tell me anything.

353
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,880
I know, but it's nothing.

354
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,360
Everything's fine.

355
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,080
Well, this is nice.

356
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm sorry, darling,
I was miles away...

357
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,360
and you've gone to so much trouble,
and in your condition.

358
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,720
Time on my hands.

359
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,280
I tidied your desk this morning.

360
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,760
Why?

361
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,280
I needed some ink
and it was full of junk in there.

362
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,520
I hope I didn't throw out
anything precious.

363
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Well, I'm a hoarder.
You'll reform me yet.

364
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,120
Where's Thomas's painting?

365
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,560
I took it down. I rather hate it.

366
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Well, perhaps I could take it
to the cottage, so you...

367
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,840
Back to your precious cottage,
you'd love that, wouldn't you?

368
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,880
Pudding's only pears, I'm afraid.

369
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
Oh, God.

370
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Take this fucking thing!

371
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,840
What should I...

372
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,840
I don't want it under our roof
another night. It's repellent.

373
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,520
Yes. I mean, what are you?

374
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Are you safe around children?

375
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,520
What were you thinking, marrying me?
Do you even love me?!

376
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,280
If I'm expected to lie around
bringing forth like some brood mare,

377
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,360
while the two of you...

378
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,440
Darling. Darling, sit down...

379
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,680
Don't touch me!

380
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,400
Never touch me. You're disgusting!

381
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Criminal!

382
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,800
Mr Berryman?

383
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,680
Oh, thank God.

384
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,360
It's this way.

385
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,840
You came just in time.

386
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,400
Go and have a drink, Mr Berryman.

387
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,480
It'll be hours yet, and it's all
woman's work from here on in.

388
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,880
Ooh! Sorry. So sorry.

389
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,000
Let me put those in water.
Thank you.

390
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,040
There's not much on offer at this
time of year, even at Covent Garden.

391
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
You went all that way?

392
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,120
They're lovely. I like white roses.

393
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,500
He's... He...

394
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,120
He's sweet.

395
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,720
Bit soon to tell.

396
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,560
Eager feeder, though,
but it hurts like hell.

397
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,640
I thought maybe Robert,
after your father,

398
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,120
and James for mine.

399
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,280
Look, darling, I'm so...

400
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,360
I am far, far too tired
to talk about it.

401
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,720
Would you like to hold him?

402
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,040
He's... He's asleep.
Perhaps we should just leave him.

403
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,160
No, pick him up, please.

404
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,160
I really... I want the father of
my child to hold his son.

405
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,160
Hold his head.

406
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,880
So, you like it?

407
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
What?

408
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,520
The name - Robert James.

409
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,000
Yes. Yes. Yes, it's perfect.

410
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,840
It's perfect.

411
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,760
Did you light a cigar?

412
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,800
Certainly not.

413
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,440
Papers!

414
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,320
There you go, sir. Thank you.

415
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
Papers! Get your papers...

416
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,240
Come on.

417
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,000
It took me several weeks
to track you down.

418
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,440
How?

419
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,680
Your boss and I go back
a long, long way.

420
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,600
But he's...

421
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,320
He's married with children.
There's a lot of it about.

422
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Thomas is in prison.

423
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,240
Why?

424
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,680
The usual - cottaging.

425
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
Oh, Christ, he really can pick them.

426
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,520
Gross indecency, dear.

427
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,880
One year.

428
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,400
You must visit him.

429
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,720
But, look, it...

430
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,120
No buts. He needs you.

431
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,600
What lies you tell are up to you.

432
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,360
Well, I'm told dentistry
usually works.

433
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,120
Why me?

434
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,680
Because you could fuck,
understand him and meet the mother.

435
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,560
You got under his skin.

436
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,680
He loves you, truly.

437
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Right, let's be having you!

438
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,680
Sit yourself down.

439
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,600
Yeah, well, move along.

440
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,680
I, um...

441
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
I brought you a pad
and some charcoal.

442
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,960
You look terrible, Thomas.

443
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,260
It's prison food -

444
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,560
permanent trots.

445
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,600
You look like a bank manager.

446
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,600
How is...

447
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,960
..Flora?

448
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,560
Yes, fine. Fine.

449
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,960
Though, um, motherhood seems to
make her a little impatient.

450
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,480
She, um...

451
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,560
Baby boy arrived in November -
Robert.

452
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,040
Well...

453
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,240
Just make sure that she doesn't...

454
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,160
..that she doesn't turn him
into a banker too.

455
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,960
I, um...

456
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,800
We'd, um...

457
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,000
We'd like to ask you to be
his godfather.

458
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,920
Well, once...once you get out.

459
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,680
What on earth for?

460
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,440
Well...

461
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,520
Well, whatever you think of church
or children,

462
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
it's rather a good way
to stay in touch

463
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,480
with the people who...who matter.

464
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,320
Don't visit again.

465
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,800
But... It's upsetting.

466
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,240
Oh.

467
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
Do something for me.

468
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,520
I was at school with Thomas,
Mrs March.

469
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,760
I know who you are, Mr Berryman.

470
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,040
How is he?

471
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,160
He, er...

472
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,480
He's, um... He's grown a beard.

473
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,240
His father did that once, for Ibsen.

474
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,720
Does it suit him?

475
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
Yes.

476
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
Yes, he...

477
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,680
He looks like a submariner.

478
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,440
It's oddly like having him
back in boarding school.

479
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,560
I was forbidden to visit there too,
in case I embarrassed him.

480
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,480
Oh, you needn't look at me
with such sensitivity.

481
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,760
I'm well aware of what he did
and why he's there.

482
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,920
I have been storing them
in his absence,

483
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,280
rather than leave them
with that creature in Soho.

484
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,920
I write him letters in soft pencil
on one side of cartridge paper,

485
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,600
so he can draw on the other.

486
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,560
Well, you should take this one.

487
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,120
It's only a study.

488
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,080
He must have sold
the finished portrait.

489
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,880
I call it Man In An Orange Shirt,

490
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,800
but it's you, isn't it?

491
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
Yes.

492
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
So you must take it.

493
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,400
Oh, no, I... I couldn't possibly.

494
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,200
Uh, I think it's...it's
wonderful, the colours...

495
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,240
but our...our flat's so tiny.

496
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,960
Perhaps, um...

497
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,360
Perhaps just one of the notebooks?

498
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,520
Oh, well, that one's damaged.

499
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,640
Yes, but, um...

500
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,160
I was there, you see.

501
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,680
I have a very small house
in France, Mr Berryman...

502
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,560
..in a very small village,
in Cassis.

503
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
You can go there
when Thomas comes out.

504
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,520
He...he can paint
and...and you can...

505
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,480
you can write something.

506
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,720
That's very kind of you, Mrs March,
but, um, he wants...

507
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,560
he wants nothing more to do with me.

508
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,880
Oh, that's just pride.

509
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,880
And I have a wife and child.

510
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,960
Is she happy?

511
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
She's...

512
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,200
I, um...

513
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,320
I should...
I should be getting home.

514
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
My darling Thomas,

515
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,640
you refuse my visits so you're
probably tearing up my letters too,

516
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,560
but there's nothing else
I can do but keep trying.

517
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,360
It's beyond my control, do you see?

518
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,040
All those months ago,
when I had nothing to lose really,

519
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,200
I wrote to you in my head,

520
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,920
but was too cowardly to set
more than lies on paper,

521
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,000
and now I find I no longer care.

522
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,200
The love I feel for you runs through
me like grain through wood.

523
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,720
I love you, Thomas. I love you.

524
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,260
Your face, your voice, your touch,
enter my mind at the least

525
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,800
opportune moments and I find
I have no power to withstand them.

526
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,040
No desire to.

527
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,720
I want us to be together
as we were in the cottage,

528
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,440
only forever, not just a weekend.

529
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,120
I want it to go on so long
that it feels normal.

530
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,800
I want to do all the ordinary,
un-bedroomy things

531
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,760
we never got around to doing -

532
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,720
making toast, raking leaves,

533
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,160
sitting in silence.

534
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,060
I love you, Thomas.

535
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,560
I've always loved you -

536
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,880
I see that now.

537
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,520
Tell me I'm not too late.

538
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,520
There she is.

539
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,280
Going to say hello? Oh, look.

540
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,000
So solemn. So like his pa!

541
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,320
I can't believe
he's nearly one already.

542
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,120
I say, not to worry about bridge
tonight if Michael's away.

543
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,080
Percy can always take me out
somewhere instead.

544
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,560
Oh, tonight? But he's...

545
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,440
I was coming out of South Ken on my
way to Christie's this morning,

546
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,640
and I saw him striding towards
the train with his suitcase,

547
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,120
as well as the usual briefcase.

548
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,080
Oh, yes. I'm such a dolt, darling.

549
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,840
I'd completely forgot to tell you,

550
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,800
he's got some dreary conference
to go to.

551
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,840
Banking - whither?

552
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,640
You know the sort of thing.

553
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,600
Well, we can play when he's back.

554
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,880
Are you all right?

555
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,400
Fine.

556
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,240
Oh, do hush, Robert.

557
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh, hush!

558
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,800
For pity's sake!

559
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,880
Hello. British Savings Bank.

560
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,720
Hello. Can you put me through
to Michael Berryman, please?

561
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,320
Who's calling, please?
It's his wife.

562
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,760
Oh.

563
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,240
Oh, of course, those wretched teeth!
How stupid of me to have forgotten.

564
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,080
Oh, stop it!

565
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,760
I can't bear it! Stop it, stop it!

566
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,200
Stop it!

567
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,240
Come to me...

568
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,560
Sorry.

569
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,960
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry...

570
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,960
It's Thomas...

571
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,480
Thomas, dear boy!
Thomas! Thomas! How are you?

572
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,800
Thomas. Oh, Thomas...

573
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Well...

574
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,880
So, are you all right?

575
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,400
Let's get in the cab. Come on.
We'll see you at the flat?

576
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,000
Yes. Get in.

577
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,080
Hello, darling. Get in.

578
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,520
Hello.

579
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,680
Hello.

580
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,920
Oh...

581
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,400
I'll tell you anything you...

582
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,120
I'd rather you didn't.

583
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,000
I don't want a divorce.

584
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,360
Please, Michael!

585
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,080
It wouldn't be fair to Robert.

586
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,640
But I...I...

587
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,960
I don't want to make you wretched.

588
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,640
I never want details.

589
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,460
You must never get caught.

590
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,600
We will never speak of it.

591
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,480
But, darling, I...

592
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,040
Please, don't you love me at all?

593
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,320
Of course I do.

594
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:13,160
I'm just a sister
who happened to bear your child.

595
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,080
I...

596
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,240
I can live with that.

597
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,920
I do, I...

598
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,280
Lovely morning, sir.

599
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,440
All well?

600
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,240
He wants to make an entrance.

601
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,520
Ready?

602
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,240
We can't wait.

603
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,160
Oh! Oh!

604
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,800
Stop laughing at me!

605
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,440
Oh, dear.

606
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,600
Fortnum's will cheer him up.

607
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,320
I just need to find the gents.

608
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,960
We'll meet you down by the lifts.

609
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,920
Robert, can I help?

610
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,300
Sorry...

611
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,400
Sorry.

612
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,720
Who's joining me on
the bus to Fortnum's? Me!

613
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,120
May I come too?

614
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,740
Don't be silly.

615
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,360
Michael, Flora!

616
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,160
Oh, Thomas!

617
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,160
How... H-h-how... How are you?

618
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,860
Fine. I'm fine.

619
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,360
Stunning day.

620
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,800
We've just been kitting someone out
for boarding school,

621
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,040
so I'm bracing myself for a long
afternoon sewing in name-tapes.

622
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,480
Oh, he can't be that age already?

623
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,440
We haven't met, Robert.
I'm Thomas March.

624
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,720
I knew your father when he wasn't
much older than you are.

625
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,760
Yes.

626
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,840
Yes, before I became respectable.

627
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,480
Thomas, you've been too long
a stranger. We must have you over.

628
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,760
Yes, we must.

629
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,760
I've not long moved, to Cassis.

630
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,640
Oh, to...to your mother's place.

631
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,920
Yes. That's right.

632
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,520
I'm just over
for my...my new exhibition.

633
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,000
It opens tonight.

634
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,240
Oh, bother.

635
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,000
Well, you could go along, darling.

636
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,520
Well, no, it's...
It's Robert's last night of freedom.

637
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,420
Can't let you start school
without a present, hmm? Here.

638
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,320
Thomas, you...you shouldn't...
What do you say, Robert?

639
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,360
Thank you, sir.

640
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,480
Oh, that's our bus.

641
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,640
Come along, Robert.

642
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,800
Bye-bye, Thomas.

643
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,440
Goodbye, old man.

644
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,200
I'll find seats!
We're not going that far.

645
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,720
Oh, let him, this once.
School's not that much fun.

646
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,000
Two and a child to Piccadilly,
please.

647
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
Two and a child to Piccadilly.

648
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,960
There you go, sir. Thank you.

649
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,360
Any more fares?

650
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,040
He'll drink himself to death
in the sunshine.

651
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,280
Probably.

652
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,000
Was that where you were going?

653
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,600
Yes.

654
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,320
Look! They're really good ones.

655
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,640
Goodness!

656
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,400
Well, I'd put them safely away until
we get home or you'll get all mucky.

657
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,400
Don't fidget, Bob.

658
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,960
"To Flora and Michael,

659
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,840
"in the hope the enclosed might
one day hang in your drawing room.

660
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,000
"Thomas."

661
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,880
Who did you go with?

662
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,280
A friend.

663
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,560
He loved me...

664
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,760
but he married me to
be like everybody else.

665
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
This is so not OK.

666
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,040
You are leaving a table of friends
just to fuck a complete stranger.

667
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,400
You're not even out, are you?

668
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
I bet you've still not
told your granny.
