1
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:43,376
"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

2
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:54,959
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river...called life."

3
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:07,001
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

4
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:19,501
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock...to keep flowing!.."

5
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:38,376
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

6
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,626
"it is called
the river of life."

7
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,501
Lord Shiva!

8
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,001
For all the sins
I have committed,

9
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,584
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

10
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:49,501
But this boy should live...

11
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:54,668
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

12
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:57,876
he should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati...

13
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:01,626
Mahendra Baahubali should live!

14
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:35,709
Dear me!

15
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,251
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

16
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,626
Hey! Be careful!

17
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:15,251
What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

18
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:16,668
With all the jewelry on her,

19
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,168
she must have been
a queen or something.

20
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,459
She died with her
hand pointing up!

21
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,126
Master!

22
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,376
What happened?

23
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,168
They must have come
here to kill her.

24
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,751
Looks like she got
the better of them.

25
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,626
Master!

26
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,376
Oh my God! A cave!

27
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,751
We never knew this existed!

28
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:50,334
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

29
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,626
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

30
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,543
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

31
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,001
You are out of your mind?

32
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,626
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

33
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,001
What dangers do
you think await him...

34
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,001
if you send him back there!
- But, Sanga..

35
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,001
This is my baby.

36
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,001
I have no children...

37
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,876
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

38
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:15,001
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

39
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,376
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

40
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:30,501
Shiva!

41
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,376
Shiva!

42
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,501
What are you doing here,
my dear?

43
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,334
What is up there, mother?

44
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,793
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

45
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,918
They prey on
and eat little kids!

46
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,751
But I want to go up there,
mother!

47
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:57,209
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

48
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,251
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

49
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:21,001
Why do you keep doing it?

50
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,709
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

51
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,751
Looks like he will
make it this time.

52
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,168
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

53
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,626
It goes way up into the clouds...

54
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:22,876
...And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

55
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,751
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

56
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,501
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

57
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:28,251
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

58
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,501
Shiva!

59
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,209
Your mother is up to something there!

60
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:16,334
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

61
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:18,626
That is fifteen!

62
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,751
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

63
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:27,001
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

64
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,251
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

65
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,126
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

66
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,126
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

67
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:38,626
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

68
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,876
Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

69
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,626
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

70
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,501
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

71
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,001
Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

72
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,501
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

73
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,376
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

74
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,376
Sanga?
- What?

75
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:00,043
Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

76
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:01,001
Let go of me!

77
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,626
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

78
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,501
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

79
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:10,126
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

80
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,626
Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

81
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,376
Mother.
- What is it now?

82
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,751
How about I carry you...

83
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,918
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

84
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,251
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

85
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,751
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

86
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,876
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

87
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,626
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

88
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:37,001
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

89
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,626
Lord Shiva!

90
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,668
<i>Sang,“!</i>

91
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,876
See what your lad is up to now!

92
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,751
What is it this time?

93
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,876
Shiva, stop!

94
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:06,751
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

95
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,376
Shiva.

96
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,001
Shiva, wait..

97
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:38,876
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

98
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:44,126
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

99
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:53,751
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

100
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,001
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

101
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,334
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

102
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:08,584
"Who is he and
where he comes from?

103
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,751
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

104
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:18,251
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

105
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:22,043
"River Bhagirathi, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

106
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:27,001
"Look at this great irony."

107
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:59,876
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

108
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:06,334
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

109
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:12,043
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

110
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,376
"Makes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

111
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:18,084
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

112
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,918
"With the lustrous gem"

113
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,293
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

114
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,626
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

115
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:30,001
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

116
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:36,543
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

117
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:39,043
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

118
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,418
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

119
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,834
"who is the leader of demons."

120
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,876
Mother!

121
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,376
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

122
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:11,876
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

123
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,251
Yes..

124
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,751
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

125
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:21,501
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

126
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:24,501
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

127
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:28,376
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

128
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,501
that fell on the Shivalingam
from above.

129
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,959
Now what is with that?

130
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,876
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

131
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,501
Only He would know.

132
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:41,668
A small doubt.

133
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,751
Since my son was
the one who made sure

134
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,334
the idol is bathed
all the time.

135
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,001
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

136
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:49,501
or will Sanga's
wish of him always

137
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,793
staying down here come true?

138
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:54,501
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

139
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:57,751
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

140
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:03,043
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

141
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,876
Hail Lord Shiva!

142
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:06,751
What did he say?

143
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,001
Shiva!

144
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,293
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

145
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,626
There is somebody up there.

146
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,251
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

147
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,751
Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

148
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,251
Let us go, boys.

149
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:33,084
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

150
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:48,251
"My heart is lost."

151
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:55,376
"Like a drop in the waves."

152
00:21:55,793 --> 00:22:01,251
"I am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

153
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:05,001
"I am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls"

154
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:09,876
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

155
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:16,334
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

156
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:22,501
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

157
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:28,751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

158
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:35,751
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

159
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,751
"I breathe for you..."

160
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,876
"and only you"

161
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:18,751
"Come and let us live together."

162
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:24,334
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

163
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:31,751
"I chose you as my soul mate."

164
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:38,626
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

165
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,001
"I am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

166
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:51,126
"I will break free of every
mountain in no time."

167
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:55,834
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

168
00:23:57,376 --> 00:24:02,084
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

169
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:08,251
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

170
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:14,876
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

171
00:24:56,668 --> 00:25:08,584
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

172
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:14,626
"Drop a word and I swear"

173
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:20,834
"I will give up my life for you."

174
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:28,626
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

175
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:34,834
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

176
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:41,251
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

177
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:47,459
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

178
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:50,751
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

179
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,876
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

180
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:57,251
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

181
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,001
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

182
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,251
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

183
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,918
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

184
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:10,751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

185
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:17,334
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

186
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:23,751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

187
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:29,959
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

188
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,251
"The persevering one.."

189
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:37,251
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

190
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:45,501
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

191
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:48,834
Hey!

192
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:53,376
Hey! Stop!

193
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,626
Stop!

194
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,001
Over there!

195
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,751
Kasi!

196
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,251
It is a trap. Kill them!

197
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,501
Dear God!

198
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:41,168
How come you got this?

199
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:44,418
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

200
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:48,126
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

201
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,584
It was tied to his wrist.
I took it from him.

202
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:53,501
I don't know anything else.

203
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,876
Let me go! Let me..

204
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:07,584
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

205
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:50,376
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

206
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,876
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

207
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:12,001
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

208
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,709
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

209
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:26,709
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

210
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,793
Our pride and honour is injured
and we suffer in silence.

211
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:41,084
It is not time to shed tears.

212
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:43,251
It is time to breathe fire.

213
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:48,376
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

214
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:51,293
We will remember it
till our last breath.

215
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,376
To meet our goal

216
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,751
we will clash with thunder..
- We won't lose courage.

217
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:57,126
Come hell or high water..
- We will be brave!

218
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:59,293
Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

219
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,876
We shall rescue Devasena!

220
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:07,251
If we are to achieve our goal..

221
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:23,501
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

222
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,501
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

223
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,876
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Kuntala Kingdom..."

224
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,126
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

225
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,584
My leader...

226
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,293
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

227
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,209
called Kattappa of Mahishmati.

228
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:49,334
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

229
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,626
Karikala Kattappa Nadaar.

230
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,001
He is indeed a good man.

231
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:57,459
He can help us if he wants to.

232
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,959
But he won't...

233
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:06,626
Kattappa is a slave
the throne of Mahishmati.

234
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,876
Kattappa.

235
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:21,376
A sword trader, Sheik Aslam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

236
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:37,126
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

237
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,251
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

238
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,751
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

239
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,626
With this in hand...

240
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,626
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

241
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,501
I call this the Sikander.

242
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:00,376
The Pride of Swords.

243
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:08,959
A wonderful sword.

244
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:13,126
But forgive me, Aslam,
this cannot match our speed.

245
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,251
How insulting!

246
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:24,751
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

247
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:30,376
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

248
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:01,376
Does that prove
my point, Kattappa?

249
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,626
I have traveled
across the world

250
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,459
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

251
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,126
But never seen
a warrior like you.

252
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:34,959
It will be an honour
to break bread with you.

253
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,959
Please come, Kattappa.
- Please forgive me, Aslam.

254
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:42,793
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

255
00:35:42,793 --> 00:35:43,876
Slave?

256
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:49,876
You are the head of the armoury,
how can you be a slave?

257
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:52,626
Yes, Aslam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

258
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,709
He forges the weapons for war.

259
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:58,001
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

260
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,501
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

261
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:08,376
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

262
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,626
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

263
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,376
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Aslam.

264
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:20,626
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

265
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:24,334
will serve the throne
of Mahishmati for life.

266
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:27,501
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

267
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:29,501
you still..

268
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,626
People who made the pledge
might be dead

269
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:35,001
but their word
still lives on, Aslam.

270
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,751
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

271
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:45,584
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kattappa.

272
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:48,876
If you ever need anything...

273
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,876
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

274
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:18,251
Vaishali.
- Hmm.

275
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:22,084
Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

276
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:10,876
We have a golden opportunity

277
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,751
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

278
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:16,251
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

279
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:18,209
on the next new moon.

280
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:21,251
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

281
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:25,751
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

282
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:29,626
Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

283
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,126
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

284
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:37,709
Avanthika!

285
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:51,126
What is this, Avanthika?

286
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:55,876
Where did this come from?

287
00:39:57,043 --> 00:40:00,459
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

288
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:06,584
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

289
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,751
You are not worthy
of this honour. Leave us.

290
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,126
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

291
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,959
nor do they come from pain.

292
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:34,501
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

293
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:39,376
If you can feel their intensity

294
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,084
then let me go.

295
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:54,834
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

296
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,626
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

297
00:40:57,793 --> 00:41:00,001
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

298
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:03,459
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

299
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:40,876
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

300
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:50,959
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

301
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:09,876
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

302
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:16,793
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

303
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:21,376
"and the home of peace."

304
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:40,501
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

305
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:44,418
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

306
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:48,751
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

307
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:18,043
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

308
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:19,876
we caught that bull
in the forests.

309
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:23,376
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

310
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:24,959
Minister!

311
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:31,209
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

312
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,501
Please come.

313
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:36,876
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

314
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:41,459
Yes!

315
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:48,709
Kill him, father.

316
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:02,251
Did you see, grandfather?

317
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:04,459
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

318
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:06,626
Glory to the king!

319
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:08,626
That was a great feat..

320
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,626
Bravo, Your Majesty!

321
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,751
Bhallaladeva!

322
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:51,501
Father!

323
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,209
He did it!

324
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,501
Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

325
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:07,751
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kattappa.

326
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:12,168
I know deep in your heart...

327
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,459
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

328
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:19,959
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

329
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:21,709
How do you do it?

330
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,376
How do you manage to do this?

331
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:28,126
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

332
00:46:30,293 --> 00:46:31,876
Ask for anything!

333
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:35,709
Your Majesty!

334
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:41,626
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

335
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,626
Please release her.

336
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:53,584
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

337
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:58,001
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

338
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:06,126
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

339
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,626
No?

340
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:13,209
Then let her suffer.

341
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,376
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

342
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:56,584
Hey old hag! Get up!

343
00:48:04,293 --> 00:48:05,584
Hey! Get up.

344
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:49,251
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

345
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:55,751
You chose him over me.

346
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:59,459
So where is he now?

347
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:04,001
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

348
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,543
In all these years...

349
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:11,251
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

350
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:17,584
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

351
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:21,001
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

352
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,501
did you ever hear his name?

353
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:29,584
No.

354
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:34,126
Mahishmati has forgotten him,
Devasena.

355
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:37,084
They neither talk
about him anymore...

356
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,626
and nor do they remember him.

357
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:44,376
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

358
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:47,001
You and I.

359
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:51,251
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

360
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:55,126
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

361
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,751
with my bare hands.

362
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,876
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

363
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,626
Lady Devasena!

364
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,709
At least, accept it now.

365
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,626
You just have to say yes...

366
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,126
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

367
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:34,751
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

368
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:38,626
No, Kattappa.

369
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:44,459
My son will come
and he will set me free.

370
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,959
How can your dead child
come back for you?

371
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:51,251
My son is alive.

372
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,251
He will come looking for me!

373
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:57,501
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

374
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:00,209
who is no longer alive,
My Lady!

375
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:03,751
Please get a grip on yourself.

376
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:07,126
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

377
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:11,126
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

378
00:52:11,126 --> 00:52:12,376
Please agree!

379
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,251
Please accept it.

380
00:52:16,543 --> 00:52:20,876
I am begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

381
00:52:32,418 --> 00:52:37,709
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kattappa?

382
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,876
This is a funeral pyre!

383
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:50,251
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

384
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:55,001
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

385
00:52:58,293 --> 00:52:59,876
My son will come...

386
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,251
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

387
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,251
My son will make me
light the pyre...

388
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:08,626
while Bhalla is still alive.

389
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:12,126
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

390
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:16,209
beyond the walls
of Mahishmati.

391
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:19,376
My son will come!

392
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,376
What happened, Avanthika?

393
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:38,001
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

394
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:43,126
He will come back
once he sees me.

395
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:31,709
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

396
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:43,793
Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

397
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:45,084
Avanthi, listen!

398
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:13,376
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

399
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:17,876
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

400
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:32,126
Oh My God!

401
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:34,376
Hey! What is with the arrows?

402
00:56:34,376 --> 00:56:36,084
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

403
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:41,126
Who are you?
- That is better.

404
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,168
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

405
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:44,751
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

406
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:51,334
What a girl!

407
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:20,751
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

408
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:25,251
Avanthika?

409
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:37,876
Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

410
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:39,334
I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

411
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,376
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

412
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,126
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

413
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:51,709
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

414
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:57,543
But before that I have
to ask you one thing. - What?

415
00:57:57,543 --> 00:58:02,251
Who are you? Who are you?

416
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:10,501
You got a sword in your hand.

417
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:14,084
Not to mention body armour, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

418
00:58:14,793 --> 00:58:17,334
I am not asking about
this mask of yours!

419
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:21,376
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

420
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:27,209
Shall I tell you?

421
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:33,209
You are a woman and I am a man.

422
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:37,626
I have come here to love you.

423
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,959
Now that hurts.

424
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:30,626
This is mine.

425
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:33,959
I dropped it near the waterfall.

426
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:41,709
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

427
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,084
Just for me?

428
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:50,126
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

429
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,876
I still don't see it.

430
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:23,626
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

431
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:29,376
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

432
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:36,251
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

433
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:41,501
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

434
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:46,501
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

435
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:51,126
"But now I want to live for you."

436
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:56,501
"I made a pact with my heart."

437
01:02:56,668 --> 01:03:01,876
"I will be born a hundred times
for you."

438
01:03:01,876 --> 01:03:06,751
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

439
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:12,751
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

440
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:38,376
"I will write our love saga
on the skies."

441
01:03:38,793 --> 01:03:43,376
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

442
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:53,626
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

443
01:03:53,626 --> 01:03:57,751
"Being in love is so lovely."

444
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:03,126
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

445
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:08,168
"But now I want to live for you."

446
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:17,876
"I made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

447
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:23,418
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

448
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:28,501
"I am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

449
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:33,876
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

450
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:39,626
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

451
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:05,626
This is something
the world has never seen.

452
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:08,584
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

453
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:11,584
Even the Gods don't
get this honour.

454
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:13,834
Once this is erected,

455
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:17,001
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

456
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:19,334
will live on forever
in the entire world.

457
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:24,918
Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

458
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:27,001
There will be celebrations galore.

459
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:30,876
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

460
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,626
Avanthika..

461
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:35,834
Frisk her!

462
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:12,751
Attack!

463
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:14,834
Baahubafin

464
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:21,626
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

465
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:25,751
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

466
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:34,959
Forgive me.

467
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,001
Shiva!

468
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:06,334
Please forgive me, Shiva.

469
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,001
I didn't know what else to do.

470
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:13,459
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

471
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:15,876
You are mine, Avanthika.

472
01:11:16,876 --> 01:11:19,001
Everything that is yours
is mine.

473
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,126
I also share your obligation.

474
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,751
I don't know who Devasena is.

475
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,459
If your goal is to free her

476
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,334
then I will bring her back!

477
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:45,751
This is my word.

478
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:55,751
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

479
01:11:55,751 --> 01:11:59,626
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart"

480
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:09,876
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

481
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:14,459
"O Kingdom! see who
comes your way."

482
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:17,876
Mahishmati,
you can breathe now.

483
01:13:18,918 --> 01:13:20,834
My son is back.

484
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:23,501
Baahubali is back!

485
01:14:44,376 --> 01:14:45,668
When the king's statue
is erected...

486
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:47,001
everyone must applaud!

487
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:49,168
When the king's statue
is erected

488
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:50,584
everyone must applaud!

489
01:15:36,043 --> 01:15:37,459
No worries!

490
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:39,876
It is a hundred foot statue.

491
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:42,501
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

492
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:46,126
Thank you.

493
01:16:57,001 --> 01:16:58,459
Baahubafin

494
01:16:59,793 --> 01:17:03,043
Baahubafi?
- Baahubali.

495
01:17:03,043 --> 01:17:05,626
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

496
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:13,126
Baahubali! Baahubali!

497
01:17:13,126 --> 01:17:15,543
Move it!
- Baahubali! Baahubali!

498
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:25,001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

499
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:28,584
Baahubali! Baahubali!

500
01:17:33,626 --> 01:17:37,584
Baahubali! Baahubali!

501
01:17:40,043 --> 01:17:41,251
Hey!

502
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,126
Who was that?

503
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:49,876
Baahubali! Baahubali!

504
01:17:50,043 --> 01:17:52,751
Baahubali! Baahubali!

505
01:18:23,376 --> 01:18:25,626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

506
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:37,626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

507
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,376
Baahubali!

508
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:07,001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

509
01:19:07,168 --> 01:19:09,876
Baahubali! Baahubali!

510
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:13,126
Baahubali! Baahubali!

511
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:53,709
It is been fifteen days
since my son left! - Hold this.

512
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:55,626
He hasn't returned yet.

513
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:57,626
I wonder if he is alright.

514
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,501
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

515
01:19:59,668 --> 01:20:00,501
What can happen to him?

516
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:03,001
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

517
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:05,626
Maybe he found his family.

518
01:20:05,793 --> 01:20:07,876
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

519
01:20:08,043 --> 01:20:10,834
Will he never come? Will he not
call me mother again? - Sanga.

520
01:20:11,043 --> 01:20:12,876
People, hurry up, will you?

521
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:28,001
Come on.

522
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:38,126
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

523
01:20:38,293 --> 01:20:40,209
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

524
01:20:40,376 --> 01:20:43,501
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

525
01:20:44,293 --> 01:20:48,459
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

526
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:51,751
Alright!

527
01:20:56,668 --> 01:21:00,751
"Mahasena!"

528
01:21:05,751 --> 01:21:07,251
Who says that Baahubali,

529
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:10,001
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

530
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:19,126
I am nothing, but a living dead.

531
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:24,459
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

532
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,751
Baahubali! Baahubali!

533
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:38,584
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

534
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:44,751
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

535
01:21:45,626 --> 01:21:48,251
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

536
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:54,751
Or did they see someone?

537
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:57,584
No! Impossible!

538
01:21:59,168 --> 01:22:01,584
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

539
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:02,959
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

540
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,209
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

541
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,209
What are you doing here?

542
01:22:46,376 --> 01:22:48,209
L.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

543
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:04,626
Who first uttered the
name of Baahubali in the crowd?

544
01:23:09,501 --> 01:23:12,209
Am I talking to these walls?

545
01:23:12,418 --> 01:23:15,626
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

546
01:23:16,293 --> 01:23:20,251
I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

547
01:23:22,376 --> 01:23:24,834
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

548
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,459
I saw him, My Lord!

549
01:24:13,126 --> 01:24:17,584
I have seen those eyes before!

550
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:22,876
Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

551
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:38,876
Hey, who are you?

552
01:24:55,543 --> 01:24:57,126
He is here! Catch him.

553
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,376
Catch him..

554
01:25:33,876 --> 01:25:34,959
That way..

555
01:26:32,293 --> 01:26:33,459
Sound the alarm!

556
01:26:50,543 --> 01:26:52,126
I have come to rescue you.

557
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:56,751
Kattappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

558
01:26:57,001 --> 01:26:58,584
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

559
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:00,251
You head north.

560
01:27:18,626 --> 01:27:21,751
Kattappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

561
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:24,626
As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

562
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:28,709
Come on!

563
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,001
The alarm!

564
01:28:47,293 --> 01:28:48,501
Attack!

565
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:52,709
Get up!

566
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:57,001
You lousy old hag!

567
01:29:59,418 --> 01:30:01,209
All these years of punishment...

568
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:03,126
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

569
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:09,626
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

570
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:19,459
Kattappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going to kill me!

571
01:31:19,626 --> 01:31:21,001
My Prince!

572
01:31:21,168 --> 01:31:23,459
It is my duty to protect you!

573
01:31:25,918 --> 01:31:28,459
To get to you,

574
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,334
he has to go through me first!

575
01:32:39,668 --> 01:32:40,876
Kattappfl!

576
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:43,459
Kattappfl!

577
01:32:54,376 --> 01:32:55,501
Devasena!

578
01:32:58,668 --> 01:32:59,834
Attack!

579
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,501
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

580
01:33:02,668 --> 01:33:04,334
Hail Mahishmati!

581
01:33:36,376 --> 01:33:37,626
Shiva!

582
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:44,376
Siddha!

583
01:33:56,793 --> 01:34:00,001
"Mahasena!"

584
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:06,626
"Mahasena!"

585
01:34:11,543 --> 01:34:14,376
"Mahasena!"

586
01:35:13,293 --> 01:35:14,709
Anila!

587
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:02,501
Baahubali!

588
01:37:27,376 --> 01:37:30,001
You resurrected our lost hope.

589
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:31,709
You made a great
warrior out of him

590
01:37:31,876 --> 01:37:33,001
and brought him back to us.

591
01:37:33,168 --> 01:37:38,376
Kingdom of Mahishmati will be
eternally grateful to you.

592
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:57,876
My mother looks at me

593
01:37:58,751 --> 01:38:00,876
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

594
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:06,126
I don't know
who they are...

595
01:38:06,293 --> 01:38:08,001
and yet they look at me like
lam their God!

596
01:38:10,626 --> 01:38:12,751
And when I see the wounds
that fester on that lady...

597
01:38:13,293 --> 01:38:15,126
I have never met before,

598
01:38:16,793 --> 01:38:21,126
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

599
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:23,751
Who am I?

600
01:38:25,168 --> 01:38:29,876
You are the son of our savior (God)
Amarendra Baahubali.

601
01:38:31,293 --> 01:38:34,084
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

602
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:36,001
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

603
01:38:37,876 --> 01:38:39,501
You are the fruit of our

604
01:38:39,668 --> 01:38:43,376
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

605
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:47,376
<i>The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.</i>

606
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,876
<i>This kingdom of Mahishmati
was established</i>

607
01:38:50,043 --> 01:38:53,001
<i>by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.</i>

608
01:38:53,168 --> 01:38:56,084
<i>Though elder,
Bijjaladeva was not crowned</i>

609
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:58,251
<i>because of his conniving nature.</i>

610
01:38:58,418 --> 01:39:03,626
<i>But Bijjaladeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities</i>

611
01:39:04,126 --> 01:39:07,209
<i>and it caused
great turmoil in him.</i>

612
01:39:08,626 --> 01:39:12,209
<i>The King died.</i>

613
01:39:12,793 --> 01:39:15,876
<i>He was survived by his subjects</i>

614
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:19,209
<i>and the queen
who was six months pregnant.</i>

615
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:23,126
<i>Three months passed by and
Mahishmati continued to mourn.</i>

616
01:39:23,376 --> 01:39:26,834
<i>The King's sister-in-law
and Bijjaladeva's wife, Sivagami</i>

617
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:30,626
<i>took up the reins of the kingdom.</i>

618
01:39:31,751 --> 01:39:33,209
<i>Being an astute woman</i>

619
01:39:33,376 --> 01:39:35,251
<i>she focused on
the welfare of the people</i>

620
01:39:35,418 --> 01:39:37,501
and defense
of the kingdom.

621
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:41,501
<i>She could hear
the howls of the jackals</i>

622
01:39:41,668 --> 01:39:44,126
<i>making their move
towards the throne.</i>

623
01:39:45,251 --> 01:39:50,751
<i>It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labour.</i>

624
01:39:57,876 --> 01:40:00,001
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

625
01:40:05,043 --> 01:40:06,251
It is a boy!

626
01:40:31,668 --> 01:40:32,876
Baahubali!

627
01:40:38,668 --> 01:40:43,126
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

628
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:46,501
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

629
01:40:46,668 --> 01:40:48,501
Hail him!

630
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:52,751
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

631
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:55,376
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

632
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:58,334
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

633
01:40:58,501 --> 01:41:00,251
Being a leader
is the first tenet

634
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:02,126
of being a Kshatriya,
Minister.

635
01:41:12,418 --> 01:41:13,834
Lady Sivagami?

636
01:41:34,043 --> 01:41:38,084
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

637
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:41,126
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

638
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:53,626
Kattappfl!

639
01:41:57,751 --> 01:42:00,834
They have soiled Mahishmati
with their revolt.

640
01:42:01,543 --> 01:42:03,459
Wash it off with their blood!

641
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:13,876
How can you stand and watch...

642
01:42:14,043 --> 01:42:15,584
while our people
are being hacked to death?

643
01:42:18,418 --> 01:42:22,459
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

644
01:42:23,793 --> 01:42:25,709
Kill Kattappa!

645
01:42:44,126 --> 01:42:48,334
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

646
01:42:51,626 --> 01:42:55,709
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

647
01:43:11,376 --> 01:43:14,209
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

648
01:43:14,376 --> 01:43:15,876
and we had the privilege to witness it.

649
01:43:16,043 --> 01:43:19,626
Please ascend the throne
and rule Mahishmati!

650
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:23,001
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

651
01:43:23,168 --> 01:43:26,626
Then whose is it? O!Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

652
01:43:26,793 --> 01:43:31,376
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

653
01:43:31,543 --> 01:43:33,001
Tell him, Sivagami!

654
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,376
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

655
01:43:58,001 --> 01:44:03,751
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

656
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:05,876
will be crowned
the king of Mahishmati.

657
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:11,001
This is my word
and my word is the law!

658
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:26,209
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

659
01:44:27,626 --> 01:44:38,001
"May you live long,
my dear Baahubali."

660
01:44:48,418 --> 01:44:53,751
"Ambrosia and venom."

661
01:44:55,543 --> 01:45:02,876
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

662
01:45:15,168 --> 01:45:19,126
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

663
01:45:19,293 --> 01:45:23,876
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Baahubali."

664
01:45:27,043 --> 01:45:31,001
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

665
01:45:31,251 --> 01:45:34,709
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

666
01:45:42,043 --> 01:45:44,209
Kattappa! I am very hungry.

667
01:45:44,418 --> 01:45:45,834
Can I have some?

668
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:47,251
My Prince!

669
01:45:48,043 --> 01:45:50,126
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

670
01:45:52,751 --> 01:45:54,084
Now give me some.

671
01:45:55,126 --> 01:45:57,834
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

672
01:45:58,001 --> 01:45:59,959
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

673
01:46:00,918 --> 01:46:03,459
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

674
01:46:04,293 --> 01:46:05,626
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

675
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:07,084
for you in your
royal chambers.

676
01:46:07,293 --> 01:46:09,876
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

677
01:46:10,043 --> 01:46:12,084
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

678
01:46:12,251 --> 01:46:14,501
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

679
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:17,709
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

680
01:46:17,876 --> 01:46:21,376
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

681
01:46:24,043 --> 01:46:25,251
Feed me, uncle.

682
01:47:00,876 --> 01:47:03,126
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

683
01:47:03,293 --> 01:47:05,501
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

684
01:47:05,668 --> 01:47:07,834
"His enemies remain astonished."

685
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:14,876
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

686
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:47,626
Bhallaladeva!

687
01:47:59,126 --> 01:48:00,584
Great Bhalla!

688
01:48:01,668 --> 01:48:04,626
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

689
01:48:28,418 --> 01:48:30,501
Both the princes
have excelled

690
01:48:30,668 --> 01:48:32,126
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

691
01:48:32,293 --> 01:48:34,084
They stand as equals.

692
01:48:34,376 --> 01:48:39,709
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

693
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:44,834
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

694
01:48:45,001 --> 01:48:47,001
Now he is testing me

695
01:48:47,168 --> 01:48:50,876
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

696
01:48:51,043 --> 01:48:54,751
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

697
01:49:06,793 --> 01:49:09,709
<i>Before she could decide
on who will ascend the throne</i>

698
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,876
<i>the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.</i>

699
01:49:13,043 --> 01:49:16,251
<i>In the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.</i>

700
01:49:19,043 --> 01:49:23,001
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

701
01:49:25,418 --> 01:49:27,751
Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

702
01:49:28,418 --> 01:49:31,001
<i>The young Princes searched</i>

703
01:49:31,168 --> 01:49:34,001
<i>for the traitor
in neighbouring kingdoms.</i>

704
01:49:34,168 --> 01:49:36,626
<i>Finally they found out
that he was hiding</i>

705
01:49:36,876 --> 01:49:38,751
<i>in a den of thieves
called Singapuram.</i>

706
01:49:38,918 --> 01:49:40,334
<i>It is a lawless place
where bandits</i>

707
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:41,751
<i>thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.</i>

708
01:49:41,918 --> 01:49:44,251
<i>Strangers who drew
attention to themselves</i>

709
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:47,501
<i>were in mortal danger.</i>

710
01:49:57,168 --> 01:49:59,959
I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

711
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:02,376
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

712
01:50:02,543 --> 01:50:03,876
Are you a SPY?

713
01:50:10,418 --> 01:50:12,626
If our guards were this good..

714
01:50:12,793 --> 01:50:14,001
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

715
01:50:14,168 --> 01:50:15,626
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

716
01:50:18,293 --> 01:50:19,959
Swords or smarts?

717
01:50:20,126 --> 01:50:21,584
Whichever is sharper.

718
01:50:29,626 --> 01:50:30,959
Do you have a drink?

719
01:50:38,418 --> 01:50:39,501
Big one?

720
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:50,376
Much bigger?

721
01:50:58,001 --> 01:50:59,251
Do you have money?

722
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:11,376
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

723
01:51:31,043 --> 01:51:33,001
Look what is happening there..

724
01:51:33,168 --> 01:51:34,334
Come on!

725
01:51:39,168 --> 01:51:42,209
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

726
01:52:06,293 --> 01:52:11,334
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

727
01:52:12,293 --> 01:52:17,334
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

728
01:52:18,293 --> 01:52:24,084
"Let your lips find mine."

729
01:52:24,293 --> 01:52:30,001
"Come and steal
myself from me."

730
01:52:30,251 --> 01:52:34,709
"You are the charming one."

731
01:52:36,168 --> 01:52:41,001
"You are the charming one."

732
01:52:42,293 --> 01:52:45,126
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

733
01:52:45,293 --> 01:52:48,126
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

734
01:52:48,293 --> 01:52:53,709
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

735
01:52:54,293 --> 01:52:56,876
"Let me drink
this love potion."

736
01:52:57,043 --> 01:53:00,126
"You are mine, just mine."

737
01:53:00,293 --> 01:53:05,251
"lntoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

738
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:12,001
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

739
01:53:48,293 --> 01:53:53,959
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

740
01:54:00,251 --> 01:54:05,876
"You got the magic,
no one has."

741
01:54:12,293 --> 01:54:18,126
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

742
01:54:18,293 --> 01:54:24,251
"I want to be your
and make you mine, too."

743
01:54:24,668 --> 01:54:28,376
"Come and enjoy me."

744
01:54:30,168 --> 01:54:34,501
"You are the charming one."

745
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:35,959
"Yes, I am."

746
01:54:36,126 --> 01:54:41,126
"You are the charming one."

747
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:45,126
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

748
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:47,626
"Please listen to me, my love."

749
01:54:48,376 --> 01:54:51,126
"Let me drink
this love potion."

750
01:54:51,126 --> 01:54:54,293
"You are mine, just mine."

751
01:54:54,293 --> 01:54:59,751
"lntoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

752
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:05,751
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

753
01:56:13,668 --> 01:56:16,751
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

754
01:56:16,918 --> 01:56:18,001
Bhalla!

755
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:53,084
Kattappa..

756
01:57:23,251 --> 01:57:26,876
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

757
01:57:27,376 --> 01:57:28,876
Kalakeya!

758
01:57:32,751 --> 01:57:35,084
The Kalakeyas don't believe
in tactical attack.

759
01:57:35,668 --> 01:57:38,209
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

760
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:41,626
If they barge into the kingdom

761
01:57:42,626 --> 01:57:45,001
they will kill every
innocent child

762
01:57:46,293 --> 01:57:49,376
and violate every woman.

763
01:57:50,543 --> 01:57:53,251
They will destroy
and burn everything.

764
01:57:54,376 --> 01:57:57,209
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

765
01:57:57,543 --> 01:57:59,376
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

766
01:57:59,543 --> 01:58:00,876
Why should we be scared?

767
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:05,584
How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

768
01:58:42,293 --> 01:58:44,459
When wild bulls barge into the crops

769
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:49,459
and lands that the Kalakeyas
plunder, are both left barren.

770
01:58:58,418 --> 01:59:00,876
We have to defend our kingdom

771
01:59:01,626 --> 01:59:03,751
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

772
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:06,501
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

773
01:59:07,418 --> 01:59:08,751
"The trident strategy".

774
01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:17,084
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

775
01:59:17,293 --> 01:59:19,626
You want to go to war
with something untested?

776
01:59:19,793 --> 01:59:21,459
If no one has used it

777
01:59:21,626 --> 01:59:23,834
the Kalakeyas wouldn't
expect it either.

778
01:59:24,001 --> 01:59:26,209
That is why
we should implement it.

779
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:29,626
I second the plan.
- I approve it.

780
01:59:30,751 --> 01:59:34,501
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

781
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:40,001
Kattappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

782
01:59:40,543 --> 01:59:42,209
Five thousand, Your Highness!

783
01:59:42,918 --> 01:59:47,084
I will use armour and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

784
01:59:47,251 --> 01:59:49,834
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

785
01:59:51,793 --> 01:59:54,584
I will command the forces
to the north.

786
01:59:57,293 --> 01:59:59,876
I will take responsibility
for the south.

787
02:00:02,168 --> 02:00:03,584
According to our sources,

788
02:00:03,751 --> 02:00:06,126
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

789
02:00:06,293 --> 02:00:08,584
and send half
his army forward.

790
02:00:09,418 --> 02:00:12,334
Our military formation
and our weapons...

791
02:00:12,751 --> 02:00:15,959
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

792
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:20,959
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

793
02:00:21,126 --> 02:00:24,459
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

794
02:00:24,626 --> 02:00:27,126
In the middle of that battle

795
02:00:27,293 --> 02:00:29,501
both princes with
their cavalry

796
02:00:29,668 --> 02:00:32,501
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

797
02:00:32,668 --> 02:00:35,709
It will take them
at least three hours

798
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:38,459
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

799
02:00:38,626 --> 02:00:41,126
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

800
02:00:41,293 --> 02:00:45,001
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

801
02:00:45,168 --> 02:00:48,251
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

802
02:00:48,418 --> 02:00:50,501
of who should be the king.

803
02:00:52,793 --> 02:00:55,626
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

804
02:00:55,793 --> 02:00:58,001
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

805
02:00:59,793 --> 02:01:02,501
My Lord has
the perfect solution. - Yes.

806
02:01:05,751 --> 02:01:09,334
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

807
02:01:11,418 --> 02:01:13,251
Bhalla, Baahu.

808
02:01:13,793 --> 02:01:16,834
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

809
02:01:17,376 --> 02:01:18,626
Accept it.

810
02:01:20,043 --> 02:01:22,876
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

811
02:01:27,043 --> 02:01:30,001
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

812
02:01:30,168 --> 02:01:34,334
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

813
02:01:34,793 --> 02:01:37,751
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

814
02:01:38,793 --> 02:01:40,876
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

815
02:01:41,043 --> 02:01:43,001
all went to Bhallaladeva!

816
02:01:45,126 --> 02:01:47,251
You should have objected, Baahu!

817
02:01:50,793 --> 02:01:53,459
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

818
02:01:53,918 --> 02:01:57,084
You brilliantly hoodwinked
Baahubali! - What hoodwink?

819
02:01:57,543 --> 02:02:01,751
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

820
02:02:02,626 --> 02:02:05,001
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

821
02:02:06,543 --> 02:02:08,876
I made the strong one
even stronger.

822
02:02:09,626 --> 02:02:12,876
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

823
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:16,251
Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

824
02:02:16,418 --> 02:02:17,834
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

825
02:02:18,043 --> 02:02:19,584
the tents and
bring them to him.

826
02:02:52,293 --> 02:02:56,751
(Sanskrit chants)

827
02:02:57,126 --> 02:03:02,376
(Sanskrit chants)

828
02:03:18,251 --> 02:03:23,626
(Sanskrit chants)

829
02:03:23,793 --> 02:03:27,876
(Sanskrit chants)

830
02:03:28,043 --> 02:03:31,251
Welcome, Bhallaladeva!

831
02:03:31,418 --> 02:03:34,126
(Sanskrit chants)

832
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:51,001
(Sanskrit chants)

833
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:56,376
(Sanskrit chants)

834
02:03:59,376 --> 02:04:02,376
Invincible!
- Invincible!

835
02:04:02,543 --> 02:04:05,251
Invincible!
- Invincible!

836
02:04:05,918 --> 02:04:08,126
Welcome, Baahubali!

837
02:04:13,168 --> 02:04:18,626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

838
02:04:18,793 --> 02:04:22,959
Baahubali! Baahubali!

839
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,251
Baahubali! Baahubali!

840
02:04:39,918 --> 02:04:42,959
Bahu, it is
a time-honoured ritual.

841
02:04:43,126 --> 02:04:43,959
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

842
02:04:44,168 --> 02:04:46,251
the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

843
02:04:46,418 --> 02:04:48,501
If you don't offer the sacrifice

844
02:04:48,668 --> 02:04:50,001
the Goddess will be angry.

845
02:04:50,168 --> 02:04:51,834
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

846
02:04:52,043 --> 02:04:53,709
the blood of
this innocent animal

847
02:04:54,126 --> 02:04:56,501
when my own blood
can be offered?

848
02:04:59,293 --> 02:05:01,834
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

849
02:05:02,001 --> 02:05:05,501
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

850
02:05:05,668 --> 02:05:07,959
Hail Mahishmathi!

851
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:10,251
Hail Mahishmathi!

852
02:05:10,418 --> 02:05:13,876
Hail Mahishmathi!

853
02:05:21,793 --> 02:05:23,959
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

854
02:05:26,626 --> 02:05:28,126
This is your last chance.

855
02:05:28,293 --> 02:05:31,584
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

856
02:05:46,668 --> 02:05:48,626
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

857
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:51,334
the one who kills me
would be made king.

858
02:05:56,793 --> 02:05:59,501
And if both of them
die at my hands?

859
02:06:16,876 --> 02:06:19,501
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

860
02:06:19,668 --> 02:06:20,959
and then I will have
a son with you.

861
02:06:21,126 --> 02:06:22,709
You can make him the king!

862
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:33,251
I want him alive.

863
02:06:34,293 --> 02:06:37,584
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

864
02:06:37,751 --> 02:06:40,376
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

865
02:06:47,293 --> 02:06:52,126
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

866
02:06:52,793 --> 02:06:54,751
He should be alive.

867
02:06:56,251 --> 02:06:58,084
Kattappa!
<i>'</i> My Lady!

868
02:06:58,251 --> 02:07:00,334
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

869
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:32,751
It is ready.

870
02:07:32,918 --> 02:07:33,834
Arm the weapon.

871
02:07:39,626 --> 02:07:40,876
Fire!

872
02:07:46,793 --> 02:07:48,334
Baahubali's command!

873
02:08:15,918 --> 02:08:17,001
Get ready!

874
02:08:18,376 --> 02:08:20,209
Arm the weapons.

875
02:09:27,168 --> 02:09:28,334
Attack!

876
02:10:27,251 --> 02:10:29,376
Attack!

877
02:12:10,043 --> 02:12:12,834
Well done, Baahubali!
- Well done.

878
02:12:42,293 --> 02:12:44,251
Soldiers. Attack.

879
02:12:44,418 --> 02:12:45,959
Attack!

880
02:13:05,168 --> 02:13:07,751
Hold! Hold strong!

881
02:13:23,918 --> 02:13:25,751
Swords group, step forward!

882
02:15:29,918 --> 02:15:32,126
Trident strategy begins!

883
02:18:01,293 --> 02:18:02,584
Stop.

884
02:18:08,793 --> 02:18:10,001
Bhallaladeva!

885
02:18:15,751 --> 02:18:17,001
My Prince?

886
02:18:28,418 --> 02:18:30,334
My Prince!
- Army!

887
02:20:02,251 --> 02:20:05,251
Hold your lines!

888
02:20:13,043 --> 02:20:15,876
Hold your lines! Hold them!

889
02:20:59,918 --> 02:21:01,876
Our defenses are in tatters.

890
02:21:02,293 --> 02:21:04,459
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Mahishmati soil...

891
02:21:04,626 --> 02:21:05,626
for the first time!

892
02:21:05,793 --> 02:21:08,209
This is the death of us. Death!

893
02:21:08,793 --> 02:21:11,459
Death! Death!

894
02:22:01,876 --> 02:22:03,126
Death!

895
02:22:06,418 --> 02:22:07,834
Death!

896
02:22:11,293 --> 02:22:12,626
Soldiers!

897
02:22:20,501 --> 02:22:22,084
What is death?

898
02:22:23,751 --> 02:22:26,084
To think that the
enemy is stronger

899
02:22:26,251 --> 02:22:27,876
than our resolve, is death!

900
02:22:29,751 --> 02:22:34,126
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

901
02:22:36,043 --> 02:22:40,501
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

902
02:22:42,418 --> 02:22:45,501
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

903
02:22:45,668 --> 02:22:48,001
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

904
02:22:53,043 --> 02:22:56,126
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

905
02:22:57,251 --> 02:23:01,334
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

906
02:23:01,543 --> 02:23:05,751
I am about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

907
02:23:11,168 --> 02:23:13,251
Who is with me?

908
02:23:15,293 --> 02:23:16,626
Me!

909
02:23:16,793 --> 02:23:19,626
Who will die with me?
- Me!

910
02:23:19,876 --> 02:23:24,626
Who will vanquish that
death and live on? - Me!

911
02:23:26,376 --> 02:23:27,626
Me!

912
02:23:27,793 --> 02:23:30,251
Hail Mahishmathi!

913
02:23:30,418 --> 02:23:32,376
Hail Mahishmathi!

914
02:23:32,626 --> 02:23:36,751
Hail Mahishmathi!

915
02:23:47,376 --> 02:23:49,001
Hail Mahishmathi!

916
02:23:50,543 --> 02:23:54,084
Hail Mahishmathi!

917
02:24:20,543 --> 02:24:21,751
Sethupathy!

918
02:29:13,793 --> 02:29:16,084
<i>I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes</i>

919
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:18,751
<i>and feast on his guts.</i>

920
02:29:19,543 --> 02:29:24,251
<i>His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!</i>

921
02:29:48,668 --> 02:29:50,001
MY son!

922
02:29:51,626 --> 02:29:54,626
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

923
02:30:17,751 --> 02:30:19,126
MY son!

924
02:30:19,876 --> 02:30:26,251
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

925
02:30:31,501 --> 02:30:35,501
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

926
02:30:35,668 --> 02:30:39,001
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

927
02:30:40,501 --> 02:30:42,876
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Mahishmati

928
02:30:43,043 --> 02:30:45,126
for generations to come!

929
02:30:45,751 --> 02:30:51,376
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

930
02:30:51,918 --> 02:30:54,251
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

931
02:30:54,418 --> 02:30:57,751
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

932
02:31:01,168 --> 02:31:05,126
I proclaim Baahubali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

933
02:31:13,793 --> 02:31:17,126
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

934
02:31:17,293 --> 02:31:22,251
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

935
02:31:22,418 --> 02:31:24,709
You saw it with your own eyes!

936
02:31:25,543 --> 02:31:29,084
He has to be the King! Only he!

937
02:31:29,543 --> 02:31:31,876
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

938
02:31:32,043 --> 02:31:33,834
by the number
of enemies he has killed

939
02:31:34,001 --> 02:31:36,501
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

940
02:31:37,043 --> 02:31:38,001
During the battle

941
02:31:38,168 --> 02:31:41,126
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

942
02:31:41,376 --> 02:31:44,376
Baahubali,
while killing the enemy

943
02:31:44,543 --> 02:31:47,001
also managed
to save his subjects.

944
02:31:48,001 --> 02:31:50,876
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

945
02:31:53,168 --> 02:31:56,626
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

946
02:31:57,293 --> 02:32:01,626
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

947
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:07,001
So, saving a couple
of common men

948
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:08,584
is now the
qualification to rule?

949
02:32:08,751 --> 02:32:11,126
Baahubali will be
crowned the King of

950
02:32:11,293 --> 02:32:13,376
Mahishmati on
an auspicious day.

951
02:32:14,418 --> 02:32:17,876
That is my word
and my word is law!

952
02:32:22,168 --> 02:32:24,584
Baahubali! Baahubali!

953
02:32:25,168 --> 02:32:27,626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

954
02:32:27,793 --> 02:32:30,001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

955
02:32:30,251 --> 02:32:32,209
Baahubali! Baahubali!

956
02:32:32,376 --> 02:32:36,626
Baahubali!
-Baahubali!

957
02:32:36,793 --> 02:32:39,959
Baahubali! Baahubali!

958
02:32:40,126 --> 02:32:42,209
Baahubali! Baahubali!

959
02:32:52,751 --> 02:32:55,001
Amarendra Baahubali!

960
02:32:56,168 --> 02:32:59,751
Glory to him!

961
02:33:03,418 --> 02:33:06,626
Amarendra Baahubali!

962
02:33:07,251 --> 02:33:11,001
Glory to him!

963
02:33:11,251 --> 02:33:14,376
Glory to him!

964
02:33:16,626 --> 02:33:19,626
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

965
02:33:20,751 --> 02:33:23,459
We are so glad
to hear about him.

966
02:33:24,418 --> 02:33:27,626
I wish we can
see the great man once!

967
02:33:30,168 --> 02:33:31,584
He is no more.

968
02:33:33,293 --> 02:33:35,126
The saviour is no more!
(That God is no more!)

969
02:33:42,418 --> 02:33:44,626
You said no enemy
could come near him.

970
02:33:45,126 --> 02:33:47,376
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

971
02:33:48,918 --> 02:33:51,001
How did such
a great warrior die?

972
02:33:52,918 --> 02:33:56,459
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

973
02:33:57,376 --> 02:33:59,126
is a stab in the back, Mahendra.

974
02:33:59,543 --> 02:34:02,251
Who? Who was it?

975
02:34:05,501 --> 02:34:06,876
That traitor...

976
02:34:09,126 --> 02:34:10,334
was me!

977
02:34:27,543 --> 02:34:38,501
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

978
02:34:41,376 --> 02:34:51,501
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

979
02:34:52,918 --> 02:35:02,834
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

980
02:35:04,626 --> 02:35:15,876
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

981
02:35:17,168 --> 02:35:33,376
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

982
02:35:35,126 --> 02:35:41,626
"it is called
the river of life."
