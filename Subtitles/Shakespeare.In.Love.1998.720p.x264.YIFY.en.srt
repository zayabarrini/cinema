1
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,973
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:02,183
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,353
Why do you howl!...

4
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:09,065
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,068
- What am I, Mr. Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,070
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:17,073
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:19,033
- Aaah! I can pay you!
- When?

9
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:22,328
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity's sake!

10
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,581
Take them out.

11
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:26,583
Where will you find...

12
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,584
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:30,586
Including interest,
in three weeks?

14
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,381
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:35,383
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,010
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,015
- And his ears.
- And a share!

18
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,059
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,645
Partners?

20
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:53,943
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:57,530
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,450
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- I think I've seen it.

23
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,285
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:06,080
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called?

25
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,959
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,127
Good title.

27
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:14,547
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,050
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:19,552
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:23,264
In addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,308
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:29,145
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:32,356
- Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
- Correct.

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,485
- But I have to pay the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

35
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,987
- There's never any-
- Of course not.

36
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:42,409
Oh- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:44,995
Sign there.

38
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:52,502
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

39
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,504
Almost finished?

40
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:58,091
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

41
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,277
Will. Will!

42
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:01,738
Where is my play?

43
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:05,075
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

44
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:08,578
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

45
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:11,415
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

46
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,416
Where is my play?

47
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,044
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

48
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,005
Locked?

49
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:21,425
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

50
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,426
She is always Aphrodite.

51
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,263
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

52
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:29,433
Henslowe, you have no soul,

53
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:33,186
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

54
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,189
Ow! Will!

55
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:38,191
I am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

56
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,694
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

57
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,697
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

58
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,700
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

59
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,703
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

60
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:52,706
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

61
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,708
when you were green
and grateful.

62
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,711
- What piece? Richard Crookback?
- No! It's comedy they want.

63
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,713
Like Romeo and Ethel.

64
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:02,716
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,719
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

66
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,138
I'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

67
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:11,642
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my wordwright.

68
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:13,644
When the plague lifts,

69
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:16,646
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

70
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,649
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

71
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:20,651
- Will you lend me 50 pounds?
- Fifty pounds?

72
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:23,653
- What for?
- Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men.

73
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:26,490
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

74
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:30,619
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

75
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,621
No, then?

76
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:35,666
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

77
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,295
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

78
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,967
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

79
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,680
I say, a plague
on both their houses!

80
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:51,681
Where are you going?

81
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,851
My weekly confession.

82
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:01,942
Words, words, words.

83
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:04,445
Once, I had the gift.

84
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:08,448
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

85
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,451
Love that overthrows empires.

86
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:13,954
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

87
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,958
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

88
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,462
- But now-
- And yet you tell me you lie with women.

89
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,882
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

90
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:30,012
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind-

91
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:32,890
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

92
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,558
I have lost my gift.

93
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:37,061
I am here to help you.

94
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,563
Tell me,
in your own words.

95
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:47,196
I- It's as if
my quill is broken,

96
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,200
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

97
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:54,829
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

98
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,747
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

99
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,707
Most interesting.

100
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,544
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

101
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:07,257
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

102
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,430
How long has it been?

103
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,600
A goodly length in times past,
but lately-

104
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:20,104
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

105
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:24,942
Aye.

106
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:27,987
I was a lad of 18.

107
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,489
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

108
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,617
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

109
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:38,456
- One day she was three months gone
with child, so- - And your relations?

110
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,209
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

111
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:45,880
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

112
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:49,759
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

113
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,760
Banishment was a blessing.

114
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:55,431
- So, now you are free to love-
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

115
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:01,980
Here is a- a bangle...

116
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,566
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

117
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,943
Cheap at fourpence.

118
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:12,949
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

119
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,951
Will it restore my gift?

120
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,454
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

121
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,749
Words will flow like a river.

122
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,751
See you next week.

123
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:28,256
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

124
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:31,759
All right.

125
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,262
Hello, Will.

126
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:38,391
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

127
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:42,269
- You too, good Crab.
- Crab's nervous. He's never played the palace.

128
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:44,772
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

129
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:48,192
- I could do it.
- No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it.

130
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:51,529
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

131
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:54,532
- How goes it, Will?
- I'm still owed money for this play, Burbage.

132
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:57,035
Not by me.
I only stole it.

133
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,537
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

134
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,039
Where were
my seamstress' eyes?

135
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:06,002
- When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
- When I have 50 pounds.

136
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:09,630
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

137
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,633
A pirate comedy.

138
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:14,052
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

139
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:17,847
- It's for Henslowe. He paid me. Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

140
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,644
- He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

141
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,188
Will?

142
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:29,192
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you another two when I see the pages.
- Done.

143
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,194
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

144
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,696
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

145
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,365
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

146
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:39,369
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

147
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,371
- Ask him.
- She comes!

148
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,107
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

149
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,402
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

150
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:15,280
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

151
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,744
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will?

152
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:24,289
- I've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

153
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,290
Come to look for it again.

154
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:36,134
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline?

155
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:39,304
Burbage has my keeping,

156
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,306
but you have my heart.

157
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,978
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

158
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:47,979
Will Shakespeare has a play.

159
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:50,482
Let's go and cough through it.

160
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,487
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

161
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,325
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

162
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:03,787
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

163
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,790
shed one tear-

164
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,638
You see? Comedy.

165
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:25,684
Love, and a bit with a dog.

166
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,852
That's what they want.

167
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,781
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

168
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:43,868
and has no more pity in him
than a dog!

169
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,872
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

170
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:51,835
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word-

171
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:54,420
Well played, Master Crab!

172
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:58,550
I commend you!

173
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,181
What light is light...

174
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:06,183
if Silvia be not seen?

175
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,894
What joy is joy...

176
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:12,231
if Silvia be not by?

177
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,234
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

178
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:19,237
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

179
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:23,742
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

180
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:27,287
there is no music
in the nightingale.

181
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,291
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

182
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:33,794
there is no day for me
to look upon.

183
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:00,696
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

184
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,698
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

185
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:06,201
Oh, I liked the dog
for laughs.

186
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:08,704
Silvia, I did not care for much.

187
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:10,705
His fingers were red
from fighting...

188
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,043
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

189
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:17,045
Stage love will never be true love...

190
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,176
while the law of the land has our heroines
being played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

191
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,345
- Oh, when can we see another?
- When the queen commands it.

192
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,347
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse!

193
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:31,227
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

194
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,562
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

195
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,064
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

196
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,568
and well-married
is more so.

197
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:41,070
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

198
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:43,572
All the men at court
are without poetry.

199
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,575
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

200
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:50,246
I will have poetry
in my life,

201
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,247
and adventure.

202
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,043
And love.
Love above all.

203
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:58,045
Like Valentine
and Silvia?

204
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,007
No, not the artful postures
of love,

205
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,095
but love that overthrows life.

206
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:09,848
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

207
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:14,270
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

208
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:18,023
Love as there has never been
in a play.

209
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:22,028
I will have love,
or I will end my days as-

210
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,030
As a nurse?

211
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:28,909
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

212
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:33,039
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

213
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:37,334
I would stay asleep
my whole life...

214
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:41,339
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

215
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:44,341
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

216
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,889
Now spit.

217
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,707
This time the boots
are coming off.

218
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,169
- What have I done?
- The theaters have all been closed down by the plague.

219
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:23,172
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

220
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:27,593
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

221
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:31,681
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

222
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:34,433
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

223
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:38,187
- Strangely enough, it all turns out well.
- How?

224
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,190
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

225
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:43,192
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

226
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,194
The theaters are reopened...

227
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:48,948
by order of
the Master of the Revels!

228
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:52,201
The theaters are reopened!

229
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,203
Mr. Fennyman.

230
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:56,705
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

231
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,083
If you wouldn't mind.

232
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:03,712
Where's the play?

233
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:06,633
Oh, it's coming.
It's coming.

234
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:11,220
It's coming.

235
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,317
Will!

236
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
Will, I have wonderful news.

237
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,321
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

238
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,322
God, I'm good!

239
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:33,326
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

240
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:40,500
Richard?

241
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,836
Burbage!

242
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:52,261
Mr. Tilney.

243
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:56,015
Like you,
I found him not at home.

244
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,812
I would've made you immortal.

245
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:07,193
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

246
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:09,946
What does Burbage care of that?

247
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,783
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

248
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:17,120
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

249
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:20,206
- But the plague-
- Yes, I know.

250
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,210
But he was always
hanging around the house.

251
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:40,727
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

252
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:43,688
- served on a buckwheat pancake-
- Will!

253
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,565
Have you finished?

254
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:47,567
Yes, nearly.

255
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,862
- Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice part.
- Yes!

256
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:54,991
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

257
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:59,162
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

258
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,456
I need actors!

259
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,459
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

260
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:09,631
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

261
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:12,633
Auditions in half an hour!

262
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,974
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you,

263
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,894
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

264
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:24,896
Never when I'm working.

265
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,774
Never when I'm working!

266
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,069
Get me to drink mandragora.

267
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:33,071
Straight up, Will?

268
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:36,157
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

269
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,451
Kit.

270
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:42,080
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:45,792
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

272
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,628
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

273
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,631
I hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

274
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,800
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

275
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,344
Ah.
I love your early work.

276
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:59,348
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

277
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,975
and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"

278
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:04,978
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

279
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:06,980
The Massacre at Paris.

280
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:11,860
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

281
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:14,362
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

282
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,367
Yes, I know. I know.

283
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,368
What is the story?

284
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,204
Well, there's this pirate-

285
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,210
In truth, I have not written a word.

286
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:31,838
Romeo.

287
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:35,008
Romeo is Italian,

288
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,344
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:39,637
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets-

290
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,057
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

291
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,601
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,895
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:50,482
by Ethel's brother, or something-
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,484
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:55,987
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

296
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,824
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:02,494
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

298
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,579
A different one
you haven't written?

299
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,374
Was this the face...

300
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,918
that launched a thousand ships...

301
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,420
and burnt the topless
towers of llium?

302
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,089
Thank you.

303
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,759
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

304
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,553
- and burnt the top- topless
towers of llium? - Thank you!

305
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,555
Was this the face...

306
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:25,226
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless-

307
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,855
I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

308
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,190
- How refreshing.
- ... the topless towers of llium?

309
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:35,402
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

310
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,699
W- Was this the f-

311
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,911
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

312
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,622
My tailor wants to be an actor.

313
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,125
I have a few debts
here and there.

314
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,211
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

315
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:54,713
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

316
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:57,048
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

317
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,636
Oh, God.

318
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,975
May I begin, sir?

319
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:11,855
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

320
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:16,652
I
- I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

321
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:24,659
What light is light...

322
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,329
if Silvia be not seen?

323
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:33,001
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?

324
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,839
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

325
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,175
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

326
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:46,682
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

327
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,352
there is no music
in the nightingale.

328
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:55,691
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

329
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,069
there is no day
for me to look upon.

330
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:05,200
She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not-

331
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,496
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

332
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:11,373
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

333
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,667
- I-
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

334
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:16,086
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

335
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,047
Wait there!

336
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:34,439
- Will, w-where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

337
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:40,778
B- B-B-Break a leg!

338
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,409
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange?

339
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,805
Hey!

340
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:27,992
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:32,246
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,337
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:43,675
- Yes.
- Yes, I think I've seen you in something.

344
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,677
- That one about a king.
- Really?

345
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,680
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,155
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:20,211
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:24,215
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:27,302
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

350
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:29,846
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,140
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

352
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:36,144
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,399
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:44,402
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,407
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,409
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

357
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,828
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,914
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

359
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:58,416
Master Kent...

360
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:01,586
is my nephew.

361
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,588
I will wait.

362
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,090
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,763
"Romeo Montague,

364
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:13,765
a Young Man of Verona."

365
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,766
Verona again?

366
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,768
"A comedy
of quarreling families...

367
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:20,105
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

368
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,607
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

369
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,485
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

370
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:31,032
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king."

371
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:33,034
Your mother and your father-

372
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:36,037
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:38,540
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:41,542
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,544
He would give Thomas Kent...

376
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:45,547
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

377
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,049
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

378
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,051
You will not tell.

379
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:52,386
As I love you and you love me,

380
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,390
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

381
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,523
Master Plum.
What business here?

382
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,525
The five schilling business, Will.

383
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,777
We play for the dancing.

384
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,449
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

385
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:28,507
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

386
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,135
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

387
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,137
She's a beauty, my lord,

388
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,100
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

389
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:41,603
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

390
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:44,606
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

391
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,608
when your grandson is a Wessex.

392
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,652
- Is she fertile?
- Oh, she will breed.

393
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:52,488
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

394
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,491
As any mule in Christendom.

395
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:57,494
But if you are the man to ride her,

396
00:27:57,577 --> 00:27:59,496
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

397
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,915
I like her.

398
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,979
By all the stars in heaven.

399
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:26,356
Who is she?

400
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,902
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

401
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:09,899
Master Shakespeare.

402
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:18,867
My lady Viola.

403
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,869
My lord.

404
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:23,372
I have spoken with your father.

405
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:26,374
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

406
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,310
Good sir.

407
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,897
I heard you were a poet.

408
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:55,154
A poet of no words?

409
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,244
Poet?

410
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:06,457
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

411
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,668
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

412
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:12,963
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

413
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:16,341
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

414
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,844
Do you have a name?

415
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:21,680
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

416
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:48,207
Romeo. Romeo.

417
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,210
A Young Man of Verona.

418
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:54,046
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

419
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:57,216
- My lady!
- Who is there?

420
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,177
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

421
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,681
Anon, good nurse, anon.

422
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:08,394
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

423
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,145
But why "alas"?

424
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:12,190
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

425
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:14,984
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

426
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:17,736
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

427
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,238
- Oh, I am him too.
- Madam!

428
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:23,242
Anon!
I will come again.

429
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:28,288
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

430
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,210
Oh, my lady, my love!

431
00:31:33,294 --> 00:31:36,588
If they find you here,
they will kill you.

432
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:40,176
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

433
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,429
- Madam!
- Anon!

434
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,448
Draw, if you be men!

435
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,450
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

436
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:49,954
Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

437
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,957
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

438
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,460
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

439
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,462
Do you think it's funny?

440
00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:00,464
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

441
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:03,384
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

442
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,887
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

443
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,389
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

444
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:11,016
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

445
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,019
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

446
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:16,773
I'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

447
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,774
I'll be damned if you are!

448
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:23,196
Your attention, please!

449
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,699
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

450
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:29,368
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

451
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:32,539
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

452
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:36,042
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

453
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,545
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

454
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:41,965
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we-

455
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:43,966
I'll do it.

456
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,469
Now listen to me, you dregs.

457
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:48,471
Actors are ten a penny,

458
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:52,392
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

459
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:54,644
Huzzah!

460
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:58,314
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

461
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:00,400
Huzzah!

462
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:06,740
Henslowe!

463
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,741
Earl! Good to see you.

464
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:13,747
Who is this?

465
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,749
Silence, you dog!

466
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,710
I am Hieronimo.

467
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:22,422
I am Tamburlaine.

468
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:24,758
I am Faustus.

469
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:28,761
I am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

470
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:32,933
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am Henry the Sixth.

471
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:37,186
What is the play,
and what is my part?

472
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,690
- Uh, one moment, sir-
- Who are you?

473
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,776
I'm, um-
I'm the money.

474
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,778
Then you may remain,

475
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:47,781
so long as you remain silent.

476
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:50,951
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

477
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:54,787
- Thank you, sir.
- We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned.

478
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:57,457
A young nobleman of Verona.

479
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,459
- And the title of this piece?
- Mercutio.

480
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:02,128
Is it?

481
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,714
I will play him.

482
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,760
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

483
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,720
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

484
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:12,722
Sam, my pretty one!

485
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:16,810
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

486
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,103
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

487
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,606
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

488
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:25,318
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

489
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,947
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

490
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,949
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

491
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,951
Of course,
such mighty writing.

492
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:35,120
There's no one like Marlowe.

493
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:50,844
Better fortune, boy.

494
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,846
I was in a play.

495
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:55,473
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

496
00:35:55,557 --> 00:35:59,311
When I write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

497
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:00,854
You admire it.

498
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:03,022
I liked it
when they cut heads off,

499
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:06,026
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

500
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,153
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

501
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:10,280
Here, kitty, kitty.

502
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:16,954
Plenty of blood.

503
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:18,955
That's the only writing.

504
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,500
I have to get back.

505
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:25,712
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

506
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:27,714
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

507
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:31,218
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

508
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:33,220
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

509
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:35,722
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

510
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,724
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

511
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,726
Is the day so young?

512
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,980
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

513
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:45,982
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

514
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:48,486
Not having that which having
makes them short.

515
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,487
- Good.
- In love?

516
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:52,406
- Out.
- Of love?

517
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:56,409
- Out of her favor where I am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

518
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,664
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:03,583
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

520
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,921
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

521
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:10,257
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

522
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,342
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

523
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:15,846
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

524
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:20,684
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

525
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:26,857
I- I'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

526
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,026
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

527
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,029
Go once more.

528
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:33,906
Will.

529
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,366
Where is Mercutio?

530
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,369
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

531
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,372
I have a sonnet to write.

532
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:43,540
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

533
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:50,089
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

534
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:54,092
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

535
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:56,928
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

536
00:37:57,012 --> 00:38:00,474
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

537
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:06,146
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May-"

538
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,232
Two hours at prayer!

539
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,734
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

540
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:12,736
Piety is for Sunday!

541
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,740
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

542
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:18,659
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

543
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:21,495
It would be better if you'd tell her to
get off her knees and show some civility...

544
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:23,581
to her six-day
lord and master!

545
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,960
Mmmph!

546
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:35,509
My lady Viola.

547
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:38,011
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

548
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:40,013
I am aware of it.

549
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:43,184
But it is
beauty's privilege.

550
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,352
You flatter, my lord.

551
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:49,189
No. I have spoken
to the queen.

552
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:52,526
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

553
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,529
and once given,
her consent is her command.

554
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,032
Do you intend to marry,
my lord?

555
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,368
Your father should keep you
better informed.

556
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,870
He has bought me for you.

557
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:07,542
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

558
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,835
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

559
00:39:11,378 --> 00:39:14,298
But I do not love you,
my lord.

560
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:17,134
How your mind hops about.

561
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:19,553
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

562
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,014
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

563
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:24,559
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

564
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,561
You will like Virginia.

565
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:29,230
- Virginia?
- Oh, yes.

566
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:32,399
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

567
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:36,028
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

568
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:39,031
I fancy tobacco
has a future.

569
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:42,076
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

570
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,579
But why me?

571
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:46,580
It was your eyes.

572
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,041
No, your lips.

573
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:03,180
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

574
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:05,182
The queen has consented?

575
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:07,185
She wants to inspect you.

576
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:09,854
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

577
00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:14,275
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

578
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:16,277
and brief.

579
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,865
I will do my duty, my lord.

580
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:30,207
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

581
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:34,212
I beseech you
banish me from yours.

582
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:37,548
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

583
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:41,051
A daughter's duty...

584
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:43,555
and the queen's command."

585
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:08,913
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

586
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:14,502
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

587
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:17,839
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

588
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,674
I'm very sorry, sir.

589
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,180
We're gonna have to do it again.

590
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:28,933
You did not like the speech?

591
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:30,935
No, the speech is excellent.

592
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:34,689
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you."

593
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:37,025
Excellent,
and a good length.

594
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:41,487
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

595
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,866
There.
You have this duel.

596
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:48,744
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

597
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:53,875
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

598
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,711
"A plague
on both your houses!"

599
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:04,135
He dies?

600
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:09,641
- Ohh!
- Will!

601
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,726
Where are my pages?

602
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:25,907
Did you give her my letter?

603
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,702
And this is for you!

604
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:45,927
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

605
00:42:47,345 --> 00:42:49,263
I'm unmanned,

606
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:52,434
unmended and unmade,

607
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:54,436
like a puppet in a box.

608
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,604
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

609
00:42:56,688 --> 00:42:58,940
She tells me to keep away.

610
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:02,277
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

611
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,280
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

612
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,282
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

613
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:10,285
She loves me, Thomas!

614
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:12,287
- Does she say so?
- No.

615
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,290
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

616
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:18,794
- Was she weeping when
she gave you this? - Uh-

617
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:21,630
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

618
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:23,631
Yes, my aunt.

619
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:27,594
But perhaps
she wept a little.

620
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:32,140
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

621
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,936
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

622
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,522
Oh, yes.

623
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:40,982
Like rain and sun.

624
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,652
Like cold and heat.

625
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:46,571
Is your lady beautiful?

626
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:50,241
Since I came here from the country,

627
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:52,244
I have not seen her close.

628
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:55,247
Tell me, is-
is she beautiful?

629
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,042
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

630
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:02,004
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

631
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,840
A- A-And her lips?

632
00:44:05,924 --> 00:44:07,842
Her lips?

633
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:11,430
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

634
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:14,182
And her voice,
like lark's song?

635
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:17,185
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

636
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:20,856
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

637
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:23,608
- Ah, she sings too?
- Constantly.

638
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:27,071
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

639
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,198
And her bosom.

640
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:31,450
Did I mention her bosom?

641
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,326
What of her bosom?

642
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,996
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

643
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,999
as round and rare
as golden apples.

644
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:42,043
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

645
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:45,547
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

646
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:50,010
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

647
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:52,888
Besides, can a-

648
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:55,349
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

649
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:58,685
love happily with
a bankside poet and player?

650
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:01,063
Yes, by God!

651
00:45:01,147 --> 00:45:03,899
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

652
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:07,152
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

653
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:09,655
Their love
should be minded by each,

654
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,408
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

655
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:15,494
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

656
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:17,495
But what of Lord Wessex?

657
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,000
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

658
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,926
Oh, Will.

659
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,596
Thank you, my lady.

660
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:37,933
Lady?

661
00:45:38,017 --> 00:45:40,936
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

662
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:43,230
Wouldn't deceive a child.

663
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:49,611
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

664
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,280
It wouldn't take you long
to read it.

665
00:45:52,364 --> 00:45:55,075
I expect you'd know all the booksellers!

666
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,586
Can you love a fool?

667
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:08,463
Can you love a player?

668
00:46:15,888 --> 00:46:18,140
Wait!

669
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:21,977
You're still a maid, and perhaps as mistook
in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

670
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:24,813
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

671
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:26,481
I am.

672
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:29,485
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

673
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:45,459
I do not know how to undress a man.

674
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:47,461
It is strange to me too.

675
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,496
Go to. Go to.

676
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:12,630
I would not have thought it.

677
00:48:13,881 --> 00:48:16,801
There is something better than a play.

678
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:19,471
There is.

679
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:21,973
Even your play.

680
00:48:24,058 --> 00:48:25,976
Oh?

681
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:29,856
And that was only my first try.

682
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:48,291
Will.

683
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:52,795
You would not leave me.

684
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:55,298
I must.

685
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,300
Look how pale the window.

686
00:48:57,383 --> 00:48:59,302
Moonlight.

687
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:02,263
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

688
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:05,433
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

689
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:09,937
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

690
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:13,775
Mr. Henslowe?

691
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:16,277
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

692
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,279
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

693
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:21,283
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

694
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:24,285
- It's broad day. The rooster tells us so.
- It was the owl.

695
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:26,662
Believe me, love, it was the owl-

696
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,000
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

697
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:36,464
My lady?

698
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:39,300
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

699
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:42,804
It is a new world.

700
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:45,807
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

701
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:48,518
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

702
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:51,813
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

703
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:55,317
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

704
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,112
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

705
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:01,114
Aye, pilgrim.

706
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,617
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

707
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,870
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

708
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:08,871
They pray.

709
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:12,376
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

710
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:15,879
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

711
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:19,507
It's you.

712
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,010
Suffering cats!

713
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,179
Then move not...

714
00:50:24,262 --> 00:50:27,306
while my prayer's effect
I take.

715
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:35,064
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

716
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:37,901
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

717
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:42,739
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

718
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:45,450
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

719
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,536
It is more-
Let me.

720
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:50,580
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

721
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:54,960
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:03,969
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will!

723
00:51:04,052 --> 00:51:06,138
It was lucky you were here.

724
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:08,640
- Why do not I write the
rest of your play- - Yes, yes!

725
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:12,936
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

726
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:16,898
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

727
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:21,445
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

728
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:24,114
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

729
00:51:24,197 --> 00:51:26,408
and a wise and virtuous.

730
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:29,411
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

731
00:51:29,495 --> 00:51:32,581
I tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

732
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:34,583
shall have the chinks.

733
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:36,668
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

734
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:40,505
Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

735
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:43,383
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

736
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:46,552
Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.

737
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:50,974
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?

738
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,435
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

739
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:56,146
Let it be night.

740
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,192
- What's he that follows here that would not dance?
- I know not.

741
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:02,152
Go ask his name.

742
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:07,324
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

743
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:10,493
No, do not go.

744
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,496
I must. I must.

745
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,832
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

746
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,001
Simply... terrible!

747
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:29,345
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

748
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:31,515
It is the east,

749
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:34,226
and Juliet is the sun.

750
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:38,856
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

751
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:41,859
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

752
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:46,488
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she."

753
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:49,366
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

754
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,202
"It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!

755
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:55,121
Oh, that she knew she were!

756
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,792
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

757
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,169
as daylight doth a lamp."

758
00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:04,382
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

759
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:07,051
stream so bright...

760
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:11,763
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

761
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:15,517
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

762
00:53:15,601 --> 00:53:18,520
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand,

763
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,856
that I might touch
that cheek.

764
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:24,068
- Ay, me.
- "Oh, Romeo.

765
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:26,195
Romeo.

766
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,864
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

767
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:32,576
- Deny thy father and-"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

768
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,454
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

769
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:38,290
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

770
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:40,751
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

771
00:53:42,503 --> 00:53:45,255
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

772
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:48,050
so stumblest
on my counsel?"

773
00:53:48,134 --> 00:53:51,345
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

774
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:56,099
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

775
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:59,645
Had I it written
I would tear the word.

776
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:04,066
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

777
00:54:04,149 --> 00:54:07,319
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

778
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:09,988
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

779
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:13,116
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee."

780
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,621
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

781
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:22,126
Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.

782
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,503
Would not for the world
they saw thee here.

783
00:54:24,587 --> 00:54:27,506
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

784
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:31,135
- And but thou love me let them find me here.
- "Good night.

785
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:33,137
Good night,

786
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,098
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

787
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:38,559
as that within my breast.

788
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,853
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?"

789
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:42,855
That's my line.

790
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:44,982
Oh. It is mine too.

791
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:47,986
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

792
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:50,905
What satifaction
canst thou have tonight?

793
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,907
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

794
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:57,453
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

795
00:54:57,537 --> 00:55:00,164
My love is deep.

796
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,791
The more I give to thee,

797
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:04,835
the more I have,

798
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:06,921
for both are infinite."

799
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,465
Madam?

800
00:55:09,548 --> 00:55:13,677
- I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
- Juliet!

801
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,682
- "Anon, good nurse."
- Anon, good nurse. Sweet Montague, be true.

802
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:21,685
"Stay but a little.
I will come again."

803
00:55:21,769 --> 00:55:24,689
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

804
00:55:24,772 --> 00:55:27,191
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

805
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:30,861
"I am afeared...

806
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:35,366
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

807
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:37,868
Too flattering sweet...

808
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:39,871
to be substantial."

809
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,960
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

810
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,045
A thousand times,
good night.

811
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:50,548
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

812
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:54,260
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

813
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,514
I have no neck in this pig dress.

814
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:05,187
- How is it?
- It's all right.

815
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:11,861
Ned, I know, I know.

816
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:14,864
- It's good.
- Oh?

817
00:56:14,948 --> 00:56:17,700
The title won't do.

818
00:56:17,784 --> 00:56:19,535
Ah.

819
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:23,081
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

820
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,209
Thank you, Ned.

821
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:33,550
- You are a gentleman. - And you
are a Warwickshire shit-house.

822
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:36,344
- What o'clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
- By the hour of nine.

823
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,637
I shall not fail.
'Tis 20 year till then.

824
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:40,890
I have forgot
why I called thee back.

825
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:43,685
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh! Silence.

826
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:46,437
The friar marries them in secret,

827
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,441
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

828
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:53,528
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

829
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:56,781
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

830
00:56:56,864 --> 00:56:59,159
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

831
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:01,536
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

832
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,538
on the island
of the pirate king.

833
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:07,500
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

834
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:10,044
Get out!

835
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:14,632
A thousand apologies.

836
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:19,137
Please.

837
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,973
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

838
00:57:22,056 --> 00:57:24,309
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

839
00:57:24,392 --> 00:57:29,439
- I would I were thy bird.
- Sweet, so would I; yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

840
00:57:30,523 --> 00:57:33,693
Good night.
Good night.

841
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:38,448
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

842
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,125
Sunday.

843
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:51,336
'Tis Sunday.

844
00:57:57,926 --> 00:58:00,887
I found something
in my sleep.

845
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:05,516
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

846
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,604
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

847
00:58:09,688 --> 00:58:12,607
It is not a comedy
I'm writing now.

848
00:58:14,275 --> 00:58:17,404
A broad river
divides my lovers.

849
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:20,657
Family, duty, fate.

850
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,288
As unchangeable as nature.

851
00:58:26,371 --> 00:58:28,289
Yes.

852
00:58:29,249 --> 00:58:32,335
This is not life, Will.

853
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:35,463
It is a stolen season.

854
00:58:35,547 --> 00:58:37,465
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

855
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:40,426
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My Lord, I will go-

856
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,597
Sunday. Greenwich!

857
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,018
Now, pay attention, nursie.

858
00:58:49,102 --> 00:58:51,605
The queen-
Gloriana Regina,

859
00:58:51,688 --> 00:58:55,191
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us-

860
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:58,404
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

861
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:01,656
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

862
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,367
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

863
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:08,622
So get you to my lady's chamber and produce
her with or without her undergarments!

864
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:11,041
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

865
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:14,669
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

866
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:17,214
To be the wife
of a poor player.

867
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:21,176
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

868
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:24,555
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

869
00:59:24,638 --> 00:59:27,474
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

870
00:59:27,557 --> 00:59:31,144
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

871
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:33,981
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

872
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:36,566
Stage fighting.

873
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,735
Oh, Will.

874
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,323
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

875
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:45,742
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

876
00:59:45,826 --> 00:59:49,913
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

877
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:52,916
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

878
00:59:55,836 --> 00:59:57,837
Good morning, my Lord.

879
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:02,968
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

880
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:06,596
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

881
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,141
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman?

882
01:00:11,518 --> 01:00:14,229
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

883
01:00:14,312 --> 01:00:17,858
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

884
01:00:17,941 --> 01:00:20,277
just as she said.

885
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,821
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

886
01:00:22,904 --> 01:00:25,324
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

887
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:28,243
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

888
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:32,956
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

889
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,907
- Now?
- Now.

890
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:10,995
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

891
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:16,208
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

892
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:19,878
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

893
01:01:19,962 --> 01:01:22,839
- Does he come to the house?
- A theater poet?

894
01:01:22,923 --> 01:01:26,427
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

895
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,804
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

896
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:31,181
Oh, yes. He is the one.

897
01:01:31,265 --> 01:01:34,810
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

898
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:37,563
That dog!

899
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:55,372
Your Majesty.

900
01:01:56,582 --> 01:01:58,875
Stand up straight, girl.

901
01:02:02,505 --> 01:02:04,423
I've seen you.

902
01:02:04,506 --> 01:02:08,218
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

903
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:10,888
Your Majesty.

904
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:13,390
What do you love so much?

905
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:15,934
- Your Majesty-
- Speak up, girl!

906
01:02:16,018 --> 01:02:18,104
I know who I am.

907
01:02:18,187 --> 01:02:21,565
Do you love stories
of kings and queens?

908
01:02:21,649 --> 01:02:23,567
Of feats of arms?

909
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,362
Or is it courtly love?

910
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:28,406
I love theater.

911
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:31,450
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed-

912
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:35,163
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

913
01:02:36,664 --> 01:02:39,333
And I love poetry above all.

914
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,335
Above Lord Wessex?

915
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:43,963
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

916
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:46,465
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

917
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:51,763
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

918
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:55,182
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

919
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:57,184
They cannot make it true.

920
01:02:57,268 --> 01:03:00,062
Oh, but they can.

921
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:07,611
I mean, Your Majesty, they-
they do not, they have... not,

922
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:09,989
but I believe
there is one who can.

923
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:14,118
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

924
01:03:14,201 --> 01:03:16,161
Your Majesty is wise in it.

925
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:19,248
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

926
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:22,209
I thought you were here
because you had none.

927
01:03:28,091 --> 01:03:32,303
- Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
- Fifty pounds.

928
01:03:34,973 --> 01:03:36,849
Fifty pounds?

929
01:03:38,392 --> 01:03:43,313
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

930
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:46,776
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

931
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:51,864
I bear witness to the wager...

932
01:03:51,947 --> 01:03:55,076
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

933
01:03:57,787 --> 01:04:00,497
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

934
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:04,001
Are there
no more fireworks?

935
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:08,005
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

936
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:12,302
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

937
01:04:12,385 --> 01:04:16,347
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

938
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:19,350
It takes a woman to know it.

939
01:04:22,979 --> 01:04:24,897
Marlowe.

940
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:37,744
Burbage?

941
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:40,705
Huh? Who's there?

942
01:04:40,788 --> 01:04:43,457
Marlowe.

943
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:47,045
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

944
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:49,338
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

945
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:53,009
- What do you want, Kit?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

946
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:56,387
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

947
01:04:56,471 --> 01:05:00,558
- Tomorrow.
- Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

948
01:05:00,641 --> 01:05:02,936
Oh, will you desist, madam!

949
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:05,938
- Oh!
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

950
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,316
Now, what is money to men like us?

951
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:15,156
Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting
- a comedy by Shakespeare.

952
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,116
Oh, Romeo.

953
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,453
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

954
01:05:20,537 --> 01:05:23,539
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

955
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:26,709
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

956
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:31,214
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's
Men have the playing of it at the Rose.

957
01:05:31,297 --> 01:05:33,257
Treachery!

958
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:36,845
Traitor and thief!

959
01:05:39,764 --> 01:05:42,016
Oh, no.

960
01:05:42,058 --> 01:05:44,101
No!

961
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,955
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

962
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:06,958
By my heel,
I care not.

963
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:10,337
Follow me close.
I will speak with them.

964
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,465
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

965
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:15,800
Are you going
to do it like that?

966
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:18,094
Positions.

967
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:22,474
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

968
01:06:22,557 --> 01:06:24,809
Follow me close.
I will speak to them.

969
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:27,813
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

970
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:31,316
And but one word with one of us?

971
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:34,194
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

972
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:37,990
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

973
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:40,200
What is this rabble?

974
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:45,330
Draw, if you be a man!

975
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:10,731
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

976
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:15,068
And a dog.

977
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:18,571
No!

978
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,909
Have privy, players! Please!

979
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:24,869
Oh! Not with my props!

980
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:26,371
Oh!

981
01:07:26,454 --> 01:07:29,374
- Will! What-
- A writer's quarrel.

982
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:31,877
Quite normal.

983
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:35,380
Stay here.

984
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:49,728
You are hurt.

985
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:06,119
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

986
01:08:06,203 --> 01:08:09,164
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

987
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:11,167
Not yet.

988
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,211
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

989
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:16,630
My investment!
Lambert!

990
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:20,301
Vengeance!

991
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:49,830
A famous victory!

992
01:08:49,913 --> 01:08:54,000
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

993
01:08:54,084 --> 01:08:56,629
Oh, what happy hour.

994
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:59,965
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

995
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,676
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

996
01:09:04,762 --> 01:09:07,514
One at a time. One at a time.

997
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:11,476
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

998
01:09:15,606 --> 01:09:19,359
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

999
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:22,321
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

1000
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:27,200
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1001
01:09:27,284 --> 01:09:28,995
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

1002
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:30,996
The Admiral's Men!

1003
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:57,398
Well, I-
I quite liked it.

1004
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:59,900
Master Kent,

1005
01:09:59,984 --> 01:10:02,819
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

1006
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:07,324
My "wick"?

1007
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:11,203
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the
theater, you must have a part in my play.

1008
01:10:11,286 --> 01:10:16,250
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1009
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,419
My heavens.
I thank you.

1010
01:10:19,503 --> 01:10:21,798
What's the play about, then?

1011
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:24,050
Well, there's this nurse-

1012
01:10:29,514 --> 01:10:32,266
Silence, silence, silence!

1013
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,727
Master Shakespeare...

1014
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:39,107
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

1015
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:43,903
The apothecary?

1016
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:47,031
What is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

1017
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:49,283
How does the comedy end?

1018
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:53,579
- By God, I wish I knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does?

1019
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:57,291
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

1020
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,628
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1021
01:11:17,228 --> 01:11:20,481
Will! Mr. Henslowe!
Gentlemen all!

1022
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:24,360
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1023
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:26,862
Marlowe is dead.

1024
01:11:30,783 --> 01:11:33,119
Stabbed.

1025
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:37,581
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1026
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:42,462
What have I done?

1027
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:45,381
He was the first man among us.

1028
01:11:45,464 --> 01:11:48,134
A great light has gone out.

1029
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,944
Forgive me.

1030
01:12:08,988 --> 01:12:11,240
God forgive me.

1031
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:40,979
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1032
01:12:41,062 --> 01:12:43,481
One morning
in the month of May

1033
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:46,609
From my cot I stray

1034
01:12:46,692 --> 01:12:49,362
Just at the dawning
of the day

1035
01:12:49,446 --> 01:12:52,031
I met with
a charming mai-

1036
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:57,704
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1037
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:01,207
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1038
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,918
I'm going to church.

1039
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:07,714
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1040
01:13:07,797 --> 01:13:11,217
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1041
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,596
And on a day of mourning.

1042
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,807
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1043
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:19,892
Mourning?

1044
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:24,397
Who is dead, my lord?

1045
01:13:24,481 --> 01:13:29,402
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1046
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:34,115
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1047
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:37,160
My lady.

1048
01:13:37,243 --> 01:13:40,914
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

1049
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,293
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1050
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:58,557
Who can remember sorrow

1051
01:14:29,796 --> 01:14:34,885
Spare me, dear ghost.

1052
01:14:34,968 --> 01:14:37,804
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1053
01:14:51,068 --> 01:14:52,986
Will!

1054
01:14:54,404 --> 01:14:56,322
Oh, my love.

1055
01:14:56,406 --> 01:14:58,325
I thought you were dead.

1056
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:06,333
It is worse.

1057
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,669
I've killed a man.

1058
01:15:12,839 --> 01:15:15,676
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

1059
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:19,429
and my Henry VI was a house built
on his foundations.

1060
01:15:20,555 --> 01:15:23,142
You never spoke
so well of him.

1061
01:15:23,225 --> 01:15:26,353
He was not dead before.

1062
01:15:26,436 --> 01:15:31,191
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1063
01:15:32,526 --> 01:15:34,695
You lie.

1064
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:40,534
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1065
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:43,078
My love is no lie.

1066
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:46,790
I have a wife, yes,

1067
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:50,127
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1068
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,922
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

1069
01:15:55,298 --> 01:15:58,385
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

1070
01:15:58,469 --> 01:16:01,722
Calf-love.

1071
01:16:01,805 --> 01:16:06,227
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1072
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:09,063
I was the more deceived.

1073
01:16:09,146 --> 01:16:12,065
Yes, you were deceived,

1074
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:15,528
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1075
01:16:18,155 --> 01:16:21,241
I love you, Will,

1076
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:23,411
beyond poetry.

1077
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:25,996
Oh, my love.

1078
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,125
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1079
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,503
about all the plays
that would never come,

1080
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:35,297
only that I would
never see your face.

1081
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:38,675
I saw our end,
and it will come.

1082
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:43,264
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

1083
01:16:43,347 --> 01:16:45,933
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

1084
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:50,688
- and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
- No. No.

1085
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:55,275
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

1086
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,279
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1087
01:16:59,864 --> 01:17:03,117
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

1088
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,119
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

1089
01:17:06,203 --> 01:17:08,164
Romeo is banished.

1090
01:17:08,247 --> 01:17:10,833
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet- - Is that me?

1091
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:15,796
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1092
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,633
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1093
01:17:19,717 --> 01:17:22,678
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

1094
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:25,514
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1095
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:31,770
I have not said all.

1096
01:17:31,853 --> 01:17:37,026
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

1097
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:40,487
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

1098
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:43,574
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

1099
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:45,576
That's me.

1100
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:47,911
and buys a deadly poison.

1101
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:52,917
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1102
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,336
He drinks the poison.

1103
01:17:56,795 --> 01:17:59,048
He dies by her side,

1104
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:04,094
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1105
01:18:04,178 --> 01:18:07,307
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

1106
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:12,269
and then kills herself.

1107
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:18,484
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1108
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:21,445
Sad... and wonderful.

1109
01:18:22,613 --> 01:18:25,450
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1110
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:28,285
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

1111
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,371
Just so.

1112
01:18:31,622 --> 01:18:34,709
Yes, it will serve.

1113
01:18:36,627 --> 01:18:38,921
But there's a scene missing.

1114
01:18:39,004 --> 01:18:41,883
Between marriage
and death?

1115
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:52,393
The play...
all written out for you.

1116
01:18:53,936 --> 01:18:56,564
I had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

1117
01:18:56,647 --> 01:18:59,067
He has a good fist
for lettering.

1118
01:19:01,235 --> 01:19:03,154
There is a new scene.

1119
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:14,331
- Will you read in for me?
- "Wilt thou be gone? It's not yet near day.

1120
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,168
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1121
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,837
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1122
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:23,007
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

1123
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,927
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale."

1124
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:30,056
"It was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

1125
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:32,474
no nightingale.

1126
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:35,478
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

1127
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:39,690
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

1128
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:43,611
Night's candles
are burnt out,

1129
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:46,114
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

1130
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:49,575
on the misty mountaintops.

1131
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:54,122
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die."

1132
01:19:55,873 --> 01:19:59,919
"Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.

1133
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,964
It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

1134
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:07,718
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

1135
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:11,014
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

1136
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,934
Therefore, stay yet.

1137
01:20:16,143 --> 01:20:18,563
Thou needst not
to be gone."

1138
01:20:18,646 --> 01:20:20,898
"Let me be ta'en,

1139
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,068
let me be put to death;

1140
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:28,490
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

1141
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:31,159
I have more care
to stay...

1142
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:33,619
than will to go.

1143
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:36,081
Come, death, and welcome.

1144
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,167
Juliet wills it so."

1145
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:05,193
You will go far, I fear.

1146
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:11,700
I hope we work
together again.

1147
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,372
"Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law...

1148
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:21,751
is death, death to
any he that utters them."

1149
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,461
Then him. Then me.

1150
01:21:24,962 --> 01:21:27,048
"Put- Put this...

1151
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,509
- in any liquid thing you will and-"
- Hah!

1152
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:33,804
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

1153
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:37,892
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

1154
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,894
- Like soft music-
- Shakespeare!

1155
01:21:57,328 --> 01:21:59,288
Upstart inky pup!

1156
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,293
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1157
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:11,093
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1158
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,094
I am more than enough!

1159
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,937
Move!

1160
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,522
Absent friends.

1161
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,901
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe!

1162
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,196
Will?

1163
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,532
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1164
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:01,203
Will? Uh, it's true.

1165
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:04,081
It was a... tavern brawl.

1166
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:09,127
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1167
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,422
A quarrel about the bill.

1168
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,758
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1169
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,219
Not the billing,
the bill!

1170
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,225
Oh, God.

1171
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,811
- I am free of it.
- Where is she?

1172
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,898
Close it.

1173
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:33,443
- My Lord Wessex.
- The Rose harbors the ass that shits on my name!

1174
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,738
Take it down
stone by stone.

1175
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:39,533
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1176
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,493
Mr. Tilney,
what is this?

1177
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,995
Sedition and indecency.

1178
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,790
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1179
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,501
- Where, boy?
- There.

1180
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,753
I saw her bubbies.

1181
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:56,217
So, a woman on the stage!

1182
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,429
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1183
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,973
Why, sir?

1184
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:06,185
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness!

1185
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:11,148
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1186
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:28,291
Not him, her!

1187
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,295
That's who I meant.

1188
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,468
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

1189
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:44,807
Notice will be posted!

1190
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:47,852
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1191
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:50,813
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

1192
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,900
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1193
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,488
It is over.

1194
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,325
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1195
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,676
I wanted to be an actor.

1196
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:22,220
I'm so sorry, Will.

1197
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:31,354
You were... w-w-

1198
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:34,857
w- wonderful.

1199
01:26:36,443 --> 01:26:38,695
Thank you.

1200
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:51,540
"Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and-"

1201
01:26:57,964 --> 01:27:00,549
Everything all right?

1202
01:27:38,004 --> 01:27:41,215
I would've been good.

1203
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:44,385
- I would've been great.
- So would I.

1204
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,888
We both would.

1205
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,621
Lambert, kill him.

1206
01:28:12,956 --> 01:28:15,208
That can wait.

1207
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:24,092
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1208
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,845
But my father,
James Burbage,

1209
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:32,392
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

1210
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:37,188
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1211
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:40,775
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1212
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:42,860
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1213
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:48,825
I have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

1214
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:25,653
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1215
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:34,579
Oranges!
Sweet oranges!

1216
01:30:02,357 --> 01:30:06,570
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1217
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:08,738
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1218
01:30:08,822 --> 01:30:10,740
You are gaining a colony.

1219
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:13,660
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

1220
01:30:13,744 --> 01:30:16,246
by these drafts in my hand.

1221
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:19,082
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

1222
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,252
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1223
01:30:23,545 --> 01:30:26,423
Ah, the bride!

1224
01:30:27,674 --> 01:30:30,594
Good morning, my lord.

1225
01:30:30,677 --> 01:30:34,639
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1226
01:30:39,853 --> 01:30:41,772
Be gone!

1227
01:30:41,855 --> 01:30:43,982
Hup, hup, hup!

1228
01:31:40,164 --> 01:31:42,082
Oh, my lord!

1229
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:44,751
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

1230
01:31:44,835 --> 01:31:46,920
Oh, God bless you!

1231
01:31:47,003 --> 01:31:49,840
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1232
01:31:49,923 --> 01:31:51,884
The tide will not wait!

1233
01:31:51,967 --> 01:31:55,845
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1234
01:32:22,373 --> 01:32:27,044
Candy apples!

1235
01:32:27,127 --> 01:32:30,673
Buy my apples!

1236
01:32:35,177 --> 01:32:37,387
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1237
01:32:44,895 --> 01:32:48,274
Is this, uh-
Is this all right?

1238
01:32:48,357 --> 01:32:50,276
Yeah.

1239
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:09,920
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1240
01:33:10,004 --> 01:33:14,550
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1241
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:19,596
This is the very business
of show!

1242
01:33:28,731 --> 01:33:33,277
T- T- T-Two-

1243
01:33:33,361 --> 01:33:35,988
T- T-T-T- T- T-

1244
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:39,742
T- T-T-Two households-

1245
01:33:39,826 --> 01:33:42,787
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

1246
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:46,331
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1247
01:33:48,835 --> 01:33:52,380
T- T- T- T-T-

1248
01:33:52,463 --> 01:33:54,798
T- T-

1249
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,644
Two households,

1250
01:34:48,728 --> 01:34:51,856
both alike in dignity,

1251
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:54,692
in fair Verona,

1252
01:34:54,775 --> 01:34:57,362
where we lay our scene.

1253
01:34:57,445 --> 01:35:00,490
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

1254
01:35:00,573 --> 01:35:03,951
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1255
01:35:04,034 --> 01:35:07,038
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1256
01:35:07,122 --> 01:35:10,249
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1257
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:13,085
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1258
01:35:13,169 --> 01:35:16,631
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

1259
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,887
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

1260
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:27,725
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1261
01:35:34,065 --> 01:35:36,067
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

1262
01:35:37,193 --> 01:35:39,236
good?

1263
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:45,159
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

1264
01:35:45,243 --> 01:35:48,287
No, for then
we should be colliers.

1265
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,874
I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

1266
01:35:50,957 --> 01:35:54,043
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1267
01:35:54,127 --> 01:35:56,587
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1268
01:35:56,671 --> 01:35:59,841
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

1269
01:35:59,924 --> 01:36:03,761
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

1270
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:07,098
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

1271
01:36:07,182 --> 01:36:11,102
- The show must- You know.
- Go on!

1272
01:36:11,185 --> 01:36:14,605
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1273
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:17,108
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1274
01:36:17,192 --> 01:36:19,485
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, I fear thee!

1275
01:36:21,904 --> 01:36:24,783
- Let them begin.
- I will frown as I pass by.

1276
01:36:24,866 --> 01:36:28,661
- Let them take it as they list!
- Nay, as they dare.

1277
01:36:28,745 --> 01:36:32,791
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

1278
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:35,794
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

1279
01:36:35,877 --> 01:36:39,172
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1280
01:36:39,255 --> 01:36:42,884
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1281
01:36:42,968 --> 01:36:44,886
- Can we talk?
- Shh!

1282
01:36:44,969 --> 01:36:47,805
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

1283
01:36:47,889 --> 01:36:51,017
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

1284
01:36:51,101 --> 01:36:54,187
- What happened to Sam? -
Who are you? - Thomas Kent.

1285
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:56,856
Do you know it?

1286
01:36:56,939 --> 01:37:00,068
- I serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

1287
01:37:03,905 --> 01:37:06,532
Hyah! Yah!

1288
01:37:10,328 --> 01:37:13,331
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

1289
01:37:13,414 --> 01:37:16,543
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

1290
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:18,920
Nurse!

1291
01:37:21,297 --> 01:37:24,551
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

1292
01:37:24,635 --> 01:37:27,846
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

1293
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:29,848
I bade her come.

1294
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:32,016
How now, who calls?

1295
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,853
What, ladybird!

1296
01:37:34,936 --> 01:37:36,688
God forbid!
Where's this girl?

1297
01:37:36,771 --> 01:37:39,399
What, lamb!

1298
01:37:39,482 --> 01:37:41,693
What, ladybird!

1299
01:37:42,778 --> 01:37:45,197
What, Juliet!

1300
01:37:46,323 --> 01:37:49,701
How now, who calls?

1301
01:37:52,663 --> 01:37:57,250
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

1302
01:38:00,379 --> 01:38:03,548
Your mother-
Your mother.

1303
01:38:03,632 --> 01:38:06,926
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

1304
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:09,054
This is the matter.

1305
01:38:09,137 --> 01:38:11,556
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

1306
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:16,395
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1307
01:38:16,478 --> 01:38:19,815
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

1308
01:38:19,898 --> 01:38:23,401
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

1309
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:28,990
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

1310
01:38:29,074 --> 01:38:31,826
I have but four-

1311
01:38:54,016 --> 01:38:56,059
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

1312
01:38:56,143 --> 01:39:00,731
how stands your dispositions
to be married?

1313
01:39:00,814 --> 01:39:03,942
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

1314
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,116
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

1315
01:39:18,874 --> 01:39:22,085
I- I'm sped.

1316
01:39:22,169 --> 01:39:24,963
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

1317
01:39:25,047 --> 01:39:27,424
Ask for me tomorrow,

1318
01:39:27,508 --> 01:39:30,344
you shall find me
a grave man.

1319
01:39:37,559 --> 01:39:40,812
Yes!

1320
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:47,986
Yah!

1321
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:50,614
"Such mortal drugs I have,

1322
01:39:50,697 --> 01:39:55,369
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them."

1323
01:39:55,452 --> 01:39:57,996
Then him. Then me.

1324
01:40:06,463 --> 01:40:08,549
Romeo, away, be gone!

1325
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:13,053
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!

1326
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:17,391
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1327
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:20,936
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

1328
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,938
Why dost thou stay?

1329
01:40:23,021 --> 01:40:25,023
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

1330
01:40:25,107 --> 01:40:27,318
That murderer,
which way ran he?

1331
01:40:27,401 --> 01:40:30,195
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

1332
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:32,322
I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

1333
01:40:32,406 --> 01:40:35,117
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?

1334
01:40:35,201 --> 01:40:37,453
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool."

1335
01:40:40,247 --> 01:40:42,207
You are married?

1336
01:40:45,836 --> 01:40:50,882
"If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed."

1337
01:41:06,648 --> 01:41:08,860
Art thou gone so,

1338
01:41:11,487 --> 01:41:13,614
love, lord,

1339
01:41:13,697 --> 01:41:15,908
aye, husband, friend?

1340
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:20,746
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1341
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:23,749
for in a minute
there are many days.

1342
01:41:23,832 --> 01:41:27,420
Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...

1343
01:41:27,503 --> 01:41:29,922
I behold my Romeo.

1344
01:41:30,005 --> 01:41:31,924
Farewell.

1345
01:41:33,425 --> 01:41:36,345
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1346
01:41:38,389 --> 01:41:41,433
Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low,

1347
01:41:41,517 --> 01:41:44,979
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

1348
01:41:45,062 --> 01:41:48,440
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

1349
01:41:50,692 --> 01:41:52,904
Then trust me, love,

1350
01:41:52,987 --> 01:41:55,323
in my eyes, so do you.

1351
01:41:55,406 --> 01:41:59,159
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

1352
01:41:59,243 --> 01:42:01,162
Adieu.

1353
01:42:02,663 --> 01:42:05,291
Adieu.

1354
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:08,127
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

1355
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:11,297
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1356
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:15,342
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1357
01:42:15,426 --> 01:42:18,388
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1358
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:21,682
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1359
01:42:21,766 --> 01:42:25,394
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1360
01:42:25,477 --> 01:42:27,564
What ho! Apothecary!

1361
01:42:31,067 --> 01:42:34,695
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.

1362
01:42:34,778 --> 01:42:37,699
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1363
01:42:37,782 --> 01:42:41,535
- Let me have a dram of poison-
- Such mortal drugs I have,

1364
01:42:41,619 --> 01:42:45,665
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

1365
01:42:45,748 --> 01:42:49,251
- Art thou so-
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1366
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:58,010
I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

1367
01:43:02,015 --> 01:43:04,183
Eyes, look your last.

1368
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:07,019
Arms, take your last embrace.

1369
01:43:07,103 --> 01:43:09,438
And, lips,

1370
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:12,984
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

1371
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:15,486
seal with
a righteous kiss...

1372
01:43:17,446 --> 01:43:19,699
the dateless bargain...

1373
01:43:19,783 --> 01:43:22,035
to engrossing death.

1374
01:43:23,327 --> 01:43:26,163
Come, bitter conduct.

1375
01:43:26,247 --> 01:43:29,542
Come, unsavory guide.

1376
01:43:29,626 --> 01:43:33,337
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

1377
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:38,218
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

1378
01:43:38,301 --> 01:43:40,720
Here's to my love!

1379
01:43:48,645 --> 01:43:51,814
Oh... true apothecary!

1380
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:58,071
Thy drugs are quick.

1381
01:44:02,868 --> 01:44:05,453
Thus with a kiss...

1382
01:44:08,164 --> 01:44:10,250
I die.

1383
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:30,061
Where is my lord?

1384
01:44:31,813 --> 01:44:35,943
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

1385
01:44:36,026 --> 01:44:37,319
Dead!

1386
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:52,750
What's this?

1387
01:44:52,834 --> 01:44:56,546
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

1388
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:59,132
Poison, I see,

1389
01:44:59,215 --> 01:45:01,927
hath been
his timeless end.

1390
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:10,143
Oh, happy dagger,

1391
01:45:10,226 --> 01:45:12,187
this is thy sheath.

1392
01:45:15,148 --> 01:45:17,483
There rest...

1393
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:21,196
and let me die.

1394
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:31,665
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

1395
01:45:31,748 --> 01:45:36,169
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1396
01:45:36,252 --> 01:45:41,258
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1397
01:45:41,341 --> 01:45:43,593
Some shall be pardoned,

1398
01:45:43,676 --> 01:45:46,680
and some punished;

1399
01:45:46,763 --> 01:45:50,892
for never was a story
of more woe...

1400
01:45:50,975 --> 01:45:54,605
than this of Juliet...

1401
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,940
and her Romeo.

1402
01:46:24,051 --> 01:46:26,928
Bravo!

1403
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:32,642
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!

1404
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:21,734
- Bravo!
- Yea! Bravo!

1405
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:40,627
- God save the queen!
- I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1406
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:44,714
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1407
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,550
Everyone!

1408
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:49,970
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1409
01:47:50,054 --> 01:47:54,391
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1410
01:47:54,474 --> 01:47:57,853
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1411
01:47:57,937 --> 01:48:01,982
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

1412
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:04,568
That woman is a woman!

1413
01:48:04,652 --> 01:48:06,737
What?

1414
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:10,032
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1415
01:48:10,115 --> 01:48:15,537
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1416
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:18,957
Mr. Tilney!

1417
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:27,924
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1418
01:48:35,849 --> 01:48:38,561
The queen of England
does not attend...

1419
01:48:38,644 --> 01:48:40,688
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1420
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:43,774
So something
is out of joint.

1421
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:49,363
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1422
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:07,089
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

1423
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:09,883
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1424
01:49:11,218 --> 01:49:15,222
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1425
01:49:15,306 --> 01:49:18,267
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1426
01:49:20,018 --> 01:49:22,939
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

1427
01:49:27,776 --> 01:49:30,029
If only Lord Wessex
were here.

1428
01:49:30,113 --> 01:49:32,156
He is, ma'am.

1429
01:49:35,075 --> 01:49:38,288
Y- Your Majesty.

1430
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:42,541
There was a wager
I remember...

1431
01:49:42,625 --> 01:49:47,463
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1432
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:50,132
I think you lost it today.

1433
01:49:54,803 --> 01:49:58,724
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1434
01:49:58,808 --> 01:50:01,727
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1435
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:10,819
Master Shakespeare.

1436
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:16,409
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

1437
01:50:16,492 --> 01:50:19,620
and we will speak
some more.

1438
01:50:37,096 --> 01:50:39,349
Your Majesty.

1439
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:42,727
Why, Lord Wessex.

1440
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:45,354
Lost your wife so soon?

1441
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:48,191
Indeed I am a bride short,

1442
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:52,570
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1443
01:50:52,653 --> 01:50:55,239
How is this to end?

1444
01:50:55,322 --> 01:50:58,076
As stories must
when love's denied-

1445
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,787
with tears and a journey.

1446
01:51:00,828 --> 01:51:03,289
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

1447
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:06,835
not even I
can put asunder.

1448
01:51:06,918 --> 01:51:09,629
Master Kent.

1449
01:51:15,343 --> 01:51:19,347
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1450
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:25,103
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1451
01:51:25,186 --> 01:51:27,605
It's time
to settle accounts.

1452
01:51:30,817 --> 01:51:33,820
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

1453
01:51:35,154 --> 01:51:37,698
Pounds.

1454
01:51:37,782 --> 01:51:42,245
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1455
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:53,798
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1456
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:56,718
for Twelfth Night.

1457
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:17,322
Too late.

1458
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:28,124
My Lady Wessex.

1459
01:52:43,306 --> 01:52:46,351
A hired player
no longer.

1460
01:52:46,434 --> 01:52:49,062
Fifty pounds, Will,

1461
01:52:49,146 --> 01:52:51,648
for the poet of true love.

1462
01:52:52,774 --> 01:52:54,692
I'm done with theater.

1463
01:52:56,486 --> 01:52:59,030
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

1464
01:52:59,114 --> 01:53:01,616
Look what the dream
brought us.

1465
01:53:02,742 --> 01:53:05,369
It was we ourselves
did that.

1466
01:53:06,747 --> 01:53:11,000
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1467
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:15,255
I have hurt you,
and I'm sorry for it.

1468
01:53:15,339 --> 01:53:19,384
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

1469
01:53:19,467 --> 01:53:21,886
then I shall be
the sorrier.

1470
01:53:27,434 --> 01:53:30,019
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

1471
01:53:30,103 --> 01:53:32,064
for Twelfth Night.

1472
01:53:32,147 --> 01:53:35,233
A comedy.

1473
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:37,318
What would my hero be?

1474
01:53:37,402 --> 01:53:40,864
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1475
01:53:43,075 --> 01:53:46,578
It's a beginning.

1476
01:53:46,661 --> 01:53:50,749
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine-

1477
01:53:50,832 --> 01:53:54,169
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1478
01:53:56,004 --> 01:54:00,217
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1479
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,178
A storm.
All are lost.

1480
01:54:03,261 --> 01:54:06,724
She lands... on a...

1481
01:54:06,807 --> 01:54:09,810
vast and empty shore.

1482
01:54:11,269 --> 01:54:13,313
She's brought to the duke-

1483
01:54:14,732 --> 01:54:17,776
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

1484
01:54:18,902 --> 01:54:20,820
Good name.

1485
01:54:20,904 --> 01:54:25,242
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1486
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:29,204
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1487
01:54:31,414 --> 01:54:33,625
But all ends well.

1488
01:54:33,709 --> 01:54:35,919
How does it?

1489
01:54:36,003 --> 01:54:38,129
I don't know.

1490
01:54:39,714 --> 01:54:42,509
It's a mystery.

1491
01:54:48,723 --> 01:54:51,393
You will never age for me,

1492
01:54:51,477 --> 01:54:53,395
nor fade,

1493
01:54:53,478 --> 01:54:55,730
nor die.

1494
01:54:55,814 --> 01:54:58,317
Nor you for me.

1495
01:54:59,652 --> 01:55:01,945
Good-bye, my love.

1496
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:06,074
A thousand times good-bye.

1497
01:55:10,579 --> 01:55:12,497
Write me well.

1498
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:48,867
My story starts at sea,

1499
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:52,204
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1500
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:56,667
A shipwreck.

1501
01:55:58,544 --> 01:56:02,339
The wild waters roar and heave.

1502
01:56:03,549 --> 01:56:06,803
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

1503
01:56:09,555 --> 01:56:13,433
and all the helpless souls
within her...

1504
01:56:13,517 --> 01:56:15,812
drowned.

1505
01:56:18,481 --> 01:56:21,775
All save one:

1506
01:56:21,859 --> 01:56:24,027
a lady...

1507
01:56:25,404 --> 01:56:29,658
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

1508
01:56:29,742 --> 01:56:33,996
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

1509
01:56:36,332 --> 01:56:39,460
Not for her a watery end,

1510
01:56:41,003 --> 01:56:45,091
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1511
01:56:49,219 --> 01:56:51,764
It will be a love story,

1512
01:56:55,893 --> 01:57:00,064
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

1513
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:06,445
And her name will be Viola.
