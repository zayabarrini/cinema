1
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,806
One can prevent mildew

2
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:36,678
by spraying with copper sulfate.

3
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,729
There are 2 classic solutions used,

4
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,248
one from Bordeaux,
the other from Burgundy.

5
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,565
Burgundy being a region in France

6
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,768
which is reputed for its wine.

7
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,886
Three sprayings a year are required.

8
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,845
The first when the shoots reach

9
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,238
two or three centimetres long,

10
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:59,997
the second just before or after
the flowering,

11
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,159
and the third a month later.

12
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,842
The treatment is preventative

13
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,488
and must not be neglected.

14
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:10,278
Gentlemen, I'll finish my speech
on mildew prevention.

15
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,079
I remind you
that as in previous years,

16
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,717
airplanes and flyers will be placed

17
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:19,403
at your disposal
to remind the farmers that mildew,

18
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:22,925
a disease that destroys vines,
appeared simultaneously

19
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:26,923
with that other ideological disease
which has devastated men.

20
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,765
But the Chief of Police
will develop this point.

21
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:36,444
Any similarity to actual persons
or events is deliberate

22
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:47,566
As the Under-secretary
of Agriculture said,

23
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,642
3 treatments are necessary.

24
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:54,479
An ideological illness
is like mildew

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,685
and requires preventive measures.

26
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,283
Like mildew,

27
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,725
it is due
to septic germs

28
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,758
and various parasitic agents.

29
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,359
So the treatment of men
with appropriate solutions

30
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,008
is indispensable.

31
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,124
The 1 st stage occurs
in the schools

32
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,526
where,
if you'll pardon the metaphor,

33
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:22,285
the sprouts are still very young.

34
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,560
The 2nd treatment

35
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,242
occurs when they begin to bloom

36
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:31,083
as college students
or young workers.

37
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,121
The draft is the best time

38
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,401
to spray and save the sacred
tree of national liberty

39
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,526
from the disease
of ideological mildew.

40
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,365
Air-dropped leaflets are telling

41
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:47,248
our peasants of a new kind

42
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:51,600
of ideological mildew
beginning to ravage our land.

43
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,765
This new variety

44
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,362
is spreading insidiously.

45
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,961
It's a sly enemy

46
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,086
pushing us away
from God and the Crown.

47
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:03,359
It's against this enemy

48
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,758
that our action is aimed.

49
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:09,445
Don't take notes!
It's all in our pamphlet.

50
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:14,406
With the outbreak of isms,

51
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:19,006
Iike socialism, anarchism,
imperialism or communism,

52
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:24,402
sunspots start to multiply
on the face of the golden orb.

53
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,522
God refuses to enlighten the Reds!

54
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,484
Scientists forecast
an increase in sunspots

55
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,878
due to the arrival of the beatniks

56
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,246
and pacifists from certain countries

57
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,478
such as ltaly,
France and Scandinavia!

58
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:45,207
As head of Law and Order
here in the north,

59
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,124
I wish to tell you,
who are high civil servants,

60
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,320
we must preserve

61
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,758
the healthy elements
of our society

62
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,921
and heal those that are ill.

63
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:02,647
Tonight the enemy's holding
a meeting on our city.

64
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,118
But we are not an ism!

65
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,281
We are a democracy!

66
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,598
We won't forbid the meeting.

67
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:11,924
Nor will we forbid

68
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:14,603
the opposition from demonstrating!

69
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,760
With these healthy anti-bodies,

70
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:21,444
we must fight all diseases

71
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,443
of both the vine
as well as Society!

72
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,445
That's all I have to say.

73
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:36,566
Bear it in mind
during the days to come!

74
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,604
- Having lunch?
- Rapidly!

75
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,679
I'll take you to your plane.

76
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,078
- Thank you!
- It's my pleasure!

77
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,041
Tell my wife
I'll pick her up this evening.

78
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,808
An excursion
for the Bolshoï ballerinas!

79
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,762
From Moscow?

80
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:10,525
The Bolshoï Ballet is here
for 4 days. They open tonight.

81
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:16,121
- Stay over! You can sit in my box.
- I must return to the capital.

82
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,200
Ah, the capital! The palace!

83
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,563
The Palace thinks well of you!

84
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,803
What if one of them
chose freedom here?

85
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,246
Like that famous dancer...

86
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,599
No, none of that!

87
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:38,000
For freedom they pick London
or the US where the money's stable!

88
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,280
We have enough hot-heads in town!
Enough problems!

89
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,527
Stop! Take that down!

90
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,801
No permit's needed
for a meeting indoors!

91
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:55,246
I don't want any trouble!
Get a permit to use the hall!

92
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,128
Do as I say!

93
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,678
Bring me your permit!

94
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:03,398
Or meet elsewhere!
Take it down!

95
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:06,640
How can we find
another hall now

96
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:09,402
and tell 3 or 4 thousand people
about it?

97
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:14,078
- It's a rally!
- You signed the receipt!

98
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,885
Now it's unsigned! Here's your check!

99
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,887
I'll pay you compensation!

100
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,237
You got threats!

101
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,126
I don't know what you mean!

102
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:29,919
You don't cancel a rental
unless you're pressured!

103
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:34,927
- You lawyers are...
- Bozini, you're an honest man.

104
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:38,125
Who's behind all this? Why?

105
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:42,803
I don't want you in my hall,
that's why!

106
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,005
If you don't like it, lump it!

107
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,840
There must be a reason!

108
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:48,806
My father died today! OK?

109
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:00,561
I'd gladly let you see it

110
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:04,801
but the city inspector came by.

111
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:05,765
When?

112
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:09,046
Yesterday.
The seats must be specially set.

113
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,280
We can set 'em up this afternoon.

114
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,839
No, fastened to the floor!
It'll take a week at least.

115
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,407
Since when!

116
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:21,602
We cancel or meet in the street!

117
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:26,239
And without a permit!
That'd mean instigators and cops!

118
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,924
We won't find a hall.
They'll all refuse!

119
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,318
I say we have to cancel it.

120
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:33,922
He'd never agree!

121
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,881
We cancel it
and go quietly off to bed

122
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:41,080
or better yet,
to the Bolshoï opening!

123
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:45,400
And we take him there too?
And send his audience there?

124
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,924
- You got a hall?
- The Bolshoï!

125
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,760
A plot on the doc's life!

126
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,840
- Says who?
- My wife.

127
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,761
Who told you? None of my business?

128
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:59,202
What'll we tell the police?
Don't hang up!

129
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,727
She won't say. The guy didn't know
the doctor's due today.

130
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,445
This is George Pirou.
You must tell us who...

131
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:10,962
Certainly not!

132
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,758
I trust him. He didn't know
about tonight's meeting.

133
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,040
He overheard a discussion.

134
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,363
He won't tell you. Me neither!

135
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,564
He's had enough trouble!
He has a family!

136
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,128
Now they know!

137
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:30,241
Now you know. So do something!

138
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,205
It's for you.

139
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,438
I know, darling. See you later!

140
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,760
What do we do?

141
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,006
Call the Red Cross!

142
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,157
Attorney-Gen.!

143
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:47,363
It's all quite vague.
An anonymous witness.

144
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,078
An overheard conversation!

145
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:53,480
Maybe it's a hoax or a chronic liar!

146
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:57,563
Like those who
phone there's a bomb in a plane...

147
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,164
Who'd want to kill your president?

148
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,603
Marie, open the door!

149
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,477
Shall we go?

150
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:14,718
I'll call the Head of Security.

151
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,078
He'll provide protection,
unofficially!

152
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:22,163
We've no basis for any action!

153
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,884
Yes, I'm interested
in the Paris Commune!

154
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,164
- I'm late!
- You'll come to the theatre tonight?

155
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,606
As for a hall, I can do nothing.

156
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,241
The colonel!

157
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,805
Property rights
can't be infringed upon,

158
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,967
even though
some may want to change that!

159
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,443
- Yes, Papa?
- Niki, see to our guest.

160
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:54,882
In 2 seconds!

161
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,480
He's a fine magistrate!

162
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,039
He's out? Give me his duty officer.

163
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,525
You know about tonight?
Not the Bolshoï!

164
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,877
Yes! The Doctor's life
has been threatened.

165
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,238
- No, but he's due to arrive...
- Shortly.

166
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:20,400
He'll arrive shortly.

167
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,408
No... on the phone.

168
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,163
Like you say...

169
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,967
Tell the Col. I phoned.

170
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:31,682
"All quite vague"...
"No basis for any action".

171
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:36,924
The Doctor'll be mad when he hears
we asked those puppets for help.

172
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:38,726
- Puppets?
- Of the USA!

173
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,448
What can they have to do with it!

174
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,726
Always blame the USA!
Even if you're wrong!

175
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,323
Cut it out! You're not always funny!

176
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:17,516
There they are!

177
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,323
The police?

178
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,726
They've tailed me for 3 days.

179
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,087
Everything's set?

180
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:28,884
No. We lost our hall
and no one knows it!

181
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,683
They want to sabotage the meeting.

182
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:32,963
Who can fix it?

183
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:37,726
Only the Head of Security.
We'll see him after lunch.

184
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,356
Let's go now!

185
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,964
Then, to the hotel.

186
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:49,361
Your life's been threatened.
A guy overheard some talk about it.

187
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,645
- We'll ask the cops...
- For nothing!

188
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,477
Just for a hall, that's all!

189
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,997
This hall does not meet
safety regulations.

190
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:07,800
It was in use 2 weeks ago!

191
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,403
Here's the report.

192
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,884
- It has no emergency exit!
- It never did!

193
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,168
With a normal show

194
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,645
there's no danger.

195
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,202
Your rally might excite people.

196
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,882
It's in no way dangerous!

197
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,639
I've no reason
to hinder your meeting.

198
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,279
My decision is based

199
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,284
on reports.

200
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm neutral in this affair.

201
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,481
Then why're we being tailed?

202
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,245
For your safety! The Minister
of lnterior ordered us

203
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:51,039
to protect your committee members
from any possible extremists.

204
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,562
Whom you are using!

205
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:00,241
Other halls meet
the safety requirements,

206
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:04,920
Iike the Employees' Union Hall
opposite your hotel.

207
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:11,318
You simply cross the square!
I'm neutral in this affair!

208
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,920
Alright, Col.

209
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,406
There, on the 1 st floor! Not room

210
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,160
for over 200 people!

211
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:30,039
We'll look stupid! In a city
of 500,000, only 200 would hear you.

212
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,847
The rest'll be outside.

213
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:36,163
Ask the Col. to let us hang
loudspeakers from the trees.

214
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,198
Permit or not, people'll be here!

215
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,406
We'll go now...

216
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,765
...and try to alert people.

217
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,924
Print posters
with the rally's change of address!

218
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,967
Manuel, come discuss my speech!

219
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,837
George, you too!

220
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,487
I'll hold on.

221
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,966
Hello, darling! How are you?

222
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,722
Fine... yes.

223
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:37,044
Problems with the hall as usual!

224
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,006
Why should there be any fights?

225
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,519
Why any fights?

226
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,839
Yes, tomorrow.

227
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,567
George sends a kiss.

228
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,919
Till tomorrow, darling!

229
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,641
The kids?

230
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,757
Fine, but I don't see them enough.

231
00:15:57,928 --> 00:15:59,408
Helen?

232
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,564
We're not always eye to eye
but it's not serious.

233
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,606
They say a hungry bear

234
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,327
won't dance!

235
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:11,366
The bears are going to read that!

236
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:15,443
Your pen!

237
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,524
Go!

238
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,924
Hold your meetings in Russia!

239
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,399
We'd rather stay here!

240
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,161
Do as you're told!

241
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,483
Hey, you!

242
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,041
What's the idea!

243
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,648
- Never mind!
- Better than the Bolshoï?

244
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,525
- I only came to please you.
- Your dancers are old-hat.

245
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:25,919
Except when one chooses freedom!

246
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,959
And the Warsaw Pact?!

247
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:32,798
We're against the bomb,
Russian or American!

248
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,720
Disarmament!

249
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,158
Long live the Bomb!

250
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:05,166
You could sell 'em
to the "Daily Worker"!

251
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,124
No more NATO bases!

252
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,840
Calm down!
No fighting! No provocation!

253
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,727
Ya just ease 'em away!
Ya don't push!

254
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,322
Leave 'em alone!

255
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:18,444
Calm down!

256
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,481
Don't provoke 'em!

257
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,004
Mr Lawyer!

258
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:27,438
Start now!
There's no more room up there!

259
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:29,648
Squeeze 'em in!

260
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,400
Get the speakers.

261
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:33,963
Ready?

262
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,562
I'll get 'em!

263
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,122
Go on in!

264
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:48,964
Let 'em in!

265
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:17,437
- So that's it!
- What?

266
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,960
The new opposition!
Women go for him!

267
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,244
Communist?

268
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,957
Never! He's anti-foreign!

269
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,120
Next elections, he'll win!

270
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,082
Good-looking!

271
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:35,076
Ex-Olympic champ, doc,
college prof and honest politician!

272
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,602
Perfection!

273
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:39,242
He's at the Bolshoï!

274
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:42,207
- He must cancel it!
- We back down!

275
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,836
To avoid provoking the crowd.

276
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,727
The students could maintain order.

277
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,085
- A free-for-all!
- You and your non-violence!

278
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:53,478
We must respect the law!

279
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,400
The law of the jungle!

280
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:59,397
They stuck us in that hall.
It's a trap!

281
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,326
Set by whom?

282
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:05,803
The ClA! We want
the foreign bases to be dismantled!

283
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,796
You think too much!
There are some stubborn extremists...

284
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,481
The threats?

285
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:15,608
It's not the 1 st time.
We've all taken risks.

286
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,042
They're all at the Bolshoï!

287
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,603
Keep trying.

288
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:24,522
The police must face
their responsibility.

289
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,088
We're going to our rally.

290
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,281
Rotten politicians!

291
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,918
We'll put ya in your graves!

292
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,281
We'll kill ya all!

293
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:40,197
Stay outside!

294
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,399
- And you?
- I'm a mason.

295
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,167
OK, let's go.

296
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,681
They hit me.

297
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,076
Why?

298
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:46,919
Why do our ideas

299
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,800
provoke such violence?

300
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,882
Why don't they like peace?

301
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,239
Why don't they attack
other organisations?

302
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,881
The answer is simple.

303
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:06,447
The others are nationalists,
used by the government

304
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:09,646
and don't upset
our Judas allies who betray us...

305
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,165
General, they're getting out of hand!

306
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,878
I'll have the loudspeakers cut off!

307
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:19,086
It'd excite the others.

308
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,198
Don't do that!

309
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,601
Where's the Chief of Police?

310
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,686
I was told he's here!

311
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,409
Really? He must be over there!

312
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:35,407
We lack hospitals and doctors

313
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:39,163
but half the budget
goes for military expenditures.

314
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,121
He's the one!

315
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,239
A cannon is fired

316
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:17,487
and a teacher's monthly salary
goes up in smoke!

317
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,801
That's why they can't

318
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:24,846
bear us or our meetings

319
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:28,683
and use hired thugs
to jeer and attack us!

320
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:34,445
Around the world. too many soldiers
are ready to fire

321
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:37,841
on anything moving toward progress.

322
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:39,961
He's your guy?

323
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,086
- You sure?
- I think.

324
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:44,045
An Olympic champ?

325
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:02,757
Stop!

326
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:09,567
Finish him off!

327
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,641
Shit! It's not him!

328
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,881
- I told ya it wasn't!
- They said it was!

329
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:25,803
Take off!

330
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,316
I'll go around to avoid the cops.

331
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,285
Tomatoes out of season!
They cost a fortune!

332
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,526
Fix your muffler!

333
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:51,726
I can't even make
the monthly payments!

334
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,562
Shit! The cops!

335
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,441
But our fight is theirs too!

336
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,805
We live
in a weak and corrupt society

337
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:13,359
where it's every man for himself.

338
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,999
It's blocked off here too! Hide!

339
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:20,525
Even imagination is suspect

340
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:25,000
yet it's needed
to solve world problems.

341
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:29,605
The stockpile of A-bombs is equal

342
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:33,637
to 1 ton of dynamite
per person on earth.

343
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,437
Horny again?

344
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:38,918
Yeah!

345
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:44,477
They want to prevent us
from reaching

346
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:49,438
the obvious political conclusions
based on these simple truths.

347
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,640
But we will speak out!

348
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:55,881
We serve the people
and the people need the truth.

349
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,842
Send them back to the Bolshoï!

350
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:06,964
The truth is the start
of powerful. united action.

351
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,679
Get those hoodlums out of here!

352
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:34,604
Down with the police state!

353
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,524
No more foreign bases!

354
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,120
Inspector!

355
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,286
Chief!

356
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,957
What're you waiting for?

357
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:23,839
Watch out!

358
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:47,086
Throw him off!

359
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:06,004
It's my cousin. He fell off!

360
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:09,127
By his feet!

361
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:13,841
I saw you hit him!

362
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:16,842
- What?
- What's going on?

363
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,767
I hit the brake
and my cousin fell off.

364
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:23,444
- He's bleeding and needs care.
- Your papers!

365
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,368
Just a moment...

366
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,961
Here they are!

367
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,648
He's bleeding! He needs care!

368
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:39,957
He hit him with a club!

369
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,047
See? It's nothing!

370
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,846
This is nothing?

371
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,887
- He tried to kill him!
- Dummy!

372
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,005
- My truck?
- lt'll be OK.

373
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:59,838
Call in for a patrol car.

374
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,442
Sure, call the station!

375
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:08,363
Stay there!

376
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,923
Look...

377
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm goin'.
Pretend to try and stop me.

378
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:28,080
I can't explain but I gotta go!
Just play dead!

379
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:29,921
One move and I'll slug you!

380
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:41,968
What time is it?
I got a date I can't miss!

381
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:00,364
The regime can't change that!

382
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:10,239
All the Russians want
is to live like Americans!

383
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,806
Quick, sir, it's serious!

384
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,880
Come with me!

385
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:34,121
The Attorney-General!

386
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,122
We'll talk later.

387
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:41,042
And the ballet?
I had to miss it!

388
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,483
Why wasn't I told?

389
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,480
During the performance? How?

390
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:48,244
- What is it?
- A stupid traffic accident!

391
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,717
The culprit?

392
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,608
We'll have him soon.

393
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:54,920
- The victim?
- The hospitaI'll tell us.

394
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:58,199
I'll go there in your car.

395
00:35:58,369 --> 00:35:59,563
Certainly!

396
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:02,084
Have the papers heard about it?

397
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:04,278
I doubt it.

398
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:08,039
I must call the Ministry!

399
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:18,128
Editorial room!

400
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,841
What on earth's wrong?

401
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:37,846
There was a demonstration.
We taught the bastards a lesson!

402
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:41,962
They hold a meeting?
Well, we can demonstrate too!

403
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,364
It's like a biological reaction.

404
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:50,604
Society's healthy elements,
the anti-bodies...

405
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,726
We beat the hell out of 'em!

406
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:55,240
What do you want from me?

407
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,203
Write...

408
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:01,648
...that I was there and beat 'em up!

409
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,003
What for?

410
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,966
So my pals'll know!

411
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:09,882
OK, if you want.
Get fixed up at the hospital

412
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,121
so they'll know
both sides were hurt!

413
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:17,279
Go now and I'll put
your name in the lead!

414
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:41,880
We warned you
but you said it was a hoax

415
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,045
- or a crackpot!
- Please!

416
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:47,485
This attempted killing
is your responsibility!

417
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:51,244
The police has proof
it was an accident.

418
00:37:55,689 --> 00:38:01,321
Go easy! We need their help!
Such unfounded accusations!

419
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:05,517
They're blind... or worse...
accomplices!

420
00:38:05,729 --> 00:38:08,038
They've no proof!

421
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,642
Assassination?

422
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:13,048
I was there taking pictures.

423
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,086
You got the truck?

424
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,520
No, I missed it!
The cops chased us away.

425
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:22,683
Such cynicism!
They'll use the incident politically!

426
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,205
- Surely!
- They know how to make martyrs!

427
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,837
Death-lovers!

428
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:30,364
Let's hope he doesn't die.

429
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,207
That would suit them!

430
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:39,521
The brain is damaged
in 2 or 3 spots. We're operating.

431
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:42,283
His heart is fighting hard

432
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,122
but it's too soon to say.

433
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,122
- But you must!
- He can't hear you.

434
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,519
You realise the political aspect?

435
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:53,157
But the other victim
is out of danger.

436
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:55,081
Other victim?

437
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,960
Senator Pirou.
He was found in the street.

438
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,165
It's serious but he's alright.

439
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:05,001
2 senators hurt!
Such incompetent police!

440
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:09,998
I must phone
the Minister in private!

441
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:16,878
His wife knows?

442
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,240
I don't eavesdrop!

443
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:20,798
I'm sure!

444
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,527
When's she coming?

445
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,242
Tomorrow, 1 st plane.

446
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,445
Tomorrow is today!

447
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,601
It's for my paper.

448
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,248
What did she say?

449
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:39,803
Nothing. I heard her breathing.

450
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:41,960
Then she said Will he live?

451
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,920
The director couldn't answer.

452
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:48,445
And she said
So they finally did it!

453
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:00,646
Were you there?

454
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,046
I'm a reporter...

455
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:11,961
I'm afraid the police bungled it!
I wanted no one hurt!

456
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,399
2 senators hurt... 1 critically!

457
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:15,922
We have the culprit!

458
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:17,921
Where? I want to see him!

459
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:20,080
He's in the canteen.

460
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,486
- The canteen!
- The cells are in poor condition.

461
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:29,086
No electricity!
So we use them for storage.

462
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:35,486
The Minister says this is serious
and a political catastrophe.

463
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,562
If the papers knew
he's in a canteen...!

464
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,687
The Minister wants
to be kept fully informed.

465
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:55,368
No handcuffs!

466
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:59,163
- His son?
- No, a street pedlar.

467
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,081
- Was he alone?
- No, 2 of them.

468
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,524
We have the end man's address.

469
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:06,408
It seems
he slept through the accident.

470
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,527
He gave himself up?

471
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:13,287
He was arrested for drunken driving.
You'll get a report.

472
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,637
Breathe!

473
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:20,763
- No alcohol!
- It's the stew.

474
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:23,802
Mutton stew kills all smells.

475
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,767
What have you been doing?

476
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:27,488
I made the stew!

477
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:33,803
He made it?
And you hid this from me!

478
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:36,603
I didn't know. I found out later.

479
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:40,166
You weren't told? Since when?

480
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,405
Since about 1 0:30 p.m.

481
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:45,209
That's harboring a criminal!

482
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:48,080
You knew about it, Col.?

483
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,482
I knew but...

484
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,198
...I hadn't had time
to tell the General.

485
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:54,962
Then you arrived.

486
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:58,485
The Gen. said
we didn't have the culprit

487
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,527
and I couldn't contradict him.

488
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:02,964
Fine!

489
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,925
I'll take his statement myself.

490
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,361
Get the 2nd culprit!

491
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:15,604
Eat!

492
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,279
They're at the presses!

493
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:39,281
Now what? You wear glasses now?

494
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:45,359
It's a disguise. Take my name
off the list. The guy's dyin'!

495
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:47,288
What's that to you?

496
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:52,045
Nothing! It was an accident!
2 drunks in a pickup truck!

497
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:56,407
If my name's in the paper,
I'll be questioned!

498
00:42:56,569 --> 00:42:58,321
I'll remove it!

499
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:02,008
Are you free now?

500
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:07,687
No, I can't. I'm busy.

501
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:10,608
You'll have to go.

502
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:13,838
That way!

503
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,281
No one is to move!

504
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:18,327
What do they want?

505
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:22,358
To start trouble. We refuse!

506
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:25,641
But how do you explain
it's always ours who are killed?

507
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,518
- He's alive!
- Clinically he's dead! Why dream?

508
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:32,081
Clinically dead!

509
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:37,841
The brain's destroyed
but the heart's beating!

510
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,443
It won't quit!

511
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,161
One word
and they'll tear up the town!

512
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:50,482
Why hold them back?
I wonder if we've any will to fight.

513
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:54,881
He had! That's why
they killed him! Not us!

514
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:56,243
Come on!

515
00:44:58,249 --> 00:44:59,762
It's all I could find.

516
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:05,241
The papers!
The cops put the blame on us!

517
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:06,484
Coffee?

518
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:10,404
"The broadcasting of the speech
was a provocation.

519
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:12,366
"The anti-national tone

520
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:17,649
"of the attack on foreign policy
aroused the crowd at once.

521
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:19,959
"Hence the violence.

522
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:23,280
"The police handled
the situation efficiently

523
00:45:23,649 --> 00:45:28,279
"yet 1 3 policemen
were injured in the course of duty."

524
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,004
So said the Gen. to the Press!

525
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:32,324
We must answer that!

526
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:36,687
Yes, and stress
the pacifist nature of our rally.

527
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:38,123
We had permission...

528
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:40,883
So the cops
could do a better job on us!

529
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:43,439
But we have no proof!

530
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:45,368
Nothing valid!

531
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,685
We can only deplore
the police's passiveness.

532
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:53,365
Later we'll underline
all the contradictions.

533
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:58,562
Why not call the Red Cross
or the Rights of Man Commission?

534
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,962
You're making a cry-baby defense!

535
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:06,161
We must attack
and expose those responsible!

536
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:08,889
- Take up arms in the streets?!
- Why not?

537
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,488
Anything goes?

538
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:12,322
We can consider...

539
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,128
Nothing at all! It must be legal!

540
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:18,680
- We've been legal for years!
- This is no time to change!

541
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,362
It's our only way!

542
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:23,282
Or the affair could backfire!

543
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:27,442
Aren't you ashamed?
He's dying in there!

544
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:34,559
We've no case against them!

545
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:37,562
And the threats on his life?

546
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,401
He too ignored them!

547
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:42,163
But that was yesterday!

548
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:46,283
Will your guy talk now?

549
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:48,400
Statement to the Press?

550
00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:00,645
I doubt it.
He was scared then of reprisals.

551
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:05,088
- And now, even more so!
- Try! Can you find him?

552
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:06,284
Not before noon.

553
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:08,567
We'll have to be careful.

554
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:12,081
We're being watched.

555
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,003
It's them!

556
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:18,606
But they're protecting us!
We're as safe as the doctor!

557
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:39,437
What was your reaction to the news?

558
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:43,968
The US President sent you a telegram?

559
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:45,638
Saying what?

560
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:47,726
Happily wed?

561
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:52,358
Was he threatened?

562
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:55,566
You'll let the Reds exploit this?

563
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:58,527
Was it an attempted assassination?

564
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,442
Why'd you send for a British surgeon?

565
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,209
Did you want a divorce?

566
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:06,361
Was it an accident?

567
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:17,529
They're operating...
for the 3rd time.

568
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,604
Here's the hospital director!

569
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:48,078
Your husband's had an accident.

570
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:58,002
I knew your husband.
We were at school together.

571
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,803
I wanted to go
to his peace marathon

572
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,806
but it was forbidden.

573
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,287
It's serious but he'll make it.

574
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:11,928
Prof. Dodd from London is here.

575
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,962
He's one of England's best surgeons.

576
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:19,404
Want to tell them the truth?
They'll live the truth later.

577
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:34,008
The fall broke
the dome of the skull

578
00:49:34,169 --> 00:49:37,081
and no doubt
the brain has been affected.

579
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:42,403
The shock was very violent causing
an explosion inside the skull

580
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:44,127
Iike an earthquake.

581
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,887
I can't evaluate the aftereffects

582
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:51,001
of the concussion,
even if the operation succeeds.

583
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:53,842
The 3rd operation has just begun.

584
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,967
His heart
is the only positive factor.

585
00:49:57,129 --> 00:50:01,042
We've massaged and used adrenaline

586
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:03,564
and its resistance is amazing.

587
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:05,361
It's beating regularly...

588
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:09,757
Come in.

589
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:15,085
Gen. Missou.

590
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:19,322
A stupid accident!
I'm deeply sorry...

591
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:21,047
Head of the Police...

592
00:50:21,249 --> 00:50:22,682
We have the culprit.

593
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:24,407
Attorney-Gen.

594
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:25,718
My sympathies...

595
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,082
The inquest judge...

596
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:44,718
Well...

597
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:49,237
...certain areas of the brain
have been affected

598
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,519
but the lesions can't be defined.

599
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,244
But the surgeons are optimistic.

600
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:57,362
We must await the end
of the 3rd operation.

601
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:00,324
Your husband's heart is exceptional.

602
00:51:00,649 --> 00:51:02,048
If it holds, he'll live!

603
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:05,327
We have every hope...

604
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,962
The capital is on the phone.
The Ministry!

605
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:42,448
They'll try to use his wife!
They'll use people's emotions!

606
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,797
The files!

607
00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:55,126
Their committee secretary.

608
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:57,726
I want résumés on each.

609
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:01,838
Details of their private lives
and jobs too!

610
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:03,886
For this evening!

611
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:05,761
The injured senator.

612
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:10,883
The other lawyer.

613
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,646
And his? Have it?

614
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:18,118
It just came.

615
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:24,321
Any love affairs?

616
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,559
I don't know, but there must be!

617
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:30,725
Break his halo!
Does he get along with his wife?

618
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:37,482
- Watching her?
- Like the others, General.

619
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:41,005
- 2 of our men...
- I don't want to know that!

620
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:45,923
They met this morning,
picked up his wife

621
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:47,682
then separated.

622
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:52,127
Some took his wife to the clinic.
As for this one...

623
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:53,842
He took a statement

624
00:52:54,009 --> 00:52:56,523
to the Press. You have a copy.

625
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:00,808
Then he saw some university students.

626
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:01,924
Students!

627
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:03,408
Call our students!

628
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:07,801
That one's a mad dog!
He wants to make the most of it!

629
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:09,766
- A Jew!
- Only half.

630
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:13,126
They think they're superior
even to other Jews!

631
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:17,204
- The Att.-Gen.!
- Good!

632
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:19,564
Stay on him night and day!

633
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:23,601
We were expecting you!

634
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,281
- The 2nd culprit?
- We have him.

635
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:29,280
He turned himself in.

636
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:31,280
Come into my office!

637
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:37,525
Please sit down.

638
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:42,957
He's boss now, officially.

639
00:53:43,569 --> 00:53:46,959
So you're to give him
your initial findings

640
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:49,518
and then follow his instructions.

641
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:53,477
- My deputy'll keep me posted.
- The Col.'s men have checked...

642
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:55,807
Can I see the 2nd culprit?

643
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:58,447
Whenever you want to!

644
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:03,128
It seems he was asleep
on the truck, dead drunk.

645
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:05,957
So he's innocent,
if it all checks out.

646
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:08,761
Their whereabouts earlier?

647
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:12,439
The driver's statement and photo.

648
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,559
They'd been drinking
at the Chinaman's bar.

649
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:20,441
We have Chinese tradesmen in town?

650
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:25,524
The owner was in the Korean War
and now he's called the Chinaman.

651
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:27,600
He backs them up.

652
00:54:27,928 --> 00:54:30,318
I'll read his statement.

653
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:36,239
"l, Bertrand... alias the Chinaman...
etc... bar owner... etc...

654
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:40,243
"do state
that on 22 May of this year,

655
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:44,245
"Yago and Vago
came into my bar at 7 p.m.

656
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:47,129
"and stayed until 1 0 p.m.

657
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:50,048
"They were drinking Pernod."

658
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,361
It's not allowed, Madam.

659
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:31,358
1 3th witness, a docker...

660
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:35,005
"l saw Yago and Vago
drinking Pernod all evening.

661
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:38,047
"They left at 1 0 p.m. drunk.

662
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:41,440
"The Chinaman said
Not in the Kamikaze!"

663
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:42,957
Kamikaze?

664
00:55:43,928 --> 00:55:47,126
The pickup truck. It's Japanese made.

665
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,277
You'd think we're in the Far East!

666
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:53,361
I think it's clear.

667
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:56,879
Though we lack some details
on the culprits,

668
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:00,321
- it's obviously an accident.
- I agree.

669
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:05,205
Besides, the Minister phoned
and wants this settled very quickly

670
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:08,918
to cut short
political speculation abroad.

671
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:13,042
I think the prosecutor
must make a statement

672
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:17,487
about the accident today
and say the culprits are caught

673
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:21,961
and accused of drunken driving
and assault and battery.

674
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:24,082
And wilful flight.

675
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:25,682
Naturally!

676
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:29,598
And the man
who took him to the clinic?

677
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:33,767
It's for you.

678
00:56:40,928 --> 00:56:42,328
He just died.

679
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:53,044
That doesn't change the statement.

680
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,839
Instead of "assault and battery",

681
00:56:56,009 --> 00:56:59,081
say "manslaughter".

682
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:17,041
Go away, Shoula.

683
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:21,688
I'll wait for you.

684
00:59:53,529 --> 00:59:54,644
Who are you?

685
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:57,846
An admirer of your husband.
A reporter.

686
00:59:58,009 --> 00:59:58,998
No photos!

687
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:05,563
Only a few questions!
The public has a right to know!

688
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:15,401
Was it an accident?
Or not at all?

689
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:20,600
Yesterday his life was threatened.
Did you know?

690
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:23,282
You expected it?

691
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:27,280
You said So they finally did it!

692
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,407
What did I say?

693
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:35,806
To the hospital director

694
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:39,598
you said So they finally did it!
Who're they?

695
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:41,484
Go away!

696
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:45,524
The culprits have been arrested.
You thought of them?

697
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:48,803
Go away!

698
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:08,522
They know already?

699
01:01:08,928 --> 01:01:11,238
Yes, and it's only beginning!

700
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:17,686
Unmask the killers!

701
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:55,599
The police is an accomplice!

702
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,988
Wait, I don't understand!
The fall didn't kill him?

703
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:28,469
Not at all.
The skull fracture

704
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,199
was due to a blow
struck on the head.

705
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:36,798
That's our conclusion.
The fall caused minor bruises.

706
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,472
You're sure?

707
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:41,872
A blow? You mean by the truck?

708
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,237
The truck hit his body.
It wasn't serious.

709
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,311
The death blow hit his skull

710
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,994
and was made by an instrument

711
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:54,231
such as a club,
an iron bar or a gun butt.

712
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,718
But no one's mentioned a weapon.

713
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,070
Continue, Doctor.

714
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:08,268
The skull fracture can only be due
to a weapon that struck from above.

715
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:13,758
That's the sole condition that causes
symmetrical lesions on the brain

716
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:19,869
touching the subjacent area
and the area opposite the wound.

717
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:22,109
An autopsy showed the lesions,

718
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,953
the right cerebral hemorrhage

719
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,475
and the fracture of the left temple.

720
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,233
In the case of a shock

721
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:35,792
due to a fall
on a hard surface like the street,

722
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,513
such lesions couldn't exist.

723
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:40,915
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

724
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:43,034
Yesterday!

725
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,588
Mr Deputy, he was still alive!

726
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:47,192
We needed an autopsy.

727
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,715
Time for other tests
would've shown the same facts.

728
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:54,553
Another hypothesis is
if the truck dragged him,

729
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,109
his skull could've hit the curb.

730
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:01,113
It's a fact that he was hit
in the middle of the street.

731
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,632
Then a fall couldn't cause
such lesions.

732
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:07,553
- A phone?
- Next door.

733
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:11,077
Yago was driving.

734
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:15,198
The 2nd man was drunk
and couldn't have been so precise.

735
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:17,270
A demonstrator.

736
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,398
Their story's odd.

737
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,754
- Know them well?
- Very well!

738
01:04:21,919 --> 01:04:23,272
Political?

739
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:25,118
Maybe.

740
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,352
- Communists?
- Not if they work here!

741
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:30,397
The opposition?

742
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,992
One never knows.

743
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:35,238
The General, please.

744
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:40,633
I wanted to see you
to clarify a few points.

745
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,359
It all seems clear enough to me!

746
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,111
A new fact has come up.

747
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:47,511
It's stuffy in here!

748
01:04:49,439 --> 01:04:51,350
You saw the accident?

749
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:53,512
How did it happen?

750
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,511
In what respect?

751
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:58,876
When the truck arrived,
what happened?

752
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:02,437
The Col. and I were there

753
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:06,115
when he walked out
waving to the crowd.

754
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:08,470
They didn't applaud him either!

755
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:13,595
He didn't see the truck
zigzagging toward him

756
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,033
and he was hit!

757
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:19,067
The Col.'s men ran after the truck.
2 men drew their guns

758
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,317
but, due to the crowd,
they didn't fire.

759
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,991
The truck zigzagged

760
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:27,950
and finally got away!

761
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,678
The police cleared the square

762
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,991
and helped put the victim
into a VW to go to the hospital.

763
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,594
No trace of the VW driver?

764
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:41,592
Not yet but he must be
a friend of theirs.

765
01:05:41,759 --> 01:05:44,114
He helped them at once.

766
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,237
When the victim was run over,
could his head

767
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,276
have hit the curb?

768
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,835
No, it occurred in the square!

769
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:56,189
- You're sure?
- Positive!

770
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,949
But what's this new fact?

771
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:03,799
The autopsy says
he was killed by a club.

772
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:07,998
A club? Why did the doctors
do an autopsy?

773
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:10,236
It's the legal procedure.

774
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:14,194
Yesterday it was all settled!
Now you'll foul us up...

775
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,307
A new witness.
He claims he has proof

776
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,231
the senator was assassinated.

777
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,752
He'll be here today at 2 p.m.

778
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:39,710
There you are! An assassination!
Soon they'll say it was a plot!

779
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,030
I saw him! He's drunk!

780
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,595
He nearly fell in front of the truck!

781
01:07:27,678 --> 01:07:30,113
What happened? You saw it?

782
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,190
Yes, he slipped and fell.

783
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,118
Anybody here?

784
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,192
Anybody here?

785
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:47,072
I'm the Chief of Police.

786
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:53,108
I was on my way to testify
and as I walked along...

787
01:08:53,318 --> 01:08:56,356
You fell and hit your head.

788
01:08:57,278 --> 01:08:59,509
You suffer from epilepsy?

789
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,715
Someone hit me!
I was on my way to testify

790
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,870
the senator was assassinated!

791
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:11,188
It was no accident!
Yago told me so himself!

792
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:13,592
I was gonna testify!

793
01:09:13,919 --> 01:09:18,549
But someone hit me on the head...
from a truck... with a club...

794
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,474
...to keep me quiet.
They tried to kill me!

795
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:25,715
I don't know who told you
to say this, or why.

796
01:09:26,358 --> 01:09:27,951
I don't want to know.

797
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:33,034
We can forget all this.
Let's say you were influenced.

798
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:39,151
You're almost one of the family.
Your cousin's a policeman,

799
01:09:39,318 --> 01:09:42,914
brother-in-law's got
a government job. Forget all this.

800
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,796
They're coming!

801
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,316
If you need anything,
come and see me.

802
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:50,550
I'll drop by again.

803
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:58,876
I'm a bachelor and live with my ma.

804
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:01,997
- Profession?
- I got a varnish shop.

805
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,592
You know Yago?

806
01:10:03,759 --> 01:10:06,068
Sure! He makes
deliveries for me!

807
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:09,432
The other 2 I don't know.
The killing...

808
01:10:09,599 --> 01:10:11,237
The accident.

809
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,072
...was the day I phoned Yago

810
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:16,354
about a delivery.

811
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:20,796
Varnished coffins! And I can't
even pay off my Kamikaze!

812
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,870
Come back this afternoon.

813
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:24,313
I'll be busy.

814
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,914
- Tonight then.
- I'm busy too.

815
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:31,827
I'm gonna make a real big mistake.
It'll be a murder.

816
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,948
Next day I learned
he'd killed the senator.

817
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:37,756
Yago told you all that?

818
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:39,510
You belong to the party?

819
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,831
I never belonged to any party!
I like soccer!

820
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:46,879
What is this?
The Gen. says I'm epileptic!

821
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,509
- General?
- The Chief of Police!

822
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,111
- He was here?
- Just before you came.

823
01:10:54,278 --> 01:10:59,034
But I'm no epileptic
and never belonged to any party!

824
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:04,675
- Go on about Yago.
- That's all. He left.

825
01:11:05,639 --> 01:11:07,675
He's the lucky one!

826
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:10,675
What about the delivery?

827
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:14,707
I tried to set him straight
but he does as he pleases.

828
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,916
Who told you to call
the inquest judge?

829
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:21,827
No one! I saw Yago's picture
in the papers!

830
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:24,513
On the front page,
like a Minister!

831
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:27,639
- Jealous?
- You made up this tale.

832
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:30,393
No, someone advised him.

833
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,595
Even Ma was against it!

834
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:34,238
She said to keep quiet!

835
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:36,832
- Come and eat.
- He killed him.

836
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:39,308
- Who?
- A senator.

837
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:42,039
- In the government?
- No, a leftist!

838
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:45,271
He did right!
What's it to you?

839
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,191
His picture too!

840
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:52,232
- Eat and let 'em kill each other!
- Not hungry!

841
01:11:52,398 --> 01:11:54,867
Later my sister came.

842
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:57,269
So you wanna be a big shot?

843
01:11:57,599 --> 01:11:59,317
Just doin' my duty.

844
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:02,711
Your duty's to see to your family!

845
01:12:02,879 --> 01:12:06,588
I always have!
Ya got an idiot who sees to you!

846
01:12:06,759 --> 01:12:09,512
Don't call my husband an idiot!

847
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,273
Ya think they'll give ya a medal.

848
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:17,916
I came anyway. Or I would've
if they hadn't slugged me!

849
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:19,631
You didn't fall?

850
01:12:19,799 --> 01:12:23,997
I'd have to be an acrobat
to land on my head!

851
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,835
You can sign a statement later
if you still want to.

852
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:30,314
Of course! I'm not crazy!

853
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:34,835
1 st witness for the prosecution?
They lost no time!

854
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:38,196
Tomorrow you'll have 1 0, then 1 5.

855
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:41,430
They'll say Yago did this or that...
anything!

856
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:43,829
Vague, worthless statements

857
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:47,992
that'll create unrest!
They sent him

858
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,834
and beat him up
to turn a witness into a martyr!

859
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:53,671
They left him hospitalised

860
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,836
yet able to talk!

861
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:59,036
You admit I was beaten
and didn't fall?

862
01:12:59,358 --> 01:13:01,429
You realise what perjury means?

863
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,076
It's not perjury!
I wanted to help, but if I'd known...

864
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:13,590
Told ya so! Why'd ya get involved?
Weren't ya alright at home?

865
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:17,747
Eat!

866
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:23,388
Suppose you say
you slipped on an orange peel?

867
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:24,957
I didn't slip!

868
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:29,675
Why're ya so pigheaded?
Listen to me for once!

869
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:32,308
The 1 st and last time!

870
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:35,277
- Like always!
- Really the last time!

871
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:40,394
Say you slipped and we got
no troubles. You won't go to prison.

872
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:45,271
I'll send others to prison!
I got 'em!

873
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:47,669
Yago and his picture!

874
01:13:48,278 --> 01:13:50,997
Who sent ya?
The cops or your daughter?

875
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,514
Yes, it's me!
Ya wanna ruin my home?

876
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:57,113
Mama, leave!

877
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:58,633
Leave us alone!

878
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:04,309
- Don't argue!
- Go outside!

879
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:09,273
Ya hate me
'cause I've succeeded in life!

880
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:11,669
You and your husband hate me!

881
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,514
Never mind him!
You've caused him enough trouble!

882
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:18,353
Ya wanna ruin my life!

883
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:22,791
When Papa died,
I hoped you'd take his place.

884
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:29,108
I needed protection. You neglected me
and never took me anywhere!

885
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:34,148
You preferred soccer... and slobs
like Yago! See what it's got ya!

886
01:14:34,358 --> 01:14:37,271
Prison, maybe... for perjury!

887
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:40,710
And my husband'll lose his job!

888
01:14:41,318 --> 01:14:43,912
Come here... Listen!

889
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,027
You hear a guy's gonna be killed.
Ya don't believe it.

890
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:53,474
Then ya hear he's dead.
Would you tell the cops?

891
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,836
That's all I did, to help them.

892
01:14:57,238 --> 01:14:58,388
Help who?

893
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:00,834
To help the cops find the murderer.

894
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:03,992
You're helping the others!

895
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:07,037
What do you want?

896
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:11,554
Your mother sent me. I'm a reporter.

897
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:16,071
I'll tell you what truly happened
'cause you print just anything!

898
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:17,592
Sure?

899
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:23,157
He wasn't hit. Either he slipped
or felt dizzy and fell

900
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:26,390
or else leftists hit him
to create trouble.

901
01:15:26,559 --> 01:15:27,992
So say the police!

902
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,309
They say he's crazy
but can't prove it. Can you?

903
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:34,393
- No, I can't!
- Then why try?

904
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:39,438
I never said that!
He's stubborn as a mule!

905
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,911
He never changes his mind!

906
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,754
If he doesn't,
the inquest'll continue!

907
01:15:46,398 --> 01:15:50,711
What if he is crazy?
And had epilepsy as a baby?

908
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,349
Tell him you and your husband
are rightwingers

909
01:15:54,519 --> 01:15:56,474
and how ya got your jobs!

910
01:15:57,358 --> 01:16:00,192
Yes, I do belong!

911
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:04,997
The cop!

912
01:16:06,799 --> 01:16:09,028
- She woke him.
- Sleeping?

913
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:11,796
Pictures?

914
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:14,393
For the Press?

915
01:16:15,799 --> 01:16:17,117
That's no good!

916
01:16:17,278 --> 01:16:21,272
But that way people'll see
you were slugged

917
01:16:21,519 --> 01:16:24,670
to keep you from saying
something important. See?

918
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:26,590
They'll beat me again?

919
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:30,235
They won't dare!
You're famous now!

920
01:16:30,559 --> 01:16:33,119
But the Press must talk about you!

921
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:36,907
Tell me who saw you here...
your sister, the judge...

922
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,673
The General! He can't stand me!

923
01:16:39,879 --> 01:16:42,598
I wanted to help
and got a cold shoulder!

924
01:16:42,759 --> 01:16:44,954
They asked if I was a Commie!

925
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:48,231
- Are you?
- No! I only like soccer!

926
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:51,470
We'll be on the front page
for a week!

927
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,308
Sorry!

928
01:17:06,278 --> 01:17:07,155
Who was it?

929
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,273
I know him!

930
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:32,195
And you're a cardiac case?

931
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:36,956
It's an old fracture!

932
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:41,952
Name and profession?

933
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:47,357
Any convictions?

934
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:52,436
- 4 times.
- 4!

935
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,393
Yes, 4!
Carrying arms illegally,

936
01:17:55,559 --> 01:18:00,791
public outrage,
theft... and rape.

937
01:18:01,839 --> 01:18:03,067
Rape?

938
01:18:04,839 --> 01:18:08,115
Not really!
I was counselor at a boy scout camp.

939
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,116
Why were you in the hospital?

940
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:17,514
The Head of Security put him there.
My client has a weak heart.

941
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,795
The police doctor certified it.

942
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:24,277
I know but why the plaster cast

943
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:26,630
and a cane like a club?

944
01:18:26,839 --> 01:18:32,550
It's 'cause of an old fracture.
I was broke when it happened.

945
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:37,117
I needed X-rays and 1 0 days in bed.
2 days of no work

946
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:41,193
and I starve!
It was a rich man's fracture!

947
01:18:42,278 --> 01:18:47,751
The rich get a cold.
A week in bed!

948
01:18:47,919 --> 01:18:51,354
For the poor, a fracture means
work or the grave!

949
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:54,671
So I had it seen to
while I was in the hospital!

950
01:18:55,278 --> 01:18:56,951
Where were you that night?

951
01:18:57,959 --> 01:19:00,951
At the Chinaman's with Yago till 1 0.

952
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,758
You see Yago often?

953
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:06,514
We're friends and cousins.

954
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,273
Was he drunk?

955
01:19:08,599 --> 01:19:10,988
Yago drinks a lot!

956
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:16,589
The Chinaman told him
not to take the Kamikaze.

957
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:19,872
I got in back and fell asleep.

958
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:22,718
The shock and the yells woke me.

959
01:19:23,519 --> 01:19:27,148
I thought we were in a ditch
but we were still going!

960
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:33,635
Then a guy leaped onto the Kamikaze
as lithe and fierce as a tiger.

961
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:38,068
He grabbed me and threw me off!
In the street!

962
01:19:38,559 --> 01:19:40,151
He leaped like...?

963
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,116
- A tiger.
- Before that?

964
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:47,071
Lithe and fierce.

965
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:51,832
Yago used the same words.

966
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:54,755
Yet he didn't see him.

967
01:19:55,839 --> 01:20:00,514
A simple coincidence!
They haven't met since the accident.

968
01:20:00,919 --> 01:20:02,432
The police can swear to it.

969
01:20:04,358 --> 01:20:05,474
Continue!

970
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,789
I was in the street
and almost got run over!

971
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:11,994
Then?

972
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,796
I went home.

973
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,593
Next day when I read the papers,

974
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:19,432
I went to the cops
who put me in hospital.

975
01:20:19,599 --> 01:20:25,071
There he got lost in the halls
and met that reporter...

976
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:26,838
...by accident.

977
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:30,997
That agrees with the other testimony.

978
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:34,915
Yet one phrase makes me wonder.

979
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:37,947
It could change my investigation.

980
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:40,388
You're a Red!

981
01:20:41,799 --> 01:20:43,835
You and Yago too!

982
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,707
Something you said
makes me think so.

983
01:20:48,799 --> 01:20:50,790
"The rich get a cold. A week in bed!

984
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:54,110
"For the poor, a fracture
means work or the grave."

985
01:20:54,318 --> 01:20:56,628
You gave yourself away.

986
01:20:56,799 --> 01:20:58,278
I hate the communists!

987
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,635
Words! I want proof!

988
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:03,189
Only a Red would say such a thing.

989
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:06,555
I belong to an anti-communist group.

990
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:07,787
Yago too!

991
01:21:07,999 --> 01:21:08,749
What one?

992
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,987
CROC! Christian Royalist
Organisation on Communism!

993
01:21:23,919 --> 01:21:25,750
You created a storm!

994
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:31,028
Vago's jailed for collusion
and that means premeditation!

995
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,916
The judge believed you
and found out...

996
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:39,236
Vago and Yago belong
to a secret society!

997
01:21:39,398 --> 01:21:42,470
- Secret?
- Yes, the CROC!

998
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:44,829
Anybody knows that!

999
01:21:44,999 --> 01:21:47,991
The cops use 'em
to keep order at parades!

1000
01:21:49,759 --> 01:21:51,670
You've nothing to fear now.

1001
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:55,434
But in a year I'll be forgotten.

1002
01:21:55,599 --> 01:21:57,430
No one can touch you.

1003
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:02,517
Know anyone
who'd show me CROC members?

1004
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,468
I'd pay.

1005
01:22:04,959 --> 01:22:07,836
- Sure, it's them!
- So help me!

1006
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:11,548
Know anyone?

1007
01:22:11,919 --> 01:22:13,113
Yes.

1008
01:22:14,599 --> 01:22:16,669
But don't say I told ya!

1009
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:18,113
It's Dumas!

1010
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:20,670
He was born in Russia.

1011
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:25,671
CROC's got a hold on him
'cause of trouble with his brother.

1012
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:29,157
He'd like to get to Germany,

1013
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:32,951
so if you can get him
a passport...

1014
01:22:36,358 --> 01:22:40,068
I can get one through my newspaper.

1015
01:22:41,398 --> 01:22:42,878
- Pictures?
- Here.

1016
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,911
I've kept my promise.

1017
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,992
Now it's your turn.

1018
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:58,907
Don't like it?

1019
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:00,637
Sure!

1020
01:23:03,519 --> 01:23:04,793
The questions?

1021
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,827
Does CROC meet regularly?

1022
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,513
Where?

1023
01:23:12,519 --> 01:23:15,875
At a guy's place on the edge of town.

1024
01:23:16,318 --> 01:23:17,991
Are there many of you?

1025
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:19,758
Sometimes.

1026
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:23,916
- What goes on?
- The boss talks.

1027
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:30,394
Religion and the monarchy are
the 2 pillars of our eternal land

1028
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,156
and Western Christian civilisation.

1029
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,227
If ya don't listen, ya get no work.

1030
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:39,867
What else?

1031
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:43,747
In Russia a worker can't strike
or believe in God

1032
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:46,193
or have his own house and garden.

1033
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:49,277
He's crushed
by a totalitarian regime.

1034
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:50,794
You agree?

1035
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:55,474
I even read it in the papers.
The individual belongs to the State.

1036
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:58,552
Yago went to the meetings?

1037
01:23:58,759 --> 01:24:01,637
Always.
They'd talk about capitalists.

1038
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:06,430
No more capitalists or workers
or Left or Right.

1039
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:09,159
A unified people is what we need!

1040
01:24:09,318 --> 01:24:11,116
We need a clean sweep!

1041
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:13,997
Starting with the intellectual scum!

1042
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,831
The bookstore next door!

1043
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:20,510
He'd talk
about political youth groups.

1044
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:22,715
What'd he say?

1045
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,032
Unite the youth...

1046
01:24:25,358 --> 01:24:27,747
And give them a common ideal!

1047
01:24:27,919 --> 01:24:31,434
Abroad, some say
"Make love, not war!"

1048
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:33,874
We say "Make war

1049
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:37,394
"on corruption and on liberalism

1050
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:40,153
"and on indiscriminate liberty!"

1051
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:43,588
I say OK, but I don't give a damn.

1052
01:24:43,759 --> 01:24:44,747
And Yago?

1053
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:48,798
He agrees 'cause he wants
to pay off his Kamikaze.

1054
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:51,514
Now he'll be able to. Easy!

1055
01:24:52,278 --> 01:24:53,871
He killed the senator?

1056
01:24:54,039 --> 01:24:56,348
You said no accusations!

1057
01:24:57,398 --> 01:24:58,718
No, I'm paying!

1058
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,068
Never!

1059
01:25:00,759 --> 01:25:03,876
But you can point 'em out to me
for some photos!

1060
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,911
That's what you wanted?

1061
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:09,595
The 3 on the pickup...

1062
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:14,034
The butcher's involved.

1063
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:18,755
The fat guy owns the bar
where we meet.

1064
01:25:19,879 --> 01:25:21,278
The barber.

1065
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,595
The mechanic and the 2 in black.

1066
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:29,113
- In khaki...
- Him?

1067
01:25:29,759 --> 01:25:32,910
An ex-boxer
who lived in the US a while.

1068
01:25:33,159 --> 01:25:37,789
In the yard, the boss... an officer
during the German occupation.

1069
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:42,952
The fig seller, a loud mouth, always
up in front for the rough stuff!

1070
01:25:55,839 --> 01:25:57,397
Some figs, please.

1071
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:12,796
He sells his blood and gets
a good price in case of emergencies.

1072
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:16,434
He got rich selling
one of his eyes to an American.

1073
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:19,273
He doesn't attend meetings anymore.

1074
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:21,629
His sight's bad so he sells blood.

1075
01:26:23,759 --> 01:26:24,952
Not him?

1076
01:26:25,759 --> 01:26:26,874
Him?

1077
01:26:28,398 --> 01:26:29,593
Them?

1078
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:34,713
No?

1079
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:37,354
It looks like him...

1080
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,472
He hit me twice!

1081
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:41,390
Even in the ambulance!

1082
01:26:41,599 --> 01:26:43,749
Write that in the margin!

1083
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:47,195
Publish it in your paper!

1084
01:26:47,759 --> 01:26:49,590
Sign the caption!

1085
01:26:51,519 --> 01:26:52,668
Publish it!

1086
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:56,037
But not in your paper!
In a big daily paper!

1087
01:26:56,278 --> 01:26:57,678
For more readers...

1088
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,437
- And money!
- Money!

1089
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,956
In my paper tomorrow! I'll give
the inquest judge my photos.

1090
01:27:05,398 --> 01:27:08,277
Don't you want to be efficient?

1091
01:27:08,679 --> 01:27:11,671
In a local leftist paper,
no one'll see it!

1092
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:14,592
In mine, it's sensational news!

1093
01:27:17,079 --> 01:27:18,558
Ya recognised me?

1094
01:27:18,759 --> 01:27:21,273
Ya dishonored me!

1095
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:24,397
Ya made me out to be a gangster!

1096
01:27:24,559 --> 01:27:28,871
I wasn't at that demonstration!
I got nothin' to do with politics!

1097
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:31,030
Politics are a lot of crap!

1098
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:32,314
Let him be!

1099
01:27:34,398 --> 01:27:35,593
Leave!

1100
01:27:40,358 --> 01:27:42,077
I'm the judge.

1101
01:27:44,198 --> 01:27:45,075
Well?

1102
01:27:45,318 --> 01:27:47,787
I'm on the front page!

1103
01:27:48,318 --> 01:27:52,835
Mr Pirou says I hit him
at the demonstration!

1104
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:55,751
I wasn't there! I got witnesses!

1105
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:58,558
Politics are a lot of crap!

1106
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,474
I was at the market with my figs!

1107
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:04,358
Your picture's in what paper?

1108
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,312
I forget! It arrives

1109
01:28:08,519 --> 01:28:10,714
from the capital at 1 0:00!

1110
01:28:12,318 --> 01:28:15,037
I can't read... very easy.

1111
01:28:17,238 --> 01:28:20,834
The news vendor showed it to me
and read it to me!

1112
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:24,635
At the market
they think I'm a hoodlum!

1113
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,991
I wanted an explanation, man to man!

1114
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:30,070
From the capital?

1115
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:31,827
Still recognise me?

1116
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:34,068
I said, what paper?

1117
01:28:37,358 --> 01:28:40,430
The papers that arrive
from the capital at 1 0:00.

1118
01:28:40,759 --> 01:28:44,831
This morning they didn't.
The mail plane was fogged in.

1119
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:48,155
Who told you to say all this?

1120
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:04,314
Yes...

1121
01:29:05,719 --> 01:29:07,197
I hit him.

1122
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:08,428
But...

1123
01:29:10,919 --> 01:29:14,275
...I had to!
Somebody forced me to!

1124
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:16,077
Who? His name?

1125
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:21,629
I can't tell you. He's too big!

1126
01:29:23,318 --> 01:29:26,277
Too important! I can't!

1127
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:28,796
He told me about it.

1128
01:29:29,599 --> 01:29:33,796
Barone, your picture's
in one of the capital's papers!

1129
01:29:33,959 --> 01:29:35,108
Mine?

1130
01:29:35,278 --> 01:29:37,839
One that arrives at 1 0!
So at 1 0:45

1131
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:40,831
you go see Pirou at the hospital.

1132
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:43,872
Raise hell! Say you're innocent!

1133
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:46,075
Scream and shout!

1134
01:29:46,519 --> 01:29:50,113
Reporters'll be there.
Now tell me again?

1135
01:29:50,278 --> 01:29:52,156
I rush to the hospital...

1136
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:53,751
Get outta here!

1137
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,148
...to see Pirou.

1138
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:57,590
But tell me his name!

1139
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,397
I can't! He's too big!

1140
01:29:59,559 --> 01:30:02,630
Alright. Follow me, please.

1141
01:30:07,799 --> 01:30:11,586
I'm innocent!
I only wanted to testify!

1142
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:14,155
It's all leftwing politics!

1143
01:30:14,679 --> 01:30:17,557
This important man...

1144
01:30:18,398 --> 01:30:19,626
He helped you?

1145
01:30:19,799 --> 01:30:22,756
Yes, in my work and for my birds.

1146
01:30:22,919 --> 01:30:27,197
They wake the neighbors.
I was gonna have to move!

1147
01:30:27,358 --> 01:30:31,750
But my birds are pretty!
You should see 'em, Judge!

1148
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:35,032
He helped me in my work too.

1149
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:38,157
My market permit and all that.

1150
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:41,515
The day of the accident
you saw him?

1151
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,598
Yes, Jimmy said
"The head's downstairs."

1152
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:48,832
He was in his car.

1153
01:30:48,999 --> 01:30:49,988
Get in!

1154
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:56,717
You know it's tonight?

1155
01:30:57,198 --> 01:30:58,552
Impossible!

1156
01:30:58,799 --> 01:31:00,390
I got some figs due in!

1157
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,438
They gotta be uncrated.

1158
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:07,626
To sell them, you need a stand?

1159
01:31:07,799 --> 01:31:08,867
I got one.

1160
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,791
And you need a permit?

1161
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:12,588
I got one.

1162
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:15,193
But for how much longer?

1163
01:31:15,799 --> 01:31:18,597
- 6 months.
- And who renews permits?

1164
01:31:20,278 --> 01:31:21,836
He does?

1165
01:31:21,999 --> 01:31:23,068
Yes.

1166
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:25,597
Then he dropped us off.

1167
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,514
Do a good job tonight.
I'm counting on you.

1168
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:35,231
You'll get a permanent permit and
maybe a new house, for your birds!

1169
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:40,956
I said "Colonel, I'll do my best."

1170
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,717
The police colonel?

1171
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:47,034
Yes!

1172
01:31:49,238 --> 01:31:51,799
Let's start at the beginning.

1173
01:31:54,559 --> 01:31:56,709
Can you come in, Deputy?

1174
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:01,356
Prolonging the inquest

1175
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:04,948
gives the opposition
fuel for subversive action.

1176
01:32:05,358 --> 01:32:08,476
- You've sided with them?
- It's not a prolongation.

1177
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,675
It's a totally new case.

1178
01:32:11,358 --> 01:32:15,193
Some points are awkward
but the case is clear!

1179
01:32:15,559 --> 01:32:16,753
On the contrary.

1180
01:32:16,919 --> 01:32:19,831
We began with an accident
and 2 drunks...

1181
01:32:19,999 --> 01:32:21,717
Some ice, dear!

1182
01:32:23,358 --> 01:32:26,510
Their testimony
coincides in detail.

1183
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,108
Confirmed by the Chinaman!

1184
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:34,595
Next day, the autopsy says
death was due to a blow by a club.

1185
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,675
A 2nd autopsy will say no,

1186
01:32:36,839 --> 01:32:40,751
and a confirmation'll disprove
the initial autopsy!

1187
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:42,592
I'd had no time

1188
01:32:42,799 --> 01:32:44,517
to examine this new theory

1189
01:32:44,679 --> 01:32:48,273
when a witness says
it was an assassination.

1190
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:50,714
Based on a vague discussion!

1191
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:55,589
On his way to see me,
the witness is clubbed

1192
01:32:55,919 --> 01:32:58,638
- and is still in the hospital!
- What do you mean?

1193
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:01,398
I'm only stating facts.

1194
01:33:02,879 --> 01:33:07,952
Then comes the reporter. He's not
a militant and that's important!

1195
01:33:08,119 --> 01:33:13,637
I learn
Yago and Vago belong to CROC,

1196
01:33:13,999 --> 01:33:15,830
the Christian Royalist...

1197
01:33:15,999 --> 01:33:17,352
I know, I know...

1198
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,037
...along with the assailant
of the 2nd senator

1199
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:23,588
and most of those
at the demonstration.

1200
01:33:23,759 --> 01:33:27,229
It seems the police know
and use them as auxiliaries

1201
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:30,157
to maintain order for state visits.

1202
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:32,351
That's yet to be proven,

1203
01:33:32,519 --> 01:33:35,430
Iike the fact
that the Police Col.

1204
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:38,557
drove this man
to the demonstration.

1205
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:39,595
Really!

1206
01:33:39,799 --> 01:33:42,791
He wouldn't be involved
with such a person!

1207
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:46,474
Not openly! No one'll believe it!

1208
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,677
My conclusion is this:

1209
01:33:50,799 --> 01:33:54,553
As a case of drunken driving,
it's simple

1210
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,152
but impossible.

1211
01:33:56,879 --> 01:34:02,112
If we accept
the premeditated act of a group

1212
01:34:02,278 --> 01:34:05,271
aided or simply abetted
by the police,

1213
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,907
it all becomes clear
and fits together.

1214
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:13,077
This is serious!
I must phone the Minister!

1215
01:34:13,759 --> 01:34:16,796
I favor the accident theory.

1216
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:21,871
Premeditated, if you wish
by 2 drunken fanatics.

1217
01:34:23,759 --> 01:34:25,510
Yes, you don't smoke!

1218
01:34:26,358 --> 01:34:28,919
You must settle this quickly!

1219
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:34,835
The country, even the whole world
is watching and waiting.

1220
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,514
Our country's honor is at stake!

1221
01:34:38,959 --> 01:34:41,028
Don't bother with these fools!

1222
01:34:41,358 --> 01:34:46,273
Your future lies before you!
This case can either make...

1223
01:34:47,278 --> 01:34:48,951
...or break your career!

1224
01:34:50,278 --> 01:34:52,076
Trust in my experience!

1225
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:58,157
My group is authorised by the State.

1226
01:34:58,358 --> 01:35:03,035
We are honest citizens,
healthy elements of Society,

1227
01:35:03,318 --> 01:35:06,470
anti-bodies
in the fight against infection.

1228
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,312
We want to protect

1229
01:35:09,559 --> 01:35:13,518
Western Christian civilisation.
But it is a moral struggle.

1230
01:35:13,879 --> 01:35:18,872
No members of my group
were at the demonstration.

1231
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,271
Where were you that night?

1232
01:35:21,999 --> 01:35:25,309
I was at the Dockers' Union.

1233
01:35:26,919 --> 01:35:28,238
Alibi confirmed.

1234
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:33,108
I was playing cards with my dentist.

1235
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:34,555
Confirmed.

1236
01:35:34,759 --> 01:35:38,388
I'm a baker.
I slept till midnight at my shop!

1237
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,072
Alibi confirmed.

1238
01:35:40,398 --> 01:35:42,469
I was at the Chinaman's.

1239
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,028
Confirmed.

1240
01:35:44,398 --> 01:35:45,275
At the Chinaman's.

1241
01:35:45,839 --> 01:35:46,715
Confirmed.

1242
01:35:47,999 --> 01:35:51,116
I played cards with my dentist.

1243
01:35:51,599 --> 01:35:52,668
Confirmed.

1244
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,111
That's not you at the demonstration?

1245
01:35:56,398 --> 01:35:58,276
It does look like me.

1246
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,675
Indicted for perjury...

1247
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:05,232
...along with those
who confirmed his alibi!

1248
01:36:05,398 --> 01:36:07,309
Plus obstructing justice!

1249
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:09,354
Take him away!

1250
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:15,031
Witness 27 has died
of a heart attack.

1251
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:17,429
He owned the CROC meeting hall.

1252
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:19,436
Earlier you stated Yago

1253
01:36:19,639 --> 01:36:21,072
hit you with a club

1254
01:36:21,559 --> 01:36:23,356
Iike a police billy-club.

1255
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:26,032
- Do you maintain that?
- Yes, Judge.

1256
01:36:26,318 --> 01:36:29,231
The Att.-Gen. says he phoned you

1257
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:32,630
that the senator's life
had been threatened.

1258
01:36:32,839 --> 01:36:33,874
Your superiors

1259
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:35,671
never got his message.

1260
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:37,715
Yes, I forgot to tell them.

1261
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,108
That's a serious error!

1262
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:44,397
I'll answer to my superiors,
not to you, Judge.

1263
01:36:46,559 --> 01:36:50,836
That morning,
you were warned of death threats

1264
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:53,354
against the senator.

1265
01:36:53,999 --> 01:36:56,273
Who told you about them?

1266
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:59,948
A colleague's wife.
She can't tell us the name.

1267
01:37:00,519 --> 01:37:01,952
She'll have to.

1268
01:37:02,318 --> 01:37:06,790
The man says I can tell you.
He's waiting in the hall.

1269
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:08,392
Bring him in.

1270
01:37:09,999 --> 01:37:11,398
His name's Coste.

1271
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:15,670
- On the assassination day...
- The incident!

1272
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:18,474
...he came to my office

1273
01:37:18,679 --> 01:37:21,193
to tell me of a conversation.

1274
01:37:21,999 --> 01:37:24,148
But he'll tell it to you better.

1275
01:37:24,559 --> 01:37:28,393
Don't mention me in the papers.
Not my name!

1276
01:37:28,559 --> 01:37:30,709
Why? Isn't your story true?

1277
01:37:30,879 --> 01:37:33,439
Yes, but I want no trouble.

1278
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:35,390
If you do, come see me.

1279
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:39,309
Wait in the hall, please.

1280
01:37:42,599 --> 01:37:44,237
Name and profession?

1281
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:48,152
Ilya Coste, deliveryman.

1282
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:50,951
On the assassination day...

1283
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:54,794
Day of the incident!
An assassination's not yet proven.

1284
01:37:56,398 --> 01:37:59,835
The day of the incident was rainy...

1285
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:03,590
I work myself to death

1286
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:07,997
and the bank gets
half of what I earn!

1287
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:10,112
Someone's calling you!

1288
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:11,468
Again!

1289
01:38:17,479 --> 01:38:18,798
Which one?

1290
01:38:19,919 --> 01:38:21,034
That one!

1291
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:22,314
Go on!

1292
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:23,878
I heard Yago say...

1293
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:25,518
- If it rains?
- So?

1294
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,590
- We'll skid!
- It won't!

1295
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:30,034
It won't rain!
But I got payments due!

1296
01:38:30,198 --> 01:38:31,711
We'll cover you.

1297
01:38:31,879 --> 01:38:33,470
All the payments!

1298
01:38:34,559 --> 01:38:36,197
The varnisher phoned!

1299
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:39,874
He wants ya this afternoon
to deliver some coffins!

1300
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,467
It's a good sign! See you tonight!

1301
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,675
Then he came over.

1302
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,510
I'll buy you a drink!

1303
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:55,789
As he sat down I saw the club.

1304
01:38:55,959 --> 01:38:57,472
What's that for?

1305
01:38:57,879 --> 01:39:01,633
Tonight! A delivery job
that'll take care of a lot!

1306
01:39:01,799 --> 01:39:03,072
What kind?

1307
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:05,791
A delivery into hell!

1308
01:39:05,959 --> 01:39:08,028
A senator from the capital.

1309
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:09,592
A dirty job!

1310
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:11,393
No one knows.

1311
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:14,108
If they do, it'll be by you!

1312
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:21,269
Later, the same man came back.

1313
01:39:44,358 --> 01:39:46,269
He's different in civvies.

1314
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:47,713
You knew him?

1315
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:50,269
I'd asked for a truck permit.

1316
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:55,155
Every 6 months I went to him
about it. He was always in uniform.

1317
01:39:59,759 --> 01:40:01,032
But why pick Yago?

1318
01:40:01,919 --> 01:40:04,273
He's the best driver in town.

1319
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:08,876
You should see him
with his Kamikaze.

1320
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:13,872
He has a political record.

1321
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:17,314
He was in the communist
underground in the war

1322
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:20,515
- then deported to the islands.
- His testimony...

1323
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:24,354
...is suspect, of course.
I wouldn't use it.

1324
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:39,872
Never mind.

1325
01:41:40,198 --> 01:41:43,396
They want to eliminate
all troublesome witnesses!

1326
01:41:43,919 --> 01:41:46,592
They just tried to get me!

1327
01:41:46,759 --> 01:41:47,794
What?

1328
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:51,997
Attempted murder! Just now!
The plot continues!

1329
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,309
And will continue!

1330
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:56,754
I don't need your advice!

1331
01:41:56,959 --> 01:41:59,233
This involves the top brass!

1332
01:41:59,398 --> 01:42:00,912
The police's their toy!

1333
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:03,434
And cops haven't the possibility

1334
01:42:03,599 --> 01:42:07,308
to commit such a murder
without being protected!

1335
01:42:07,759 --> 01:42:11,956
The guilty ones are
in the government or at the palace

1336
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:15,236
where the General
is head of the guards.

1337
01:42:15,398 --> 01:42:16,593
And the palace

1338
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,795
takes orders from abroad!

1339
01:42:18,959 --> 01:42:20,517
One more word

1340
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:24,558
and I'll charge you
with defamation of the State!

1341
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,430
This isn't a rally!

1342
01:42:28,599 --> 01:42:29,793
What happened?

1343
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:34,157
They tried to kill me! They knew
I had important info for you.

1344
01:42:34,318 --> 01:42:37,470
So a car tried to run me down
on my way here!

1345
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:39,117
Any witnesses?

1346
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:42,589
Here are 3 honest,
God-fearing housewives

1347
01:42:42,759 --> 01:42:46,718
who'll testify, plus a park guardian,
a war vet with medals!

1348
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:50,151
What's this information?

1349
01:42:50,839 --> 01:42:53,637
The police own the VW...

1350
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:57,872
That took him away to the hospital?

1351
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:01,429
But no cops were allowed
in the car to finish him off,

1352
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:04,352
so the driver took
the longest route. I know!

1353
01:43:04,559 --> 01:43:05,674
I was there!

1354
01:43:05,839 --> 01:43:09,548
But the car belongs
to one of your friends!

1355
01:43:09,759 --> 01:43:13,718
He must be a friend!
He helped them at once!

1356
01:43:13,999 --> 01:43:16,638
Who told you such a tale?

1357
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:20,794
The car disappeared!
No trace of it at the hospital!

1358
01:43:20,959 --> 01:43:23,473
The page was torn out
of the registry!

1359
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,430
Don't you find that odd?

1360
01:43:27,999 --> 01:43:31,469
I think you did it
to add grist to your mill!

1361
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:33,791
Is this the car?

1362
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:35,193
Yes.

1363
01:43:35,839 --> 01:43:37,750
Find the owner of this car!

1364
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,512
If you wish to wash...

1365
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,231
Thanks, I'm alright.

1366
01:43:44,759 --> 01:43:46,032
Sit down.

1367
01:43:48,318 --> 01:43:49,831
Tell me what you know.

1368
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,630
But I warn you,
you risk indictment for perjury.

1369
01:43:54,839 --> 01:43:55,827
Go ahead.

1370
01:43:56,559 --> 01:44:00,756
The car was waiting there,
hidden by the police.

1371
01:44:01,358 --> 01:44:03,269
And when the truck came?

1372
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:05,317
He came forward.

1373
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:07,157
Inspector!

1374
01:44:10,559 --> 01:44:12,072
Chief!

1375
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:16,273
He wanted the General
to clear the square.

1376
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,347
Come on!

1377
01:44:24,879 --> 01:44:26,517
What're you waiting for?

1378
01:44:28,318 --> 01:44:29,991
I saw the truck arrive.

1379
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:30,796
Watch out!

1380
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:34,954
The man in back was standing up?
Did he hit him?

1381
01:44:35,278 --> 01:44:37,997
I dunno. It happened too fast.

1382
01:44:38,358 --> 01:44:39,394
And then?

1383
01:44:39,559 --> 01:44:42,278
He fell to his knees.

1384
01:44:42,959 --> 01:44:44,233
His knees?

1385
01:44:44,559 --> 01:44:46,311
His head hit the pavement?

1386
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:49,153
No. he was on his knees

1387
01:44:49,358 --> 01:44:51,747
surrounded by the demonstrators.

1388
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:53,477
The police did nothing.

1389
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:55,994
Which demonstrators?

1390
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,152
Impossible to say.

1391
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:04,711
We pulled him free.
Then he collapsed.

1392
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,558
A VW arrived

1393
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:14,189
from where, I don 't know.
,

1394
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,394
Finally,, the cops intervened
and tried to get into the car.

1395
01:45:33,398 --> 01:45:34,798
Come on!

1396
01:45:40,999 --> 01:45:42,796
Get to the hospital!

1397
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:47,313
Get going!

1398
01:45:51,879 --> 01:45:54,473
Faster! Honk your horn!

1399
01:45:54,999 --> 01:45:56,717
Is it broken?

1400
01:45:57,799 --> 01:45:59,232
Turn right!

1401
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:01,827
This way avoids traffic!

1402
01:46:02,318 --> 01:46:06,948
He did it to waste time.
Then, he hit another car!
,

1403
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:10,148
Keep going!

1404
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:11,918
I need a damage report!

1405
01:46:13,519 --> 01:46:16,988
A man's hurt!
It's a matter of life or death!

1406
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:19,277
OK, go on!

1407
01:46:27,278 --> 01:46:28,871
He did it on purpose!

1408
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:32,429
And the cops would've
killed him in the car!

1409
01:46:32,679 --> 01:46:34,271
On purpose?

1410
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:39,747
I did my best! They were upset,
I can understand that.

1411
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:42,469
No one noticed me at the hospital.

1412
01:46:43,358 --> 01:46:48,148
I'd rented the car
for an afternoon date

1413
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,072
and was on my way home.

1414
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:51,791
Roadblocks were up.

1415
01:46:52,959 --> 01:46:56,349
I must not have noticed the police.

1416
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:02,115
At the hospital I washed
the seats of the blood.

1417
01:47:02,278 --> 01:47:05,351
You said "I'm a part-time chauffeur".

1418
01:47:06,439 --> 01:47:08,394
But you're a serviceman!

1419
01:47:09,079 --> 01:47:11,751
- I'm doing my military service.
- What branch?

1420
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:14,510
As a policeman.

1421
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:21,308
You're a police chauffeur!

1422
01:47:23,959 --> 01:47:24,994
What section?

1423
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,070
One close to the General.

1424
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:29,594
How close?

1425
01:47:30,198 --> 01:47:31,188
Personal.

1426
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:32,235
Since when?

1427
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:34,474
1 year.

1428
01:47:34,839 --> 01:47:37,353
The General's driver for 1 year.

1429
01:47:37,799 --> 01:47:40,836
You were at the scene
of the murder by accident.

1430
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:44,356
Shall I write "murder"?

1431
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:45,832
You said "murder".

1432
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,912
Do you know who has arrived?

1433
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:06,990
The Nat'l. Att.-Gen.!

1434
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:08,387
Leave us alone.

1435
01:48:09,799 --> 01:48:13,348
The Nat'l. Att.-Gen.
has come to talk to you...

1436
01:48:13,759 --> 01:48:15,430
...totally incognito.

1437
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,153
Yes, he's here.

1438
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,357
I'll bring my files at once.

1439
01:48:31,919 --> 01:48:34,308
So it's you... Sit down.

1440
01:48:38,198 --> 01:48:41,794
You're ready to indict
the Chief of Police?

1441
01:48:41,959 --> 01:48:43,028
It's inevitable.

1442
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:46,474
My friend,
only Divine Will is inevitable!

1443
01:48:46,799 --> 01:48:48,390
Proof is overwhelming, sir.

1444
01:48:48,559 --> 01:48:50,629
Proof? Hearsay!

1445
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:54,957
So-called proof
by so-called pacifists

1446
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:57,476
who want to create a hero!

1447
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,388
That's certain, sir,
but police complicity

1448
01:49:01,559 --> 01:49:03,595
with the demonstrators is certain.

1449
01:49:04,398 --> 01:49:08,312
Those 2 men circled in red
are plain-clothes men.

1450
01:49:08,519 --> 01:49:11,715
They admit being
in the demonstration.

1451
01:49:12,759 --> 01:49:16,148
We also know
the Police Chief met Yago that day

1452
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:18,157
plus other demonstrators.

1453
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:21,915
The General said
he didn't know the driver of the VW.

1454
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:26,278
But he's the General's
personal chauffeur!

1455
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:30,112
I won't mention
the police's passiveness.

1456
01:49:30,318 --> 01:49:33,037
Then comes
the intimidation of witnesses.

1457
01:49:33,999 --> 01:49:38,914
Vago is hospitalised secretly
with a police medical certificate.

1458
01:49:39,159 --> 01:49:42,947
He's found near the room
of a major witness, with a club!

1459
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:47,947
Then there's Yago's club
during the demonstration.

1460
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:53,751
Several witnesses saw it.
It disappeared when he was arrested.

1461
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:57,196
But the agent admitted
rewriting his report.

1462
01:49:57,398 --> 01:50:00,232
You shouldn't mention
the club in your report.

1463
01:50:00,398 --> 01:50:01,468
But it's done, sir!

1464
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:03,956
I'm the Police Chief General!

1465
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,634
At ease!

1466
01:50:07,879 --> 01:50:11,235
Don't worry. You did your duty.

1467
01:50:11,398 --> 01:50:13,514
You've been a policeman how long?

1468
01:50:13,839 --> 01:50:14,794
6 years.

1469
01:50:15,919 --> 01:50:18,479
Just rewrite your report.

1470
01:50:19,358 --> 01:50:21,189
Ah! The Att.Gen.!

1471
01:50:23,278 --> 01:50:25,110
And then you arrived, sir.

1472
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:30,675
He couldn't lie. On the contrary!
His confession'll cost him a lot.

1473
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:33,668
There is a case for indictment,

1474
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:36,433
but not enough for a jury
to condemn the police.

1475
01:50:36,599 --> 01:50:39,113
The jury'll do its duty.
I've done mine.

1476
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,795
You'll discredit the police
and the court

1477
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,997
who will be blamed
for absolving them.

1478
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,437
As if it's not enough
our country's been invaded

1479
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:54,150
by long-haired atheists and addicts.

1480
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:57,995
Now you want to cast doubts
on our armed forces,

1481
01:50:58,198 --> 01:51:02,157
the sole healthy elements
in our country.

1482
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:05,117
We dream of a renewal

1483
01:51:05,278 --> 01:51:08,351
of a land with no parties,
left nor right,

1484
01:51:08,519 --> 01:51:10,794
obedient to God.

1485
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:12,827
You want to ruin it.

1486
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:16,438
Listen...

1487
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:19,233
I have a proposal for you.

1488
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,470
I understand your scruples.

1489
01:51:23,759 --> 01:51:25,192
They honor you.

1490
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:29,428
My idea should suit you
and the government and the palace.

1491
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,956
We'll divide the case in 3.
1 st, the trial of the 2 criminals.

1492
01:51:37,159 --> 01:51:39,070
Let justice be done!

1493
01:51:39,479 --> 01:51:41,309
2nd, the police authorities.

1494
01:51:41,479 --> 01:51:44,197
Their negligence is evident

1495
01:51:44,919 --> 01:51:48,594
but can't be tried
by a circuit court.

1496
01:51:48,879 --> 01:51:52,666
It's strictly
an administrative matter.

1497
01:51:53,839 --> 01:51:58,309
3rd, an action
against the rally organisers.

1498
01:51:58,679 --> 01:52:04,276
They and their loudspeakers are
responsible for the ensuing violence.

1499
01:52:04,839 --> 01:52:07,990
An old rule of thumb
is to always look for those

1500
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,309
who benefit from a crime.

1501
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,872
The Minister of Justice
thought you're a Leftist.

1502
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:16,870
I formally denied it.

1503
01:52:18,759 --> 01:52:21,592
Here's a list of helpful witnesses.

1504
01:52:22,919 --> 01:52:27,389
It seems no one wanted to kill
the senator. Just intimidate him.

1505
01:52:28,358 --> 01:52:30,429
I trust I've convinced you

1506
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:34,394
to save the honor
of the forces of law and order.

1507
01:52:35,719 --> 01:52:41,271
But you're the sole master
of your conscience, after God.

1508
01:52:54,398 --> 01:52:55,798
I won't be disgraced!

1509
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:58,468
Indict me and I'll commit suicide!

1510
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,390
Dishonor is unbearable!

1511
01:53:00,559 --> 01:53:03,119
My blood'll be on your hands!

1512
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,829
Name and profession?

1513
01:53:07,278 --> 01:53:08,711
You must answer.

1514
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:20,711
Sign your statement.

1515
01:53:30,039 --> 01:53:33,827
You are indicted
for premeditated murder.

1516
01:53:34,039 --> 01:53:35,836
The law allows 24 hours

1517
01:53:36,439 --> 01:53:39,590
to superior officers
before their imprisonment.

1518
01:53:39,919 --> 01:53:42,671
To avoid the reporters,
use that door.

1519
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:14,957
You're indicted
for premeditated murder.

1520
01:54:27,999 --> 01:54:29,352
It's unbearable!

1521
01:54:30,559 --> 01:54:31,912
You've no right!

1522
01:54:38,879 --> 01:54:41,268
I've been thrown to the hounds!

1523
01:54:41,759 --> 01:54:43,430
Name and profession?

1524
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:50,067
You're indicted
for premeditated murder.

1525
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,388
Sit down.

1526
01:55:15,559 --> 01:55:20,030
For me there's no choice!
Either I'm cleared

1527
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:21,996
or I'll commit suicide!

1528
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:23,598
Name and profession?

1529
01:55:23,919 --> 01:55:25,510
It's routine, General!

1530
01:55:26,318 --> 01:55:28,229
What did you do that day?

1531
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:31,508
I was to attend the Bolshoï Ballet.

1532
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:36,070
Not out of love for the dance!
I'm not one of those perverts!

1533
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:38,878
But it was a chance
to spot some Reds.

1534
01:55:42,559 --> 01:55:44,754
The day of the assassination

1535
01:55:44,919 --> 01:55:47,876
you were told
his life was threatened.

1536
01:55:48,799 --> 01:55:53,189
No one told me about it!
I'm sure it was only a tactic

1537
01:55:53,358 --> 01:55:55,189
to justify any incidents.

1538
01:55:59,278 --> 01:56:01,668
My men couldn't stop the truck

1539
01:56:01,999 --> 01:56:05,548
but a man leaped
on the rear platform,

1540
01:56:05,799 --> 01:56:09,314
Iithe and fierce as a tiger.

1541
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:19,914
I know no one in that organisation.

1542
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:23,354
I've had no contacts
with this... CROC.

1543
01:56:23,759 --> 01:56:27,115
You're seen here at a banquet
you gave for them.

1544
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:31,113
To thank them for keeping order
during a state visit.

1545
01:56:31,559 --> 01:56:34,312
Is he a Red? Why's he after me?

1546
01:56:34,599 --> 01:56:37,032
His father was police chief.

1547
01:56:41,559 --> 01:56:44,278
The photo's phony! It's not proof!

1548
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:47,836
You're indicted
for premeditated murder!

1549
01:56:57,839 --> 01:56:59,909
Are you a martyr like Dreyfus?

1550
01:57:00,398 --> 01:57:01,991
Dreyfus was guilty!

1551
01:57:35,839 --> 01:57:39,751
Helen! They're all indicted,
even the General!

1552
01:57:40,959 --> 01:57:43,393
The judge didn't back down!

1553
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,751
Helen, it's like he was still alive!

1554
01:57:48,759 --> 01:57:50,750
It's a real revolution!

1555
01:57:51,318 --> 01:57:55,153
The government'll fall
and extremists'll be wiped out!

1556
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,117
Elections'll be a landslide!

1557
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:09,867
THE TRlAL

1558
01:58:10,599 --> 01:58:12,669
The Deputy was not at the trial.

1559
01:58:12,879 --> 01:58:16,349
He died of a heart attack,
according to the coroner.

1560
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:20,876
7 other witnesses died
before the trial.

1561
01:58:21,519 --> 01:58:22,747
A car accident,

1562
01:58:22,919 --> 01:58:24,034
a gas explosion,

1563
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:26,754
a suicide, a drowning,

1564
01:58:27,278 --> 01:58:30,271
a work accident,
a 2nd car accident

1565
01:58:30,559 --> 01:58:32,675
and a heart attack while driving.

1566
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:37,071
"Foul play is doubted"
says the new Chief of Police.

1567
01:58:37,278 --> 01:58:39,668
Vago was sentenced

1568
01:58:39,879 --> 01:58:44,191
to 8 years in a farm prison
where 1 year equals 2 years.

1569
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:47,394
Yago got 1 1 years of the same.

1570
01:58:47,759 --> 01:58:49,954
1 0 months for disturbing the peace.

1571
01:58:50,198 --> 01:58:53,555
1 year with a possibility
of paying it off.

1572
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,915
The 4 indicted officers only
received administrative reprimands.

1573
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:02,156
Yet the government had to resign.

1574
01:59:02,318 --> 01:59:06,915
After the trial, the Leftists
seemed certain to win the elections.

1575
01:59:07,159 --> 01:59:11,869
Prior to the elections, the army
seized power and dismissed the judge.

1576
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:17,235
Senator George Pirou died in a police
car of a clot on the brain,

1577
01:59:17,398 --> 01:59:19,867
said police officers.

1578
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:21,834
Deported to the islands.

1579
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:25,312
During questioning,
fell from the 7th floor

1580
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:27,389
trying to escape,
said the police.

1581
01:59:27,959 --> 01:59:31,554
3 years for revealing
official documents.

1582
