I didn't want to say it.

136

They insisted and then...

137

It's your fault.

- My?
- Yes.

139
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,082
Because you never worried
about what they could do to you.

140

You told him what
made you happy!

- Shut up.

161

It's your fault,
because you wanted to take him home.

162
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,790
If it were up to me,
he could have stayed in reform school.

163
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,957
But since I love his mother
and I had no alternative,

even if it's of no use to me.

- Ciccio, shut up, there's the baby.

- Pasta with sauce.

Yesterday I didn't bet on just any female,

I chose the most beautiful one in the place.

- Gianni.

477
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,540
This one has been standing still for a lifetime.

478
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,915
It's definitely the candle, don't worry.

479
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,999
- Hand me a rag and some sandpaper.
- Yes.

480
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,249
- Isabella?
-What is it?

481
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,457
Help me close the bottles.

482
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,915
- [Nino] Are you seeing the match tomorrow?
- [Gianni] Which match?

483
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:02,249
- Like which match?
- Ah, the Italy match..

484
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,374
Yes.

485
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,999
[Isabella] Do you want to make pasta
with tomato sauce for breakfast too?

486
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:10,165
Because your mom put
the spoon in her mouth.

487
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:14,082
It's a trick to keep from crying
while chopping the onion.

488
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,665
I knew it.

489
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:16,915
Try now.

490
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,374
[engine starts]

491
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:41,082
Of course you know how to clean a candle,
that's your job.

492
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,374
It was my job.

493
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,124
However I don't have the money.

494
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:51,707
- I'll take you home, so we're even.
- No, I'll take the bus. There's no need.

495
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,415
- Come on, it won't be half an hour until you get home.
- There's no need.

496
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,540
Dai!

497
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,749
- [Ciccio] Is there food for us too?
- [Isabella] Good morning, huh?

498
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,249
Thanks anyway,
it was a wonderful lunch.

499
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,707
I had too good a time with you.

500
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,832
You have a beautiful family.

501
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,124
Say hello to your father,
I don't want to disturb him.

502
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,915
- Hi Gianni! Come back whenever you want.
- All right.

503
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,957
- Until we meet again.
- Until we meet again.

504
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:29,540
- [Ciccio] Totò! Buy me cigarettes!
- HI.

505
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,374
[Carmela] But do you know what time it is?

506
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,957
- [together] First.
- [together] Eh!

507
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,832
[man] Go!

508
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,957
Oh!

509
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,582
Oh!

510
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,832
[together] Eh!

511
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,457
[together] Three, four, five, six, seven

512
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,915
eight nine...

513
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,624
[yell out]

514
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,040
[inaudible voices]

515
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,457
Look who's here!

516
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:47,707
- Enzo, come here!
- [together] Enzo!

517
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,749
[together] Come here!

518
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,957
[together] Enzo, come here!

519
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:03,624
Enzo, show the kids
how you lift the car.

520
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,374
Alone.

521
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,332
[Emanuele] What's up.

522
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,832
[man] A thousand lire who can do it.

523
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,457
That's it, 100 lire.

524
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:17,790
what's up

525
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:21,790
[together] Enzo! Enzo!

526
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,832
[together] Enzo! Enzo!

527
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,957
[together] Two, three,

528
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:31,957
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

529
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,499
[shouts of exultation]

530
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:42,457
Oh, you broke my ass.
The car is mine.

531
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:46,040
- Crazy things!
- [indistinct voices]

532
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,665
[Emanuele] Shh, look who's here.

533
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,749
What is this bitch?

534
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,457
- Just like Miss Italy!
- [laughs]

535
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,290
[Gianni] Sergio, a coffee.

536
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,165
[Turi] Did you see?

537
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,665
Today he wants to get hurt.

538
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:21,957
What do you want to do?

539
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:24,540
Eh?

540
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,790
Tell me what do you want to do?

541
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,082
Why are you provoking them like this?

542
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,249
Do you want to understand that those ruin you?

543
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,374
Did you want a coffee?

544
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,874
Bring him a coffee too,
since he's very busy!

545
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:08,374
- [Turi] Franco!
- [Sucabenzina] Yes, it sticks a lot.

546
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:12,582
- [laughter]
- [Emanuele] Franco sticks it.

547
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:14,165
[laughs]

548
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,290
Franco!

549
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,707
[Turi] Shut up and go away, it's better.

550
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,957
[Sucagasoline] Go home!

551
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,665
Mamma.

552
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,290
You are completely crazy!

553
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,832
You are crazy!

554
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:54,374
- Everything's fine.
- What?

555
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,290
- He's kicking us out of the house.
- Let me talk.

556
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,499
Do you remember how you and I were?

557
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:03,624
Now you apologize to him
because money is sacred and...

558
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,457
I got a job, mom.

559
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,790
I'm taking you away from here,
we're going somewhere else.

560
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:13,540
- What do you say?
- Let's get another house, I'll pay for everything.

561
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:17,332
We don't need him! Did you understand?

562
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:20,457
- We don't need anyone.
- Where? Come here.

563
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,415
Wait, Franco...

564
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,707
You will never enter my workshop again.

565
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,582
- Leave him, Franco.
- Get up!

566
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:30,665
- Leave him!
- You have to leave.

567
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:31,790
Yes.

568
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:35,249
- Otherwise you will regret being born.
- Leave him alone!

569
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,665
Get out!

570
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,749
What should we do here?

571
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,540
[Franco] This is my house, understand?

572
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:55,457
- I make the rules!
- [the door slams]

573
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,957
- [Pietro] Pasquale, give me the list.
- [Pasquale] Here.

574
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:07,249
- [Peter] How many are there? You?
- Salvatore Massone.

575
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:10,165
[Pietro] Salvatore, we know each other. Go.

576
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,124
- Antonino, still here?
- Yes.

577
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,957
- Grab the digger and get started.
- All right.

578
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:21,332
- This is the first time I've seen you.
- You are wrong.

579
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,457
- What is your name?
- Michele Mannino.

580
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:26,207
Michele Mannino, yes.

581
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:30,499
- Do you want to work?
- I'm a family man.

582
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,790
Grab a tool and get started
before I think about it again.

583
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:34,957
Thank you.

584
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,124
- Pasquale, continue.
- All right.

585
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,415
- [Nino] Good morning.
- [together] Good morning.

586
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,499
I heard
that Giacomo Agostini put you under control.

587
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:53,249
- Leave him alone, he thinks he's nice.
- Look here.

588
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,915
No, but it's not his fault.

589
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:58,040
Gianni Accordino, pleasure.

590
00:53:58,875 --> 00:53:59,874
Pleasure.

591
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:05,915
- Alfredo, how are you?
- I am fine.

592
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:09,540
- Tonight I'm going to Santa Venerina.
- No never mind.

593
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,540
No, I won't let it go.

594
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,374
They have to tell me
what they said to you.

595
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,832
- Why are you doing so?
- Alfredo.

596
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,040
They must show you respect
because you are a good Christian.

597
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,957
- Gianni, let's get started.
- Let's go to work too.

598
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,457
- Thank you, Mr. Scalia.
- Hi handsome!

599
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,374
- Good work, Gianni. Hello Uncle.
- [Pietro] Hello, Nino.

600
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,457
[Alfredo] Let's go.

601
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:37,790
- Pasquale!
- Yes?

602
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,832
Mark Gianni Accordino on the list.

603
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,415
So, Gianni.

604
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:46,415
My brother brought you
and you didn't wait in line,

605
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,582
but when you work, you are the same as others.

606
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:49,832
- Understood?
- Certain.

607
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:54,624
Pasquale, explain the basics to this guy.

608
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:55,874
Alone.

609
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:58,540
See those branches?

610
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,332
[Pasquale] Now I'll explain what you have to do.

611
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:14,165
All right. Thanks, Fabio. HI.

612
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,707
[worker] Slowly, come in.

613
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,457
Piano.

614
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,832
Goes into.

615
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,207
Piano.

616
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,999
Or.

617
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,832
Or.

618
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,124
Stop!

619
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,915
[worker] Attention, stop! Switch off!

620
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,374
What are you doing?

621
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,499
Mr. Scalia, I'm sorry.

622
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,165
- I was smoking...
- Go home.

623
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:02,582
- How are you going home? I have a family.
- I already told you.

624
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:05,124
When the truck unloads
no one has to stay here,

625
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,915
and do you smoke cigarettes?

626
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,582
Oh, I'm talking to you!

627
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:13,040
Are you going away or will I come get you?
What should we do?

628
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:28,749
I have family.

629
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:38,332
You did well, it wasn't the first time
he did something stupid.

630
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,832
Pasquale, that's why I'm here.

631
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,415
[Pasquale] Of course.

632
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,165
[Peter] What is there to look at?

633
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,999
Nothing happened.
Come on, start working again!

634
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:16,790

638

Did you see the match?
Paolo Rossi, two to zero. Here!

639
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,915
[indistinct voices]

640
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,624
- Hello, Gioacchino.
- We will see each other.

641
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,915
[Pietro] Gianni, come here.

642
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:02,832
Until we meet again.

643
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,290
I looked at you, you know?

644
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,957
I saw how you move.

645
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,415
Bravo.

646
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:22,082
This is hard work,
you learn little by little like all things.

647
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,249
For the first day
I liked you, you work hard.

648
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,874
Thank you.

649
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,790
- HI.
- Until we meet again.

650
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,207
Now that you've become a pilot,
won't you come hunting with me anymore?

651
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,749
- No, uncle.
- HI.

652
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:47,874
Ciao.

653
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,749
What are you doing here? Don't see the game?

654
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,624
No, I want to be outdoors for a bit.

655
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,790
- Come with me!
- No, take me to the bus.

656
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,624
No, I want to take you somewhere.

657
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:58,915
Dove?

658
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,665
A place that only I know, mount.

659
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,832
- All right.
- Come on, come on! Go!

660
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,415
In here is the
gunpowder charge.

661
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,040
When the bomb enters the mortar,
the first blast puts pressure,

662
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:52,665
the gases expand,
the bomb shoots into the air and flies.

663
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:58,790
When it's high, really high, it explodes

664
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:02,332
and see all the colors
you chose in the mix.

665
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,207
Blue, red, green,
yellow, purple and all things.

666
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,874
You didn't understand anything, did you?

667
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,124
I understood that when it explodes,
you can see the colored stars.

668
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,707
Alright, let's leave it at that.

669
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,290
Look what I'll show you.

670
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,415
My grandfather drew these.

671
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,582
I did this.

672
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:37,124
So,
just a little warning to start with.

673
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,749
Alarm!

674
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:43,749
People look up
and you have their attention.

675
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,165
Now you have to figure out what you mean.

676
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:53,457
If you want to talk about love,
you need the most delicate colors.

677
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:59,665
If you've argued with someone,
you want to show everyone that you're pissed off.

678
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,790
If you want to scare them,
what's the problem?

679
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,957
You have a war army at your disposal.

680
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,165
What are you doing?

681
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,374
Then there's the grand finale.

682
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:23,040
Boom! Boom! Boom!

683
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,624
Because every story has to end, right?

684
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:40,874
What's up?

685
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,249
Did you kiss me last time?

686
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:49,832
To the accident.

687
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:54,915
What do you say? Kissed?
You weren't breathing anymore, I saved you.

688
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,832
Go wash yourself, you're all dirty.

689
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,165
No, do you think I should wash here?
The water is frozen.

690
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:16,624
Come on, come on!

691
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,749
Nino!

692
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,332
Nino!

693
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:57,665
- Come on!
- I'm here, stupid.

694
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:01,749
Damn, you scared me!
Someone like you drowns in three seconds.

695
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,415
There's current there, it's dangerous.

696
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,165
We come here every day
and he still hasn't figured it out.

697
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,207
How long until the last bus leaves?

698
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,415
Soon, come on.

699
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:32,249
If we don't hurry, will we lose him?

700
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,957
I've been telling you for half an hour, hurry up!

701
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,707
- Come on!
- A moment.

702
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,415
Fast!

703
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:50,749
- Wait a moment!
- I'll leave you here. HI.

704
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,874
Where are you going? My scooter.

705
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:07,874
- Bye see you tomorrow.
- Until tomorrow.

706
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:34,207
Dude, you fell for it!

707
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,499
Come on, come on.

708
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,999
- Did you work here?
- Yes.

709
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:12,415
- Is he the one who fired you?
- Yes.

710
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,165
He's got a really fucking face.

711
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,957
Just a lot.

712
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:21,207
- HI.
- Oh, this is Nino.

713
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:24,374
- He's my boss' nephew.
- Good evening.

714
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,082
They were late and I accompanied him.
My uncle says he's very good.

715
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:30,832
Thank you.

716
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,832
- Come on, come on.
- Yes.

717
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,290
Okay, I'm going.

718
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:45,165
Why don't you ever want me to accompany you?

719
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:50,082
- Because I don't want to disturb.
- Stop it! See you tomorrow.

720
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,332
- HI.
- HI.

721

What is this thing?

722
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,332
It's a trick, so you don't cry anymore.

723
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,374
Where did you learn this trick?

Works.

01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,290
Let me guess.

794
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,624
- You were looking for Giannuzza, right?
- [laughs]

795
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:25,499
Oh, will you shut up? I'm watching the game
and you screw my dick.

796
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:29,832
- Come on, let us have fun.
- Hi, what did you want from Gianni?

797
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:33,832
Well done Giuseppina.
This is how you welcome a stranger?

798
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,165
I came to say hello, but he's at work.

799
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,665
- What work?
- [Emanuele] So he didn't show up.

800
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,665
Work with my uncle.

801
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:50,082
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Wait, where are you going? A second.

802
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:53,874
Did he also lie to you
that his father works in Germany?

803
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,665
I think you don't know many things about him.

804
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:01,457
Now Giuseppina tells you
a beautiful story about him.

805
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,040
She acts shy.

806
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:10,290
- Turi.
- Stop it, I'm watching the game.

807
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:14,499
- I don't want to disturb you, I'm leaving.
- You don't bother at all.

808
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:17,207
Do you know that your friend is a puppu?

809
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:20,290
Giuseppina saw him
while he was sucking one.

810
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,707
Does it suck for you too?

811
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:26,332
Enough, you have to stay silent, do you understand?

812
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:27,957
Otherwise I'll kill you.

813
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,040
Eh?

814
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:33,040
<i>[reporter] One to zero for France.</i>

815
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:39,707
Are you still here? Get out! Run, baby!

816
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,165
- You got scared, huh?
- [laughs]

817
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:02,832
What's up?

818
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:05,957
Nothing!

819
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:13,957
Oh!

820
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:19,415
What do you want?

821
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,332
Uncle said you had a fever,

822
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:24,707
and I stopped by
to see how you were.

823
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:30,957
Nino, you must not come to my house
unless I tell you. Did you understand?

824
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,540
However, everything is fine.
I am fine thank you.

825
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,749
Why are you talking to me like that?

826
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,915
Gianni, I'm talking to you.
You have to answer me.

827
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,457
Do you think you can escape like this?

828
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,832
Besides not having a fever, you
don't even have a father.

829
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:08,040
You only tell lies,

830
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,332
and I don't want a friend
who tells lies.

831
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,874
We don't see each other anymore anyway.

832
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,874
What do you mean we don't see each other anymore?

833
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,707
I don't come to the quarry anymore.

834
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:29,124
They took someone from my country
who I don't want to see.

835
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:37,165
He's one of the guys
at that shitty bar, right?

836
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,499
What do you know about it?

837
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,249
They took it out on me too.

838
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:49,082
I am sorry.

839
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:55,707
- Are the things they told me true?
- What did they tell you?

840
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,957
No, bullshit.

841
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,749
Bullshit, like the ones you tell.

842
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,540
Oh, I don't want to lose you.

843
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:15,374
Me niether.

844
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:20,415
Then a solution can be found, trust me.

845
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,999
Shall we go down?

846
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:06,249

Oh well, how do you say it?

850

Here, dad. The panels.

So you told
your mother about the other night?

I? Who do you think I am?

01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:11,332
Nino, the doctor says
that my cough doesn't convince him,

871
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:14,707
and your mother doesn't want me to work.

872
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,165
Do you know what pisses me off?

873

- What? What do you?

876

We have twenty fairs up until August,
and that's quite a few.

I know, dad, but I can take care of it.

882
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:46,790
I can take Gianni with me.

883
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,665
Why not? She wants to work.

he was one of the best at the quarry.

01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:08,499
They told me everything.

948
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:10,665
Where is your friend?

949
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,582
- But what did they tell you?
- Call him.

950
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:15,874
Gianni, come.

951
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,082
At that time?

952
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:23,874
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

953
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,790
The show went well.

954
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,165
- Totò!
- [Totò] Yes?

955
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:35,624
- Come here.
- Grandpa, I'm shitting.

956
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,040
[Alfredo] The councilor called.

957
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:41,665
He said everyone had
their heads held high and their mouths open.

958
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,124
Well done.

959
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,124
What's up?

960
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:48,249
- Let them accompany you.
- Where?

961
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,957
Don't have to dye your hair?

962
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:55,124
I dreamed that if I didn't win the tricolour,
Italy would lose.

963
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,082
Take money.

964
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:59,165
It must be the most beautiful tricolor.

965
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:02,290
- All right.
- Hello Mom.

966
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:06,332
- Hello Mom. Hello grandmother.
- Where are you going?

967
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,999
Damn, you look like two mummies!

968
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:21,124
So, are you ready? One, two, three, go!

969
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,249
[Nino] Go!

970
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,207
[Totò] Come on, uncle! Come on!

971
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,540
Go, uncle!

972
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,040
[Nino] Come here.

973
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:47,665
- Totò, come here!
- You come!

974
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:50,415
No, I'm scared, I don't know how to swim.

975
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,207
[Nino] What are you doing?

976
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:50,415
- Totò, stay still.
- Leave him alone.

977
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,540
[in Sicilian] Totò,
I'll cut this ball off for you.

978
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:07,124
Totò! I'll cut it for you.

979
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:08,290
Toto?

980
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,624
- I'll cut it for you.
- [Alfredo] You have to go to the center.

981
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:16,790
- Totò! Stop with this ball.
- Good.

982
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:19,915
- Dad, shut up, I can't hear.
- You put.

983
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:23,707
[reporter] Header
<i>in a corner.</i>

984
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:28,790
- Pass, pass. Stand on the right.
- Come on!

985
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:33,124
- [together] Come on!
- The defense needs to be more aggressive.

986
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:37,957
These are good,
they recover from two to two.

987
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:42,499
<i>- [chronicler] From the flag...</i>
- Oh, dumb!

988
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:45,457
- Accounts.
- Pass!

989
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:47,582
Conti is ready, he takes the shot.

990
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:52,207
- Accounts.
- Tardelli, dad.

991
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:55,207
[together] Goal!

992
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,874
[together] Goal!

993
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,749
My love!

994
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,540
[together] Goal!

995
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:11,415
[together] Yes! Goal!

996
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:15,957
[together] Goal!

997
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,290
Damn, I'm out of breath.

998
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,957
- Come on!
- Nino!

999
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,457
[Alfredo] Nino!

1000
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,582
It wasn't needed.

1001
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:50,999
What do you do in these cases?

1002
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:53,957
He waits for it to pass and as it comes, it comes.

1003
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,290
- Do you want a beer?
- Yes.

1004
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:22,124
[Nino] A beer, thanks.

1005
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:39,957
[woman softly] Yesterday I was at the party
to see the fireworks with my daughter.

1006
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:46,999
Maybe I'm wrong, but I had the impression
that they were kissing.

1007
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,832
- What do you say?
- I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

1008
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:53,999
- So you're making me worry.
- They were so close.

1009
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,915
This seems strange to me.

1010
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:38,332
A beautiful thing happened to me.
They promoted me, now I do trade fairs.

1011
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:44,749
Nino's father is not well,
he cannot follow the fires for a while.

1012
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,957
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- I'm telling you now.

1013
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:56,124
- What do you know about fireworks?
- It's not difficult, then I'll help Nino.

1014
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:00,707
Mom, they are beautiful.

1015
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,249
You have to see them, you can say a lot of things with fires .

1016
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:08,957
Are you two alone?

1017
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:11,874
Yes.

1018
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:24,665
What is it, mom?

1019
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:29,207
Nothing.

1020
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:48,374
- [Pietro] Do you like it? Carmela cooks well.
- [Alfredo] Where is he?

1021
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,374
- [Pietro] Totò, this pasta?
- Good.

1022
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:55,790
- [Pietro] You have to take Gianni hunting.
- Certain.

1023
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:59,249
- Whenever you want.
- I'll teach you how to shoot.

1024
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:03,874
The other time Nino caught
a hare like this, huge.

1025
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,957
- Mom!
- [Pietro] You didn't see it, it was like that.

1026
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,915
- [Isabella] Mom!
- [Ciccio] In Taormina I can take...

1027
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,082
[Carmela] Yes.

1028
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:14,582
[Alfredo] Take it, but don't do anything stupid.

1029
01:36:14,791 --> 01:36:17,832
- Sorry, I got distracted.
- Help your aunt.

1030
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:18,957
No.

1031
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,915
Nobody makes Carmela's pasta like it .

1032
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:24,374
I can't do it.

1033
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:28,374
With everything
I drank last night, I'm good.

1034
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:34,374
- How beautiful my sister-in-law!
- Ciccio, hands off. It's a rare commodity.

1035
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:38,790
- Thank you, Mrs. Scalia.
- [together] Best wishes, Alfredo!

1036
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:42,040
- [together] Best wishes!
- Happy birthday to my brother, happy birthday.

1037
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:44,790
Carmela, is everything okay? Eat something.

1038
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:48,749
- You're right, I'm coming now.
- I'm always right.

1039
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:51,832
We agree with you
because it's your birthday.

1040
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:54,290
[Pietro] Leave him alone,
can't you see how he is?

1041
01:36:54,416 --> 01:36:57,874
[Ciccio] For being 99 years old you are perfect.

1042
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,624
- [Totò] He's 49!
- [Alfredo] Let's eat.

1043
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:05,249
The other night everyone was speechless
when you set off the fires.

1044
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:08,374
- Good boy.
- [Alfredo] It's the truth and for this reason...

1045
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:10,790
Carmela, bring the wine.

1046
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:14,790
Guys, uncle has to give the speech
like every year.

1047
01:37:14,958 --> 01:37:17,582
Please let me talk, come on.

1048
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:21,290
So, we all know it.
My son is a great artist.

1049
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,749
- I'll be right there.
- Yes.

1050
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:29,707
Today I want to make a toast
to those who accompanied him and work with him.

1051
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,665
[Nino] Smoke, smoke!

1052
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:33,749
[Alfredo] Just two words for the boy

1053
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:37,790
who entered this house
almost by chance and on tiptoe.

1054
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:38,915
Well done, Gianni.

1055
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:43,415
And who then took my place
next to the person dearest to me.

1056
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:44,624
Not only!

1057
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:50,540
It also took my place
in the thing dearest to me, my work.

1058
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:54,832
Yes, you took away a laborer from me
who ran like a train.

1059
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,832
Come on, you get it.

1060
01:37:57,375 --> 01:38:01,249
This year we make
the first toast for Gianni.

1061
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,374
Or.

1062
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:05,624
[together] Thank you, Gianni. Welcome!

1063
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,415
[Totò] Well done, Gianni!

1064
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,540
[Alfredo] Carmela, what happened?

1065
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:12,915
Nino, go and see
what your mother has done.

1066
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:14,707
Mamma.

1067
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,415
Mom, what happened here?

1068
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:28,957
I had them for the second one,
they slipped and they broke.

1069
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:33,749
- Don't worry, these things happen.
- No, Nino.

1070
01:38:34,166 --> 01:38:37,790
These are oddities that shouldn't happen,
you have to be careful.

1071
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,332
Don't get hurt.

1072
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,665
- HI.
- What is this concern?

1073
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,749
The fair is far away, let's leave immediately.

1074
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:07,415
I'm here to change,
Nino is waiting for me downstairs.

1075
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:29,165
Good morning.

1076
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:31,165
Ciao.

1077
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:43,290
I did it, bye.

1078
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:52,249
- Watch it! You look handsome in this shirt.
- Did you see?

1079
01:39:55,958 --> 01:39:59,415
Look at them, they look like two boyfriends.

1080
01:40:00,416 --> 01:40:02,832
[Gianni] You're talking to me. Look.

1081
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:05,915
[Franco] Our Lady sent this work to the fairs .

1082
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:11,332
If the pay is good,
he can get his own apartment.

1083
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,790
You know what?

1084
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:17,999
I'll call my friend
from public housing tomorrow.

1085
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,874
He puts in a good word.

1086
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:23,790
Oh, Lina! Where are you going?

1087
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:28,665
Gianni! Gianni!

1088
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:30,832
Gianni!

1089
01:41:01,166 --> 01:41:03,165
[phone rings]

1090
01:41:10,208 --> 01:41:11,415
[Carmela] Hello?

1091
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:14,915
<i>[Lina] I am Gianni's mother.</i>

1092
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:16,040
[Carmela] Ah.

1093
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:22,249
<i>[Lina] I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for what you did for my son.</i>

1094
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:28,082
[Lina] Precisely for this reason...

1095
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,957
<i>it is right that you should know.</i>

1096
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:38,499
My son is the victim
of gossip, of malice.

1097
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:43,124
Voices that perhaps are said
for a laugh...

1098
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:47,332
but which then boil forever,

1099
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:51,249
especially
to those who are too sensitive to react.

1100

Yes, come here. Forza Italia!

1258
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:49,582
[inaudible voices]

1259
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:58,707
[together] Oh!

1260
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,374
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1261
02:02:01,541 --> 02:02:05,207
<i>[chronist] Launch of Tardelli on Rossi.</i>

1262
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:08,749
- Come on, Rossi!
<i>- [reporter] Rossi stopped by Breitner.</i>

1263
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:14,082
[reporter] Breitner advances.
<i>Shot from afar. Deviation by Rummenigge.</i>

1264
02:02:14,166 --> 02:02:16,165
- Where is Nino?
- I do not know.

1265
02:02:16,916 --> 02:02:19,082
<i>[reporter] And he's out. Forster shot.</i>

1266
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:22,874
- [in English] One moment.
- [Alfredo in English] Italy is strong.

1267
02:02:23,083 --> 02:02:27,582
- [Totò] Grandpa, do you think we win?
- [Alfredo] Of course, we win.

1268
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:33,207
- [Alfredo] Oh, move!
- [Totò] Come on! Damn, take pictures!

1269
02:02:33,333 --> 02:02:35,832
- [Alfredo] Like this!
- [Totò] Come on!

1270
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:39,374
[Alfredo] Lance! Oh, come on!

1271
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:45,790
- Nino, what are you doing? Don't see the game?
- No.

1272
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:52,082
You don't have to be afraid of me.

1273
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:58,082
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- And you're wrong.

1274
02:02:58,208 --> 02:03:00,707
He who is not afraid of anything
goes nowhere,

1275
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:03,957
or ends up under the train.

1276
02:03:18,041 --> 02:03:20,332
They think they know everything about me.

1277
02:03:22,166 --> 02:03:23,165
Your father,

1278
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:27,790
your mother, Isabella.

1279
02:03:29,333 --> 02:03:30,665
Uncle Pietro!

1280
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,665
Instead they know nothing.

1281
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:45,582
What I do at night.
The females, the friends, the Americans.

1282
02:03:47,833 --> 02:03:49,415
What I don't do.

1283
02:03:52,083 --> 02:03:54,165
They can imagine it, yes.

1284
02:03:57,041 --> 02:03:58,832
But they must remain in doubt...

1285
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:03,957
and that alone is not enough.

1286
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:17,915
Nino, what is done in secret...

1287
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:21,499
it can be done for 100 years.

1288
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:25,249
Ciao.

1289

- [Nino] Come on, come on!
- You're not going anywhere.

1301
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:39,207
Yes, that's right, mom.

1302
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:43,499
I'm not going anywhere.

on 9 December 1980 also on the emotional wave of

following the death of the two young Sicilians
