1
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,204
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,214
What?

3
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,775
Any real city, you walk,

4
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,430
you know?

5
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,918
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

6
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,728
In I.A., nobody touches you.

7
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,591
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

8
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,423
I think we miss that touch so much

9
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,364
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

10
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,034
You guys ok?

11
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,953
I think he hit his head.

12
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,605
You don't think that's true?

13
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,459
Stay in your car.

14
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,224
Graham,

15
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,089
I think we got rear-ended.

16
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,362
I think we spun around twice.

17
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:42,095
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

18
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,156
And I'm gonna go look for it.

19
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,418
Calm down, ma'am.

20
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,606
I am calm!

21
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,037
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

22
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,421
Why? It's not my fault!

23
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:55,336
It's her fault!

24
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,257
She do this!

25
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:56,984
My fault?

26
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,186
Ma'am, you really need to wait
in your vehicle.

27
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,214
My fault?
Stop in middle of street!

28
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,902
Mexicans no know how to drive.

29
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,173
She blake too fast.

30
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,947
I blake too fast?

31
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,585
I blake too fast.

32
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,214
I'm sorry you no see my blake light.

33
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:10,808
Ma'am.

34
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:14,378
See, I stop when I see a long line
of cars stopped in front of me.

35
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:17,341
Maybe you see over steering wheel,
you blake too!

36
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,507
Ma'am!
Crazy Mexican.

37
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,639
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

38
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,676
Officer, can you please write down
in your report,

39
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,798
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,371
Ma'am!

41
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:26,466
Ma'am, no. See.

42
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:27,703
Detective.

43
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,703
I don't care you cop!

44
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,043
You wanna see insurance!

45
00:04:31,797 --> 00:04:32,960
Look what you do to my car!
Alright.

46
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:33,940
Look to my car!

47
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,432
You fuck you too!
Calm down!

48
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,854
Fuck you too!

49
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,814
Stupid wetback blake my car...

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,099
Hey, Detective.

51
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:47,179
Nice entrance.
Fuck you.

52
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:51,449
Hey?

53
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,024
You ok?

54
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,895
I'm freezing.

55
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:55,781
Shit.

56
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,051
I heard it might snow.

57
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:59,186
Get out of here.

58
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,261
That's what I heard.

59
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:01,665
You got a smoke?

60
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,045
No. I quit.

61
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,036
Yeah, me too.

62
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,610
What do you got?

63
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,377
Dead kid.

64
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:19,824
Hey, Bob.

65
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,335
You get one free box of ammunition.

66
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:05,281
What kind do you want?

67
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,462
Yo, Osama!

68
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,449
Plan a Jihad on your own time.

69
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,386
What do you want?

70
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,231
What he is saying about Jihad?

71
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,557
Are you making insult at me?

72
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,015
Am I making insult at you?

73
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,430
Is that the closest
you can come to English?

74
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,703
Yes, I speak English!

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,803
I am American citizen.

76
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:34,672
Oh, God, here we go.

77
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:35,805
I have right like you.

78
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:37,831
I have right to buy gun.
Not in my store, you don't.

79
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,249
Andy, get him out of here now!
Dad, go wait in the car.

80
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,241
Now. Get out!

81
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:43,878
You're an ignorant man!

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,037
Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country

83
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,343
and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts

84
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,428
and incinerating your friends?

85
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,324
Get the fuck out of my store!
No, you get the fuck!

86
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,493
Now, come on.
Get out!

87
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,257
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me this man!

88
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,033
Andy, now!
Come on, let's go.

89
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,718
Go wait in the car. Ok.

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,854
I go to wait in the car.

91
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,963
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

92
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,268
And I am really hoping for the money.

93
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,694
What kind of ammunition do you want?
Whatever fits.

94
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:16,182
Oh, we got a lot of kinds.

95
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:19,269
We got long colts, short colts,
ball heads,

96
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,917
flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,

97
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,087
and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.

98
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,536
Just depends upon,

99
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,865
how much bang you can handle.

100
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,887
I'll take the ones in the red box.

101
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,968
You know what those are?

102
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,294
Can I have them?

103
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,656
Did you see any white people in there

104
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,133
waiting an hour and 32 minutes
for a plate of spaghetti?

105
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,223
And how many cups
of coffee did we get?

106
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,820
You don't drink coffee,
and I didn't want any.

107
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,228
Man, that woman in there
poured cup after cup

108
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,214
to every single white person around us,

109
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,307
but did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

110
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:07,357
We didn't get any coffee
that you didn't want and I didn't order,

111
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,567
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

112
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,615
Did you notice that
our waitress was black?

113
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,971
And black women
don't think in stereotypes?

114
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,242
You tell me something, man.

115
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,830
When was the last time you met one
who didn't think she knew everything

116
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,497
about your little lazy ass, before
you even opened your mouth.

117
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,201
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

118
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,346
We're black and black people don't tip.

119
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,006
So she wasn't gonna waste her time.

120
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,553
Now, somebody like that,

121
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,301
nothing you can do
to change their mind.

122
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,231
Yeah well, how much did you leave?

123
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,892
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

124
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,443
What?

125
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,700
What the fuck
is you laughing at, man?

126
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:42,697
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

127
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:43,380
Hardly.

128
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,364
I'd just like to see you
get through a meal without

129
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,874
calling her or anyone
else for that matter.

130
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,425
Ok look, no more phone calls tonight.
Alright, it's my fault.

131
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,047
Here, you can hold the battery.

132
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,022
Ok?

133
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,746
$10 says she calls you in the car.

134
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,581
Wait, wait, wait.

135
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,122
You see what that
woman just did?

136
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,206
You see that?
Why, she's cold.

137
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,318
She got colder as soon as
she saw us, dawg.

138
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,229
Oh, man, come on, don't start.

139
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,538
Man, look around you, man.

140
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:12,300
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

141
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,698
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

142
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,508
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

143
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,356
and her reaction is blind fear?

144
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,435
I mean look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

145
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:23,946
No.

146
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,075
Do we look threatening?

147
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:25,976
No.

148
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:28,377
Fact. If anybody should
be scared around here,

149
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:29,736
it's us.

150
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,165
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

151
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,491
patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.

152
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,790
So you tell me.

153
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:39,550
Why aren't we scared?

154
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,783
Because we got guns?

155
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:43,882
You could be right.

156
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,839
Get the fuck out of the car!

157
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:49,821
Give me the keys!

158
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,714
Come on. Hurry up!
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

159
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,757
Get down!

160
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,675
No, no! No, no! Please!
Don't look at me!

161
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,343
Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.

162
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,305
Turn around!

163
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:58,677
Come on, go!

164
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,418
We're good. We're fine.
Just keep moving.

165
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,081
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing
off of there right now.

166
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,336
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

167
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,738
Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.

168
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,439
You had a conversation with God?

169
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,527
What did God say?

170
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,824
Go forth, my son,

171
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,226
and leave big slobbery suction rings
on every dashboard you find?

172
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,747
Why the hell do you do that?

173
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,499
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

174
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,577
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

175
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,605
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of
the Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.

176
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,848
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

177
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,100
Wait a minute,
this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

178
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,415
Yeah. Name's Conklin.

179
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,896
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

180
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,445
I got the Mercedes.

181
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,106
Mercedes takes a shot at him.

182
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,064
Detective Conklin returns fire.
One shot.

183
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,968
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

184
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,923
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

185
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,875
He says he kept trying to drive away.

186
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:04,411
The Mercedes kept pulling up
next to him, screaming, waving a gun.

187
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,018
Shot back in self-defense.

188
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,162
Anybody actually see who shot first?

189
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:10,669
They just heard two bangs.

190
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,661
Find me a witness.

191
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,270
That is a nice gun.

192
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,650
Well, the car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

193
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,020
And that's not Cindy.

194
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,698
That is a William Lewis.

195
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,509
Found it under the front seat.

196
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,100
Hollywood Division.

197
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:50,361
Looks like Detective Conklin shot
himself the wrong nigger.

198
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,761
How much longer are you gonna be?

199
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,303
This is the last one.

200
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,704
Thank you.

201
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,800
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

202
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,894
I need to talk to you for a second.

203
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,745
You just give me a minute, alright?

204
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:26,361
And find Flanagan, will you?

205
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,678
Now.
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,550
Yes, honey?

207
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:32,505
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

208
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,450
You want...

209
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,551
Look, why don't
you just go lie down?

210
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,570
Have you checked on James?

211
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:38,130
Well, of course I've checked on James.

212
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,079
I've checked on him every five minutes
since we've been home.

213
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,252
Do not patronize me.

214
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:41,875
I'm...

215
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,587
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

216
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,001
It's ok.

217
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,771
Just go to bed, alright.

218
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,859
You know what, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

219
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,363
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

220
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,534
Is ok I go home now?

221
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,327
It's fine.
Thank you very much for staying, Maria.

222
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,442
You're welcome. No problem.

223
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,611
Good night, Miss Jean.
Good night.

224
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,775
We'll see you tomorrow.

225
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,932
I would like the locks changed again,

226
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:05,866
in the morning.

227
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,906
And you know what?

228
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,642
You might mention
that we'd appreciate it

229
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,516
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

230
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:11,789
A gang member?
Yes, yes.

231
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,124
What, you mean that kid in there?
Yes.

232
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,604
The guy in there with the shaved head,

233
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,030
the pants around his ass,
Oh come on.

234
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,709
The prison tattoo.
Those are not prison tattoos.

235
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,601
Oh, really?
And he's not gonna go sell our key

236
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,938
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

237
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,268
We've had a really tough night.

238
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,344
I think it'd be best
if you just went upstairs right now...

239
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,888
And, what?
Wait for them to break in?

240
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,338
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

241
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,350
You lower your voice!

242
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,145
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

243
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:37,148
But if a white person sees
two black men walking towards her,

244
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,216
and she turns and walks
in the other direction,

245
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,653
she's a racist, right?

246
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,482
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

247
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:46,086
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

248
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:47,200
Now, I am telling you.

249
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,328
Your amigo in there,

250
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,079
is gonna sell our key
to one of his homies.

251
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:54,397
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

252
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,320
Alright, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

253
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,364
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

254
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,117
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

255
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,763
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

256
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,576
Fuck!

257
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,917
Why did these guys have to be black?

258
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:39,262
I mean, why?

259
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,540
No matter how we spin this thing,

260
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,506
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

261
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,009
You know, I think you're worrying
too much.

262
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,885
You have a lot of support
in the black community.

263
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,807
Alright. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

264
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,416
What we need is a picture,

265
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:55,225
of me,

266
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:56,586
pinning a medal,

267
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,458
on a black man.

268
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,748
Bruce?

269
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:02,062
The firefighter.

270
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,914
The one who saved
the camp or something.

271
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,297
Northridge.
What's his name?

272
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,555
He's Iraqi.

273
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,786
He's Iraqi?

274
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,629
Well, he looks black.

275
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,846
He's dark-skinned sir, but...

276
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,703
he's Iraqi. His name's Saddam Khahum.

277
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,512
Saddam?

278
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,289
His name's Saddam?

279
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,096
Well, that's real good, Bruce.

280
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,336
Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

281
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,245
Give yourself a raise, will you?

282
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,748
It's been good doing business with you.

283
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,028
How soon can I have them?

284
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm picking them up right now.

285
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,118
Look, you're not listening to me.

286
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,639
This is an emergency.

287
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:40,185
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

288
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,263
Mr. Ryan,

289
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,709
your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

290
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,807
He is being treated
for a urinary tract infection.

291
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,031
That is by no means an emergency.

292
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,744
Now, if you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

293
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,876
why don't you make an appointment
to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,

294
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,053
Monday through Friday?

295
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,257
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

296
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,255
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

297
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:05,090
I wanna talk to your supervisor.
I am my supervisor.

298
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:07,422
Yeah, what is your name?
Shaniqua Johnson.

299
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,968
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

300
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,817
<i>1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>

301
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,636
<i>Vehicle described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>

302
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:35,910
<i>California plates,
4 Peter Charles lda 315.</i>

303
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:39,080
<i>Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.</i>

304
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,756
That's not it.

305
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,575
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

306
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,860
The driver's got to be 40, and nobody
jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.

307
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,169
They were doing something.

308
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,108
Enthusiastic.

309
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,776
Keep your hands
where I can see them, please.

310
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,783
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

311
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,596
No problem.

312
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:00,150
I'm gonna have to...

313
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,997
reach inside of the glove compartment
to get the registration.

314
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:03,950
Is that ok?

315
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,198
Nice and slow, please.

316
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,195
Ok.

317
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,341
How are you tonight, Officer?

318
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,110
Excellent.

319
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,520
Here you go.

320
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,127
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

321
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,224
Let's do it again right now.

322
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,221
Step out of the car, please, sir.

323
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,620
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

324
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,288
Then we should not have a problem.

325
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,858
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

326
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,001
No, it's ok.

327
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,435
It's fine.

328
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,739
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

329
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,034
That's good. Right there.

330
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,519
Look at me.

331
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,948
I want you to stand on your right foot.

332
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,158
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

333
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,823
I told you he doesn't drink.

334
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,048
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time
to stay in the vehicle.

335
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,728
Ma'am?
Honey.

336
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,301
Honey, I'm ok. I got this.

337
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:26,122
Don't you ma'am me.

338
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,719
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

339
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,359
Look Officer...

340
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,885
my wife has had a couple of drinks.
Alright.

341
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:32,919
Both of you turn around.

342
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,022
Put your hands on top of your head
and interlock your fingers.

343
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:35,745
No, wait. Wait.

344
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:38,537
We're only a block away from our house.
Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.

345
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,715
That's not even necessary.
Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.

346
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,141
Look, I'm a television director.

347
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,925
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

348
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:45,946
Get your hands off him.

349
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:47,436
He has done nothing wrong.

350
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,296
Put your hands
on top of your head, ma'am.

351
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:50,626
Will you just do what he says?

352
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:51,378
Fuck you!

353
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,676
Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.
And you keep your filthy fucking hands,

354
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:54,561
off me!

355
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,658
You mother fucking pig!

356
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,275
Christine, just stop talking.

357
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,595
That's quite a mouth you have.

358
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,738
Of course you know that.

359
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,886
Fuck you!

360
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,704
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

361
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:08,335
You thought you saw
a white woman blowing a black man,

362
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,790
and that just drove
your little cracker ass crazy.

363
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,557
Will you just shut your fucking mouth!

364
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,642
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

365
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,078
Put your legs open.

366
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,277
Now, do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

367
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,181
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

368
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,609
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

369
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,927
He's clean.

370
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,779
What do you think
we should do about this, Mr. Thayer?

371
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,966
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you,

372
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,288
while you were operating a motor vehicle.

373
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,551
That's reckless endangerment,

374
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,743
which, incidentally is a felony.

375
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,371
Now we can charge your wife here with

376
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,515
lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

377
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,019
Now you say you're a block from home.

378
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:58,564
Now, we could use our discretion

379
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,300
and let you go with a warning,

380
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:04,339
or we can cuff you
and put you in the back of the car.

381
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:09,063
What do you think we should do, sir?

382
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,080
Look we're sorry,

383
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,208
and...

384
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,444
we would appreciate if you
would just let us go with a warning,

385
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:25,320
please.

386
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,715
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

387
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,981
I think we can let him go.

388
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,377
Don't you?

389
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:40,750
Yeah.

390
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,453
Alright.

391
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:45,701
You can go.

392
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:57,647
You folks drive safe now.

393
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,591
Let's go, Tommy.

394
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,737
It won't close.

395
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,114
I can do that.

396
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,033
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

397
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,157
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun.

398
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,476
Here.

399
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,320
Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

400
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,849
Dorri, that man could've
killed your mother.

401
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:01,394
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

402
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,831
Farhad, it won't close.

403
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,479
Dorri, you should be at work.

404
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,011
Who are you calling?

405
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:27,093
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

406
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:31,259
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

407
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:32,905
Do you have any
idea how that felt?

408
00:23:33,116 --> 00:23:35,172
To have that pig's hands all over me?

409
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,154
And you just stood there.

410
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,127
And then you apologized to him?

411
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,820
I mean, what did you want me to do?

412
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:44,414
Get us both shot?

413
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,476
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard?

414
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,050
Pathetic.

415
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,153
Yeah, well, maybe you would have
been satisfied with just being arrested.

416
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:52,983
Oh, I get it.

417
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:57,578
Much better to let him shove his hand up
my crotch than get your name in the paper.

418
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:00,682
You know, you finally got me figured out,

419
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,649
because see, that's exactly
what I was worried about, right there.

420
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,802
Oh, and it wasn't?

421
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,123
You weren't afraid that all your
good friends at the studio

422
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,639
were gonna read
about you in the morning

423
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:11,017
and realize that, you know what,
he's actually black?

424
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,411
You need to calm down right now.

425
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:18,028
No what I need, is a husband
who will not just stand there,

426
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,498
while I am being molested!

427
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,668
I mean, they were cops,
for God's sakes!

428
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:23,044
They had guns!

429
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,964
You know what?
Maybe I should have let them arrest your ass.

430
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,100
I mean, sooner or later you got to find out
what it is really like to be black.

431
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,888
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

432
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,190
The closest you ever came
to being black Cameron,

433
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:37,611
was watching The Cosby Show.

434
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:40,771
Yeah, well at least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

435
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,100
Yeah, you're right Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

436
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:45,626
because I haven't quite
learned how to shuck and jive.

437
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,782
Let me hear it again.

438
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,085
Thank you, Mr. Policeman.

439
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,864
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

440
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,785
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

441
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:00,540
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

442
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,541
You know, fuck you!

443
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:06,973
That's good. A little anger.

444
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,748
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

445
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,923
How's it going?

446
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:00,786
Ok.

447
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,694
You didn't get scared or something,
did you?

448
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:07,126
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
Because I hate monsters.

449
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,597
There's no such thing as monsters.

450
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:11,460
That's a good thing.

451
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:13,563
I heard a bang.

452
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:15,413
Like a truck bang?

453
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:17,435
Like a gun.

454
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,828
That's funny,

455
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,963
because we moved out
of that bad neighborhood.

456
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,412
And there is not too many guns
around here.

457
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,697
How far can bullets go?

458
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,672
They go pretty far.

459
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,170
But...

460
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:40,348
they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

461
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:46,130
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

462
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,205
Because we never did find it, did we?

463
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,945
I think it didn't see me
because I was under the covers.

464
00:26:57,346 --> 00:26:59,825
And you think it was that same bullet
that you heard tonight?

465
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,386
You think we should move again?

466
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:06,654
I like it here.

467
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:09,353
Me, too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

468
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,668
Oh, hold on.

469
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,002
What?

470
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,870
So stupid!

471
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:16,092
How can I forget?

472
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,588
What?

473
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,616
No, forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

474
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,647
Tell me.

475
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,076
Ok.

476
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,929
When I was five,

477
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,398
this fairy came into my room one night.

478
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,303
Right.

479
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,314
See, I told you
you weren't gonna believe me.

480
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,689
Ok, go to sleep now, you little rat.
No, tell me.

481
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,655
Ok.

482
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,081
So this fairy comes
into my room,

483
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:44,746
and I'm like, Yeah, right, you're a fairy.

484
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,449
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

485
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:49,346
And she's flying all around the room,

486
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,091
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

487
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,753
She was flying?

488
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,658
Yeah, but she had
these little stubby wings.

489
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,132
She could've glued them on, you know?

490
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,609
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

491
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,224
So she said, I'll prove it.

492
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,842
So she reaches into her backpack,

493
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,540
and she pulls out this,

494
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,809
invisible cloak.

495
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,256
She ties it around my neck,

496
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,656
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

497
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,030
You know what impenetrable means?

498
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:14,829
It means that nothing can go through it.

499
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,873
No bullets. Nothing.

500
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:19,041
She told me that if I wore it,

501
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,907
nothing would hurt me.

502
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,326
So I did.

503
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,578
And...

504
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,081
my whole life, I never got shot,
stabbed. Nothing.

505
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,240
I mean, how weird is that?

506
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,257
Only she told me
that I was supposed to give it

507
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:34,548
to my daughter on her fifth birthday
and I forgot.

508
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,860
Can I touch it?

509
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,834
Sure, go ahead.

510
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,458
I don't feel it.

511
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:43,892
Yeah. It's pretty cool?

512
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:46,974
If you want I can take it off
and tie it around your shoulders.

513
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,030
She told me how to do it.

514
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,738
Unless you think it's stupid then...

515
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,608
Don't you need it?

516
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,070
No, not anymore.

517
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,326
So what do you think, you want it?

518
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,714
Ok, let's get out of here.

519
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,933
Ok.

520
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,276
Hold your chin up.

521
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,882
Ok. Is that too tight?

522
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,607
Do you feel anything at all?

523
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,340
Good. Then it's just right.

524
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,371
Do I take it off when I have a bath?

525
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,229
No, you leave it on all the time.

526
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,482
Until you have a daughter.

527
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,189
When she turns five,

528
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,069
then you give it to her.

529
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:00,596
Ok?

530
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:02,401
Ok.

531
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:05,929
Ok.

532
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,798
Good night, sweetie.

533
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,474
Good night.

534
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:53,681
No, no. You wanna listen
to music of the oppressor,

535
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,135
you go right ahead, man.

536
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,231
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

537
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,816
Listen to it, man.

538
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,360
Nigger this, nigger that.

539
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,769
You think white people go around
calling each other honkies all day, man?

540
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,614
Hey, honky, how's business?

541
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,832
Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.

542
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,975
How about this?

543
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,954
How about that? Listen
to that. You like that?

544
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,597
Man's singing about lynching niggers.

545
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:16,753
And you think there is a difference,
don't you?

546
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,605
♪ <i>Gonna buy me a rope

547
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:23,796

00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:35,830
Fred Hampton.

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,947
and sooner or later, they'll all copy it,

560
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,658
and nobody will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

561
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,910
End of problem.

562
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,205
What the fuck was that, dawg?

563
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,060
Holy shit!

564
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,582
What?
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

565
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,607
You're saying there is a Chinaman
under this truck?

566
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,025
What part don't you understand?

567
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,810
There's a Chinaman
stuck underneath the fucking truck.

568
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,365
Help me.

569
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,209
Oh, God.

570
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,940
What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

571
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,791
Man, this is so completely fucked up.

572
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,043
Oh, really? No shit!

573
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,249
Ok, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

574
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,881
Get back in the truck.
What?

575
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,634
Yes, get back in the truck.
You think we didn't drag him far enough?

576
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,269
No, no we gonna drive away.

577
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:53,513
And he gonna let go.

578
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,806
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
You know why?

579
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,934
Because he's stuck underneath
the fucking truck!

580
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,227
Now, if he could've let go,

581
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,522
he probably would have considered
that option about a half a block back.

582
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,232
Now, what you and I got to do,

583
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,358
just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

584
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,111
You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.

585
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,232
Then you gonna be standing
in the middle of the street

586
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,654
holding a Chinaman's arm.

587
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,015
Then what your ass gonna do?

588
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,497
If we leave this man here, he dies.

589
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,663
Then we're up for murder charges.

590
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,476
Now just grab his arm.

591
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:21,916
Why not just pull him out?

592
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,547
I don't wanna cause any problems,
Lieutenant.

593
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,914
I just want a new partner.

594
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,502
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

595
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,548
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

596
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,973
Well, he's been on the force
for a long time.

597
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,178
Seventeen years.

598
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,352
And I do have to work here, sir.

599
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,606
So,

600
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:44,522
you don't mind that there
is a racist prick on the force.

601
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,166
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

602
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,077
If you need me to go on record
about this sir, I will.

603
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,584
That'd be great.

604
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:52,984
Write a full report.

605
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:55,614
Because I'm anxious to understand
how an obvious bigot

606
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,250
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years,

607
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,749
11 of which he was under
my personal supervision,

608
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,354
which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

609
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,208
But that's not your concern.

610
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,968
I can't wait to read it.

611
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,632
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

612
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:13,752
So now you're saying he's not
a racist prick, you just don't like him.

613
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,142
Yes, sir.

614
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:17,620
That's not a good enough reason.

615
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,941
Well then, I guess I should think
of a better one and get back to you.

616
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,810
So you think
I'm asking you to make one up.

617
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:27,430
No, sir. I just can't think
of one right now.

618
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:29,660
You wanna know what I heard?

619
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,321
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

620
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,321
You want me to say he has flatulence?
Not him. You.

621
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,479
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

622
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:41,202
You're too embarrassed
to ride with anybody else,

623
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,829
so you're requesting a one-man car.

624
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,795
I'm not...

625
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:45,833
comfortable with that, Lieutenant.

626
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,066
I would not be either.

627
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,294
Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

628
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,388
Just like I'm sure you understand
how hard a black man has to work to get to,

629
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,231
say where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the LAPD

630
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,395
and how easily that can be taken away.

631
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,667
Now,

632
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:00,821
that being said,

633
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:01,975
it's your decision.

634
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:04,290
You can put your career
and mine on the line,

635
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,368
in pursuit of a just cause,

636
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,914
or you can admit to having an...

637
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:10,441
embarrassing problem,

638
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:12,672
of a personal nature.

639
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,652
Fuck.

640
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,363
Excuse me.

641
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,900
Excuse me. Sir?

642
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,585
You finished?

643
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,988
I replaced the lock.

644
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,993
But you got a real problem
with that door.

645
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,407
You fix the lock?

646
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,286
No, I replaced the lock.

647
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,618
But,

648
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,264
you got to fix that door.

649
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,525
Just fix the lock.

650
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:08,705
Sir, sir, sir.

651
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:09,664
Listen to me.

652
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,028
What you need,

653
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,712
is a new door.

654
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:15,023
I need new door?
Yeah.

655
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,513
Ok.

656
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,217
How much?

657
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,590
I don't...

658
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,669
Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

659
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,830
You try to cheat me, right?

660
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,642
You have a friend that fix door?

661
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,766
No, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

662
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:31,544
Then go and fix the fucking lock,
you cheater.

663
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,389
You...

664
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:33,816
You know what?

665
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,671
Why don't you just pay
for the lock and...

666
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,111
I won't charge you for the time.

667
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,322
You don't fix the lock! I pay?
What, you think I'm stupid?

668
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,991
You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!

669
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,157
Hey, I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me names.

670
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,786
Then fix the fucking lock!
I replaced the lock!

671
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,680
You got to fix the fucking door!

672
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,891
You cheat! You fucking cheater!

673
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:53,388
Fine.

674
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,103
Don't pay.
What?

675
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,058
Have a good night.

676
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,755
What? No. Wait!

677
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:00,530
Wait! You come back here!

678
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:01,761
You fix the lock!

679
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,975
Come here! You fix my lock!

680
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:05,685
Fix the fucking lock!

681
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,687
No, I understand.

682
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,334
You run over a Chinaman,

683
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:15,566
stuff him in the back,

684
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:18,610
then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

685
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,404
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

686
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,184
Georgie, burn this thing.

687
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,856
Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.

688
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:26,452
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

689
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,422
You watch the Discovery Channel?

690
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:30,111
Not a lot.

691
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:31,832
They got some good shit on that channel.

692
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,506
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a little blue light

693
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:40,189
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

694
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:44,652
bathroom fixtures and special-edition
plastic Burger King tray cups.

695
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,403
Then the next thing they show
is some stupid redneck in handcuffs

696
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:52,116
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

697
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,942
Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channel

698
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:57,820
when they break in to arrest him.

699
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,927
And he still can't figure out
how on earth they could've caught him!

700
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:14,029
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

701
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:18,002
No.
Then get the fuck out of my shop.

702
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,100
Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.

703
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:27,342
Without him, things could've gone
really fucking wrong tonight.

704
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,832
Fuck!

705
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,289
Don't. Don't!

706
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,881
Could you please...
Don't you dare.

707
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:33,874
Don't!

708
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:36,260
Graham Waters.

709
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,725
No.

710
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,390
No, he's not here, Ma.

711
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,054
It's your mother?

712
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,416
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

713
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:49,264
Look, he'll be home when he...
Just leave it alone, Ma.

714
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,059
Ma, I can't talk to you right now, ok?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

715
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:54,867
Ok.

716
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,302
Ok, where were we?

717
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,587
I was white and you were about
to jerk off in the shower.

718
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,852
Oh, shit.

719
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,175
Come on.

720
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:06,925
I would have said you were Mexican,

721
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,779
but I don't think
it would have pissed her off as much.

722
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:12,953
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance?

723
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:15,583
What, you start to feel something
and panic.

724
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,865
Come on, Ria.

725
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:19,304
You're just pissed
because I answered the phone.

726
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:22,442
That's just where I begin to get pissed.

727
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:23,713
I mean really,

728
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:26,212
what kind of man speaks
to his mother that way?

729
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,934
Oh, this is about my mother.

730
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:30,201
What do you know
about my mother?

731
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:32,034
I know if I was your father,

732
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,913
I'd kick your fucking ass.

733
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,298
Ok. I was raised badly.

734
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:39,563
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?

735
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,389
You want a lesson?

736
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,512
I'll give you a lesson.

737
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,269
How about a geography lesson?

738
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,431
My father's from Puerto Rico.

739
00:39:46,433 --> 00:39:48,344
My mother's from El Salvador.

740
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,176
Neither one of those is Mexico.

741
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,162
Well, then I guess the big mystery is,

742
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,394
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

743
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,230
and taught them all
how to park their cars on their lawns?

744
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,115
Pop, you ok?

745
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,513
If I could piss, I'd be ok.

746
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,561
I'm...

747
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,084
Jesus.

748
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:39,698
I'm done now.

749
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,469
Give me a hand.

750
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,126
Wait a goddamn minute.

751
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,840
Wait a minute.

752
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:50,504
Wait a minute.

753
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,302
Alright. Ok.
Ok.

754
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:55,962
Ok.
There you go.

755
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,211
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

756
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,714
I got to go back.
Ok.

757
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,104
What, are you gonna stand there
and stare at me?

758
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,194
So Conklin just shot him?

759
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,052
They know each other?
Sir.

760
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,574
This a grudge thing?

761
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,149
Not as far as we can tell.

762
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,018
You think this is racially motivated?

763
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,921
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

764
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,494
Who do we have on it?

765
00:42:48,496 --> 00:42:49,512
Graham Waters.

766
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,900
Waters.

767
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,022
Alright, well tell him that
he speaks to no one but me.

768
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,739
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

769
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,741
And would someone please
find Flanagan?

770
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,806
What up, Mo Phat?
What's up?

771
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:06,405
Man robs purses from old ladies
and you all.

772
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:08,115
Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?

773
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:10,620
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

774
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,848
You calling him a thief?

775
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,258
And we do what?

776
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:16,397
The man steals from black people.

777
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:18,388
Only reason black people
steal from their own

778
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,388
is because they terrified of white people.

779
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:21,848
Oh man, please.

780
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,889
Think about it.

781
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:25,436
Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

782
00:43:25,677 --> 00:43:28,077
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

783
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:30,647
Now, drop Mo Phat off
at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,

784
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,616
that nigger will run like a rabbit
soon as somebody say decaf latte.

785
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,352
What the fuck did you do to my car?

786
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,499
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

787
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,586
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

788
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,854
James wanted to take this to school,

789
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,884
but I don't want the kids to fight over it.

790
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:58,329
Are these clean or dirty?

791
00:43:59,078 --> 00:44:00,553
All clean, señora.

792
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,338
You know Maria,
just once I would like to wake up

793
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,496
and find these dishes in the cabinet.

794
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:08,612
Ok? Sí, señora.

795
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:09,724
No problem.

796
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,891
I'm starting to understand now.

797
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:14,082
By your work,

798
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:16,111
you're setting an example
for our neighborhood.

799
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,348
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

800
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,240
Well, yeah, you laugh, man.

801
00:44:21,384 --> 00:44:24,855
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

802
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,582
What the hell do you think
you doing right now, man?

803
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,010
Waving down the bus.

804
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:34,013
Man, put your hand down, dawg!
Are you out of your mind?

805
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,047
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

806
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:38,383
No. I was hoping we could push
your car across town.

807
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:39,251
You know why?

808
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:40,945
Because we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

809
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,179
You have no idea, do you?

810
00:44:43,523 --> 00:44:45,732
You have no idea
why they put them great big windows

811
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:47,058
on the sides of buses, do you?

812
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:47,885
Why?

813
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:49,643
One reason only.

814
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:53,209
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to riding on them.

815
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,952
How do you know that?

816
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:58,095
You know, you could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

817
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,725
Oh, you know,
the Kings are playing tonight.

818
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,919
You don't like hockey!

819
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,164
The only reason you say
you do is to piss me off!

820
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,119
I love hockey.

821
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,403
Cut! Print. Moving on.

822
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:10,438
Ok, that takes us into scene 12,

823
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,457
and we are in the bathroom.

824
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,289
Jamal,

825
00:45:13,862 --> 00:45:15,432
that's what I'm talking about.

826
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,759
Right on.

827
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,615
Cam, Cam, you got a second?

828
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,685
Yeah, Fred. I just
wanna grab some coffee.

829
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:25,166
Yeah, listen,
I think we needed another take, buddy.

830
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,507
That looked pretty terrific, man.

831
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,057
This is gonna sound strange but is

832
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,187
Jamal seeing a speech
coach or something?

833
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,813
What do you mean?

834
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,876
Have you noticed...

835
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,438
I mean, this is weird
for a white guy to say,

836
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,470
but have you noticed,

837
00:45:39,895 --> 00:45:42,068
he's talking a lot less black lately?

838
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:46,242
No, I haven't noticed that.
Really?

839
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,692
Like in this scene,

840
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,788
he was supposed to say,
Don't be talking about that.

841
00:45:50,024 --> 00:45:52,188
And he changed it to,
Don't talk to me about that.

842
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:54,792
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You think because of that,

843
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:58,171
the audience won't recognize him
as being a black man?

844
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,253
Come on.

845
00:45:59,392 --> 00:46:00,841
Is there a problem, Cam?

846
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,716
Excuse me?

847
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:04,929
Is there a problem, Cam?

848
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:12,352
No, we don't have a problem.

849
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,098
I mean, because all I'm saying is...

850
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,473
it's not his character.

851
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,964
Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,
not Jamal, right?

852
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,453
I mean, you're the expert here,

853
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:22,291
but to me, it rings false.

854
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:28,350
We're gonna do it one more time.

855
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:30,120
Thanks, buddy.

856
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,498
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

857
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,032
Jamal, can we...

858
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,714
Morning, Carol. Who do I have?

859
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:45,719
Hold for a minute, please.

860
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:49,555
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

861
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,311
Send him in.

862
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,773
Mr. Ryan.
Yeah.

863
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,025
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

864
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:03,143
I believe we spoke last night.

865
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,708
Oh, yeah.

866
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,448
I wanted to apologize about that.

867
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:08,981
I haven't been getting too much sleep.

868
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,527
My father's in a lot of pain.

869
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:12,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

870
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:16,916
This doctor he's been seeing
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

871
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:19,170
But he's been taking this medicine
for a month now,

872
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:20,565
and he just keeps getting worse.

873
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:22,761
And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?

874
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:23,499
Yeah.

875
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,828
Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

876
00:47:26,127 --> 00:47:26,898
Really?

877
00:47:27,034 --> 00:47:29,740
Well, no offense,
but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.

878
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,639
I think his nurses
are doing most of the work.

879
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:33,828
If you're unhappy,

880
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,770
your father's welcome to see
a doctor outside the network.

881
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:40,857
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

882
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:44,301
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

883
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:47,385
Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
Then what good is that gonna do?

884
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:51,077
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

885
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,400
Alright. Well, you know what I can't do?

886
00:47:54,974 --> 00:47:56,770
I can't look at you
without thinking about

887
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:59,959
the five or six more-qualified
white men who didn't get your job.

888
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,419
It's time for you to go.

889
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,340
Now, I'm saying this because
I'm really hoping that I'm wrong about you.

890
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,710
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

891
00:48:06,903 --> 00:48:08,801
someone who may have been given
a helping hand,

892
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,596
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

893
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,641
Carol, I need security in my office.

894
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,212
You know, you don't like me, that's fine.

895
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:16,521
I'm a prick.

896
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:19,439
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

897
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,229
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

898
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,974
Saved enough to start
his own company.

899
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,920
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

900
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:28,324
Paid them equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

901
00:48:28,946 --> 00:48:31,239
For 30 years he worked
side by side with those men,

902
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,491
sweeping and carrying garbage.

903
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:35,488
And then the city council decides

904
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,606
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

905
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,055
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

906
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:44,603
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything.

907
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,291
Not once does he blame your people.

908
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:52,181
I'm not asking you to help me.

909
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,946
I'm asking that you do this small thing,

910
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,045
for a man who lost everything

911
00:48:57,428 --> 00:48:59,685
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

912
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,349
And do you know what
it's gonna cost you?

913
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:02,898
Nothing.

914
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:05,603
Just a flick of your pen.

915
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:10,321
Your father sounds like a good man.

916
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:12,002
And if he'd come in here today,

917
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:14,667
I probably would have
approved this request.

918
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:16,412
But he didn't come in.

919
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,537
You did. And for his sake,
it's a real shame.

920
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,635
Get him the hell out of my office.
Prick.

921
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,035
Yeah sir, I spoke to our employee,

922
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:33,928
and he told you you needed to replace
or repair the door.

923
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,930
He say he fix the lock.

924
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,072
You come here, see how fixed it is!

925
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:39,182
<i>You're yelling again.</i>

926
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,879
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

927
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:44,656
Yes, I am.
Mom, are you alright?

928
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,282
Stop washing.

929
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,283
Insurance must take picture.

930
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:50,200
Ok?

931
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:52,387
Yes.

932
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,490
Look what they wrote.

933
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,313
They think we're Arab.

934
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:57,402
Please, you come see my store.

935
00:49:57,404 --> 00:49:58,786
When did Persian become Arab?

936
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,749
I want. I want his name.

937
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:01,915
Yes.

938
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,157
Oh, my God.

939
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,292
I want his name!
Dad.

940
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,711
Give me his name!
Dad.

941
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,203
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

942
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:09,587
Dad, did they take the gun?

943
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,439
Not fix my lock!
I want his name!

944
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,112
Baba.

945
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,301
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
<i>Don't hang up!</i>

946
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,336
Don't hang up! Shit!

947
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,401
Oh, thank God.

948
00:51:05,581 --> 00:51:06,519
Mom?

949
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,693
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

950
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,683
Did you find your brother?

951
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,861
No, Mom.

952
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,273
Because I was doing good.

953
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,320
I was doing real good.

954
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:01,033
I know, Mom.
I was doing good.

955
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,959
It's ok.

956
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,262
Did you find your brother?

957
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,786
No, Mom.

958
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,645
Tell him to come home.

959
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,348
Tell him I'm not mad.

960
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:34,549
Ok?

961
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,053
Ok, baby?

962
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,851
Ok, Mom.

963
00:52:39,563 --> 00:52:40,905
Ok, baby.

964
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,170
Ok.

965
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,958
Did you apologize to your mother?

966
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:25,406
She wasn't there.

967
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:29,219
Internal Affairs called.

968
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:31,127
Found something in the Mercedes.

969
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,411
That's lunch. One hour.

970
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,255
I tried to call.

971
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,847
Sounded like you were having
a bad day?

972
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:09,932
Yeah.

973
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,832
What?

974
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:19,588
I got scared, Cam.

975
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,292
You know, it's not like...

976
00:54:22,505 --> 00:54:24,889
I haven't been pulled
over before, you know?

977
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,690
But nothing like that.

978
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,193
And yes, I was a little drunk

979
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,964
and I was mouthing off.

980
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,146
I'm sorry.

981
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,527
But when that man
was putting his hands on me...

982
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,990
I don't wanna talk about it.
I just...

983
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:45,579
I couldn't believe
you'd let him do that, baby.

984
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:51,161
Look, I know what you did,
was the right thing. Ok?

985
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,509
But I was humiliated.

986
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,789
For you.

987
00:54:58,218 --> 00:55:01,294
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

988
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,619
Yeah.

989
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:05,514
That's what happened.

990
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,409
Oh, baby, don't do this.

991
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:08,898
No. No, you're right.
Come on.

992
00:55:09,164 --> 00:55:10,240
I ain't doing it.

993
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,378
You gonna walk away from me?

994
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:15,796
Cameron!
Just go home.

995
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,607
I understand.

996
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,033
Thanks.

997
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,336
Has your father read his policy?

998
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:35,915
He doesn't read English.

999
00:55:36,474 --> 00:55:37,469
What he is saying?

1000
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,891
He ask if you read the policy.

1001
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,380
Mr. Golzari,

1002
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,022
you said that you called the locksmith?

1003
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:45,844
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

1004
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:48,948
They said that their man told you...

1005
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,176
to fix the door and you didn't do so.

1006
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:56,176
Are you saying it's his fault?

1007
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,933
Insurance company
is calling it negligence.

1008
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:02,372
They're not covering any of this.

1009
00:56:11,115 --> 00:56:11,783
No.

1010
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,870
This store is all we have.

1011
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,595
I really am sorry.

1012
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,735
What time you must go to work?

1013
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,420
Not until tonight.

1014
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,540
Go home and sleep.

1015
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,466
It's ok. It's ok.

1016
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:09,996
Go home and sleep.

1017
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:33,693
Hey.

1018
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,643
Maybe...

1019
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:38,944
they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

1020
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,358
Yeah, they told me.

1021
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,639
I just wanted to say good luck,

1022
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:46,037
and it was good riding with you.

1023
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,158
You, too.

1024
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,250
Wait till you've been on the job,

1025
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:54,694
a few more years.

1026
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,785
Yeah.
Look at me, look at me.

1027
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:00,938
Wait till you've been doing it
a little longer.

1028
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,357
You think you know who you are?

1029
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,295
You have no idea.

1030
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:14,623
Yo, Gomez,

1031
00:58:14,847 --> 00:58:16,242
you ready to roll, homie?

1032
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:17,352
Ready, amigo.

1033
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:29,713
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

1034
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,037
<i>21-L-23,</i>

1035
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:34,750
<i>picking up strange
noises from your car.</i>

1036
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,013
<i>Likewise, 21-L.</i>

1037
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,413
<i>Is your mike open by any chance?</i>

1038
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,537
Call it in.

1039
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,647
Ma'am?
Can you hear me?

1040
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,525
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

1041
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,944
Alright. Get an extinguisher,
and get that fire out.

1042
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:39,946
Jesus.

1043
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,203
Ma'am,

1044
01:01:45,028 --> 01:01:46,130
are you hurt?

1045
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,828
Can you move?

1046
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,707
I can't breathe.

1047
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,299
Ok. Ok, I'm gonna get you out.

1048
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:04,150
It's ok.

1049
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,684
Ok. Ok.

1050
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,311
Ok, I'm gonna get you out.

1051
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,360
No.
It's ok.

1052
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,244
Get away from me.
It's ok.

1053
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,198
Get away from me.
Stay away from me.

1054
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,826
Not you!
Fuck it.

1055
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,048
Not you!

1056
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:29,996
It's ok.

1057
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,451
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1058
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,823
Keep away from me!

1059
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,000
Lady, I'm trying...
I'm trying to help you.

1060
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:36,935
Fuck you!

1061
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:39,088
Not you!

1062
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,339
Somebody! Anybody else!

1063
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,258
Please, somebody!
Stop moving!

1064
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,593
Not you!

1065
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,353
No!

1066
01:02:46,753 --> 01:02:48,751
Get your filthy fucking hands off me!

1067
01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:49,852
Stop moving.
No!

1068
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,028
Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!

1069
01:02:58,302 --> 01:02:59,041
Ok.

1070
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:00,594
Ok.

1071
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,320
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

1072
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,855
I'm not gonna touch you.

1073
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,550
But there is nobody else here yet,
and that's gasoline there.

1074
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,327
We need to get you
out of here right away.

1075
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:13,915
Ok?

1076
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,684
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1077
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,710
Ok.

1078
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:19,752
I need to...

1079
01:03:20,188 --> 01:03:21,503
reach across your lap.

1080
01:03:21,622 --> 01:03:22,750
Can I do that, please?

1081
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,052
Yeah. Yeah.

1082
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,726
Thanks.

1083
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,632
Is anything broken?

1084
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:39,902
I don't think so.

1085
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,900
Ok. I think that's good.

1086
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,507
Are you gonna get me out?

1087
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:47,160
Yeah.

1088
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,574
I'm gonna get you out. Ok?

1089
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,288
Look at me. Look at me.

1090
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:52,629
I'm gonna get you out.

1091
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,502
Oh, fuck!

1092
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:01,803
I'm sorry.

1093
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,178
That's ok.

1094
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,284
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, ok?

1095
01:04:09,014 --> 01:04:10,207
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

1096
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,682
It's ok, it's ok.

1097
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:14,998
It's ok. It's ok.

1098
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,269
Ok, we're gonna get you out.

1099
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,866
Everything's gonna be fine.

1100
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:18,776
Look at me.

1101
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:21,038
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

1102
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,694
Everything's gonna be fine.

1103
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:43,127
Ryan!

1104
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,622
Pull!

1105
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,187
It's ok.

1106
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:43,684
It's ok.

1107
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:45,950
It's ok.

1108
01:05:46,184 --> 01:05:47,274
You're gonna be ok.

1109
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,593
Alright. Here we go.

1110
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:50,173
It's ok, it's ok.

1111
01:05:50,175 --> 01:05:51,143
It's alright.

1112
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,334
I got it now. I got it.

1113
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,201
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?

1114
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,386
It's cool, it's cool. It's ok.

1115
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,183
Here we go. Alright.

1116
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:03,409
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

1117
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,887
The DA wanted me to apologize.

1118
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,451
He really wanted
to be here himself.

1119
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,614
No, he didn't.

1120
01:06:38,692 --> 01:06:40,411
If he did his own dirty work,
none of us would have jobs.

1121
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,747
Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
Graham Waters.

1122
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,021
Thanks for coming in, Detective.

1123
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:45,334
He just pulled into the garage.

1124
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,737
Great, great. Press conference

1125
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:48,330
is in 10 minutes,
so we'll make this short.

1126
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:52,340
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has
two suspicious shootings on his record.

1127
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,387
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

1128
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,250
Detective Lewis makes
black man number three.

1129
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,266
You know any reason
why we should not hang Conklin for this?

1130
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:03,139
Well, it's...

1131
01:07:03,445 --> 01:07:05,693
it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

1132
01:07:07,659 --> 01:07:09,525
We found $300,000,

1133
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:11,920
in the trunk of the car that
Detective Lewis was driving.

1134
01:07:13,499 --> 01:07:14,446
Shit!

1135
01:07:16,648 --> 01:07:19,617
Go down to the garage, tell him to stay
in the car until he hears from me.

1136
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,322
You found the money in the Mercedes.

1137
01:07:22,464 --> 01:07:23,953
I thought that wasn't his car.

1138
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:26,415
Well, the car's actually registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

1139
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,293
We haven't been able
to get in touch with her, yet.

1140
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,484
Apparently, she...

1141
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:31,255
left town this morning.

1142
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:33,464
So it wasn't Lewis' car.

1143
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,372
He may not have even known
the money was in it.

1144
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:44,005
Do you really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

1145
01:07:47,682 --> 01:07:49,690
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

1146
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,900
These names ring a bell, Detective?
Yeah, vaguely.

1147
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,418
We have attorneys for,

1148
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,588
this slain police officer
camping in our offices.

1149
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:02,256
We have his mother and a half a
dozen men of the cloth who swear,

1150
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:04,574
that Lewis was one
of the twelve apostles of Christ.

1151
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,504
We have two black city councilmen
and a congresswoman

1152
01:08:07,506 --> 01:08:10,169
who call on the hour, every hour,
demanding to know,

1153
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:12,336
what the District Attorney
intends to do about this.

1154
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,209
And you want him
to walk into that press room

1155
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:17,353
and tell them all
that the situation is complicated?

1156
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:25,746
Give us a minute.

1157
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,472
No problem.

1158
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,436
Who knows about the money?

1159
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,828
You got to be kidding me.

1160
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:43,125
There are only two people in this room.

1161
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,082
Myself, my partner,

1162
01:08:47,084 --> 01:08:48,707
Ferguson and internal Affairs.

1163
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,883
Jim Ferguson?
Yeah.

1164
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:56,328
Ok.

1165
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:58,054
Ok, I guess I don't see a problem.

1166
01:08:58,148 --> 01:09:01,333
As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money
isn't clear evidence of any wrong-doing.

1167
01:09:01,335 --> 01:09:02,371
And even if it was,

1168
01:09:02,373 --> 01:09:04,164
we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.

1169
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,773
Which means the money internal Affairs

1170
01:09:05,775 --> 01:09:07,626
is holding can't even
be considered evidence.

1171
01:09:08,557 --> 01:09:11,018
What? You know, you can
do this whole dance if you want to,

1172
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,442
but I'm willing to bet

1173
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:14,607
when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

1174
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,456
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

1175
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:20,345
Fucking black people?

1176
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:22,436
What did you just say?

1177
01:09:22,828 --> 01:09:23,834
I mean...

1178
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,566
You know, I know all the
sociological reasons why per capita

1179
01:09:27,568 --> 01:09:30,185
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

1180
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:32,000
Schools are a disgrace.

1181
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,594
Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

1182
01:09:34,596 --> 01:09:36,503
All that stuff. All that stuff!

1183
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,569
But still it's...

1184
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:40,963
it's got to get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

1185
01:09:40,965 --> 01:09:43,552
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

1186
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,102
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth,

1187
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,986
but that's the way it always plays,
doesn't it?

1188
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,057
And assholes like Lewis
just keep feeding the flames.

1189
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,182
It's got to get to you.

1190
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:00,357
What did you say you did
for the DA again?

1191
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:02,614
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

1192
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,116
Oh, please, don't do that.

1193
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:07,452
Don't act like you know
something about me, ok?

1194
01:10:07,634 --> 01:10:09,291
What do you think those kids need?

1195
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,746
To make them believe,
to give them hope?

1196
01:10:11,748 --> 01:10:12,966
You think they need another...

1197
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,291
drug-dealing cop

1198
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,961
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

1199
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:19,130
Why don't you cut through
the bullshit, Flanagan,

1200
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,711
and just tell me what it is you want?

1201
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:26,666
The DA's squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

1202
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:30,600
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

1203
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,713
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

1204
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:37,644
And the right message is,
Look at this black boy I just bought?

1205
01:10:38,928 --> 01:10:40,404
Well, fuck you very much,

1206
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:41,861
but thanks for thinking of me.

1207
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:45,396
Actually, we were thinking of you.

1208
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:48,558
Until we saw that.

1209
01:10:50,634 --> 01:10:51,822
It's your brother's file.

1210
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,999
Twenty something years old
and already three felonies.

1211
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,961
Three-strikes law.
Kid's going away for life for stealing a car.

1212
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,587
Christ, that's a shitty law.

1213
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,191
There's a warrant in there.

1214
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:03,719
But still, hey...

1215
01:11:04,604 --> 01:11:06,262
he had every opportunity you had.

1216
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:11,045
Fucking black people?

1217
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,022
So all...

1218
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:23,151
All I need to do to make this disappear
is to frame a potentially innocent man?

1219
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:25,911
What are you?
The fucking defender of all things white?

1220
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:30,034
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

1221
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,538
And you're arguing with me
that maybe we're not being fair to him?

1222
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:36,795
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.

1223
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:37,916
Maybe Lewis did provoke this

1224
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,061
and maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

1225
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:43,987
Or maybe, stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

1226
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:45,633
was enough to get him killed.

1227
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,672
There was no one there
to see who shot first,

1228
01:11:48,674 --> 01:11:49,807
so there is no way to know.

1229
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:51,074
Which means we...

1230
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:53,132
could get this wrong.

1231
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,238
Maybe that's what
happened with your brother.

1232
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,570
Maybe we got it wrong.

1233
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,579
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

1234
01:12:03,947 --> 01:12:05,589
You're the one closest to all this.

1235
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:07,355
You need to tell us.

1236
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,009
What does your gut tell you?

1237
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:27,997
So...

1238
01:12:28,815 --> 01:12:29,737
Graham.

1239
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:31,294
What do I tell them?

1240
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,041
You tell me...

1241
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,866
and I'll tell them.

1242
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,584
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

1243
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,927
it's pretty clear what happened last night.

1244
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,560
Ok.

1245
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,538
Before I get to why we're here,

1246
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:15,239
I know that many of you have heard
that we had our car stolen last night.

1247
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,841
And as you could imagine,

1248
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:20,732
my wife and I are both
pretty shaken up but...

1249
01:13:21,282 --> 01:13:22,134
we're ok.

1250
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:25,630
And Jean and I truly appreciate
all your calls and your concern.

1251
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:26,756
Thank you.

1252
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:27,870
Now,

1253
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:31,156
just after 9:00 p.m. last night,

1254
01:13:31,771 --> 01:13:34,090
Detective William Lewis,
an eight-year veteran of the force

1255
01:13:34,092 --> 01:13:35,830
and an active member
of the black community,

1256
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,540
was gunned down by a fellow officer.

1257
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,054
Hi, sweetie.

1258
01:13:57,891 --> 01:13:59,350
Bye, Lara.

1259
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:39,641
Get out of the car!

1260
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,429
Give me the keys! Get out the...

1261
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:42,436
What the fuck?

1262
01:14:44,805 --> 01:14:45,938
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1263
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:46,828
Shit!

1264
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,816
You wanna get killed, nigger?
Say that again!

1265
01:14:48,954 --> 01:14:49,594
What the...

1266
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,486
Say that again, bitch!
You stupid motherfucker!

1267
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:54,791
Say it again?

1268
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:56,783
Call me a nigger again! Christ!

1269
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,590
Yo, man, what the fuck?
Get off of him.

1270
01:14:58,833 --> 01:14:59,578
Fuck you!

1271
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,365
Shoot him!
Fucking blow your head off!

1272
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,452
Shoot this motherfucker, man!

1273
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:05,249
I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1274
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,717
Stop talking and shoot!

1275
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,586
Come on, stop! Let's go!

1276
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,381
Shit, here comes the police.
Shit.

1277
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,823
Get off of me.
Fuck off.

1278
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:12,719
Jesus.

1279
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:14,581
Hey, hey. Where you going, man?

1280
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,790
Hell, no!

1281
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,929
Oh, shit.
Anthony! Anthony!

1282
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,827
Get the fuck out of my car!

1283
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,768
Shit! Damn!

1284
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,728
What are you doing, man?
Get out of the car!

1285
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,653
Fuck you!

1286
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,482
Get the fuck out of my car!
You get the fuck out of the car!

1287
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:32,940
Unit 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
Westbound on...

1288
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,202
I will blow you away. Get the fuck out!

1289
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:42,954
2-2 lda Tom Adam 3...

1290
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,497
Oh, Christ!

1291
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:52,386
Get the fuck out of the car!
You get the fuck out of the car!

1292
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,632
Get out of the fucking car!
It's my fucking car!

1293
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,676
It's my fucking gun!
Fuck, it's my gun now!

1294
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,302
You just give me my fucking gun!

1295
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,812
Fuck!

1296
01:16:11,507 --> 01:16:13,731
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1297
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,106
Hands in plain sight!

1298
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,430
Step out of the vehicle!

1299
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,484
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

1300
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,035
Get out of my car.

1301
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,659
Oh, you so brave,
you get out the car, man.

1302
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,261
Turn off the engine.

1303
01:16:35,263 --> 01:16:37,005
Throw the keys out the window.

1304
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:51,459
You fucking want me?

1305
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:52,941
Here I am, you pig fuck!

1306
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,191
Lie face down on the ground.
Spread your arms and legs.

1307
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,653
No, you lie face down on the ground
and spread your arms and legs.

1308
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,562
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

1309
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:01,115
Fuck you, man!
What are you gonna do?

1310
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,385
Pull the fucking trigger, then!
On your knees now!

1311
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:04,450
You get on your knees

1312
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:06,816
and suck my motherfucking dick
while you down there.

1313
01:17:06,818 --> 01:17:08,657
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

1314
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:10,666
Yeah, that's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

1315
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,213
This man is making threatening gestures.
Threatening gestures?

1316
01:17:13,283 --> 01:17:14,766
You wanna see a threatening gesture?

1317
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:16,253
I got a threatening gesture for you.

1318
01:17:16,255 --> 01:17:17,322
I know this man!

1319
01:17:17,324 --> 01:17:19,209
I know this man!
Get back.

1320
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,042
Fuck off. Give me some space.
I know this guy.

1321
01:17:21,044 --> 01:17:22,469
Get out of the way.
You don't fucking know me.

1322
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,277
Step away!

1323
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,487
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

1324
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:28,606
Man, don't walk up on me!

1325
01:17:28,608 --> 01:17:29,864
See what's happening here?

1326
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:32,188
Do you wanna die here?
Is that what you want?

1327
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,190
Because these guys
really wanna shoot you.

1328
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:37,068
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

1329
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,105
Fuck you!

1330
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:39,041
Fuck me?
Step away!

1331
01:17:39,043 --> 01:17:40,548
Fuck me?
I'm not the one who's fucked here.

1332
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,598
You're the one who's fucked here.

1333
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,032
Because you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

1334
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,282
and onto that man's patio.

1335
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,911
Officer Hanson, step away.
He's a friend of mine, ok?

1336
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:49,691
He's a fucking friend of mine!
This man is not armed!

1337
01:17:49,693 --> 01:17:52,361
He's not gonna shoot you, or me,
or anybody else, alright?

1338
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,877
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

1339
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,588
Lower your firearm!
Lower your firearm!

1340
01:18:03,234 --> 01:18:04,889
Are you starting
to understand the situation?

1341
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:07,859
What do you want from me?

1342
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,726
Unless you think your wife

1343
01:18:11,182 --> 01:18:13,896
is gonna be better off with a husband
who has a bloody stump for a head,

1344
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,107
I want you to sit down on that curb,
put your hands on your head,

1345
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,109
and do nothing
until I speak with these officers.

1346
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,364
I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not putting
my hands on my head for nobody.

1347
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,114
Then stand right where you are

1348
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:25,214
and keep your hands in plain sight.
Can you do that?

1349
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:30,071
Yeah, I can do that.

1350
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,798
Good.

1351
01:18:33,402 --> 01:18:36,320
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

1352
01:18:37,334 --> 01:18:40,013
This man better be related
to you by blood,

1353
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,745
because this is fucking nuts.

1354
01:18:41,747 --> 01:18:43,271
I need this favor.

1355
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,763
You can check the guy's name,
his license.

1356
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:47,556
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1357
01:18:48,272 --> 01:18:49,761
I need to let him go with a warning.

1358
01:18:50,843 --> 01:18:52,496
What kind of fucking warning?

1359
01:18:53,341 --> 01:18:54,896
A harsh warning.

1360
01:18:58,316 --> 01:18:59,568
Thank you.

1361
01:19:03,377 --> 01:19:04,809
You've been warned.
Do you understand me?

1362
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,366
Do you understand me?

1363
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,707
You want something from me?

1364
01:19:09,237 --> 01:19:10,370
Because I'm right here.

1365
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,489
Look, I'm trying to help you.

1366
01:19:12,717 --> 01:19:14,736
I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1367
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:17,762
Go home.

1368
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,040
Yeah, that I can do.

1369
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,957
Look at me.

1370
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,426
You embarrass me.

1371
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,460
You embarrass yourself.

1372
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:35,994
Daddy's home!

1373
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,037
What's up?
Give me my money!

1374
01:21:58,121 --> 01:21:59,626
What? What money?

1375
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:00,468
Daddy!

1376
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,141
To pay for my store.
Give me my money!

1377
01:22:02,143 --> 01:22:04,002
Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1378
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,303
You give me my money.
Daddy.

1379
01:22:06,785 --> 01:22:08,839
I want my fucking money!
Give me that truck.

1380
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,341
That's not my truck, bro.

1381
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,092
Daddy?
Elizabeth!

1382
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,386
Hey, ok.

1383
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:14,574
You know what? Hey.

1384
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:16,641
I got $50. Here, here.

1385
01:22:16,842 --> 01:22:18,849
$50?
You took everything!

1386
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:20,016
Mommy?

1387
01:22:21,742 --> 01:22:22,919
Coming, I'm coming.

1388
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,090
He doesn't have it.

1389
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,484
Hasn't got what?

1390
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,070
I have it. He doesn't have
the impenetrable cloak.

1391
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:34,823
Lara, stay out of the street!

1392
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:03,450
It's ok, Daddy.

1393
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,360
What? What?
I'll protect you.

1394
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,260
It's ok. Daddy's ok.

1395
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:41,098
It's a really good cloak.
Good.

1396
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:02,974
How's it going?

1397
01:25:29,266 --> 01:25:33,033
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1398
01:25:34,575 --> 01:25:36,504
Well, you know what?
You are one to talk.

1399
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,888
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year.

1400
01:25:40,538 --> 01:25:43,582
I'm not snapping at you.
I am angry.

1401
01:25:44,998 --> 01:25:47,287
Yes. At them! Yes!

1402
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,446
At them, the police,

1403
01:25:49,628 --> 01:25:51,730
at Rick, at Maria,

1404
01:25:51,732 --> 01:25:52,364
at...

1405
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,537
the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

1406
01:25:55,539 --> 01:25:56,862
at the gardener,

1407
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,381
who, who, who keeps
over-watering the lawn.

1408
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:00,056
I...

1409
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,287
I just thought that...

1410
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,684
Carol, I just thought that,

1411
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:07,548
I would wake up today

1412
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,552
and I would feel better,

1413
01:26:09,962 --> 01:26:10,746
you know?

1414
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:12,514
But I was still mad.

1415
01:26:12,844 --> 01:26:14,497
And I realized...

1416
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:19,047
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1417
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,594
I wake up like this every morning.

1418
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,446
I am angry,

1419
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:28,892
all the time and I don't know why.

1420
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:31,113
Carol, I don't know why.
And I...

1421
01:26:34,178 --> 01:26:35,163
Yeah.

1422
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:36,221
Yeah, call me back.

1423
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,282
Bye.

1424
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,888
I really appreciate this.

1425
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:33,788
No problem.

1426
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,718
So how long you been out there tonight?

1427
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,596
It's cold.

1428
01:28:43,082 --> 01:28:44,065
Hour, maybe.

1429
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,259
Big surprise?

1430
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,493
Yeah, this ain't exactly
pick-up-a-brother territory.

1431
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,266
True.

1432
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:53,995
So where you headed?

1433
01:28:54,419 --> 01:28:56,278
Anywhere the other side of the hill.

1434
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:58,424
I'm going to El Segundo.

1435
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:00,085
El Segundo's cool.

1436
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,089
You've been there?

1437
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:03,864
Fuck, no.

1438
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:12,133
That's some good music.

1439
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:16,406
No, really.

1440
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:17,894
I'm starting to understand it.

1441
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,561
Wrote me a country song myself
just yesterday.

1442
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,770
I'll bet you did.

1443
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,651
Whatever.

1444
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,407
So what was going on
in the Valley tonight?

1445
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:45,360
Ice-skating.

1446
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,018
Ice-skating.

1447
01:29:48,312 --> 01:29:49,791
Love the ice-skating, man.

1448
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:53,688
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1449
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:55,897
Come on.

1450
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:57,681
What, you...

1451
01:29:58,271 --> 01:29:59,654
you think that's funny or something?

1452
01:30:00,023 --> 01:30:01,359
I think you're having fun.

1453
01:30:02,336 --> 01:30:03,522
Yeah. Whatever.

1454
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,913
Something else funny?

1455
01:30:15,531 --> 01:30:16,735
Oh, yeah.

1456
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,269
Yeah? What's that?

1457
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:22,999
People, man. People.

1458
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:25,803
People like me.

1459
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,673
No, no, no.
I'm not laughing at you, man.

1460
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:32,307
Yeah, I can see that.

1461
01:30:32,615 --> 01:30:33,970
Why don't you laugh outside?

1462
01:30:34,316 --> 01:30:35,966
Dawg, why are you getting
all bent out of shape?

1463
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,523
I'm not getting bent, man.

1464
01:30:37,525 --> 01:30:38,933
I'm just pulling over.

1465
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,395
Come on, man, keep driving.

1466
01:30:43,714 --> 01:30:45,189
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1467
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,941
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1468
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,318
Why you being a fucking jerk, man?
Just drive the car.

1469
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:52,395
I've got a better idea. Get out now.

1470
01:30:52,397 --> 01:30:54,114
Fine. You want me to show you?
I'll show you.

1471
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:55,623
Get your hands out of your pocket.

1472
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:56,705
Put your hands where I can see them.

1473
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:57,868
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

1474
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,035
Put your hands where I can see them.

1475
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,202
You wanna see what's in my hands?

1476
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:02,033
I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.

1477
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:39,093
Oh, my God.

1478
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:16,780
<i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>

1479
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:21,409
<i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,
the scene of country music here in LA.</i>

1480
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,120
<i>It's a cold night, and it's getting colder.</i>

1481
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:27,374
<i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo
coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>

1482
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,547
<i>so give us a call...</i>

1483
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:32,572
Hey?

1484
01:32:33,341 --> 01:32:34,075
You ok?

1485
01:32:34,813 --> 01:32:35,766
I'm freezing.

1486
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:36,875
Shit.

1487
01:32:37,893 --> 01:32:38,939
I heard it might snow.

1488
01:32:38,968 --> 01:32:41,255
Get out of here.
That's what I heard.

1489
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:43,974
You got a smoke?
No. I quit.

1490
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:46,094
Yeah, me, too.

1491
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:48,323
What do you got?

1492
01:32:48,809 --> 01:32:49,823
Dead kid.

1493
01:32:52,582 --> 01:32:53,457
Hey, Bob.

1494
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,896
Cash it right away!

1495
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:24,020
Choi Jin Gui!

1496
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,483
Choi Jin Gui!

1497
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:26,817
Choi Jin Gui!

1498
01:34:26,819 --> 01:34:28,632
Choi Jin Gui!
Do you speak English?

1499
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,782
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!

1500
01:34:30,784 --> 01:34:32,750
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1501
01:34:34,761 --> 01:34:35,972
Jin Gui!
Ma'am!

1502
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:38,449
Kim Lee.

1503
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,710
I thought you were dead.

1504
01:34:47,647 --> 01:34:49,141
I called every hospital.

1505
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,272
It's ok. I'm ok.

1506
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:53,632
I went crazy speeding.

1507
01:34:53,634 --> 01:34:55,434
I drove into a car.

1508
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,690
Oh, my God. Are you ok?

1509
01:34:57,983 --> 01:34:59,928
Got into big fight with poor woman.

1510
01:35:00,172 --> 01:35:01,531
I called her names.

1511
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,382
Oh, fine.

1512
01:35:04,774 --> 01:35:06,686
I die from worry and you laugh.

1513
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:12,242
Thank you for finding me.

1514
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:16,932
Will you do something for me?

1515
01:35:17,989 --> 01:35:19,130
Anything.

1516
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,469
Go to the locker.

1517
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:26,288
No, next one.

1518
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,180
In my wallet,

1519
01:35:31,182 --> 01:35:32,309
there is a check.

1520
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,060
Bring it here.

1521
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,705
Oh, I get it.
When I said get me a black Lincoln Navigator,

1522
01:35:46,713 --> 01:35:49,826
you thought I said
get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.

1523
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:53,097
Fine, it's fine.
Just give me whatever for it, man.

1524
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,056
You should see this.

1525
01:36:11,491 --> 01:36:13,159
I'll take the van.

1526
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:15,332
They're chained to the van.

1527
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,353
So I'll take them, too.

1528
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,356
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1529
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,609
Don't be ignorant.

1530
01:36:21,611 --> 01:36:23,069
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1531
01:36:23,071 --> 01:36:24,986
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1532
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,566
What the hell are you
gonna do with them?

1533
01:36:26,568 --> 01:36:28,407
Sell them.
What the hell do you think?

1534
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,406
I'll give you $500 apiece,

1535
01:36:30,408 --> 01:36:32,077
and you can keep the van.

1536
01:36:51,263 --> 01:36:53,264
Oh, no!

1537
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:59,395
No! No!

1538
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,705
This is Dorri.

1539
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:33,555
My baby.
My poor baby.

1540
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,767
Mom.

1541
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:40,585
I promise you,

1542
01:37:40,852 --> 01:37:42,008
I promise,

1543
01:37:42,425 --> 01:37:44,103
I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.

1544
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:48,236
I already know.

1545
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:52,436
You did.

1546
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:58,079
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1547
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:02,140
We weren't much good to you anymore,
were we?

1548
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,855
You got things to do.
You go ahead.

1549
01:38:09,857 --> 01:38:11,010
I'll sign the papers.

1550
01:38:11,116 --> 01:38:12,491
Mom, I wanna stay with...

1551
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,597
I just wanna wait with my baby.

1552
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:28,368
He came home.

1553
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:29,971
Did you know that?

1554
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,158
My little boy.

1555
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:35,501
When I was sleeping,

1556
01:38:36,088 --> 01:38:37,770
he brought me groceries.

1557
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:40,830
It's the last thing he did.

1558
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,443
Baba.

1559
01:39:09,913 --> 01:39:10,827
Baba.

1560
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:21,665
What happened?

1561
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,250
What did you do?

1562
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:33,434
Baba, what did you do?

1563
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:38,819
I shoot a little girl.

1564
01:39:39,862 --> 01:39:40,464
What?

1565
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,874
No, she's ok.

1566
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:46,560
She's...

1567
01:39:46,846 --> 01:39:47,731
Here.

1568
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:49,942
The gun shoot her...

1569
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:53,045
but she's ok, Dorri.

1570
01:39:53,156 --> 01:39:54,347
Nothing happened.

1571
01:39:57,908 --> 01:39:59,242
She's my farishtay.

1572
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:02,681
What are you talking about, Daddy?

1573
01:40:02,683 --> 01:40:04,039
My farishtay, Dorri.

1574
01:40:06,505 --> 01:40:07,250
My angel.

1575
01:40:10,558 --> 01:40:11,066
Angel.

1576
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,925
She came to protect me.

1577
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,412
To protect us.

1578
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:23,236
You understand?

1579
01:40:28,436 --> 01:40:30,104
Take this, Please.

1580
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:32,883
Take it.

1581
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:39,532
Hey, hey.

1582
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,077
Everything is ok, Dorri.

1583
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:45,730
It's ok.

1584
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,629
Ok, Daddy.
Ok.

1585
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:18,807
Jean?

1586
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,491
<i>Rick?</i>
Yeah. What's wrong?

1587
01:41:22,289 --> 01:41:23,826
I fell down the stairs.

1588
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,334
Are you alright?

1589
01:41:26,129 --> 01:41:27,335
<i>I tried calling you.</i>

1590
01:41:28,107 --> 01:41:29,968
I couldn't get through to anyone. Not...

1591
01:41:30,824 --> 01:41:33,962
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, not...

1592
01:41:34,228 --> 01:41:36,923
<i>I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.</i>

1593
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:40,114
It's ok. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1594
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:42,912
<i>Carol was the only one that was home</i>

1595
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:46,492
and she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1596
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,384
Well, that's because she's a bitch.

1597
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:51,604
She's been my friend for 10 years.

1598
01:41:53,059 --> 01:41:54,468
<i>Alright honey. Feel better.</i>

1599
01:41:55,567 --> 01:41:56,813
I'll be there soon.

1600
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,077
I love you.

1601
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,373
I love you, too.

1602
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,067
Miss Jean.

1603
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:41,637
Would you like to sit up?

1604
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,370
Here.

1605
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,205
Good.

1606
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,010
Do you want to hear something funny?

1607
01:43:02,636 --> 01:43:04,096
What, Mrs. Jean?

1608
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:08,246
You're the best friend I've got.

1609
01:46:22,288 --> 01:46:23,129
Allo.

1610
01:46:24,457 --> 01:46:25,098
Hi.

1611
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:33,379
I love you.

1612
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,091
Alright.

1613
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:07,509
Everybody out.

1614
01:48:08,595 --> 01:48:09,473
You're free to go.

1615
01:48:12,527 --> 01:48:13,606
Alright, come on.

1616
01:48:15,468 --> 01:48:18,179
Come on, now. This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop.

1617
01:48:18,181 --> 01:48:19,266
Come on, you all.

1618
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,906
Come on.

1619
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:02,785
That's $40.

1620
01:49:02,827 --> 01:49:04,859
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1621
01:49:07,912 --> 01:49:09,560
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1622
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:46,835
Oh, my God!

1623
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:48,815
What the hell is wrong with you people?

1624
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,669
Don't talk to me,
unless you speak American!
