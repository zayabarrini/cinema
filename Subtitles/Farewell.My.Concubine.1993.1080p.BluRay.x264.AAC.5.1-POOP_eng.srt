1
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,665
Who are you?

2
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,499
We're with the opera troupe.

3
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,124
Oh, I didn't recognize you!

4
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,790
I'm a great fan ofyou both.

5
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,707
Is that so? Thank you.

6
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:21,290
It's been over twenty years
since you performed together, hasn't it?

7
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,999
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-two.

8
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,124
Yes, twenty-two years.

9
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,957
And it's been ten years
since we last saw each other.

10
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:36,915
Eleven. Eleven years.

11
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,957
That's right, eleven years. Yes.

12
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,457
It's due to the Gang of Four.

13
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,124
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,415
Things are better now.

15
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,040
That's for sure.

16
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:07,624
Everything's fine now.

17
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:13,707
Please, wait here a moment.
I'll go turn on the lights.

18
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:52,707
- Farewell, My Concubine -

19
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,790
Beijing, 1924

20
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,957
Yanhong, is that you?

21
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,749
I've really missed you.

22
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,249
Whore!

23
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,832
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the show!

24
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,874
Laizi is trying to run away again.
Brat! See how far you get!

25
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,290
Quick, go catch him!

26
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,957
I'm sorry.
Gentlemen, please be patient.

27
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,790
Trash! How dare you
show yourselves around here?

28
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,332
Just as sure as my name is Shitou,

29
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,999
I'll give you something to look at.

30
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,332
What are you screaming for?
I haven't even said hello yet!

31
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:17,207
You're a disgrace to the opera troupe.

32
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,665
You couldn't even play a monkey right.

33
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,457
Thought you'd get away
with that brick act, didn't you?

34
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,540
It's garbage.

35
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,499
Dare you run again!

36
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:59,249
Sharpen your knives.

37
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,332
This child isn't fated to be an actor,

38
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,165
not with that extra finger.

39
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:32,332
He have a good face, but he can't.

40
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:39,832
I can afford to raise him, but he's
getting too big to keep at the brothel.

41
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,249
If only you take him,

42
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,999
you can do anything you like.

43
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,582
Don't look down on us.

44
00:07:56,291 --> 00:08:00,249
Don't be foolish. Prostitutes and actors...

45
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:06,082
...are equally despised by society.
Just go away.

46
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,915
Ma, my hands are freezing.
They feel like ice.

47
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,499
Ma!

48
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,165
Get away from us,
you son ofa whore!

49
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,124
It's from the whore house!
Drop it on the floor!

50
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,540
- Drop it on the floor!
- You son of a whore!

51
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,749
It's cold.

52
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,290
Are you bullying him?

53
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,957
Come over here. Sleep with me.

54
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,124
You're really something.

55
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,207
Laizi, go snuggle up with the Little Monk.

56
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,957
Catch!

57
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,332
It's so cold outside...

58
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:06,624
The piss froze on the tip ofmy dick.
I nearly turned a somersault!

59
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:31,832
If you belong to the human race,
you go to the opera.

60
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,624
Pigs and dogs don't listen to opera.
If you don't go to the opera,

61
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,999
you're not a human being.

62
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,999
And where there's opera,
there's work for us actors!

63
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,040
Stop squealing!

64
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,374
Straighten that back!

65
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:06,165
If you think you're above everyone else,
you'll learn the hard way.

66
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,957
This isjust the beginning.

67
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:19,790
Don't worry, Douzi.

68
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,124
We're already halfway through.

69
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,207
Shitou,

70
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:33,749
- are you helping someone cheat?
- I didn't notice what was on the floor.

71
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,040
Bullshit! Get me my sword.

72
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,832
And hurry up!

73
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:59,624
Get up!

74
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,374
Don't you have something to say?

75
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,457
Yes. Forming cliques is prohibited
and we'll be punished.

76
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,165
Not fucking scared of anything!

77
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:30,415
From the time opera began, it's never
enjoyed such popularity as it does today.

78
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,249
You're lucky to be part ofit!

79
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,207
We are!

80
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:04,415
Heavens make us die,
not due to the wars or anything else.

81
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:13,624
I've been practicing Kung Fu
to keep myselfwarm.

82
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,915
It's cool outside, quite cool.

83
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,999
But I've become a man offire.
Get away from me.

84
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:40,624
I am so strong
I can uproot the mountains

85
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:47,290
My courage is renowned

86
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:56,999
- I've fallen on bad times
- I am so strong...

87
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,290
My courage is renowned

88
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:09,207
I've fallen on bad times

89
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,249
These are our rules.
We must learn them well.

90
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,582
From ancient times,
man has needed a skill.

91
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:30,082
If you devote yourselfto this,
you'll get paid off.

92
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,499
Pushing yourselfhard is the only way
to become famous one day.

93
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,499
Now go off and practice!

94
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,749
Let's hear Fleeing by Night.

95
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,790
I look back at the Celestial Court
and hurry on wards in fight

96
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,874
- Heedless of... heedless of...
- Heedless ofwhat?

97
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,624
Heedless ofloyalty and filial piety.

98
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:02,999
I am so strong
I can uproot the mountains

99
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,707
I've fallen on bad times

100
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,999
Yet even my horse won't
run away to save itself

101
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,915
And my beloved concubine
What shall I do about her

102
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,915
Excellent, not a word out ofplace.

103
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,165
Give me your hand.

104
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,874
So you'll remember to
do the same as well the next time.

105
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:31,624
At sixteen, I am a nun
My hair is shorn at youth's prime

106
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,624
Go on.

107
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:41,082
I am by nature a boy...

108
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,249
You are by nature a girl!

109
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,999
I'll punish you, Laizi!

110
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,332
You still can't get it right, can you?

111
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,374
Why can't you be right?

112
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,832
Don't hit me! I won't do it again!

113
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,999
It's your turn.

114
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,582
I am... I am by nature...

115
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,749
Spit it out!

116
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,874
I am by nature a boy...

117
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,540
Is a nun a male or a female?

118
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,332
Aboy.

119
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:28,832
You really are in character.
You can't even tell male from female.

120
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:45,499
I... I am by nature a boy.

121
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,290
You've forgotten everything
the master has taught you!

122
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,082
Do it again, and I'll beat you
within an inch ofyour life.

123
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,124
Don't make the same mistake ever!

124
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,082
You'd better remember this.

125
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,999
Lfby chance
I'm beaten to death tomorrow,

126
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,582
you shall take the three copper coins
hidden under my pillow.

127
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:39,790
Careful!

128
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,415
Don't water your hand!

129
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:58,040
Douzi, in a few days,
you'll be initiated into the troupe.

130
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,999
Just pretend you're a girl,
and don't mess up the lyrics again.

131
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:23,374
- Laizi, have you ever eaten pea cakes?
- What's the big deal about pea cakes?

132
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,540
- How about millet rolls?
- Basin cakes?

133
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,290
They're as fucking special as dog farts.

134
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,790
So what do you like?

135
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,624
There's nothing yummier
than sugar-coated haws.

136
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,249
If I make it big, I'll eat
sugar-coated haws every day for dinner.

137
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,124
Don't look at us like that.
We're not sticks ofhaws.

138
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,499
Laizi, you're drooling!

139
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,207
- Laizi, what the hell are you doing?
- Wow, so many big kites!

140
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,582
Go back! Go back!

141
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,499
Douzi.

142
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:40,874
Run for it!

143
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,749
Come back!

144
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,290
Douzi!

145
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:58,374
Don't forget the money under my pillow.

146
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,624
You're worthless. Get out ofmy sight!

147
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,082
Where'd you get that?

148
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,249
Forget about Shitou.
I'm spending your money now.

149
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,582
Ten haws on each stick.
I'll give you two.

150
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,874
- What's wrong with you?
- I have to pee real bad.

151
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,999
Not in the middle ofthe street.

152
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,624
The stars have arrived!
Here, come this way.

153
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,499
My dear sir, this is like a visit from heaven!

154
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,249
All you need to do is sneeze
and you get a standing ovation.

155
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,999
We'll be lucky ifno one is
trampled to death in there!

156
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,499
I'll sit on your shoulders for a while,
then you sit on mine.

157
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,457
The King of Chu!

158
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,249
What does it take to become a star?

159
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,999
How many beatings?

160
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,749
When will I ever enjoy such fame?

161
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:17,374
You're pissing all over me!
Are you nuts?

162
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:36,249
I knew you'd go back.
You couldn't live without Shitou.

163
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:41,040
We're going to get a taste ofthe sword.
But I'm not afraid.

164
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,499
For me, it's like having an itch scratched.

165
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,540
I've eaten my sugar-coated haws.

166
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,332
I'm a fucking star already.

167
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,874
You little runts,
you've come back after all.

168
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,582
I deserve it!

169
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,207
- Good! I deserve it!
- Good! I deserve it!

170
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:06,332
Why the hell did you let them go?

171
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,540
Die you runts!

172
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:19,957
Skipping class and running away
must be punished!

173
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:23,582
Master, I'll never do it again.

174
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,707
Please let me go!

175
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,540
You let them get away? Assholes!

176
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,499
How dare you!

177
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:41,165
- Get him!
- Master, I'll never do it again.

178
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,624
I wouldn't dare do it again, master.

179
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:55,124
Master, it was my fault.

180
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:57,915
Beat me instead!

181
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:42,124
Didn't you think you'd get yours?

182
00:27:43,125 --> 00:28:02,624
I'll beat you to death!

183
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,665
Douzi, speak! Say something!

184
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,790
Beg for mercy! Come on!

185
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:17,040
Speak! Beg for mercy!

186
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,082
Let's just disband the troupe!

187
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:28,999
You're killing Douzi!

188
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,415
I won't let you do this!

189
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:47,624
Master! Laizi, he...

190
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:48,582
This opera tells the story ofthe war
between the Chu and the Han kings.

191
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,499
What sort of a man was the King of Chu?

192
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,165
A peerless and invincible hero;

193
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:01,540
a bold and resourceful general
capable of defeating vast armies.

194
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:07,082
But fate wasn't on his side.

195
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:15,832
At Gaixia he was outwitted by the Han king.

196
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,540
As they prepared for battle,

197
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,082
Han's troops sang victory songs
because of Han's military tactics,

198
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:31,332
the Chu armies fed in a great panic,
had their country taken by Han.

199
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,415
Even the king was weeping.

200
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:43,624
No matter how resourceful you are,
you can't fight against fate.

201
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:53,040
The king had once been all-powerful, but in
the end, all he had was one woman and one horse.

202
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:57,707
He tried to get his steed to run away,
but it wouldn't go.

203
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,415
He wanted his concubine to free,
but she wouldn't leave.

204
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,749
For the very last time, Concubine Yu
poured wine for her king,

205
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:15,332
danced for him with a sword; and then
cut her throat with it, to keep her fidelity.

206
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:25,624
There's a lesson in this story.
You better keep that in mind.

207
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:30,540
Each person is responsible
for his or her own fate.

208
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:46,582
I am so strong
I can uproot the mountains

209
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:52,915
My courage is renowned

210
00:31:53,541 --> 00:32:00,874
I've fallen on bad times

211
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:06,290
Yet even my horse won't
run away to save itself

212
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,999
Old Man Zhang has commissioned you
to hire an opera troupe.

213
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,124
I truly congratulate you.

214
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:25,624
With your patronage, the children
will have new clothes to wear.

215
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:32,374
Good opera, however, is not so simple.

216
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:37,624
When he was a palace eunuch, Old Man Zhang
attended operas with the Empress Dowager.

217
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,165
I could lose a lot of respect...

218
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,749
...if anything goes wrong.

219
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:50,707
You realize that ifthe performance
doesn't make the grade...

220
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,165
This kid's got something.
How long has he been in training?

221
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:02,374
Douzi, come here and pay your respects.

222
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,040
He's got a nice little figure too.

223
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,874
Can you sing any old-style operas?

224
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,124
Yes, two.

225
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,249
Fleeing by Night is for male and
Outside the Nunnery is for female.

226
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,332
Let's hear a bit ofthe latter.

227
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:43,707
At sixteen, I am a nun
My hair is shorn at youth's prime

228
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:47,124
Yet I am by nature a boy

229
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,749
not a girl

230
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,707
Why...

231
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:01,124
Mr. Na, I am terribly sorry!

232
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,915
- He's usually very good.
- Master Guan, I'll see you some other time.

233
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:11,249
You idiot! Idiot!

234
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:19,540
Open your mouth. Open it!

235
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:28,374
You've screwed it up for all ofus!

236
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:31,332
Such a fool!

237
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:34,624
I'll teach you.

238
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:09,582
I am by nature a girl,

239
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,290
not...

240
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,457
At sixteen, I am a nun

241
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:36,124
My hair is shorn at youth's prime

242
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,999
Yet I am by nature a girl
not a boy

243
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,749
Why must I wear these sexless robes

244
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,249
I see the joyful couples pass

245
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,290
in their splendid brocades

246
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,332
Despite myself

247
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,582
desire burns in my heart

248
00:35:53,125 --> 00:36:00,082
Year after year

249
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:12,499
All over the land

250
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:28,915
I've followed my king

251
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:34,790
on his military campaigns

252
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:41,832
enduring the wind and frost and hard toil

253
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,665
Our people are fallen into abyss of misery

254
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,082
Master Guan, come here.

255
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,624
Mr. Zhang, wish you health and longevity.

256
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,207
The king is here.

257
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:33,582
Your highness.

258
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:56,082
The people have suffered
untold hardship and pain...

259
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,707
This is Old Man Zhang's...

260
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:09,499
...special reward for two kids. Take this.

261
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,540
Yes, sir!

262
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:17,332
The Chu King would have won with this sword.
If I were emperor, you'd be the queen.

263
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,749
Someday, I'll give you a same one.

264
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,665
Careful, kids!

265
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,915
That's a real sword!

266
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:30,832
No need to run.

267
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,415
We're coming.

268
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,249
- What's wrong?
- The sweat stings the scratches.

269
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,790
Have them go together.

270
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:48,374
No way.
It's an old rule around here.

271
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:49,790
Master Guan,

272
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,499
I'm sorry ifyou don't understand.

273
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:59,040
The concubine has to die
one way or the other. Isn't it so?

274
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,249
Master?

275
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:11,665
Douzi! Douzi!

276
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,499
What year is this year?

277
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:56,749
- This is... this is 1932.
- No!

278
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,665
This is still the Qing dynasty!

279
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,082
Come over here.

280
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:12,040
I... I want to find Shitou.
I need to pee.

281
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,832
Pee into this.

282
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,207
Don't waste it.
Just pee into this.

283
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,832
Come to me!

284
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:49,790
Douzi!

285
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:59,790
What happened to you?

286
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:04,749
Talk to me!

287
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,999
Douzi. Fate has
determined each of our lots.

288
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,457
Leave him to his destiny.

289
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:24,665
All right, look at the camera!

290
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,540
Gentlemen, you have done
grandly for yourselves.

291
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:46,707
You look so dignified and stunning
in any style of clothing.

292
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,915
That's it!

293
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,832
Oppose Japan's invasion ofNorth China!

294
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,707
Damn! Those students again.

295
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,999
Down with Japanese imperialism!

296
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:15,790
The year 1937,
the eve of Lugou Bridge Incident

297
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,915
Aren't they the opera actors?

298
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,582
Do you have any feeling for your country?

299
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:35,207
How can you put on makeup
and sing opera at a time like this?

300
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:42,082
We're Chinese too!

301
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,040
Look at us, goddamn it!

302
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:51,249
That's true. We're all Chinese.

303
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,499
We Chinese mustn't fight among ourselves!

304
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,707
We're all Chinese here!

305
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:01,749
All Chinese here!

306
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,290
How dare they pretend to be patriotic!

307
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:11,040
Why don't they go out
and fight the Japanese soldiers?

308
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,790
Why don't they actually do something?

309
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:17,790
They're penniless, you know,

310
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,457
for women and marriage.

311
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:23,582
Just want to find a way out.

312
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,207
The one who was yelling the loudest
would make a good actor.

313
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,749
Remember the first time
we performed Farewell, My Concubine?

314
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,207
It was long ago.
Only you remember that kind ofthing.

315
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,332
I know.

316
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,624
It was for Old Man Zhang, remember?

317
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:44,249
It was the lucky day for you.

318
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:47,874
It's now a coffin shop.

319
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,499
I went there yesterday.

320
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,082
I know you've been looking for the sword,

321
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,915
but it's long gone.

322
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,999
Deyie! Deyie!

323
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:12,540
Sugar-coated haws for sale!

324
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,665
We've got huge crowds ofpeople.

325
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:19,249
They're craning their necks
to catch a glimpse oftheir idols.

326
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:25,040
Even Master Yuan is here to see you.
It's a great honor for us.

327
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:37,540
Go away! Go away!

328
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:57,999
Mr. Duan.

329
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,540
They're becoming impatient, please hurry!

330
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,874
Trust me.

331
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,207
They won't feel like
they are wasting their money.

332
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:34,624
Year after year

333
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:41,332
All over the land

334
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,915
I've followed my king

335
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:12,624
on his military campaigns

336
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:20,207
Has he blurred the distinction
between male and female?

337
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,040
You be the judge.

338
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:46,832
Your highness,

339
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,707
I've caused you...

340
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:12,415
...so much grief.

341
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:21,249
Master Yuan has come to see us tonight.

342
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,665
I know. I sang so loudly,

343
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,957
I drowned out the horns.

344
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:34,707
I'll show him how great we are
without his patronage.

345
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,415
- But Duan...
- Don't worry.

346
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:39,374
At key moments,

347
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:43,082
I squeezed my waist with my hands,
helping me raise my voice.

348
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,665
- Here?
- No.

349
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,124
Here?

350
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:53,332
Stop it!

351
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,665
Master Yuan!

352
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:17,374
- It's an honor that you come to see us.
- You deserve this.

353
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,374
I've got a gift for you.

354
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:46,915
The Empress Dowager herself...

355
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:53,749
...never bestowed such a stunning gift
upon her favorite actors.

356
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,915
Master Yuan, how can Dieyi
be worthy ofyour favor?

357
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,332
Farewell, My Concubine
has a long history.

358
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:16,290
It evolved from the old-style opera,
Story ofthe Precious One.

359
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,290
Many famous actors
have failed in performing this.

360
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:27,374
I've never seen an actor as great as you are.

361
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,582
Impressive.

362
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:47,749
For a moment or two, I was so entranced.

363
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,999
I believed Concubine Yu
had actually come back to life.

364
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,540
Master Duan.

365
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:04,915
When the king returns to camp
and meets Concubine Yu,

366
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,457
custom has it...

367
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,582
Excuse me.

368
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:15,957
He shall take seven steps.
You took fivejust now.

369
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:22,040
Lfthe King of Chu fails to
bear himselfwith majestic dignity,

370
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:25,374
he's little better than a gangster
putting on airs!

371
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,999
Master Yuan, you are a master
ofthe theater arts.

372
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:32,457
You are an expert in all
the varieties and facets of opera.

373
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,374
I may probably be wrong as you said.

374
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:39,957
What you said was like the Bible of Opera.

375
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:44,249
Please give us the benefit
ofyour advice and criticism.

376
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:52,874
If it's not beneath you, I'd like to
invite you to my home for some wine.

377
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,415
- There is still so much to be said...
- I'm terribly sorry, Master Yuan.

378
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,290
I have another drinking engagement...

379
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,290
...with a courtesan.

380
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:19,707
With a courtesan...
Nice taste you have.

381
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,457
And Mr. Cheng?

382
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:34,999
Then we'll share our thoughts later.

383
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:37,582
Bye.

384
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,540
Thank you for coming.

385
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,207
Dieyi, I gotta go.

386
00:53:55,625 --> 00:54:00,207
Girls! Come entertain our guest!

387
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,832
Mr. Duan, this way please.

388
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,624
Long time no see.
Mr. Duan, we've missed you.

389
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,707
I'd like to see Miss Juxian.

390
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:18,874
How shall I put it?
You should've said that earlier.

391
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:24,874
She's not here at the moment.
She's out, with other guests.

392
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:29,790
What can be done?
Let me find someone else for you.

393
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:34,207
Caifeng, come keep Mr. Duan company.

394
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,957
Enjoy!

395
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:56,790
Tell me the truth.
Where is Juxian?

396
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:03,124
Upstairs? Or down?

397
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,707
The phoenix roosts on
the highest branches for sure.

398
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:14,665
But she's pretty high-class.
You reckon she'll go for you?

399
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:24,540
You bet!
I specialize in high-class.

400
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,374
Miss Juxian...

401
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:36,624
Why don't you go there and see her?

402
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,457
How dare you!

403
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,999
Cut it out!

404
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,832
What can you do?

405
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:50,415
Cut it out!

406
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,207
Cut it out or I'lljump!

407
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:58,707
Jump! I'll follow you.

408
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:03,540
No matter where you are,

409
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,707
even after death, I'll be there for you.

410
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:12,915
Xiaolou!

411
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:33,415
These guys are revolting! They were forcing
me to drink wine from their mouths.

412
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:40,957
Come on, assholes. Jump!
Now it's your turn!

413
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:45,290
Bastards! Jerks!

414
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,332
All right, let's go!

415
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,790
Oh, it's Mr. Duan!

416
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:15,207
Listen, we're all here to have a good time,

417
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:20,124
spending lots of money.

418
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,540
So let's not pick fights, ok?

419
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,415
Come on.

420
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,082
Keep out ofit, and get lost.

421
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:33,832
Don't get upset.

422
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:35,624
Scared?

423
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,749
Juxian, you are to blame.

424
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,874
Didn't you tell these gentlemen
today's a special day...

425
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,749
...that we decided to get engaged?

426
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:19,624
That's right!

427
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,749
We are to get engaged.

428
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,624
Have a toast to me!

429
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:33,915
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

430
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:27,249
You think you can fool us?

431
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:31,749
Gentlemen, today is my happiest day;

432
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,499
allow me to drink to all ofyou.

433
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:37,499
And now, I'll give you something...

434
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,290
...to sober you up.

435
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:42,499
Mr. Cheng!

436
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:04,665
I heard you got into a fight
at the House of Blossoms.

437
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:11,915
You know the old story,
Pan Jinlian's husband and Ximen Qing?

438
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,124
Does this means there's
a Pan Jinlian in your life?

439
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,957
- What are you saying?
- What do you want to hear?

440
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,165
I was just fooling around.
It's not serious.

441
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:26,249
Dieyi,

442
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,040
come with me sometime.
You'll see what it's like.

443
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:49,290
I'm sorry. I really am!

444
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:55,207
I wasn't thinking. Itjust came out.

445
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:58,457
I'm a damn fool.

446
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:06,457
Have you forgotten the secret of our success?

447
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,874
Don't you remember our teacher's words?

448
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,082
What words?

449
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,332
Stick together until the day you die.

450
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,165
I want you to be with me...

451
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:24,957
No.

452
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,249
How about we staying together forever?

453
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:36,790
- We've come this far together, haven't we?
- It's not enough. Should be a lifetime.

454
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:41,207
One day, even one second less,
makes it less than a lifetime!

455
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:53,665
Dieyi, you really are obsessed.

456
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,957
Your obsession with the stage
carries over into your everyday life.

457
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:07,665
But how are we going to get through
the days and make it in the real world?

458
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,457
Give me a hand with my makeup.

459
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,374
Concubine Yu,

460
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,749
the song was sung everywhere,

461
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,665
our country is being ruined by the enemy.

462
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:51,249
Go live out this goddamn fantasy, then.

463
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,665
My king...

464
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,290
I'll tell you even though
it's heart breaking.

465
01:02:55,541 --> 01:03:10,749
Today is the day we say goodbye.

466
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,832
You think you'll become a lady ofvirtue?

467
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,415
Wake up!

468
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:06,499
You think you can
get away with your past?

469
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,999
You think the wolves and tigers
won't recognize your scent anymore?

470
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,207
I am so, so scared.

471
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:22,540
Let me tell you something.
Once a whore, always a whore.

472
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:30,540
Keep that in your mind.

473
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,624
Fine. See you around.

474
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:56,082
Mr. Yuan has presented you with a pennant.
"The Beauty ofthe Age."

475
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,540
What are you doing here?

476
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,707
What is it, Juxian?

477
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,874
- Come on in!
- No, you come out!

478
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,374
What are you doing barefoot
on such a cold day?

479
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,957
What happened?

480
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,290
The House of Blossoms...

481
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:16,499
...won't keep an engaged woman.

482
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:23,415
Mr. Cheng.

483
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:37,665
Come. Let me introduce you.

484
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,665
This is Miss Juxian.

485
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,374
This is my stage brother, Dieyi.
You may have seen him as Concubine Yu.

486
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:51,332
Xiaolou speaks ofyou so often,
I feel like we were old friends.

487
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,874
Miss Juxian...
Excuse me, I must be going.

488
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,749
Xiaolou, at the House of Blossoms,

489
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:16,957
ifyou hadn't saved me,
l"d be six feet under by now.

490
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:25,665
Remember, it was you who proposed to me.

491
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:33,249
I'm used to hardship. If you take me in,
l"ll do whatever you want me to do.

492
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:41,332
If you ever abandon me, I'll just
kill myself as ifyou never saved me.

493
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,499
What a dragon lady!

494
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:05,332
Truely dramatic!

495
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,082
When's the performance of
Candle-lit-night in the Bridal Chamber?

496
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,290
- Tonight.
- Yes!

497
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,582
Hold on.

498
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:23,415
I want a formal engagement ceremony
to which the entire company is invited.

499
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:26,665
I want to enter your home
as a proper bride.

500
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,749
You don't think
I plan to cut corners, do you?

501
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:36,207
The engagement ceremony will be tonight.
We request the pleasure ofyour company.

502
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:47,874
Miss Juxian, where did you study opera?

503
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,540
Me? What makes you think that?

504
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:57,040
Just the way you overplayed your part.

505
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,790
Dieyi, she's going to be your sister-in-law.

506
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:10,290
Also, at the engagement party tonight...

507
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:17,540
I haven't learned the opera
Gangster King and His Whore.

508
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:23,749
- Our teacher never taught us that one.
- What are you talking about?

509
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:30,665
Dieyi, Xiaolou has spoken
good ofyou. Always.

510
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:35,790
Don't leave!

511
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,499
Where are you going?

512
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:47,207
None ofyour business.

513
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,040
Don't.

514
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,790
Please, don't go.

515
01:09:55,291 --> 01:10:00,874
Master Yuan invites us tonight.
He wants to become our patron.

516
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:04,249
Who does he think he is?
No one tells me what to do!

517
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:10,332
I'm just a fake king.
You really are Concubine Yu.

518
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,624
Let him patronize you ifyou like.

519
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,832
Xiaolou! Xiaolou!

520
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:43,999
This feather headpiece
is rare and precious.

521
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:51,457
The feathers are collected
from the tails oflive peacocks.

522
01:10:53,333 --> 01:11:00,124
That's the secret to keep
the feathers soft and colorful.

523
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,540
I'll be waiting for you.

524
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:48,457
In this world, there is foulness
in both men and women.

525
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:53,457
Only the Bodhisattva embodies
both male and female essences.

526
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,415
Such ecstasy!

527
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:18,165
This sword has a history.

528
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,582
It once belonged to the eunuch Zhang.

529
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:27,082
When Zhang went bankrupt,
I went to great trouble to acquire it.

530
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:34,624
I can see from this,
you're old acquaintances.

531
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:42,624
Amazing! One searches
far and wide for something...

532
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:53,790
- Like it?
- I...

533
01:12:55,208 --> 01:13:00,082
Let's not have any vulgar talk
of money between us.

534
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,499
A precious sword is the classic gift
for one's most intimate friend.

535
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,165
Mr. Cheng.

536
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:14,165
Will you be my most intimate friend?

537
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:24,290
The soldiers of Han have invaded

538
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:31,332
The songs of Chu can be heard on all sides

539
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:45,290
Since the good king
has lost his fighting spirit

540
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:58,082
why should his humble concubine
value her life

541
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:07,874
Don't! It's a real sword!

542
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:32,749
A smile ushers in the spring.

543
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:39,499
A tear does darken the world.

544
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,332
How truly does this befit you.

545
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:53,207
Only you are possessed of such charm.

546
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,249
Mr. Cheng, I knew you'd come.

547
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,082
We saved a seat
at the head table for you.

548
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,207
You came back?

549
01:15:58,291 --> 01:16:03,249
It's a good thing you showed up.

550
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:04,374
Have a look at this.

551
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,999
What a sword!

552
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:20,540
How did you acquire this
out of nowhere tonight?

553
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:36,832
Dieyi, you've come so late.

554
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:41,207
- You better drink up!
- Yes, drink up!

555
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,415
My gratitude, Miss Juxian.

556
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:55,957
Dieyi? Mr. Cheng!

557
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:05,832
Xiaolou, from now on,
we'll no longer perform together.

558
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:08,957
Mr. Cheng, you can't do this!

559
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,915
This is terrible!

560
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:18,790
Japanese troops have entered the city!

561
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,374
Dieyi? Where is Dieyi?

562
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:53,540
I'll fill up your glass with finest wine.

563
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:06,207
So what is this wine called?

564
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:11,124
Wine of overnight drinking.

565
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:21,040
Fill it up.
Who will be serving me tonight?

566
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,832
You shall make it as Dieyi's method
of doing the makeup for me.

567
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:35,832
A man's life is meaningless
It's just like dream

568
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:45,124
One shall do whatever he wants

569
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:59,165
I will keep on drinking
until the night is over

570
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,332
Well, Mr. Duan...

571
01:19:54,375 --> 01:20:01,165
Don't waste my time.
Tell him to take it off.

572
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:01,999
Xiaolou!

573
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,290
How dare you!

574
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:36,915
Even if it belongs to your ancestor,
you should let him put it on. Low life!

575
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:16,665
Tell the Japanese,
I'll be there right away.

576
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:24,624
It's not some private party. They're
blackmailing you to sing for them.

577
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:31,082
On the other hand, you're
the only one who can save Xiaolou.

578
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:36,207
But, if anything happened to you...

579
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:42,707
This theater of mine would...
All right, go then.

580
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,582
- Miss Juxian, what are you doing?
- Mr. Cheng isn't at home.

581
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:54,540
Where's Dieyi? Dieyi, hurry! I've heard
the Japanese feed prisoners to their dogs!

582
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:58,290
If you delay, he might not
have a life to save. Please!

583
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,332
Dieyi!

584
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:18,749
You allowed them to
take him away in the first place.

585
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,290
What you talking about! Xiaolou has
looked after you since you were small.

586
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,999
So you know we're pretty close.

587
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:49,165
- Mr. Na.
- I'm here.

588
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:54,832
Would you mind leaving for a moment?
I've something to say to Dieyi in private.

589
01:22:56,416 --> 01:23:00,415
Everyone says Miss Juxian is quite clever.

590
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:04,499
We're all trying to help Xiaolou.
Talk it easy.

591
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,540
How about a clear answer?
Are you going or not?

592
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:33,582
Say something!

593
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:47,915
I know what's on your mind.
I have a proposal.

594
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:55,749
If you can get Xiaolou out ofthere,
I'll go back to the House of Blossoms.

595
01:23:57,041 --> 01:24:00,999
I'll keep away from both ofyou.
How's that?

596
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:09,957
At the House of Blossoms,
you don't have to worry about anything.

597
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,415
Life is much easier there.

598
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,790
Just remember,
you said it, not me.

599
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:26,415
I give my word.

600
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:48,040
The flowers have blossomed

601
01:24:52,500 --> 01:25:17,374
Their season is past

602
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:33,249
All has fallen

603
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:53,290
Only the sun is still the same

604
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:10,415
- Xiaolou!
- My brother!

605
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,707
- Xiaolou, are you all right?
- Did you sing for the Japanese?

606
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,165
There's one called Aoki,
genuinely likes opera.

607
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,415
Xiaolou!

608
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:10,207
All right. Come here!

609
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:14,665
- Let me have another drink!
- Okay, I'll drink one for you.

610
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,624
I think this opera,
Farewell, My Concubine.

611
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:13,499
But it has turned into
Farewell, My King.

612
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:15,790
The king's really irrelevant.

613
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:41,040
Drink this.
Your voice will pierce the heaven.

614
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,165
Alright, come.

615
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:30,665
Forget the opera.

616
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:37,165
Let's just live a quiet life.

617
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:40,332
We'll have a fat little baby boy.

618
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,332
Then I'll have everything I want.
That's enough.

619
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:48,540
No more opera.

620
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:18,165
Sugar-coated haws for sale!

621
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:23,415
Let's go!

622
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:25,124
Just go.

623
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:27,499
Bye, then.

624
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:31,374
Give me!

625
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,957
Not the crickets, my money.

626
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:42,540
You borrow the money
on your host's credit, right?

627
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:49,332
Go!

628
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,124
I can't believe such a grown-up like you...

629
01:31:56,625 --> 01:32:01,249
...is busy playing with bugs
and not working!

630
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,874
Work? I'm an actor!

631
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:10,790
What else can I do
other than acting on stage?

632
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:14,082
Shall I carry coffins?

633
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,999
You should be satisfied by now.

634
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,415
No need to shout like that.

635
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:31,249
Here's the money.
What? Don't need it?

636
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:36,040
I'll apologize if I were going too far.

637
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:42,749
Unless you take caution,
they will get you.

638
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,999
The master wants to see you.

639
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,707
No, I won't.

640
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:04,790
Look at this sword.

641
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:12,957
Master, they've just arrived here.

642
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:17,124
Who?

643
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:20,665
Dieyi and Xiaolou,
whom you've wanted to meet.

644
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:24,624
What a great fucking honor.

645
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:28,124
- Super stars have arrived!
- Master.

646
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:32,665
Well, I finally got something to brag about.

647
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,665
A great fucking honor.

648
01:33:35,916 --> 01:33:39,624
Take your seats there,
I'll bow to you.

649
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:41,040
Master, please don't.

650
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:50,290
You are finally here.

651
01:33:52,375 --> 01:34:00,999
Dieyi, without Xiaolou's help,
you are nobody.

652
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,249
And now, he left the stage,

653
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:11,915
it's your turn to help him.

654
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,832
You hear me?

655
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,665
Come on!

656
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:42,415
Douzi!

657
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:45,415
Shitou!

658
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:54,290
You are now all grown-ups...

659
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:03,249
...and great actors with fame.

660
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,790
Don't remember your youth?

661
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:12,457
What's worrying you?
Just hit him hard.

662
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:22,707
When did I tell you to
look down on me?

663
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,290
Are you going to ruin operas?

664
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:29,165
It's your fault!

665
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:33,665
Master!

666
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:35,874
I am to blame.

667
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:38,124
Hit me instead!

668
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:43,457
Wait, I have to tell you this.

669
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:49,874
Xialou is my husband. If you want to
hit him, you need my permission.

670
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:50,499
Knock it off!

671
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:56,499
I've heard of one bitch, and it was you!

672
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,915
So you must be the VIP today, right?

673
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:07,832
Take your seat and drink a cup oftea.
Make yourself comfortable.

674
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:10,082
Here you are.

675
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,707
- Alcohol, gambling and women!
- I deserve it!

676
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:23,332
- And now crickets?
- I deserve it!

677
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:26,915
- You didn't cherish your costume!
- I deserve it!

678
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,207
- You fucking ruined opera's tradition!
- I deserve it!

679
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:33,790
I deserve it! I deserve it!

680
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:36,124
Hold on a moment.

681
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,040
Nothing's wrong to beat him
with the stick for his disgrace.

682
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:50,374
- But for an opium addicted brother...
- Juxian!

683
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:58,332
I know it's not time
for a whore to interfere,

684
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:03,665
but you have to look at
both sides of everything.

685
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:04,207
Shut the fuck up!

686
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:07,374
Don't be so stupid!

687
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:25,749
Well, you are such a nice guy.

688
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:31,499
- Go on, hit me.
- Quiet, or I'll cut your throat!

689
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,707
Calm down! Calm down!

690
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:40,624
Alright. You could kill me,
but you'd also kill your child.

691
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:45,165
Your family will be over.

692
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:52,165
Did I tell you to stand up?

693
01:37:55,458 --> 01:38:02,374
Shitou, were you listening?
You are becoming a father.

694
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:10,415
If you stay away from being an actor, you won't
be able to buy a birthday present for your kid!

695
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,749
Come closer!

696
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,082
Closer!

697
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,540
Practice! Use your heart!

698
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:32,624
Don't be slacking.

699
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,915
Stretch out your legs!

700
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,624
Wait. Wait.

701
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,582
This play is called Fleeing by Night.

702
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:59,290
You are acting Linchou in this.

703
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:04,040
He's the head ofthe palace guard,
not some sneaky little thief.

704
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:05,707
Take this.

705
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,040
Attention, everyone!

706
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:12,665
This is what a great hero should be like.

707
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:23,040
A man doesn't lightly shed his tears

708
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:38,707
Unless his heart has broken into pieces

709
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:54,915
Leave me alone.
I'm taking master's punishment.

710
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:58,874
The troupe has disbanded.
You shall leave, too.

711
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:02,290
Master said that one should learn
how to endure to become a great actor.

712
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:09,290
- Everyone else has left. You ought to go too.
- I was found on the street as a baby.

713
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:18,457
- Do you know who found you?
- No. They wouldn't tell me.

714
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:24,290
- Do you still want to sing opera?
- Yes, even if I have to beg to support myself.

715
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,207
What's your name?

716
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:39,582
Xiao Si.

717
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:51,082
Xiao Si, go tell the manager to avoid trouble.

718
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,082
What's this? Why you stop singing?

719
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:10,040
Don't make trouble!

720
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:21,999
Don't go, Xiaolou.

721
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:43,665
Gentlemen,

722
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:52,124
waving flashlight is not allowed in the theater.

723
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:54,665
Even the Japanese didn't do this sort ofthing.

724
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:57,249
Everyone's here for the opera.

725
01:43:57,791 --> 01:43:59,415
Please return to your seats.

726
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:06,540
Well put. Back to your seats!

727
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:14,290
But can we let him get away
with speaking up for the Japanese?

728
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,165
- No!
- Beat him!

729
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:30,165
Xiaolou! Xiaolou!

730
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,874
Let go ofhim. Let go!

731
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:07,290
Juxian!

732
01:45:11,708 --> 01:45:13,165
I got you.

733
01:45:19,083 --> 01:45:20,374
So much blood...

734
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:23,874
Get her to a hospital.
Save her first! Hurry up!

735
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:30,749
Make way.

736
01:45:33,666 --> 01:45:37,582
There was only a minor disturbance.

737
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:40,499
There's no need to come and check.

738
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:43,249
You can fine us.

739
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,790
Why do you need to arrest anyone?

740
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:06,624
The theater's been trashed, people beaten;
and you still want to arrest him?

741
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:09,040
You can't do that!

742
01:46:16,416 --> 01:46:17,540
What for?

743
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:20,999
Are you asking me?

744
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:25,332
Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country
to the Japanese.

745
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:28,749
Move it!

746
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:31,499
On what base?

747
01:46:32,958 --> 01:46:34,124
Master!

748
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:37,790
Mr. Duan.

749
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:43,457
I'm afraid she's lost the baby.

750
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:57,540
Honey, I'm so sorry.

751
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:01,790
Go, help Dieyi.
Lfhe's more important to you.

752
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:29,915
I don't know whether Dieyi
goes looking for trouble,

753
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:32,832
or if it's trouble
that comes looking for him.

754
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,165
He's always making troubles.

755
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:42,749
Whenever you're with him,
my heart's in my throat.

756
01:47:47,416 --> 01:47:48,999
Now that I've lost our child,

757
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,665
you're all I have left.

758
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:57,665
I don't care if I have to
beg with you on the streets.

759
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:00,374
All I ask...

760
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:07,249
...is peace of mind.

761
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:15,915
If you help him this time,
we'll no longer owe him anything.

762
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,957
Don't perform with him anymore.

763
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:22,374
Promise me.

764
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:26,165
No more performance after this.

765
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:54,749
Master Yuan,

766
01:48:56,541 --> 01:49:01,165
Dieyi's life is in your hands.

767
01:49:02,541 --> 01:49:07,165
Count this. If it's not enough...

768
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,874
If only you'll save Dieyi,

769
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:16,832
we'll give you all our earnings
for the next three years.

770
01:49:18,125 --> 01:49:21,165
You think I need your money
to keep my birds from starving?

771
01:49:25,958 --> 01:49:27,332
And this gentleman is?

772
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:31,374
Don't you recognize Xiaolou?

773
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:37,249
He plays the king to Dieyi's concubine.

774
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:41,957
Then it should be him
who saves Concubine Yu.

775
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:46,332
My dear man, that's only a play!

776
01:49:47,416 --> 01:49:52,207
All Beijing knows that you Master Yuan
is the true king ofthe theater.

777
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,124
Yeah, it's true.

778
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,665
Speaking ofwhich, I'd like to
ask Mr. Duan something.

779
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:08,665
When the king returns to see Concubine Yu,
how many steps should he take?

780
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:13,582
Seven.

781
01:50:13,791 --> 01:50:15,124
Show me.

782
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:20,915
Come on, show me!

783
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:23,915
Master Yuan...

784
01:50:32,583 --> 01:50:34,832
Is this the home ofMr. Yuan?

785
01:50:38,875 --> 01:50:40,582
When a man called Cheng Dieyi
was arrested, he said...

786
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:46,082
...the owner ofthis sword
would be able to rescue him.

787
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:51,124
Do you recognize it?

788
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:08,707
From your facial expression,
I see I've come to the right place.

789
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:15,332
Good. I'll put the sword here.

790
01:51:16,916 --> 01:51:20,665
I'm so relieved to have found its owner.

791
01:51:26,458 --> 01:51:29,749
But sometimes one's hopes are misplaced.

792
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:34,624
Master Yuan, you mustn't blame Dieyi.

793
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:41,332
Hey, wait!

794
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:49,457
The reason why Dieyi performed for Japanese
wouldn't be by someone's request, would it?

795
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:56,249
If it would, he wouldn't have been arrested.

796
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,124
True!

797
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:06,874
There's a roomful of reporters
waiting at home.

798
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:09,332
Xiaolou, Mr. Na, let's go.

799
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:11,415
Wait a moment! Let's talk.

800
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:22,915
Master Yuan asked me to talk to you.

801
01:52:25,583 --> 01:52:26,957
Tomorrow in court,

802
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,124
say the Japanese put a gun to your head;

803
01:52:32,041 --> 01:52:34,332
say they tortured you.

804
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:38,290
Master Yuan has made arrangements
for everything else.

805
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:50,415
This is from Xiaolou.

806
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:03,207
Dieyi, don't blame us.

807
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:05,290
Xiaolou's child...

808
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:18,499
It's karma! Your twisted partnership
with Xiaolou caused this!

809
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:33,415
After you getting out ofhere,
just go your own way.

810
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:45,874
During the resistance against Japan,

811
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:50,832
Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country
by performing...

812
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,790
...for Aoki and his colleagues.

813
01:53:55,208 --> 01:53:59,874
You performed for their immorality.

814
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:03,749
The defendant also encouraged the enemy
and disgraced your people.

815
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:10,290
Aoki continued to resist
even after Japan officially surrendered.

816
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:14,957
We've collected these pictures as evidence...

817
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:20,832
...and they confirm the defendant
sang for the Japanese.

818
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:30,249
We call on the witnesses Yuan Shiqing,
Duan Xiaolou and Na Kun.

819
01:54:38,666 --> 01:54:42,624
The government has always been good to me.

820
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:46,874
Nor would I betray
the laws or my own conscience.

821
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:53,957
Cheng Dieyi was taken away
in handcuffs by the Japanese.

822
01:54:55,333 --> 01:55:01,332
They put a gun to the back ofhis neck.
He couldn't do anything.

823
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:05,790
Duan Xiaolou?

824
01:55:06,875 --> 01:55:10,374
It's true. The Japanese
beat up my stage brother.

825
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:13,249
Exactly as Master Yuan has just described.

826
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:14,249
Na Kun?

827
01:55:19,166 --> 01:55:19,999
He...

828
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:26,665
The prosecutor claims Cheng
performed obscene material.

829
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:32,874
That is ridiculous!

830
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:46,040
Cheng performed highlights from
Peony Pavilion that night.

831
01:55:47,375 --> 01:55:50,040
Anyone with any common sense knows that...

832
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:54,165
...Peony Pavilion is the
quintessential Chinese opera.

833
01:55:54,833 --> 01:56:00,749
How can that be obscene
to the prosecutor's eye?

834
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:07,165
How dare you insult
our tradition and culture like this!

835
01:56:08,583 --> 01:56:13,040
Who's disparaging Chinese tradition...

836
01:56:16,166 --> 01:56:18,540
...and its culture?

837
01:56:18,791 --> 01:56:20,082
Well put!

838
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:27,290
We ask the accused, Cheng Dieyi.

839
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:31,374
Have the witnesses told the truth?

840
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:46,999
The court wishes to hear
what the accused has to say.

841
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:54,582
The accused may say now.

842
01:56:58,291 --> 01:56:59,957
I sang for the Japanese.

843
01:57:03,041 --> 01:57:04,290
I hate the Japanese too.

844
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:12,082
But they didn't lay a hand on me.

845
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,624
Cheng Dieyi,

846
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:22,915
You have the right and duty...

847
01:57:23,083 --> 01:57:25,790
...to clear your name.

848
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,249
Reconsider carefully and tell us again.

849
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:44,290
LfAoki had lived, he'd have
taken the Beijing Opera to Japan.

850
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:51,082
Why don't youjust kill me?

851
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:57,332
Master Yuan, Master Yuan!

852
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,707
What are you doing here?

853
01:58:15,458 --> 01:58:17,790
Please, Master Yuan, don't leave.

854
01:58:18,083 --> 01:58:20,499
What does it matter?
He's as good as dead.

855
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:25,249
Master Yuan, you can't go.
If you leave, he's finished for sure.

856
01:58:27,333 --> 01:58:28,624
The court has made its decision.

857
01:58:30,208 --> 01:58:34,749
The case ofthe traitor
Cheng Dieyi is suspended.

858
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:41,332
The accused is released under bond.

859
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,165
Court dismissed!

860
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:49,124
What's going on?

861
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:57,874
Dieyi, are you playing with me?
Goddamn it!

862
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:12,082
Mr. Cheng, good-bye.

863
01:59:17,791 --> 01:59:19,374
This way, Mr. Cheng.

864
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,540
The commander has arrived.

865
01:59:51,625 --> 01:59:52,957
Attention!

866
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,957
Chunxiang!

867
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:20,832
Miss!

868
02:00:22,166 --> 02:00:33,749
How can one know the beauty of spring
unless one visits the garden

869
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:40,707
To Mom:
Did you get my last letter?

870
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:44,582
Everything's fine here.

871
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:46,999
Don't worry about me.

872
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:49,540
Xiaolou's been...

873
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:52,749
...wholeheartedly looking after me.

874
02:00:53,416 --> 02:00:56,165
We rehearse by day,

875
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:59,374
and perform at night.

876
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,707
Just like before.

877
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,915
The world's not what it used to be,

878
02:01:06,458 --> 02:01:09,207
but all we ask is a peaceful life.

879
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:15,124
We sing and get paid for.
Keep ourselves safe and that's all.

880
02:01:15,958 --> 02:01:20,790
The kitty is waiting around
for one smell ofyour smoke.

881
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:22,832
See? It's satisfied, right?

882
02:01:24,083 --> 02:01:27,249
Dieyi, should I mail this to...

883
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:29,915
- The usual address.
- Got it.

884
02:01:32,875 --> 02:01:35,665
All you classic vulnerable heroines...

885
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:37,665
...burn your letters and stuff.

886
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:45,582
Have you seen this?

887
02:01:46,625 --> 02:01:48,790
Do you want it?

888
02:01:49,833 --> 02:01:54,415
You don't want it?
Fine, I'll tear it up.

889
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:59,665
Well, I'm tearing it up. See that?

890
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:14,499
Xiao Si!

891
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:17,332
Master Duan took the sword.

892
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:41,582
The river's course is twisted,
but in the end it flows to the sea.

893
02:02:42,166 --> 02:02:44,957
But what problem lies between
our concubine and our king?

894
02:02:45,875 --> 02:02:48,624
Talk to each other,
or the Han King will take the city.

895
02:03:02,666 --> 02:03:07,624
The year 1948, the eve of
the Nationalist's evacuation to Taiwan

896
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:15,832
For better or worse, we Manchus
ruled the country for three centuries.

897
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:21,832
The Republics onlyjust begun,
and already has being overthrown.

898
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:26,499
But even the Communists
have to come see opera.

899
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:32,374
The empire may change hands,
but you two are alwaying superstars.

900
02:03:32,791 --> 02:03:33,582
Right?

901
02:03:34,875 --> 02:03:37,290
Just wait, we'll make a fortune.

902
02:03:38,958 --> 02:03:41,582
Well, do you still want to
pick a fight with the ragtag troops?

903
02:03:42,666 --> 02:03:46,624
I'll fight them
ifthey don't behave themselves.

904
02:03:46,916 --> 02:03:50,082
Unless you had Master Yuan's class,

905
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:54,165
we are capable offighting them.

906
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:55,540
You know that?

907
02:04:13,416 --> 02:04:15,290
Do you recognize me?

908
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:17,540
Cigarettes! Buy one!

909
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,415
Mr. Zhang, don't you remember us?

910
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,082
Cigarettes! Buy a pack!

911
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:59,624
Song of sorrow and grief of my king
cause me shed tears

912
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:16,124
To console your saddened heart
I'd rather dance and sing a song for you

913
02:05:17,166 --> 02:05:22,665
Please, my beloved.

914
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:33,624
A dance for... for my king.

915
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:44,207
Xiao Si, tell him to
stay calm no matter what.

916
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:52,999
Honorable guests, I'm very sorry.

917
02:05:55,166 --> 02:05:58,207
Today my fellow actor is...

918
02:06:16,083 --> 02:06:20,040
Let's sing a song, ready?

919
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:22,749
Marching! Marching! Marching!

920
02:06:23,708 --> 02:06:27,457
Our army is marching for the sun,

921
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:31,582
stepping on the great motherland.

922
02:06:31,958 --> 02:06:35,624
With hopes of nation on our shoulders,

923
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,665
no enemy can stop us from our course.

924
02:06:41,625 --> 02:06:46,290
Mr. Cheng, ifyou can't take it,
have another smoke.

925
02:06:47,125 --> 02:06:49,249
Xiao Si, go call Mr. Duan.

926
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:51,915
Down with the counter-revolutionary
Yuan Shiqing!

927
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:58,582
Yuan Shiqing is an enemy ofthe people,
who must be put to execution!

928
02:07:02,208 --> 02:07:09,499
Be alert! Be vigilant!

929
02:07:11,083 --> 02:07:15,165
Yuan Shiqing, the counter-revolutionary one.

930
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:18,082
He has harmed his community...

931
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,332
...and is guilty of monstrous crimes.

932
02:07:23,166 --> 02:07:25,499
Only execution can satisfy the people's anger.

933
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:30,874
Down with the counter-revolutionary
Yuan Shiqing!

934
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,249
Down with the tyrant of
the opera world, Yuan Shiqing!

935
02:07:40,458 --> 02:07:42,499
Death to Yuan Shiqing!

936
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:47,457
Satisfy the people's anger!

937
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:49,332
Take him away!

938
02:08:11,208 --> 02:08:14,082
Only execution can satisfy the people's anger.

939
02:08:17,125 --> 02:08:18,415
Execution?

940
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:24,124
Yuan's been put to execution?

941
02:08:24,291 --> 02:08:25,290
Keep your voice down.

942
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:54,374
Let me go! Release me!

943
02:08:58,791 --> 02:08:59,957
Calm down!

944
02:09:11,541 --> 02:09:15,374
Cut it out! Listen to me okay?

945
02:09:16,083 --> 02:09:18,457
You will go through this.

946
02:09:24,541 --> 02:09:26,915
Cut it out or I'll hit you!

947
02:09:47,041 --> 02:09:47,874
Stay clam!

948
02:09:52,166 --> 02:09:54,707
- How is he?
- We may need to wean him...

949
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,540
...from the opium slowly.
Stay here and watch him.

950
02:09:57,791 --> 02:09:59,665
Don't leave, Xiaolou.

951
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:01,749
Lfhe really wants to
overcome his addiction,

952
02:10:02,083 --> 02:10:03,999
he's got a long way to go.

953
02:10:44,458 --> 02:10:45,332
It feels like ice.

954
02:10:51,666 --> 02:10:52,749
Mom!

955
02:10:54,416 --> 02:10:56,124
The river may get frozen.

956
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,082
It feels like ice.

957
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:06,332
Mom!

958
02:11:07,916 --> 02:11:09,999
It's getting frozen.

959
02:11:13,291 --> 02:11:14,332
So cold...

960
02:11:17,708 --> 02:11:19,165
I got you.

961
02:11:37,416 --> 02:11:38,332
Mrs. Duan!

962
02:11:40,916 --> 02:11:41,999
Where were you?

963
02:11:42,791 --> 02:11:43,874
A meeting.

964
02:11:44,916 --> 02:11:45,957
A meeting?

965
02:11:54,041 --> 02:11:55,665
Xiaolou, the whole troupe's come.

966
02:11:55,958 --> 02:11:57,290
- Come in!
- Please come in.

967
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:03,457
Ah, a costume change!

968
02:12:07,625 --> 02:12:11,249
Thank you all for coming
to see me. I'm fine now.

969
02:12:11,666 --> 02:12:14,957
Sounds easy now.
You didn't see him suffer.

970
02:12:15,166 --> 02:12:19,707
Dieyi, get out ofbed.
All of Beijing is waiting...

971
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:22,790
...for the next appearance
ofthe King and his Concubine.

972
02:12:23,583 --> 02:12:26,790
It'll be the goddamn golden hit
of a golden era!

973
02:12:34,791 --> 02:12:38,957
You've asked me to say a few words.
I'm not sure how to put it.

974
02:12:41,125 --> 02:12:44,707
I think these Modern Operas
are quite interesting,

975
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:48,832
but the costumes aren't very attractive.

976
02:12:49,666 --> 02:12:53,040
The backdrops are too realistic.

977
02:12:54,166 --> 02:12:56,249
Yet Beijing Opera puts
great value on ambiance.

978
02:12:56,791 --> 02:13:00,582
Song recital, movement and acrobatics
are part ofthis ambiance.

979
02:13:02,916 --> 02:13:05,499
But with these costumes on,

980
02:13:06,916 --> 02:13:08,915
performance won't look good.

981
02:13:10,208 --> 02:13:13,540
You know, it really concerns me.

982
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:15,624
What do you think?

983
02:13:21,958 --> 02:13:24,999
Are you saying that Modern Operas
aren't Beijing Operas?

984
02:13:25,833 --> 02:13:28,374
Do you really know about Beijing Operas?

985
02:13:28,708 --> 02:13:31,540
No sound is but a song,
no movement is but a dance.

986
02:13:32,041 --> 02:13:35,665
It must have the sense ofbeauty.
For instance...

987
02:13:36,166 --> 02:13:39,332
Teacher, I don't get it.

988
02:13:41,875 --> 02:13:45,332
When you've sweated enough
to fill buckets, you'll get it!

989
02:13:46,416 --> 02:13:48,207
- I still don't understand.
- Xiao Si!

990
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:50,707
I just don't get it!

991
02:13:51,541 --> 02:13:54,415
Why is it Beijing Opera when
ancient heroes and beauties take the stage,

992
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,457
but not when the laboring masses do?

993
02:13:58,625 --> 02:14:00,874
You're talking apples and oranges.
Don't be stupid!

994
02:14:01,041 --> 02:14:01,874
What kind of attitude is that?

995
02:14:05,625 --> 02:14:07,790
I'd like to hear from Teacher Duan.

996
02:14:08,041 --> 02:14:08,957
Xiaolou!

997
02:14:17,458 --> 02:14:19,957
It's going to rain.
I've brought you the umbrella.

998
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:22,374
Here!

999
02:14:30,833 --> 02:14:34,665
Yes, yes. Run along home now.

1000
02:14:49,458 --> 02:14:52,290
Questions like these give me a headache.

1001
02:14:53,750 --> 02:15:00,082
I say if it uses the traditional forms,
then it's Beijing Opera.

1002
02:15:01,416 --> 02:15:02,332
Am I right?

1003
02:15:04,333 --> 02:15:05,582
I'd like to say something.

1004
02:15:09,708 --> 02:15:13,124
I've been part ofthe New Society...

1005
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:14,957
...since giving my theater to the state.

1006
02:15:17,208 --> 02:15:18,624
Comrade Cheng, I believe you're wrong.

1007
02:15:21,958 --> 02:15:27,457
Modern Opera is a new venture.
It deserves our support.

1008
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,749
Opera requires practice,
don't think you know it well!

1009
02:15:38,458 --> 02:15:42,457
It requires practice, skill and talent.
You know that?

1010
02:15:43,625 --> 02:15:44,874
There's no easy way!

1011
02:15:45,458 --> 02:15:47,999
You're breaking the law
for punishing me like this.

1012
02:15:48,916 --> 02:15:51,624
If I don't do this,
you'll always be third-rate.

1013
02:15:52,041 --> 02:15:53,707
Don't even think about success!

1014
02:15:56,708 --> 02:16:00,790
And when did you ever
seriously want me to succeed?

1015
02:16:01,833 --> 02:16:04,790
All you've ever wanted
was a coolie, a stagehand,

1016
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,457
a follower, a bit player!

1017
02:16:08,375 --> 02:16:13,290
How dare you!
How dare you say such rubbish!

1018
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:19,499
Kneel down!

1019
02:16:21,708 --> 02:16:27,540
Master Cheng, you won't
live to see the day ever.

1020
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,249
Xiao Si!

1021
02:16:51,083 --> 02:16:54,290
Go, then! Be a bit player your whole life!

1022
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:01,082
Mr. Cheng,

1023
02:17:02,250 --> 02:17:08,082
your saying belongs to the past.

1024
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:14,124
It's not going to work in the present day!

1025
02:17:15,916 --> 02:17:20,874
If I end up being third-rate,
it'll ruin your reputation!

1026
02:18:06,958 --> 02:18:10,249
So, you know?

1027
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,290
I... I just learned myself.

1028
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:19,040
That's not true, Teacher Duan.

1029
02:18:19,833 --> 02:18:22,790
You were there at the meeting last night.

1030
02:18:28,041 --> 02:18:31,124
You said you'd notify Dieyi
that you were replacing him.

1031
02:18:31,541 --> 02:18:32,915
I had second thoughts.

1032
02:18:33,625 --> 02:18:37,665
I decided you should tell him.
Don't you agree?

1033
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:42,749
If you couldn't tell him, who could?

1034
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:47,499
Take it off!

1035
02:18:51,375 --> 02:18:54,749
- Don't be like that.
- I won't fucking sing anymore!

1036
02:18:55,416 --> 02:18:56,707
Leave me alone!

1037
02:18:59,041 --> 02:19:00,832
Xiaolou, you mustn't go.

1038
02:19:07,958 --> 02:19:09,665
Comrade Duan,

1039
02:19:15,916 --> 02:19:18,874
That audience is made up
ofthe laboring masses.

1040
02:19:20,125 --> 02:19:24,290
You decide whether you'll
sing for them or not.

1041
02:19:39,541 --> 02:19:41,832
Xiaolou, the Concubine is on stage.

1042
02:19:42,166 --> 02:19:43,415
You'd better hurry.

1043
02:19:47,041 --> 02:19:50,457
Xiaolou? Master Duan?

1044
02:20:11,708 --> 02:20:25,749
I've followed my king on his military campaigns
Enduring the wind and frost and hard toil

1045
02:20:29,125 --> 02:20:44,207
I hate only the lawless tyrant who has
plunged our people into an abyss of misery

1046
02:21:07,041 --> 02:21:20,624
The people have suffered
untold hardship and pain

1047
02:21:21,458 --> 02:21:25,540
The king has returned to camp.

1048
02:21:27,083 --> 02:21:31,624
I'm here.

1049
02:21:41,208 --> 02:21:43,999
Your highness.

1050
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,624
Thank you very much, Miss Juxian.

1051
02:22:17,291 --> 02:22:18,082
Dieyi!

1052
02:22:21,375 --> 02:22:24,415
Dieyi, open the door!

1053
02:22:29,916 --> 02:22:32,832
Won't you accept my apology?

1054
02:22:40,291 --> 02:22:42,499
That little snake you rescued,

1055
02:22:44,333 --> 02:22:46,207
he has turned into a veritable dragon.

1056
02:22:46,833 --> 02:22:47,665
You have to go along with it.

1057
02:22:49,958 --> 02:22:52,165
What else can you do?

1058
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:57,415
No matter what, as you told me,
you have to keep on singing!

1059
02:22:58,583 --> 02:23:01,665
It's not like old days.
Just wake up and see the world!

1060
02:23:06,791 --> 02:23:11,290
Douzi, listen to your stage brother.
Go with the times.

1061
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:13,624
I'll still be the king
and you my concubine.

1062
02:23:16,541 --> 02:23:18,832
Why does the concubine have to die?

1063
02:23:24,375 --> 02:23:30,707
Dieyi, you're way too obsessed.

1064
02:23:33,125 --> 02:23:34,624
That's the play, for heaven's sake!

1065
02:24:46,708 --> 02:24:50,874
The year 1966,
the eve ofthe Cultural Revolution

1066
02:24:54,291 --> 02:24:56,374
Central People's Radio will now
broadcast the decision ofthe Chinese...

1067
02:24:57,916 --> 02:25:05,124
...Communist Party Central Committee regarding
the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

1068
02:25:06,583 --> 02:25:09,374
passed on August 8, 1966.

1069
02:25:11,208 --> 02:25:15,624
The bill for Cultural Revolution has passed.

1070
02:25:18,208 --> 02:25:21,290
Cultural Revolution will...

1071
02:25:21,791 --> 02:25:24,499
...reconstruct people's mind.

1072
02:26:40,208 --> 02:26:42,749
Why you wanna drink at a time like this?

1073
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:45,374
I feel like it.

1074
02:26:50,958 --> 02:26:54,499
Jade cups were part ofthe Old Society.

1075
02:26:56,750 --> 02:27:01,374
We can't keep them anyway,
so use them for one last time.

1076
02:28:07,833 --> 02:28:08,999
It still won't break!

1077
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:02,707
I'm so afraid...

1078
02:29:06,708 --> 02:29:09,124
I dreamed I was on top of
a tall building alone...

1079
02:29:11,083 --> 02:29:12,540
...amongst the clouds.

1080
02:29:14,541 --> 02:29:18,582
I wanted to jump.

1081
02:29:19,541 --> 02:29:22,124
Jump! I'd catch you.

1082
02:29:24,958 --> 02:29:29,374
You weren't there.

1083
02:29:34,416 --> 02:29:37,999
Xiaolou, don't leave me.

1084
02:30:43,041 --> 02:30:44,707
Where did you get this sword?

1085
02:30:46,958 --> 02:30:49,790
Cheng Dieyi gave it to me.

1086
02:30:50,416 --> 02:30:51,707
How many times did he give it to you?

1087
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:54,332
Twice.

1088
02:30:55,291 --> 02:30:57,249
When was the second time?

1089
02:30:58,208 --> 02:31:01,124
Shortly before the liberation of Beijing.

1090
02:31:01,458 --> 02:31:02,290
Where?

1091
02:31:04,750 --> 02:31:06,290
On the street in front ofthe theater.

1092
02:31:06,916 --> 02:31:09,207
What did you say to each other?

1093
02:31:11,541 --> 02:31:16,207
It was quite chaotic. I don't remember.

1094
02:31:17,208 --> 02:31:18,457
Try it.

1095
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:22,207
We didn't say anything!

1096
02:31:22,666 --> 02:31:23,915
Keep thinking.

1097
02:31:24,791 --> 02:31:27,915
Lfwe did, I can't recall.

1098
02:31:28,291 --> 02:31:32,082
Something about what
you'd do to the Communists?

1099
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:37,582
No! Certainly not!

1100
02:31:38,416 --> 02:31:40,040
I'd stake my life on it.

1101
02:31:41,958 --> 02:31:44,082
But what ifwe've got a witness?

1102
02:31:44,291 --> 02:31:47,290
Who? Bring out the bastard!

1103
02:31:56,916 --> 02:32:01,832
Na Kun! What did I say?

1104
02:32:02,583 --> 02:32:09,832
I'll give you a hint.
Something about ragtag troops.

1105
02:32:13,916 --> 02:32:16,582
Na Kun! This is pure slander!

1106
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,165
You reactionary old theater boss!
You only want to protect yourself!

1107
02:32:20,916 --> 02:32:23,415
You said you'd take on the ragtag troops.

1108
02:32:23,583 --> 02:32:25,415
No! I never said that!

1109
02:32:29,625 --> 02:32:30,707
What I meant was...

1110
02:32:31,291 --> 02:32:32,332
I was trying to say...

1111
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,207
No, I said nothing at all!

1112
02:32:36,875 --> 02:32:39,832
Mr. Na, help me.

1113
02:32:44,041 --> 02:32:48,540
You've been smashing bricks
since you were a boy, haven't you?

1114
02:32:49,916 --> 02:32:51,207
Do it for us.

1115
02:32:53,416 --> 02:32:54,457
Do it!

1116
02:32:58,250 --> 02:32:59,582
Come on!

1117
02:33:27,208 --> 02:33:30,749
Duan Xiaolou, aren't you the King?

1118
02:33:33,416 --> 02:33:35,415
No, I'm not.

1119
02:33:36,125 --> 02:33:37,707
But you've always been the King, haven't you?

1120
02:33:40,625 --> 02:33:41,790
That's just an opera.

1121
02:33:45,416 --> 02:33:46,457
It's not real life.

1122
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,165
Did you go to brothels in the Old Society?

1123
02:33:51,291 --> 02:33:52,415
Yes.

1124
02:33:53,375 --> 02:33:54,707
Don't you think that's shameful?

1125
02:33:56,708 --> 02:33:59,582
Yes.

1126
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:02,874
What did Juxian do when you married her?

1127
02:34:05,416 --> 02:34:06,790
A prostitute.

1128
02:34:10,458 --> 02:34:11,290
Good.

1129
02:34:13,583 --> 02:34:15,290
Now tell us what we need to know
about Cheng Dieyi.

1130
02:34:16,416 --> 02:34:18,665
Of course, you don't have to tell anything.

1131
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:23,040
You saw what happened to Yuan Shiqing.

1132
02:34:24,208 --> 02:34:25,624
Make your own decision.

1133
02:34:28,125 --> 02:34:30,874
Sweep away all sorts ofbad characters!

1134
02:34:31,416 --> 02:34:34,165
Destroy our enemy!

1135
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:40,957
Uncover the black gangs!
Cut offthe vacious hands!

1136
02:34:44,541 --> 02:34:47,332
Seize the black hands that
have infiltrated the cultural world!

1137
02:34:50,875 --> 02:34:53,874
Revolution is the only way to the truth!

1138
02:34:57,958 --> 02:35:00,165
Sweep away all sorts ofbad characters!

1139
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:30,457
Xiaolou!

1140
02:35:59,208 --> 02:36:00,957
Duan Xiaolou is the reactionary king!

1141
02:36:01,333 --> 02:36:03,124
Duan Xiaolou is vicious!

1142
02:36:03,416 --> 02:36:06,040
Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi
are anti-Party elements!

1143
02:36:06,958 --> 02:36:12,040
Down with Duan Xiaolou!
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1144
02:36:13,041 --> 02:36:16,249
Talk! Talk!

1145
02:36:17,875 --> 02:36:19,374
Sweep away all sorts ofbad characters!

1146
02:36:25,375 --> 02:36:26,540
Talk! Talk!

1147
02:36:26,791 --> 02:36:27,665
All right, I'll tell you.

1148
02:36:30,041 --> 02:36:34,374
He's totally mad about opera.

1149
02:36:34,666 --> 02:36:36,165
Who? Make yourself clear.

1150
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:41,040
Cheng Dieyi!

1151
02:36:42,708 --> 02:36:44,082
All he cares about is opera.

1152
02:36:44,791 --> 02:36:48,207
No matter who was in the audience
or which class they belonged to...

1153
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:51,415
he'd still do his utmost.

1154
02:36:52,625 --> 02:36:56,332
You're not being straight with us!

1155
02:36:58,416 --> 02:37:01,165
If you don't give in, we will annihilate you.

1156
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:11,082
At the start ofthe War of Resistance,

1157
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:17,499
he sang for the Japanese.

1158
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:20,665
He was...

1159
02:37:23,083 --> 02:37:25,124
He was a traitor!

1160
02:37:25,583 --> 02:37:27,249
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1161
02:37:31,291 --> 02:37:35,665
He sang for the Nationalist soldiers;

1162
02:37:35,958 --> 02:37:38,499
he sang for capitalists, landlords
and the idle rich;

1163
02:37:38,791 --> 02:37:41,082
he sang for the reactionaries;

1164
02:37:41,333 --> 02:37:44,415
he sang for the tyrant of
the opera world, Yuan Shiqing!

1165
02:37:44,625 --> 02:37:45,915
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1166
02:37:47,375 --> 02:37:48,540
What else? Tell us.

1167
02:37:51,416 --> 02:37:54,665
He smoked opium
like there was no tomorrow,

1168
02:37:55,166 --> 02:37:59,249
he smoked away the blood and sweat
ofthe laboring masses.

1169
02:37:59,791 --> 02:38:01,540
Keep going! Get to the point!

1170
02:38:02,958 --> 02:38:04,415
Say it! Say it!

1171
02:38:05,958 --> 02:38:07,582
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1172
02:38:16,541 --> 02:38:17,332
Come on.

1173
02:38:28,291 --> 02:38:31,249
In order to get on Yuan Shiqing's good side,

1174
02:38:33,250 --> 02:38:34,374
he...

1175
02:38:36,041 --> 02:38:37,207
Did you or did you not?

1176
02:38:39,541 --> 02:38:42,707
He became Yuan Shiqing's...

1177
02:38:42,875 --> 02:38:46,957
- Xiaolou!
- You were his... Didn't you?

1178
02:38:52,458 --> 02:38:54,207
Sweep away all sorts ofbad characters!

1179
02:39:00,833 --> 02:39:03,290
Scholars and Beauties?
Kings and Ministers?

1180
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:07,874
Monsters and Demons!

1181
02:39:26,875 --> 02:39:28,415
You've all betrayed me!

1182
02:39:31,416 --> 02:39:33,165
Betrayed me!

1183
02:39:39,958 --> 02:39:41,207
I've got something to unmask as well!

1184
02:39:42,458 --> 02:39:46,624
I'll reveal everything.

1185
02:39:49,666 --> 02:39:54,624
Xiaolou, you've no conscience.

1186
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:57,332
You are as greedy as a wolf!

1187
02:39:58,750 --> 02:40:00,582
From the moment you
got involved with this woman,

1188
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:05,457
I knew you were finished.

1189
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:10,874
You think disasterjust falls from the sky?

1190
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:13,790
No. No way.

1191
02:40:15,125 --> 02:40:20,207
We have come step by step towards this fate.

1192
02:40:20,375 --> 02:40:21,874
It's retribution.

1193
02:40:23,625 --> 02:40:25,249
I'm despicable,
and I have been so for a long time.

1194
02:40:26,333 --> 02:40:29,665
But now even the King of Chu
is on his knees begging for mercy!

1195
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,124
Can Beijing Opera survive?

1196
02:40:33,791 --> 02:40:35,415
It's doomed, isn't it?

1197
02:40:38,375 --> 02:40:39,415
This is what's called retribution!

1198
02:40:41,458 --> 02:40:42,749
Karmic retribution!

1199
02:40:44,458 --> 02:40:45,749
And I have something else to unmask.

1200
02:40:47,291 --> 02:40:48,290
See that woman?

1201
02:40:50,875 --> 02:40:54,374
Who is she? I'll tell you.

1202
02:40:56,333 --> 02:41:02,790
Slut! Pan Jinlian!
Top whore at the House of Blossoms!

1203
02:41:04,791 --> 02:41:06,999
Fight against her!

1204
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:21,957
Duan Xiaolou, is it true she was a prostitute?

1205
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:24,457
Well, was she?

1206
02:41:25,583 --> 02:41:26,332
Tell us!

1207
02:41:28,666 --> 02:41:29,499
Yes.

1208
02:41:31,958 --> 02:41:32,915
Do you love her?

1209
02:41:35,333 --> 02:41:36,374
Do you?

1210
02:41:40,916 --> 02:41:46,874
No. No, I don't love her.

1211
02:41:49,083 --> 02:41:50,040
Is this the truth?

1212
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:52,832
Really! I really don't love her.

1213
02:41:53,375 --> 02:41:54,457
I'll never have anything to do with her again.

1214
02:41:58,833 --> 02:42:09,749
Nothing at all!
From now on, we got no relation!

1215
02:43:48,375 --> 02:43:53,165
Juxian! Juxian!

1216
02:44:10,291 --> 02:44:16,249
Listen to Grandma talking about revolution

1217
02:44:17,083 --> 02:44:22,874
Heroic and encouraging

1218
02:44:47,125 --> 02:44:58,457
The soldiers of Han have invaded

1219
02:45:01,416 --> 02:45:11,415
The songs of Chu can be heard on all sides

1220
02:45:12,666 --> 02:45:15,790
My king,

1221
02:45:44,125 --> 02:45:48,207
give me your precious sword
to end my life.

1222
02:45:50,541 --> 02:45:57,082
No! You mustn't do that!

1223
02:45:59,125 --> 02:46:04,874
- My king, give me your precious sword.
- No! You mustn't...

1224
02:46:13,458 --> 02:46:14,582
It's not working.

1225
02:46:17,041 --> 02:46:18,124
I can't do it.

1226
02:46:20,375 --> 02:46:21,457
I'm old.

1227
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,040
At sixteen, I am a nun.

1228
02:46:45,708 --> 02:46:48,707
My hair is shorn at youth's prime.

1229
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,749
I am by nature a boy...

1230
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,207
Not a girl.

1231
02:46:52,666 --> 02:46:54,499
You got that wrong again!

1232
02:47:05,666 --> 02:47:11,999
I am by nature a boy, not a girl.

1233
02:47:17,125 --> 02:47:19,790
Let's do it again.

1234
02:47:22,166 --> 02:47:25,874
My king, give me your precious sword
to end my life.

1235
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:34,707
No! You mustn't do that!

1236
02:47:36,708 --> 02:47:48,332
- My king, give me your precious sword.
- No! You mustn't...

1237
02:47:50,875 --> 02:47:55,957
Han's troops are entering the city!

1238
02:47:56,166 --> 02:47:57,832
Where?

1239
02:48:28,875 --> 02:48:30,374
Dieyi!

1240
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:39,332
Douzi...

1241
02:48:54,708 --> 02:48:57,915
In Beijing, 1990,
an opera performance was held...

1242
02:48:58,083 --> 02:49:19,332
...to commemorate the 200th anniversary
of Anhui Opera Troupes.
