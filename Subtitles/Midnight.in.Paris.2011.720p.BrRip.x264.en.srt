1
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,250
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

2
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,310
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

3
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,640
You act like you've never been here before.

4
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,500
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

5
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,790
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

6
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

7
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,470
in the rain; the artists and writers.

8
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,630
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

9
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,050
What's wonderful about getting wet?

10
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,710
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

11
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,370
Oh God, no.

12
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,610
I could never live out of the United States.

13
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,380
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,

14
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,870
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

15
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,650
I'll tell you something:

16
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,020
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

17
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,000
the pool, everything,
in a second.

18
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,510
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

19
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,510
We're 30 minutes from town.

20
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,510
Imagine the two of us settling here.

21
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,040
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

22
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,630
You're in love with a fantasy.

23
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm in love with you.

24
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,270
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

25
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,510
Let's meet 'em.

26
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

27
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,140
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

28
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,490
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

29
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,090
I could see myself living here!

30
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,110
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."

31
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,310
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

32
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,250
you know, baguette under my arm,

33
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,920
headed to CafÃ© de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

34
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,730
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast."

35
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,510
In this traffic, nothing moves.

36
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,020
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!

37
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,790
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

38
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,080
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,430
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

40
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

41
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,890
I'm not a big Francophile.

42
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,940
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

43
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,890
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

44
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,780
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

45
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,940
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

46
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,980
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's

47
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,050
fine for your father and I to disagree.

48
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,260
That's what a democracy is.

49
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,990
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,

50
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,110
and I happen to think you almost got to be

51
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,430
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

52
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,220
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

53
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,740
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

54
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,850
Let's do that.

55
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,420
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

56
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,170
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

57
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,570
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

58
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,630
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

59
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,790
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

61
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,550
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

62
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,440
No, it was sudden. Um...

64
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,500
Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) <i>Sorbonne.</i>

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,170
Oh, how wonderful!

66
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,420
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

67
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,180
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

68
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,210
That's great. We can spend some time together.

69
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,890
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

70
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,900
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

71
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,810
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...

72
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,890
- Versailles.
- Oh,

73
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,890
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

74
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,590
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...

75
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,700
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,600
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

77
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,360
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

78
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,340
and saw James Joyce!

79
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,440
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

80
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,140
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

81
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,480
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

82
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,440
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

83
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,530
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

84
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,350
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

85
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,780
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

86
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,180
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

87
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,900
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

88
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

89
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,240
He's brilliant.

90
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,800
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

91
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,040
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

92
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,830
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

93
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,800
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,410
You should give him your book to read.

95
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,990
Oh, come on. Why?

96
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,050
No, because he could critique your writing,

97
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,480
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

99
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,360
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

100
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,600
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...

101
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,060
Honey, just promise me something.

102
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,780
If this book...doesn't pan out,

103
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,050
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

104
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,030
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

105
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,850
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

106
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,380
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

107
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,470
- Well...
- Mmm?

108
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
Mmm?

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,030
Why would you...want to do that?

110
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,370
I believe Louis moved his court here,

111
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,710
uh, in 1682.

112
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,800
Originally, all this was swampland.

113
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,680
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

114
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,010
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

115
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,300
means, uh, something like,

116
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,670
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."
- Is that right?

117
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,380
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

118
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,270
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.

119
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,400
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,260
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...

121
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,560
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.

122
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,570
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,690
I could get used to a summer home like this.

124
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,610
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

125
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,780
except, remember: in those days,

126
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,870
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

127
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,660
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

128
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,960
Uh...Malibu.

129
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,630
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

130
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

131
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,490
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,

132
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,210
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

133
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,790
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,680
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

135
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

136
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,380
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...

137
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,770
well, everyone loves your movies.

138
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,340
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

139
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,020
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

140
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,890
- Yes!  - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

141
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,590
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

142
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,580
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

143
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,320
He works in a nostalgia shop.

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,690
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,300
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

146
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,270
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

147
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,630
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

148
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,490
people who think that
their lives would be happier

149
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,880
if they lived in an earlier time.

150
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,580
And just which era

151
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,890
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

152
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,990
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

153
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,860
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

154
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,870
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

155
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,950
no TV and suicide bombing,

156
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,050
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

157
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,760
Usual menu of clichÃ©d horror stories.

158
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,880
You know, nostalgia is denial.

159
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,270
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

160
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,080
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

161
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,170
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

162
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,370
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

163
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,740
is called "golden-age thinking."

164
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,440
- TouchÃ©.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

165
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,890
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

166
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,720
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

167
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,930
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

168
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,230
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

169
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,740
Diamonds for a wedding band.

170
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,330
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

171
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,900
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

172
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,950
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

173
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,160
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

174
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,280
It's your choice. What can I say?

175
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,930
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.

176
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,790
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

177
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,300
Well, that frightens me.

178
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,950
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

179
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,380
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

180
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,880
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,210
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

182
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,560
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

183
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,320
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

184
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.

185
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,610
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

186
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,850
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

187
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,870
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,730
Yes, he did marry Rose,

189
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,290
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

190
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,560
Are you arguing with the guide?

191
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,720
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

192
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,040
Yeah, actually, she's right.

193
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,670
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

194
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,520
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

195
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,220
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it.  I was surprised

196
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,170
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,

197
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,750
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

198
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,930
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

199
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,930
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,550
Paul is an expert on French wine.

201
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,250
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,710
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

203
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,970
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

204
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,310
I will always take a California wine, but,

205
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,980
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

206
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,110
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

207
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,640
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

208
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,210
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,570
Um...How 'bout

210
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,210
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

211
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,810
Now, which would you prefer here?

212
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,620
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just

213
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,790
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

214
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,370
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

215
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,030
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

216
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,340
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

217
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,300
These pheromones are driving me mad!

218
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,400
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.

219
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,170
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

220
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,170
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

221
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,830
Have you tasted the '61?

222
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,380
It is divine!

223
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,190
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

224
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,790
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

225
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,090
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

226
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,940
So, Carol-- Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

227
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,210
We heard of a great place. Interested?

228
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,750
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

229
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,880
but I need to get a little fresh air.

230
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Oh, come on! Come on!

231
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,940
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

232
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,910
over where the fire exits are, then...

233
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,910
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

234
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,130
I am very democratic,

235
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,170
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

236
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,250
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

237
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,900
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

238
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,890
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

239
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,220
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

240
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,010
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

241
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,050
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

242
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,420
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

243
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,140
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

244
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,230
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab.  I'm walking.

245
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,300
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

246
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,890
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

247
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,870
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

248
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,590
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

249
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,830
- That would be great!
- Would you?

250
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,180
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

251
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,720
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

252
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,330
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?

253
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,190
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.

254
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,410
I do that about you.

255
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,240
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

256
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,880
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

257
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,230
Really?

258
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,450
Oh, excuse me! <i>Parlez-vous...</i>
Do you speak English?

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,590
- I didn't hear you.  What?
- Come on!

264
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,670
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!

265
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,510
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.

I'm a little drunk! I can't...

268
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,400
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.

269
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,800
Come on, have a drink. Come on!

270
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,720
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.

271
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,250
<i>Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.</i>

272
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,660
- Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.
- <i>Allez! On y va!</i>(Let's go! We're off!)

273
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,320
OK, now, where are
you guys taking me?

274
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,300
<i>On va faire la fÃªte!</i>
(We're going to party!)

275
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,690
Yeah, this isn't quite fair,
'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.

- The night is young. Drink up!

279
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,750
- I'm drinking!
- Have a drink!

280
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,970
Yeah, drink up!

- Oh, yes?

Oh, Scott! Scott!

- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?

301
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,240
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?

302
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,510
Gil...the...
You have the same names as...

303
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,250
As what?

304
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,550
Scott Fitzgerald and...

305
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,950
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?

Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...
that's a coincidence...like....uh...

307
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:03,360
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.

308
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,710
I...I...keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

309
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,140
believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.

310
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,200
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

311
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,140
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize:  I'll never write a great lyric,

312
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,870
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.

313
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?

314
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,800
That's not possible...

315
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,660
So...um...

316
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:44,570
- What kind of books do you write?
- I...I...I'm working on a...um...

Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?

I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!

322
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,670
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!

323
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,670
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.

324
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,750
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.

325
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,380
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda
to come with, and...um...

326
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,610
uh...Gil? You coming?

Greetings and salutations.

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,460
You'll forgive me.
I've been mixing grain and grape.

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,550
Now, this a writer. uh...Gil. Yes?

339
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,700
- Gil...Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.

340
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,680
Hemingway.

341
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,230
Hemingway?

342
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,150
You liked my book?

343
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,030
Liked? I loved!
All your work.

344
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,940
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

345
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,400
and that's what war does to men.

346
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,660
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,

347
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,830
unless you die gracefully,

348
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,930
and then it's not only noble, but brave.

349
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,550
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?

350
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,380
There was some fine writing in it,
but it was unfulfilled.

351
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,690
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.

352
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,690
You liked my story, but he hates me!

353
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,590
Please, old sport,
you make matters extremely difficult.

354
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,580
I'm jumpy.  Suddenly I don't like
the atmosphere here any more.

355
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,300
Ah! Where're you going?

356

<i>Para reunirse con mis amigos en Saint-Germain.</i>
(To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.)

357
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,570
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...

358
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,610
If you're going to stay here and drink
with him, I'm going with the toreador.

359
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,970
Would you bring her back
at a reasonable time?

360
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,760
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting,

361
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,600
and she has talent.

362
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,350
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.

363
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,020
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.

364
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,030
She's wasting you because she's
really a competitor. Don't you agree?

365
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,630
Me?

366
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,040
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.

367
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,930
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.

368
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,780
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!

369
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,690
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?

370
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,580
She's jealous of his gift,
and it's a fine gift. It's rare.

371
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,750
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.

372
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,180
You like Mark Twain?

373
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,110
I'm going to find Zelda.

374
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,120
I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.

375
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,350
May I?

376
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,790
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.

377
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,560
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature

378
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,130
comes from Huckleberry Finn.

379
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:08,490
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.

380
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
What're you writing?

381
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,460
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

382
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,980
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

383
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

384
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,010
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

385
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,220
and... Does that sound terrible?

386
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,020
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

387
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,540
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.

388
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,160
No good.

389
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,310
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?

390
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,440
- What is it?
- Would you read it?

391
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,530
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like

392
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,220
400 pages long, and I'm just
looking for, you know, an opinion.

393
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,420
My opinion is I hate it.

394
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,680
I mean, you haven't even read it.

395
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,980
If it's bad, I'll hate it
because I hate bad writing,

396
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,310
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.

397
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,660
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?

398
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,820
I'm having a hard time,

399
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,770
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.

400
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,650
Writers are competitive.

401
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.

402
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,630
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.

403
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,360
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!

404
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,830
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?

405
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,500
No, I don't.

406
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,790
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.

407
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,940
Yes?

408
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,110
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.

409
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
She's the only one I trust with my writing.

410
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,830
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?

411
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,700
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.

412
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,400
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.

413
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,690
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...

414
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,910
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!

415
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,030
My heart is just racing right now!

416
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,010
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.

417
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,690
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!

418
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,170
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!

419
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,600
Papa!
You gotta...

420
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,480
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.

421
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,420
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,

422
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
but I had fun.

423
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,520
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.

424
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,050
If I was to tell you that I spent

425
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,690
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,

426
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,170
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?

427
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,170
Your literary idols?

428
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,420
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...

429
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,420
What does that mean?

430
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,710
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,

431
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,260
and Cole Porter.

432
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,260
I'd be thinking brain tumor.

433
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,560
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly

434
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,290
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.

435
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,350
You know, charming, but all over the map.

436
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,220
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.

437
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,600
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!

438
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,810
Come on! Get up! We should

439
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,750
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.

440
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,090
You know, I'm not gonna...

441
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,720
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,

442
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.

443
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,300
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!

444
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,010
Come look at these, Inez.

445
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,470
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?

446
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,740
- <i>Combien, monsieur</i>? (How much, sir?)
- <i>Dix-huit mille</i>. (â¬18,000)

447
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,560
- <i>Merci</i>. (Thanks.)
- What is that?

448
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,020
There a steal at $18,000.

449
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,520
$18,000 for this?

450
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.

451
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,480
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.

452
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,860
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.

453
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,930
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,

454
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,850
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.

455
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,130
Well, you get what you pay for.

456
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,610
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.

457
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,310
OK, you guys want to walk back?

458
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,910
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.

459
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,930
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!

460
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,290
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.

461
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,870
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.

462
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,310
Oh, right. Yes. Great.

463
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,480
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.

464
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,020
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.

465
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,890
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?

466
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,220
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.

467
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,220
Okay.

468
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,960
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

469
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
But, you made us rush through dinner,

470
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,440
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.

471
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,040
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!

472
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,700
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.

473
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,350
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,

474
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,350
your jaw is gonna drop.

475
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,770
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,

476
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,530
- it's...
- OK.

477
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,690
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?

478
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,960
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,

479
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,800
and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.

480
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,300
- This is very...
- I know. I know.

481
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,830
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.

482
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,350
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.

483
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,830
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!

484
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,960
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,

485
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,450
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,

486
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,270
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.

487
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,130
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.

488
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,450
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.

489
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,600
What am I doing wrong?

490
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,070
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.

491
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,430
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.

492
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,230
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...

493
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,840
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.

494
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,570
The clock struck midnight...

495
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,940
Hello!

496
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,680
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.

497
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Let me just jump in.

498
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,570
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.

499
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,030
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off

500
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,510
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.

501
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,510
And he was young, and brave.

502
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,680
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,

503
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,160
and there were many German soldiers on the road.

504
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,270
And the idea was to aim for the first group,

505
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,430
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.

506
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,380
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

507
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,100
Getting killed?

508
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,650
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.

509
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,360
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...

510
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,530
maybe my greatest fear, actually.

511
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,120
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.

512
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,130
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

513
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,580
Actually, my fiancÃ©e is pretty sexy.

514
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,550
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful

515
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,720
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.

516
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,000
No. That doesn't happen.

517
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,000
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.

518
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,570
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.

519
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,540
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face

520
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,920
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.

521
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,050
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,

522
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,920
until it returns, as it does, to all men.

523
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,140
And then you must make really good love again.

524
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,480
Think about it.

525
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,750
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!

526
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,980
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.

527
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,550
- <i>Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.</i>(No. I don't agree.)
- <i>Mais pourquoi</i>? (But why?)

528
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,880
<i>Parce-que</i>... (Because...)

529
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,370
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.

530
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,940
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.

531
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,420
I'm glad you're here.

532
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,440
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.

533
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,840
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

534
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,120
It has a universality, but no objectivity.

535
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,380
<i>Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.</i>
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)

536
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,110
<i>Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...</i>
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)

537
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,630
<i>Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.</i>
(Look at the motion, the painting.)

538
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,390
<i>C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprÃ©sente!</i>
(It's exactly what she represents!)

539
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,430
<i>Non. Tu n'as pas raison.</i>(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:

540
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,820
dripping with sexual innuendo,

541
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,880
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but

542
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,840
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.

543
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,550
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?

544
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,120
Exceptionally lovely.

545
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,450
<i>Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite</i>, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)

546
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,830
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...

547
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,120
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.

548
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,180
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.

549
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,900
A whore with volcanic appetites.

550
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,470
<i>Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!</i>
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)

551
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,620
Yes, <i>avec toi, au privÃ©</i>,
(Yes, with you, in private,)

552
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,570
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!

553
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,490
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.

554
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,490
- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- <i>Non.</i>

555
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,190
<i>Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.</i>
(No. No. I do not agree.)

556
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,330
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?

557
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,390
Is this it?

558
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,270
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.

559
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,090
Have you read it, Hemingway?

560
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,710
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.

561
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,530
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"

562
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,960
"and its products consisted of memories."

563
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,260
"What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,"

564
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,350
"had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years"

565
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,600
"to a status at once magical and also camp."

566
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,780
I love it.

567
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,370
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!

568
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,840
I'll start it tonight,

569
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,760
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.

570
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,350
<i>I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.</i>

571
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,410
<i>I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,</i>

572
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,180
<i>plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...</i>

573
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,190
<i>- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.</i>

574
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,180
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?

575
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:07,200
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.

576
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,590
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.

577
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,410
I always say that I was born too late.

578
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,150
<i>Mmm. Moi aussi.</i>
(Mmm. Me, too.)

579
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,530
For me, <i>la Belle Ãpoque Paris</i>
would have been perfect.

580
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,660
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.

581
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,270
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,

582
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,590
the...horse and carriages,

583
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,380
and Maxim's then.

584
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,960
You speak very good English.

585
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,540
- No, not really.
- No, you do!

586
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,000
How long have you been dating Picasso?

587
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,020
My God, did I just say that?

588
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,540
Pardon?

589
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:54,690
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?

590
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,110
I was born in Bordeaux.

591
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,240
I moved here to study fashion.

592
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,100
But you don't want to hear all this.

593
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes, I do.

594
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,700
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...

595
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,140
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,

596
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,840
and I fell in love with <i>Paris</i>,

597
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,910
and also,

598
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,600
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.

599
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:33,290
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,

600
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,080
and it was a beautiful six months.

601
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,210
M..M...Modigliani?

602
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,710
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?

603
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,750
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.

604
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,740
With Braque, though, there was another woman.

605
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,180
Many.

606
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,940
And now,

607
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,940
with Pablo.

608
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,700
I mean, he's married,
but...

609
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,340
every day, it's on-again, off-again.

610
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,590
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.

611
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,030
My God, you take "art groupie"
to a whole new level!

612
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,300
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...

613
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
But tell me about yourself.

614
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,360
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?

615
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,840
Because, you know,

616
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,840
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.

617
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,480
Isn't Hemingway attractive?

618
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,480
I love his writing.

619
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,180
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.

620
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Oh, you must stay here.

621
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,480
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for

622
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,980
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.

623
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,980
And,

624
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,960
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...

625
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,660
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.

626
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,390
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?

627
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,770
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.

628
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:24,200
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?

629
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,580
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?

630
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,910
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?

631
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,580
I wish that I could.
I cant, but

632
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,540
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.

633
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,750
That would be nice.

634
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,020
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius

635
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,650
who's great, but he's no MirÃ³.

636
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,750
I'm Gil Pender.

637
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,010
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.

638
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,330
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.

639
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!

640
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,310
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.

641
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,120
Little old Gil Pender has his novel

642
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,860
with Gertrude. Stein.

643
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,300
Boy, that girl was so...

644
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,000
lovely.

645
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,340
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,

646
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,270
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.

647
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,960
Who was in it?

648
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.

649
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,500
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.

650
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,190
I probably wrote it.

651
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,020
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and

652
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,850
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,

653
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,280
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?

654
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,220
Was it?

655
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,210
What time did you get in last night?

656
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,030
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...

657
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,520
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,

658
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,740
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little

659
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,940
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.

660
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,480
Yeah. We'll see.

661
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,140
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.

662
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,160

âª <i>You have the power to hypnotize me</i> âª

665
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,540
<i>Vous aimez</i>?
(You like?)

666
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,720
Yes. Very beautiful.

667
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,810
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.

668
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,960
You like Cole Porter?

669
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,060
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to

670
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,180
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.

671
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
I'm kidding.

672
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,720
Very pretty lyrics.

673
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,740
- Very amusing.
- Charming.

674
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,450
Gil?

675
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,910
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.

676
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,370
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?

677
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,810
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.

678
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,390
- OK. Yeah. Right.

679
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,900
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,

680
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,900
so you'll find it enlightening, I think.

681
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,190
Yeah. OK.

682
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,060
Let's get some culture.

683
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,760
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.

684
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,360
This man was the real father

685
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,310
of abstract expressionism.

686
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,570
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.

687
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,510
I mean, I love Turner,

688
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,510
but, I just find this...

689
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,760
overwhelming.

690
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,020
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.

691
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,230
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...

692
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,480
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...

693
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,140
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.

694
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,

695
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,590
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.

696
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,850
Ah. Now.

697
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,190
Here's a superb Picasso.

698
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,320
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his

699
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,030
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.

700
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,480
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.

701
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,770
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.

702
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,370
You might learn something.

703
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,480
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,

704
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,000
this was a failed attempt to capture

705
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,810
a young French girl named Adriana,

706
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,970
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,

707
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,060
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.

708
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,990
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,

709
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,650
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.

710
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,730
Of course, what you don't get

711
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,500
from this portrait
is the subtlety,

712
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,020
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.

713
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,980
What have you been smoking?

714
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,890
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,

715
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,100
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement

716
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,110
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.

717
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,760
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a

718
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,690
absolute volcano in the sack.

719
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,510
Too rich for me.

720
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,580
Where'd Gil run off to?

721
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,240
Work.

722
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,780
Been walking around Paris. You know,

723
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,890
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...

724
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,440
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.

725
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,250
Where's Carol?

726
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,370
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,

727
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,770
so I'll see you guys later.

728
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,770
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.

729
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,930
Bye, sweetie.

730
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,730
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?

731
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,700
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.

732
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,830
- You sound skeptical.
- No.

733
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,510
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...

734
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,990
got a... part missing,

735
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,990
and I didn't like his remark about

736
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,210
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent

737
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,130
people trying to take back the country.

738
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,130
They are not
crypto-fascist

739
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,130
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?

740
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,790
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed

741
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,070
- is very practical.
- No?

742
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,930
I'd like to know where he goes every night.

743
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,690
Well, we know one thing:

744
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,450
he doesn't go dancing.

745
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,420
Oh! Excuse me!

746
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,410
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!

747
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,060
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.

748
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,680
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.

749
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.

750
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Oh, Delfine?

751
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,280
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.

752
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,280
<i>Bon soir, Madame.</i>
(Good evening, Madame.)

753
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,860
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.

754
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,600
I was at Gertrude Stein's,

755
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,860
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.

756
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,200
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,

757
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,000
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,

758
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,830
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...

759
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,440
Oh, Pablo's home.

760
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,870
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!

761
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,750
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!

762
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,750
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?

763
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,290
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.

764
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:32,100
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?

765
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,570
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!

766
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,720
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.

767
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,030
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!

768
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,980
Look at that!

769
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,540
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.

770
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,810
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.

771
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,900
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.

772
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,920
It's so nice to see you tonight.

773
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,730
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!

774
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,080
<i>VoilÃ , ma petite Adriana!</i>
(There she is, my little Adriana!)

775
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,850
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?

776
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,160
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away

777
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,160
from that fugitive from
MÃ¡laga one way or another.

778
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,980
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?

779
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,590
<i>Vous Ãªtes tous deux parfaits.</i>
(You are both perfect.)

780
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,420
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and

781
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,600
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.

782
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,280
<i>Ella ha elegido Pablo.>
(She chose Pablo.)</i>

783
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,820
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks

784
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,510
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.

785
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,080
What about you?

786
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,740
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.

787
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,310
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?

788
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,150
Never.

789
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,480
Would you like to know
how that feels?

790
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,490
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?

791
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,890
- No.
- You?

792
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,130
Only for bargains.

793
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,690
<i>TomÃ©monos otra copita.</i>
(Let's take another drink.)

794
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,760
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place

795
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,870
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.

796
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:00,000
Who wants a fight?

797
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,410
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.

798
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,080
He's moody and possessive.

799
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,910
Artists are like children.

800
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,150
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,

801
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,290
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.

802
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,360
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?

803
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,790
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?

804
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,520
Well, I guess I am lost.

805
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Tell me more about your book.

806
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:29,780
My book is kind of a...

807
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:34,320
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.

808
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,550
I just want to walk around Paris with you.

809
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,590
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.

810
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,650
That's putting it mildly.

811
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,880
I can never decide whether

812
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,500
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.

813
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,680
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,

814
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,470
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.

815
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,670
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a

816
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,670
book, or a painting, or a

817
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,160
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?"

818
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,660
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...

819
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,530
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.

820
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,890
And when you think that in the cold,

821
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:16,220
violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...

822
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,290
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,

823
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,320
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,

824
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,490
the cafÃ©s, people drinking, and singing...

825
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:32,020
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

826
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,240
- <i>Vous Ãªtes un poÃ¨te.</i>(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.

827
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,630
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.

828
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,410
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.

829
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,510
See anything you like?

830
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,130
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.

831
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,440
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.

832
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,370
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend

833
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,860
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle

834
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,290
to come and teach us all her tricks.

835
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,410
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

836
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,430
Wow. That's...

837
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,890
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.

838
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,240
I love walking with you.

839
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,510
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

840
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,310
God, is that who I think it is?

841
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,040
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?

842
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,470
Oh my God!

843
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,830
Zelda, what are you doing?!

844
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,400
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!

845
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,440
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.

846
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,200
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,

847
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,710
and the more they drank,
the more he fell in love with her!

848
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,540
He...Scott loves only you.

849
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,860
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.

850
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,550
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.

851
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,280
- How?
- Trust me. I know.

852
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,720
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!

853
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,130
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!

854
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,130
Don't do that!

855
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,620
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?

856
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,620
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.

857
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,050
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.

858
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,900
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,

859
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,650
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.

860
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,110
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?

861
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,630
It's the...pill of the future.

862
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,180
You never said you were getting married.

863
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,500
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....

864
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,220
ways in the future.

865
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,480
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.

866
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,990
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...

867
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,530
has a very sharp sense of humor, and

868
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,860
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...

869
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,110
But the important things.

870
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,240
Yeah, or...actually,

871
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,200
maybe the small things. The...

872
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,750
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.

873
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,220
She wants to live in Malibu, and

874
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,110
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....

875
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,380
But I will say that we both like

876
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,940
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...

877
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,090
you know...the pita bread.

878
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,360
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.

879
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,380
I should go.

880
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,380
Pablo will be missing me.

881
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,690
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.

882
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,000
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.

883
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,410
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,

884
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:42,420
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.

885
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,800
<i>Monsieur? C'est un dommage.</i>
(Sir? It's a shame.)

886
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
<i>C'est un dommage.</i>
(It's a shame.)

887
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,530
We met, earlier tonight...

888
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,870
At the party!

889
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,870
<i>DalÃ­, sÃ­?</i>
(DalÃ­, yes?)

890
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,270
- Yes...
- DalÃ­!

891
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,350
- I remember!
- DalÃ­. Ya.

892
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,020
<i>Un bouteille de vin rouge!</i>
(A bottle of red wine!)

893
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,310
It can't be...
Yeah....

894
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,440
So?

895
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,830
<i>Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plaÃ®t.</i>
(Another glass for this man, please.)

896
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,650
I love the language!

897
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,980
The French!
The waiters? No.

898
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,400
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?

899
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,300
The rhinoceros? Uh...

900
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,260
Haven't really thought about it.

901
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,820
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.

902
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,990
<i>SÃ­.</i> Your sad eyes.

903
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,570
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,

904
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,900
with one tear.

905
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,530
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.

906
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,140
The Christ's face!

907
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:57,330
Yes, in the rhinoceros.

908
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,500
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...

909
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,830
a very perplexing situation.

910
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,930
<>Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)

911
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,520
My friends.

912
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,490
This... SeÃ±or BuÃ±uel.

913
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,500
- BuÃ±uel?
- SÃ­. BuÃ±uel...and...Mr. Man Ray.

914
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,490
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?

915
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,260
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.

916
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,460
Pender!

917
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,710
- Yes. And I am DalÃ­!
- DalÃ­. Yes.

918
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,710
You have to remember.

919
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,020
Pender is in a perplexing situation.

920
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,100
It sounds so crazy to say.

921
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,700
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but

922
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,820
I have to tell someone. I'm...

923
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,830
from a...

924
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,210
a different time. Another era.

925
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,080
The future. OK? I come...

926
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,900
from the 2000th millenium to here.

927
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,890
I get in a car, and I slide through time.

928
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,700
Exactly correct.

929
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,810
You inhabit two worlds.

930
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,710
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?

931
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,340
Yeah, you're surrealists!

932
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,940
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,

933
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,440
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.

934
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,700
At least, I think I love her.

935
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,420
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!

936
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,910
The rhinoceros makes love

937
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,670
by mounting the female.

938
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,610
But...

939
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,910
is there a difference

940
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,550
in the beauty between two

941
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,030
rhinoceroses?

942
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,260
There is another woman?

943
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,700
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...

944
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,010
very drawn to her.

945
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,330
I find her extremely alluring.

946
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:47,040
The problem is that other men,

947
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,040
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,

948
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,530
and she finds them.
So, there's that...

949
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:58,510
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.

950
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,390
I see a photograph.

951
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,600
I see a film.

952
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,740
I see an insurmountable problem.

953
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,600
I see...

954
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,570
...a rhinoceros.

955
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,320
Did you get any work done last night?

956
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,250
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my

957
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,800
book is too realistic.

958
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,170
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of

959
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:24,450
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.

960
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,060
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!

961
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,490
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!

962
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:33,440
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but

963
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,950
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.

964
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,120
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.

965
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,670
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.

966
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,960
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.

967
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,080
I'm not missing it because of you.

968
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:09,010
Hello! <i>Bonjour!</i>

969
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,740
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.

970
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,750
OK, now, I understand
he loved his wife

971
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,970
and he also loved his mistress.

972
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,670
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,

973
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,670
to love two women at once?

974
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,170
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.

975
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,140
You know...

976
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,520
That's very...
That's very French.

977
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,340
You guys are way...
you know...much...

978
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,280
more evolved in that department
than we are.

979
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,540
Do you remember me?
I was in the...

980
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,810
- was in the group that...
- Yes!

981
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,260
The group with the pedantic gentleman.

982
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:46,350
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.

983
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,050
Here is ... his photo.

984
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,140
I want to know where
he goes each night.

985
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,000
What is your suspicion? Hm?

986
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,550
He's engaged to my daughter.

987
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,590
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.

988
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,970
Naturally, discretion is paramount.

989
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,430
Well, you've come to the
right place, <i>Monsieur</i>.

990
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,540
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,

991
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,630
and report about his whereabouts at night.

992
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

993
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,670
Hey! Thank you for stopping.

994
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,790
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.

995
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:51,150
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?

996
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,490
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?

997
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,970
- Pender.
- <i>Prufrock</i>'s like my mantra!

998
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,970
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

999
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:08,590
Listen. Where I come from,

1000
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:13,280
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.

1001
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,990
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.

1002
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:18,070
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.

1003
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,390
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.

1004
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,990
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.

1005
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,050
No, it's no secret.

1006
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,500
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.

1007
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,270
<i>SabÃ­a que tenÃ­a obsesiÃ³n con este fanfarrÃ³n!</i>
(I knew that I had an obsession with that bully!)

1008
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,830
<i>Ya hemos hablado de todo esto!</i>
(We talked about all this!)

1009
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:36,450
<i>Estoy segura de que ella regresarÃ¡ muy devoto.</i>
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)

1010
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,910
<i>Muy devoto.</i> Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.

1011
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:44,860
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.

1012
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,240
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.

1013
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,670
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,

1014
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,680
it's very unusual, indeed.

1015
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,330
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.

1016
01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:00,070
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.

1017
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,410
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,

1018
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:07,150
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.

1019
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,760
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.

1020
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,730
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.

1021
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:22,610
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.

1022
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,370
Why not?
I don't understand it!

1023
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,390
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.

1024
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,300
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?

1025
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,160
He says, "Picasso never left his studio."

1026
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,080
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso."

1027
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,800
He just looks at me.

1028
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,040
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,990
- Hi.
- Hey.

1036
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,990

- Yeah?

1037
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,510
- He was your friend.
- Cole Porter? Yeah.

1038
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:18,180
And don't forget about Linda.
She was a friend, too.

1039
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,460
- You realize I was kidding?
- Yeah. I did realize.

1040

You're a bit young.

1041
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,870
Yeah. You seem a bit young
to be so familiar with his work.

1042
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,010
It's because he wrote
many songs about Paris.

1043
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:35,530
Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was
in love with your hometown, or something.

1044
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,440
- Are you a Parisian?
- Yes, monsieur.

"Yes, monsieur." Feel free to call me Gil.

1046

Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?

1078
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,040
Daddy had chest pains.

1079
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,240
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.

1080
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,990
- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.

1081
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,400
Yeah. Right.

1082
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,400
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.

1083
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,270
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.

1084
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:10,420
Don't call the doctor!

1085
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,180
Gil, why are you so dressed up?

1086
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:15,090
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.

1087
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:16,880
I was just doing a little writing.

1088

Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?

1089
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,040
No, no. I jumped in the shower,

1090
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,970
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,

1091
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,660
and I get the positive ions going in there?

1092
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,370
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel

1093
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,780
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.

1094
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,970
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just

1095
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,470
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.

1096
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:40,330
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks

1097
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,780
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.

1098
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,340
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.

1099
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,140
- What is that?
- Where?

1100
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,450
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.

1101
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:53,910
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.

1102
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:56,740
I mean, it's not...It...It is!

1103

- <i>Pour moi</i>? (For me?)
- Yes.

1104
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,960
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.

1105
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,360
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,

1106
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,950
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner

1107
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,950
that we're gonna have,
then I'm going to give it to you.

1108
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:13,490
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...

1109
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:17,020
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?

1110
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,970
Because it's understated, but elegant.

1111
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,970
That's what you always say.

1112
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,210
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.

1113
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,800
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.

1114
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,660
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.

1115
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:33,490
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...

1116
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,030
- they are...
- A little simple.

1117
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:38,560
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.

1118
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,090
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.

1119
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:43,940
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.

1120
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,330
Where are my pearl earrings?

1121
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,150
Did...Did you bring them?

1122
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:53,640
I don't even remember you packing them.

1123
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,390
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!

1124
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,890
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!

1125
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,480
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.

1126
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,660
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!

1127
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,130
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.

1128
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,130
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.

1129
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,530
Well, I would report the theft right away.

1130
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,950
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...

1131
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?

1132
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,520
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.

1133
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,880
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?

1134
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,280
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!

1135
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,140
You don't do this to people!

1136
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,780
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.

1137
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:31,440
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.

1138
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,010
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!

1139
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,710
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!

1140
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,380
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.

1141
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,980
<i>Bon soir.</i> (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor GÃ©rard.

1142
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,310
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.

1143
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,830
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.

1144
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:56,230
Look! Are these them?

1145
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,230
I don't know.

1146
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,660
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.

1147
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,660
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.

1148
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,990
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?

1149
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:09,050
I don't know.
They were just...

1150
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,460
But maybe you dropped them, and

1151
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:16,650
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.

1152
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,410
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.

1153
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,410
That was really thoughtful of her.

1154
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,320
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.

1155
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,320
The important thing is
they're not stolen.

1156
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:55,220
<i>C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prÃ©sent.</i>
(It's one of your best, until now.)

1157
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,880
<i>J'ai parlÃ© Ã  Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter</i>
(I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)

1158
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,160
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse

1159
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,520
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.

1160
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,920
I think 500 Francs is fair.

1161
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,360
500 Francs for a Matisse?

1162
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,150
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.

1163
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,790
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.

1164
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,620
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.

1165
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:17,540
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,

1166
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,940
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

1167
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,800
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.

1168
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,760
and have you heard from Hemingway?

1169
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,160
Oh, they've been back for days, now.

1170
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,400
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.

1171
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
It's over. With Picasso, too.

1172
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,990
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.

1173
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,880
By herself?

1174
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,870
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.

1175
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,710
They're doing it up there.

1176
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,060
She'll be glad to see you.

1177
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,080
<i>Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...</i>
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)

1178
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,960
Oh. What are you doing here?

1179
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
I came to find you.

1180
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,070
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but

1181
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:30,890
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at

1182
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:34,730
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.

1183
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:39,390
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,

1184
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,270
that you have for me.

1185
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,440
Aren't you gonna get married?

1186
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,320
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.

1187
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,150
I don't know what is gonna happen.

1188
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,610
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?

1189
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,280
- Sure.
- Come on.

1190
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,690
Oh, Mr. BuÃ±uel!

1191
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,180
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.

1192
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,620
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a

1193
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:09,200
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.

1194
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,360
Why not?

1195
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,820
They just can't seem to exit the door.

1196
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,460
- B...But why?
- Well, <i>momento</i>,

1197
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,640
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization

1198
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,380
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is

1199
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,470
who they really are:  animals.

1200
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,260
But I don't get it.

1201
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,260
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?

1202
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,770
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?

1203
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:37,440
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.

1204
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,450
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?

1205
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:21,840
What are you doing?

1206
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,630
I don't know!

1207
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,400
I did feel,
for a minute there,

1208
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,530
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.

1209
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:42,090
But you look so sad.

1210
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:45,440
Because life is too mysterious.

1211
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,960
This is the time we live in.

1212
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,920
Everything moves so fast.

1213
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:54,890
Life is noisy and complicated.

1214
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:58,590
I've always been a logical person.
I've never

1215
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,240
I never acted too crazy.

1216
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,740
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,

1217
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:07,800
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.

1218
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,720
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.

1219
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,900
Don't laugh. I just want to...

1220
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:18,020
I feel like I just want to let it go.

1221
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,470
- Here.
- Oh!

1222
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:29,690
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!

1223
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:32,120
Go on. Here, put in on.

1224
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,120
They're so beautiful!

1225
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,740
Look!

1226
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:50,320
<i>Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!</i>
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)

1227
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,430
- <i>Qui est vous?</i> (Who are you?)
- <i>Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard.</i> (Come up. We're too late)

1228
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,700
- <i>Allez!</i>
- Come on! Come on!

1229
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,940
Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>,
this is so beautiful!

1230
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:21,720
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

1231
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,720
Here it is: <i>La Belle Ãpoque</i>!

1232
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,350
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!

1233
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:31,640
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.

1234
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,570
<i>Bon soir!</i>
(Good evening!)

1235
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,810
<i>Bon soir! Bienvenue.</i>
(Good evening! Welcome.)

1236
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,810
Thank you.

1237
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,840
<i>Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!</i>
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)

1238
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,640
<i>Tellement avant-garde!</i>
(So ahead of the time!)

1239
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,790
<i>S'il vous plaÃ®t, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fÃªte!</i>
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)

1240
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,270
<i>Champagne.</i>

1241
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:28,920
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,

1242
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,920
and the <i>Belle Ãpoque,</i>

1243
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:32,920
and here we are!

1244
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,980
I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...

1245
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,980
I don't know, like I can't...

1246
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,590
believe my luck.

1247
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:44,410
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.

1248
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,410
You lead the way.

1249
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,210
Look!

1250
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,960
Oh, my God!

1251
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,790
Pablo admires him so much!

1252
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,870
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

1253
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,670
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.

1254
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,060
But, we know he's a lonely man.

1255
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,180
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.

1256
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,900
Monsieur Lautrec?

1257
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,180
- <i>Oui?</i> (Yes?)
- <i>Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.</i>(Good evening. We are great fans.)

1258
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:53,600
- <i>Merci, Madame.</i> (Thank you, Madame.)
- <i>Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre?</i> (May we offer you a drink?)

1259
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,310
<i>Je serais enchantÃ©e. Prenez un siÃ¨ge.</i>
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)

1260
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,310
He's asking us to sit down with him.

1261
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,820
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.

1262
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,020
<i>Vous Ãªtes Americain?</i>
(You are American?)

1263
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,520
Yes, I'm an American.

1264
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,850
<i>Je vous devine Ã  l'accent.</i>(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.

1265
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:12,300
<i>Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.</i>
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)

1266
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,760
- I love your drawings, also.
- <i>Bon soir!</i>
- Merci.

1267
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:21,210
<i>Savez que moi je prÃ©senter Monsieur Gaugin</i>and <i>Monsieur Degas</i>.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)

1268
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:24,070
- Bon soir.
- EnchantÃ©e.
- Bon soir. EnchantÃ©e.

1269
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,790
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1270
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:31,810
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.

1271
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,810
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.

1272
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,180
Unbelievable. <i>Parlez-vous anglais</i>?

1273
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:38,180
- <i>Non, monsieur.</i> (No, sir.)
- <i>Il parle un petit peu.</i>(He speaks a little.)

1274
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,320
<i>Non, non</i>. I speak well. <i>Parle trÃ¨s bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir? </i>
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)

1275
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,890
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...

1276
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:51,320
um...this...<i>cette...gÃ©nÃ©ration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.</i>
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)

1277
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,680
He said...He says that

1278
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,070
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.

1279
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:02,310
Better to have lived during the...
<i>la Renaissance</i>.

1280
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:05,440
No! This is the golden age.

1281
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,000
- Non.
- <i>C'est l'Ã¢ge d'or!</i>(It's the golden age!)

1282
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,930
<i>Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.</i>
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)

1283
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,090
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?</i>
(What is it you do?)

1284
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,610
<i>J'Ã©tudie la haute-couture.</i>
(I study high fashion.)

1285
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,850
<i>C'est pour Ã§a vous Ãªtes ****</i>(That's why you're dressed like that.)

1286
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,360
<i>Je comprends maintenant!</i>
(I understand now!)

1287
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
<i>Les vÃªtements tres jeune.</i>
(The youthful clothes.)

1288
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,640
<i>Voulez vous de lui prÃ©senter Ã  Richard?</i>
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)

1289
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,120
- <i>Ah, oui!</i> (Oh, yes!)
- <i>Ah, oui.</i> He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.

1290
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,620
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.

1291
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,170
So, <i>vous intÃ©resse</i>?
(So, you're interested?)

1292
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,170
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.

1293
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:39,980
Oh my God! I...

1294
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,080
I don't live here.

1295
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,890
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...

1296
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:46,030
It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...

1297
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:49,000
We're temporarily
passing through.

1298
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:52,770
Can I speak with you a minute?

1299
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,770
<i>PermitÃ©e</i>?
(May I?)

1300
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,610
<i>EnchantÃ©.</i>.

1301
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,980
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.

1302
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,140
Let's never go back to the '20s!

1303
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,140
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.

1304
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,710
It's the start of La Belle Ãpoque!

1305
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,500
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.

1306
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:19,460
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,

1307
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,460
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?

1308
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,800
I mean, I love those guys.

1309
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,840
But it's the present.
It's dull.

1310
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,170
Dull?

1311
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,550
It's not my present.

1312
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,890
I'm from 2010.

1313
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,430
What do you mean?

1314
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:43,850
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.

1315
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
You did?

1316
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,700
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,

1317
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,860
to a golden age.

1318
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:56,850
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!

1319
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,300
Well, yeah. To me they are.

1320
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,650
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle Ãpoque.

1321
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:09,070
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.

1322
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:13,530
You know, they're trade <i>Belle Ãpoque</i>
to be painting alongside

1323
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,310
Titian and Michelango.

1324
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,340
And those guys probably imagined

1325
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,380
life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.

1326
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,210
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but

1327
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:27,550
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.

1328
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:30,160
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where

1329
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,850
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.

1330
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:36,060
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.

1331
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,060
You see what I'm saying?

1332
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,630
These people don't have any antibiotics.

1333
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,890
What are you talking about?

1334
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:47,180
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,

1335
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:52,300
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,

1336
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,690
you know, was really the golden time.

1337
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,940
That's what the present is.

1338
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:01,660
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.

1339
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,780
That's the problem with writers.

1340
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,350
You are so full of words.

1341
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,050
But I am more emotional,

1342
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:11,720
and I'm going stay,

1343
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,750
and live in Paris' most glorious time.

1344
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,800
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.

1345
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,250
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,

1346
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,590
but at least it was a choice.

1347
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:27,230
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,

1348
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:29,850
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.

1349
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,820
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,

1350
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,950
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be

1351
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:40,470
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.

1352
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,410
So...

1353
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,380
Goodbye, Gil?

1354
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,300
Goodbye.

1355
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,390
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.

1356
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,110
You understood me clearly.

1357
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,200
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,

1358
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,760
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!

1359
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,150
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it

1360
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,740
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.

1361
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:18,520
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you

1362
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,640
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?

1363
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,640
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.

1364
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,730
but he did have one plot suggestion.

1365
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,960
What's the suggestion?

1366
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,910
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist

1367
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:32,400
doesn't see that his fiancÃ©e is
having an affair right before his eyes.

1368
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:35,930
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.

1369
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,280
That's called denial.

1370
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,280
Thank you.

1371
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,520
You're crazy!

1372
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,520
Paul and I?

1373
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,260
Where did you get such an insane notion?

1374
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,260
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.

1375
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:58,100
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.

1376
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,180
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.

1377
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,630
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,

1378
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,580
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador DalÃ­!

1379
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,060
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!

1380
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,990
No, no. The past is not dead.

1381
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,710
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?

1382
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,860
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.

1383
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,380
I ran into him at a dinner party.

1384
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,160
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.

1385
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,480
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.

1386
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,480
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.

1387
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,060
It's cognitive dissonance.

1388
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,300
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.

1389
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,160
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.

1390
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,010
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.

1391
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:33,500
OK. Yes! I did.

1392
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,090
I was with Paul for a few nights,

1393
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:39,360
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,

1394
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,910
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...

1395
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,910
get over it, Gil.

1396
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:49,150
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.

1397
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:53,020
I'm not...I'm not going back.

1398
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:57,190
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,

1399
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:59,800
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.

1400
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,140
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...

1401
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,630
I don't think we're right for each other.

1402
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,860
What?

1403
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:09,870
What are you saying?

1404
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,590
What are you even talking about?

1405
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,150
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!

1406
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,770
We're breaking up.

1407
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,980
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.

1408
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,980
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?

1409
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,700
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but

1410
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,220
just because we're...

1411
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,010
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

1412
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,640
W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?

1413
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,490
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?

1414
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,490
I mean, Mom's right about you.

1415
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,380
You have this part missing.

1416
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,760
Yeah, I said that first.

1417
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,060
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living

1418
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:46,420
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...

1419
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,100
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be

1420
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,880
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.

1421
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,540
- I really do.
- But we would!

1422
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,670
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!

1423
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:02,990
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.

1424
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,990
Goodbye, Inez.

1425
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,980
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.

1426
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,820
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...

1427
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:16,750
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.

1428
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,910
- You did?
- You bet I did.

1429
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,930
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,

1430
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,930
and he followed him very closely.

1431
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,240
- And what happened?
- I don't know.

1432
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,340
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.

1433
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,660
<i>Ã qui dois-je l'honneur?</i>
(To whom do I owe the honor?)

1434
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,130
<i>Je...Je suis perdu.</i>
(I...I'm lost.)

1435
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:37,130
<i>J'ai detournÃ©e la mauvaise endroit.</i>
(I made a wrong turn.)

1436
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:40,310
<i>Gardes! Gardes!</i>
(Guards! Guards!)

1437
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:42,310
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!</i>
(Off with his head!)

1438
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,310
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!</i>
(Off with his head!)

1439
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,250
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!

1440
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:57,870
Wow! What...

1441
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,000
Good to see you.

1442
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,080
What are you doing here?

1443
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,250
I'm returning from dinner with friends.

1444
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,250
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

1445
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,310
And you? What are you doing here?

1446
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:12,700
I was just out for a walk.

1447
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,980
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.

1448
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:19,590
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.

1449
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,490
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.

1450
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,830
You know, I thought about
you the other day.

1451
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:26,620
- Really?
- Yeah, because

1452
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:30,370
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.

1453
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,670
That made you think about me?

1454
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:35,640
I like to be thought of that way.

1455
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,880
You're on your way home right now?

1456
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:41,880
Yes.

1457
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,100
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?

1458
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:49,110
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.

1459
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:54,010
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

1460
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:57,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

1461
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,710
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

1462
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,050
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.

1463
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,600
I couldn't agree more with you.

1464
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,910
Yes, it is more beautiful.

1465
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:12,710
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.

1466
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:15,060
- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.
