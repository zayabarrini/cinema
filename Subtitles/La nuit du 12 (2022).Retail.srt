1
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,333
<i>Each year, the French police open
more than 800 murder investigations.</i>

2
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,833
<i>Nearly 20% remain unsolved.</i>

3
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,667
<i>This film relates one of them.</i>

4
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,667
THE NIGHT OF THE 12TH

5
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:39,792
Grenoble, Police Headquarters

6
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,917
October 12th, 2016

7
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,875
9:36 pm

8
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,833
Speech, speech, speech!

9
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,083
Yes!

10
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,000
I love you, guys.

11
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,583
But I won't miss your mugs.

12
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,167
Especially those in my unit.

13
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,125
Yohan, Jérôme, Loïc,
Willy, Marceau,

14
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,167
Fred.

15
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,583
I'll miss filling out forms

16
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,667
and the screw-ups with the software.

17
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,083
Like when you lose
a 15-page report by magic.

18
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,833
You said it!

19
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,083
I see some young jerks thinking

20
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,292
retirement's far off. It's true.

21
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
But when you lucky guys reach my age,

22
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,833
it'll be just a memory.

23
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,292
I also wanted to say...

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,375
No!

25
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,500
You fucking pains.

26
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,167
Go ahead, I can't do it.

27
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,667
It's your party.

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,333
Tell them you're proud to take over.

29
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,875
Ok, listen up, guys.

30
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:49,958
I'm proud, very proud,
to take over from him.

31
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,125
So are we!

32
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,208
You know it's true.

33
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,958
There.

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,625
C'mon, make an effort!

35
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,000
To Tourancheau!

36
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,875
For years now, I've wondered

37
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:10,333
how they gave a unit to a Breton
who only drinks pastis!

38
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,875
An eternal mystery.
Thanks, Marceau.

39
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,083
Cheers!

40
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,208
Thanks, Yo.

41
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,625
Thanks, Willy.
Thank you, Chief.

42
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,208
Tourancheau! La Tanche!

43
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,042
Look at him!

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,917
You little cunts.

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,458
For your bedroom.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,750
- Let's have a photo.
- Gather round.

47
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,625
Ready...

48
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,458
At ease and say cheese!

49
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,042
You won't stay?

50
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,667
- I'm going home.
- Tomorrow's your day off.

51
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,458
- Meeting Wesley?
- No, I'll sleep.

52
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Good night then.

53
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,042
Take care.

54
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,667
See you tomorrow?

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Love you.

56
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,250
Good night.

57
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,417
Nanie, babe.

58
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,375
Nanie, I adore you.
You're the best friend ever.

59
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,917
Loads of kisses for you.

60
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,375
Clara.

61
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,125
Who are you?

62
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,292
<i>Who's the black cat?</i>

63
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Boris.

64
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,542
- What am I?
- The black cat.

65
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,667
<i>- It's him.
- You said it.</i>

66
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:55,250
You turn up
and we get a case on a weekend.

67
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,417
<i>Hungover too!</i>

68
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,250
<i>- In the sticks.
- Doing the gendarmes' job.</i>

69
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,583
So you're bad luck.

70
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,250
Nothing to smile about.

71
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,667
<i>- You have the evil eye.
- You were on duty.</i>

72
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,667
<i>Is it normal on your first night?</i>

73
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,167
<i>You're jinxed.</i>

74
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,208
Fred was on duty too.

75
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,875
Fred never gets a case
when he's on duty, so it's you.

76
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,208
<i>Blaming a colleague sucks.</i>

77
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,542
<i>Show team spirit.</i>

78
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,833
Or it's Yohan.

79
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,833
New unit chief and wham!

80
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,917
<i>Yeah.</i>

81
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,083
The gendarmes are pissed off.

82
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,625
It's their turf.
We shouldn't be here.

83
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,667
Why didn't they get it?

84
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,292
We have enough work in the city.

85
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,042
The chief said the prosecutor
insisted we take it.

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,958
He must think we do a better job.

87
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,625
And there's some truth in that.

88
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,625
- Hello.
- Hello, police.

89
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,125
We're going house-to-house.
May we come in?

90
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,833
Heard from the medical examiner?

91
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,500
He took the wrong exit.
He won't be long.

92
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,208
<i>Clara?</i>

93
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,042
<i>Hello?</i>

94
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,958
<i>Hello, Clara?</i>

95
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,833
This is Captain Vivès of the police.

96
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,500
We just found this phone.

97
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,333
Can you tell me who you're calling?

98
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,792
Clara who?

99
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
<i>You're the police?</i>

100
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,292
Yes. Answer me, please.

101
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,042
Clara who?

102
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>Royer. Clara Royer.</i>

103
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,458
Y-E-R?

104
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,042
<i>Yes.</i>

105
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,708
Do you know her address?

106
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,583
<i>17, Chemin des Terres Blanches.
Her parents' place.</i>

107
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,292
<i>You found her phone?</i>

108
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,208
I can't say anything now.
May I have your name?

109
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,583
Nanie who?

110
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,542
<i>Béguin. Stéphanie Béguin.</i>

111
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,583
Can you do the talking?

112
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,417
If you want.

113
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,792
I prefer it.

114
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,375
I hate telling parents
their kid's dead.

115
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:14,333
I can take autopsies, the gross stuff,
but that...

116
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,583
Yes?

117
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,750
Mrs Royer?

118
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,750
Yes.

119
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,833
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

120
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,042
We're from the police.

121
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,875
Yes...

122
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,375
What's it about?

123
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,333
May we come in, please?

124
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,833
What's wrong?

125
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,917
Is there a problem?

126
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,875
Let's go inside. It's important.

127
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,542
Is your husband in?

128
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,958
No, he's at work.

129
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,833
- Shall I call him?
- We'll see to it.

130
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,167
When is he due back?

131
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,708
I don't know. 6, 6:30.

132
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,667
What's going on?

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,250
Sit down, it'll take a while.

134
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,875
Can you tell me now?

135
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,375
Last night,
a young woman was killed nearby.

136
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,542
We have reason to believe...

137
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,333
Yohan...

138
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,542
We have reason to believe
it was your daughter.

139
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,708
What?

140
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,167
A girl was found murdered

141
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,833
and we think it's Clara.

142
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,500
- Clara?
- Yes.

143
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,333
She's at Nanie's place.

144
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,542
No, she was at Nanie's,
but didn't stay over.

145
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,000
- She's at Nanie's, I tell you.
- Ma'am...

146
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,625
She didn't stay over.

147
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,833
She was attacked on her way home.

148
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,250
What are you saying?

149
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,417
Nanie, where's Clara?

150
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,583
She's not here?

151
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,042
- I don't get it.
- Sit down, ma'am.

152
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,542
- What's wrong?
- Sit down, please.

153
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,625
I don't want to sit down!

154
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
Ma'am, look at me.

155
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,667
We're the police.

156
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,042
We think the young woman killed
is Clara, your daughter.

157
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,208
What do you mean? It's not true!

158
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,875
You're lying to me!

159
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,375
You're lying! Get out!

160
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,958
Get out of my home!

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,250
Nanie!

162
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,708
I want to see her!
Where is she?

163
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,542
Where is she?

164
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,125
Where is she?

165
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,875
Clara!

166
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,375
It was just us girls.

167
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,833
We had fun, chatted...

168
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,333
Who else knew about the evening?

169
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:12,958
I don't know.

170
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,958
When Clara left,
was she meeting someone?

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,167
No.

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,125
No...

173
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,417
She wanted to go home.

174
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,167
Did Clara have problems?

175
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,667
Conflicts with others?

176
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,500
No.

177
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,167
She got on with everyone.

178
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,625
She was good-natured.

179
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,042
Any romantic break-ups?

180
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,208
Yes, quite a few.

181
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,292
She fell in love easily.

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,417
Anything recent?

183
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,125
No.

184
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,500
These last few months,
she was dating Wesley.

185
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,750
She met him at work.

186
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,750
At the bowling alley in La Toussuire.

187
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,125
La Toussuire?

188
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,875
The ski resort up above.

189
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,958
Wesley who?

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Fontana. Wesley Fontana.

191
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,667
She sent me a video.

192
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,000
When?

193
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,292
Last night, just after she left.

194
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,875
May I see it?

195
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,208
<i>Nanie, babe, I adore you.
You're the best friend ever.</i>

196
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,875
<i>Loads of kisses for you.</i>

197
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
I'll need this video.

198
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,125
Something odd happened to me.

199
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
I was informing her mother

200
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,625
when I saw a photo of Clara, little,
with a cat.

201
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,583
I seized up.

202
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,958
I couldn't utter a word.

203
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,708
Normal, you'd seen the body.

204
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,208
It's harder after that.

205
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,041
Maybe.

206
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,041
I felt like I was on the edge
of a big hole.

207
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,458
I could see her mother,
but my mind was blank.

208
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,583
You froze up.

209
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,750
It happens.

210
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,208
It was so weird.

211
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,541
I thought I was dead.

212
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,458
Aren't you overdoing it?

213
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,292
Yeah, you're right.

214
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,417
Did Clara live here?

215
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,083
Yes.

216
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,208
She didn't always sleep here.

217
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,208
We didn't track her every move.

218
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,792
But she lived here.

219
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:49,833
You knew her boyfriend?

220
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,375
- Wesley?
- Yes.

221
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,292
Not very well.

222
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,042
Clara was discreet about her feelings.

223
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,958
Wesley would fetch her,
but we only spoke once.

224
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,625
She seemed in love.

225
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,083
Were you close?

226
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,208
I guess.

227
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,250
We never discussed intimate stuff,
if that's what you mean.

228
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,292
That'd be with her mother.

229
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,333
How would you describe her?

230
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,375
I'm her father.

231
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,292
I see her with a father's eyes.
I'd say...

232
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,708
Intelligent.

233
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,458
Yes.

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,167
And joyful.

235
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,417
Setting a girl on fire...

236
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,000
The guy's a psycho.

237
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,708
Could he be some fanatic?

238
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,500
Girl or not, it takes planning.

239
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,542
You need a fuel can and a lighter...

240
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,625
It's not like stabbing or strangling.

241
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,250
You have to be mad to think,
"I'll burn her."

242
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:00,167
So strangling or stabbing is ok?

243
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,375
No, but you can follow a guy's thinking.

244
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,833
You imagine he blew a fuse.

245
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,292
But what was this guy thinking?

246
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,333
It feels like punishment to me.

247
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,333
Like an acid attack.

248
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,833
Remember that last one?

249
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,000
With acid,
they want to mark a girl for life.

250
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,833
Maybe he didn't mean to kill.

251
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,167
A dumb psycho?

252
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,042
Why not?
And we keep saying "he".

253
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,792
Maybe it's a she.

254
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,667
Women always get burned.

255
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,125
Joan of Arc, witches...

256
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:34,208
Guys get beheaded, crucified or shot,
but rarely burned.

257
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,042
Some burn themselves to protest
in Tibet.

258
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,333
You can't compare suicide for a cause
with a maniac burning a girl.

259
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,458
I agree.

260
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,667
Even if women don't burn,
men start the fire.

261
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,875
Some guys get burned with barbecues.

262
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,125
Beard on fire,
you jumped in the pool squealing,

263
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,250
"Shit, I'm burning! I'm burning!"

264
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,583
Do your reports, you jerks.

265
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,000
Sorry to ask this now,
but what about overtime?

266
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,208
You note it?

267
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,000
You're off to a bad start.

268
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,500
- How old are you?
- 27.

269
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,375
27 and counting hours?

270
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,958
It's a job, not volunteer work.

271
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,208
Overtime is normal,
if it's taken into account.

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,500
Normal in a normal world.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,417
You'll get paid when the world's normal.

274
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,292
"Mr and Mrs

275
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,708
Tudesque

276
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,583
declare they

277
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,000
saw and heard nothing.

278
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,167
At number 26, rue Jean Huguet,

279
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,292
Mr and Mrs Vovelle

280
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,500
declare

281
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,083
they saw and heard nothing."

282
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,375
Fred...

283
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,958
Can you do it silently?

284
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,625
Yes, sorry.

285
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,208
Yohan...

286
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,833
Is this a case
of enhanced jurisdiction?

287
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,917
No. Why?

288
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,917
It's the gendarmes' remit.

289
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,292
It's still our jurisdiction.

290
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,917
So it's not an 18.3?

291
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

292
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,542
I don't believe it!

293
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm sick of this thing!

294
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:32,458
What's up?

295
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,542
Another problem.
Now the ink's leaking!

296
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,750
The rolls are jammed again.

297
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:41,917
- You used the rubber band?
- It was my idea, so yes.

298
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,042
You need the wedge too.

299
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,000
The wedge, the rubber band,

300
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,417
I snap it shut, press the button

301
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,417
and it doesn't work!

302
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,208
I'm a cop, not a repair guy.
I just want to print my reports!

303
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,125
Is that too much to ask?

304
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,750
Give Nathalie my love.

305
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,292
Can we talk?

306
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,333
Sure.

307
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,875
It's going to shit, total shit.

308
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,625
We're heading for divorce.

309
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,667
She's pregnant.

310
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,833
Pregnant and you get divorced?

311
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,167
It's one big mess.

312
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,292
We've been trying for a baby.

313
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,958
She was keener.

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,167
I felt I was too old.

315
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,208
I wasn't against it,

316
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,667
then the idea grew on me.

317
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,042
We stop contraception.

318
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,542
Nothing happens.

319
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,083
I tell myself

320
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,708
it'll happen in the end.

321
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,542
But not Nathalie.

322
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
She got more stressed with the years.

323
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,292
She'd check dates, her temperature
and so on.

324
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,417
She does tests.

325
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,375
She makes me do some too
to see if it's me.

326
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,750
She was doing my head in.

327
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,250
And?

328
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,417
The fertility tests
are good for us both.

329
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,125
We aren't sterile.

330
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,042
The gyno tells us to be patient,
so we are.

331
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,583
Three months ago, she meets a guy.

332
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,708
She doesn't hide it.

333
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,000
She sees him regularly.

334
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,000
She sleeps at home less and less.

335
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,583
I come to terms with it.

336
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,000
I think it'll pass
if she gets a change.

337
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:12,750
Last weekend, she tells me
she's pregnant and wants a divorce.

338
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,833
Imagine it...

339
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,042
Pregnant after just three months.

340
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,875
That really knocked me out.

341
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,667
Things weren't great, but now...

342
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,500
The fact it worked right away
with him...

343
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,708
It's not fair.

344
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,333
See you tomorrow.

345
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,750
Do you know Clara Royer?

346
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,583
Yes, I know her.

347
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,125
Not well, but I know her.

348
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,583
You aren't together?

349
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:36,708
Together?

350
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,333
- Yes and no.
- Yes or no?

351
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,125
Her dad says you are.

352
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,750
No, not at all.

353
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:44,833
She's an acquaintance.

354
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,458
So when did you meet?

355
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,583
I can't say precisely.

356
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:52,250
Without being precise,
a week ago, a month, two years?

357
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,500
I'd say less than six months.

358
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,417
She filled in at the shoe hire.

359
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,875
I was at the bar and, to be nice,

360
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,875
I offered her a drink. That's all.

361
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,875
With nothing in mind.

362
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,667
And?

363
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,583
I let myself be tempted.

364
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,500
- We slept together.
- And then?

365
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,708
We kept on seeing each other.

366
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,958
To be honest, Clara isn't...

367
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,333
She isn't my type.

368
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,750
She's cute and all, but she's not...

369
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:34,625
This is weird, I talk about myself,
but what's going on?

370
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,792
- What did Clara say?
- Nothing.

371
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,625
She's dead.

372
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,333
What?

373
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,875
She was murdered.

374
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:55,875
You're sick.

375
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,958
You should've told me right away.

376
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,667
- I wouldn't have said that.
- What?

377
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,375
I was thinking...

378
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,542
What?

379
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,958
I thought she'd screwed up or...

380
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,750
- Or talked crap about me.
- Such as?

381
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,833
I dunno, I've no idea.

382
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,250
About her being in love and not me.

383
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,417
Why?

384
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,375
The thing is, Clara...

385
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,792
She was a nice girl.

386
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,750
But I forced myself to date her.

387
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,125
She kept chasing after me and...

388
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,292
as I was on a break with my girl...

389
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,250
Did you fight?

390
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,917
No.

391
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:43,042
- All couples fight.
- We weren't a couple.

392
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,000
She was in love.
Wasn't she jealous?

393
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,000
Never.

394
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,917
And is your official girlfriend jealous?

395
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,958
She doesn't know.

396
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,583
Can you not tell her?

397
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,625
He's got it good.

398
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,708
What a romantic.

399
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:20,125
We've seen Clara's girlfriends
and Fred is getting

400
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,417
her phone data.

401
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,583
Her timetable is clearer.

402
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,875
She was at home most of the day,

403
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,542
watching series and texting friends.

404
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,792
At 4 pm,

405
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,458
she went to a climbing gym.

406
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,917
We have the members.

407
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,875
One name appears in Clara's contacts:
Jules Leroy.

408
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,917
Lately, whenever Clara was at the gym,
Leroy was there too.

409
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,458
The 12th included.

410
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,792
Interesting.

411
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,750
This is him.

412
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,500
He lives at his grandmother's.

413
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,042
- What is he, 12?
- No, 21, like Clara.

414
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,042
Looks like Willy in a wig.

415
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,750
- Your dream.
- It'd suit you.

416
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,625
And the boyfriend? Wesley...

417
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,125
His girlfriend confirms his alibi.

418
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,792
We've requested tracking

419
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,042
on his phone.

420
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,333
Want him tapped?

421
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,125
Yes, him and his girlfriend.

422
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,542
And his boss too.

423
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,500
- Hello, ma'am, police.
- Hello.

424
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,625
We'd like to see Jules Leroy.

425
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,167
Yes. I think he's still asleep.

426
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,000
Fine, we'll wake him.

427
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,042
Can you show us his room?

428
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:44,542
Yes, come in.

429
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,792
Follow me.

430
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,125
Just down the stairs.

431
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,333
Thank you, ma'am.

432
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,083
The new champ's wild.

433
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,917
He blows my mind.

434
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,833
I didn't realize.

435
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,875
Can you cover me?

436
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,125
Go on, move.

437
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,417
Yeah, cool.

438
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,000
The bastard got me!

439
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,917
Fuck, I'm dead!

440
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,833
Jules Leroy?

441
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,542
Yeah.

442
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,083
I don't know what to say.

443
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,833
Did you see her that day?

444
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,083
Yeah, at the gym.

445
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:26,792
So let's start with that.
What gym?

446
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,792
The climbing gym.

447
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,500
I was kind of her coach.

448
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,208
When was she there?

449
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,750
I dunno. She didn't stay long.

450
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:37,792
An hour.

451
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,292
From 4 to 5 pm or so.

452
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,833
Ok, and then?

453
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,042
- Then she left.
- Where?

454
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,042
I dunno.

455
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,250
Were you sexually involved?

456
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,625
What's the link?

457
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,458
I ask, you answer.

458
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,333
If you won't answer, we have to note it.

459
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,708
Were you having sex?

460
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,292
It happened, yeah.

461
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:03,708
You knew she had a guy?

462
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,667
Yeah, and I have a girl.

463
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,792
It was no big deal.

464
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,167
It was simple with Clara.

465
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,583
We were sexfriends.

466
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,833
- Sexfriends?
- Yeah.

467
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,250
We had sex as friends.

468
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,750
- We weren't in love.
- She talked about her guy?

469
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,250
I wasn't interested.

470
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,667
Did he know about you?

471
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,042
Ask him, but I'd be surprised.

472
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,375
Why?

473
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:31,958
She wouldn't want her guy to know
she was cheating.

474
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,583
She told you that?

475
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:36,917
No. I dunno...

476
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,875
She never talked about him?

477
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,625
I wasn't interested.
I'm not jealous.

478
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,208
But you thought he was?

479
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,292
Yeah, probably.

480
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,333
All guys are jealous, so...

481
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:50,917
Not you, you say.

482
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,375
I've decided not to be.

483
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:56,167
But I think we're all jealous basically.

484
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,833
Yeah. So he was jealous?

485
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,125
Yes, probably.

486
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,042
What's so funny?

487
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:19,792
Sorry.

488
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,417
- I thought of something.
- What?

489
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,875
Something a buddy...

490
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,792
Something a buddy said.

491
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,375
Know how Clara died?

492
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:32,917
Yeah, she got torched.

493
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,375
- I think.
- You think?

494
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,500
She was burned alive.

495
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,625
Go on, say it.

496
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,917
She was burned alive.

497
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,458
How did Clara die?

498
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,000
- Burned alive.
- Yeah.

499
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,917
Stupid little shit.

500
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:51,458
You believe that sexfriend stuff?

501
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,667
Is it fishy?

502
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,000
Not for the case, but in real life.

503
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,125
I need to be in love to fuck.

504
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,000
You're the sentimental type.

505
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,250
He said she was an easy lay.

506
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,125
No, that things were simple.

507
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:09,042
- Same difference.
- Simple doesn't mean an easy lay.

508
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,167
Yeah?

509
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,042
And you piss me off has a double "s".

510
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:23,958
Well?

511
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,542
Did you like the morgue?

512
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,875
Great.

513
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,333
Did you throw up?

514
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,458
No.

515
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,042
No blows.
Cause of death: smoke asphyxiation.

516
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,625
Clear tox test.

517
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,500
Low alcohol
and no sex in the hours prior to death.

518
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,375
- I don't smell of...
- What?

519
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,167
Death, the morgue.

520
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,750
You do, a little.

521
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,625
Shower. Got clean clothes?

522
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:01,042
Keep some here.
Ask Fred, he has a whole range.

523
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,417
Do you know Jules Leroy?

524
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,042
Yes.

525
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,583
He was at our vocational school.

526
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,500
You knew Clara slept with him?

527
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,125
Yes.

528
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,375
Why not mention him?

529
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,167
I didn't think to.

530
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,875
You should have.

531
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,417
Or I'll think you're hiding something.

532
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,250
You're not protecting him?

533
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:31,708
No.

534
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,708
No, not at all.

535
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,333
It didn't seem important.

536
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,625
It is important.

537
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,167
I don't need to tell you why.

538
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:51,833
If Clara was double-dating,
I need to know.

539
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,458
Jealousy is a catalyst
in a huge number of crimes.

540
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,250
Sorry.

541
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,958
Give me every name you can.

542
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,583
Anyone linked to her.

543
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,292
No one knew her better.

544
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,958
Gabi Lacazette.

545
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,708
- With a "Z"?
- Yes.

546
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,208
Who is he?

547
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,750
He lives in the housing project.

548
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,083
He was at school with us.

549
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,708
Clara dated him.

550
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,125
Just before Wesley.

551
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,333
She left him for Wesley?

552
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,958
I think it was over
when she met Wesley.

553
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,417
But she said Gabi was jealous.

554
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,750
What else did she say?

555
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,458
I don't know...

556
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,083
She enjoyed being seen with him.

557
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,833
She liked bad boys.

558
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,417
Were there others?

559
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,917
Others?

560
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,583
You said she liked bad boys.
Who are the others?

561
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,417
Stop stringing out the information.

562
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:08,833
Yes?

563
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,083
Ok, I'll come and get him.

564
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,875
Jérôme!

565
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,542
- What?
- You talk shit.

566
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,750
Lacazette answered my summons.

567
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,167
Ok, Mr Top Gun?

568
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,250
I knew you'd want to see me.
I called the gendarmes.

569
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,542
Really? When?

570
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:41,208
When I heard, on the 14th.
They said it wasn't their case.

571
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,875
- Didn't they say to call us?
- No.

572
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,083
Why would we want to see you?

573
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,667
Because of the song.

574
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:52,833
- What song?
- The one I wrote about Clara.

575
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,417
What song exactly?

576
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,875
A rabid rap about her.

577
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,875
- Haven't you heard it?
- No.

578
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,292
I thought I was here about that.

579
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,750
What does it say?

580
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,042
Basically, it says I'll torch her.

581
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,583
Why did you sing that?

582
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,875
She wasn't straight with me.

583
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,458
Clara isn't the faithful type.
She wasn't.

584
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,750
It wasn't easy.
We couldn't go to her parents' place.

585
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,625
She wanted me
to treat her like a princess.

586
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,750
I work.
Half my pay is for my mum.

587
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,167
The rest's to launch my label.

588
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,750
I can't afford hotel rooms
for a quickie.

589
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,458
Can we hear the song?

590
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,042
Yeah, it's on YouTube.

591
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:46,792
I'd like you to sing it.

592
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,708
What? Here and now?

593
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,458
Yeah, here and now.

594
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:57,208
I can't do it.
I need a backing track, a beat...

595
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,792
A beat? You don't need a beat.
Can't you just do it?

596
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,083
Go on.

597
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:12,833
<i>Clara, get this clear
I'll be at your window, ya hear</i>

598
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:16,375
<i>With a Molotov cocktail
To ignite your ass</i>

599
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:17,542
<i>You suffer</i>

600
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,125
<i>It's cool, I got me a gun
If the fuel ain't enough</i>

601
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:24,500
<i>You'll burn in hell
Get ready for the flames</i>

602
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,625
<i>I'll torch you, scorch you</i>

603
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,583
<i>Burn you to ashes...</i>

604
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,500
Ok, that'll do.

605
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,208
- You asked!
- We get it!

606
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,625
I wouldn't have done it if I'd known.

607
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,583
- But you did.
- It's just words.

608
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,125
Just words? Words matter!

609
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,542
It wasn't me.

610
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,375
I couldn't do such a thing.

611
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,333
I'm not violent!

612
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,125
Not violent?
Hear what you sing?

613
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,250
You'd torch her!
You all want to burn girls!

614
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,167
What's the deal?

615
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:57,000
Where d'you get such crap ideas?

616
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,417
What if it inspired some maniac?

617
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,125
Thought of that?

618
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,917
You'd be an accomplice!

619
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,750
- Keeping me in custody?
- You bet your ass.

620
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,250
Can you tell my mum?

621
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,875
She'll worry if I'm not back.

622
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,125
Just stick to the facts.

623
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,000
How d'you mean?

624
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,958
He bugs you, but if you do all the talking
it's counterproductive.

625
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,833
- I was counterproductive today?
- A little.

626
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:47,625
I need a piss.

627
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,583
Marceau!

628
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,625
Willy said you've been sleeping here.

629
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,875
Things are a mess at home
with Nathalie.

630
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,667
Don't worry, I can manage.

631
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,625
Toilet, bathroom...

632
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,333
You can sleep here.

633
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:30,333
Just don't spray everywhere
when you piss.

634
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,708
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

635
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,875
I won't clean up your piss.

636
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,250
Hold on, I can aim properly.

637
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,333
When you see the crapper at work...

638
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,333
There are 24 of us.

639
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,833
Don't blame me for the others' mess.

640
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,542
So run no risks
and piss sitting down.

641
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,292
You're pretty far gone.

642
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,708
You didn't know?

643
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,917
Not to that extent.

644
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,292
<i>Hello, you've reached Emilie.</i>

645
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,750
<i>I can't talk right now
so leave a message. Bye.</i>

646
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,542
<i>Baby, it's me again.
Can't you pick up?</i>

647
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,042
<i>I didn't care about Clara.
She was nothing.</i>

648
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,708
<i>Some lost girl...</i>

649
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,792
<i>Marion, it's Jules. Ok?</i>

650
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,125
<i>Yeah, and you?</i>

651
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,625
<i>I was wondering...</i>

652
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:27,125
<i>- Wanna come to the gym?
- Sure.</i>

653
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:31,292
<i>Ok, cool.
It was really nice last time...</i>

654
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,083
<i>Call me. I can't live without you.</i>

655
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,917
<i>I'm scared I'll lose you.</i>

656
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,917
<i>You're the love of my life.</i>

657
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,625
This was in the mail.
It seemed a bit odd.

658
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,792
Thanks.

659
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:56,333
<i>To the officer
in charge of the Clara case</i>

660
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,292
Fred...

661
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,292
Come and see.

662
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,958
It was posted in St Jean.

663
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,000
If it's him, he's a psycho.

664
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,292
That shouldn't leave the office.

665
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,458
I know.

666
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:15,167
I keep thinking of Nathalie.

667
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,583
I think I love her like crazy.

668
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:25,250
When I lie down,
I hear my heart pounding.

669
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,042
It stresses me out.

670
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,000
See the shrink.

671
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,333
The shrink...

672
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:40,667
"In the lonely old park,
on the icy grass

673
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,667
Two outlines recently passed..."

674
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,208
Know it?

675
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,667
You kids learn nothing nowadays.

676
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,500
Paul Verlaine.
C<i>olloque sentimental.</i>

677
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,917
"Their eyes are dead, their mouths weak

678
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,542
And one can barely hear them speak

679
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,042
There, on the icy grass

680
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,958
Two ghosts talked of the past"

681
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,792
<i>Rest in peace
We miss you</i>

682
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:34,583
<i>Nanie, babe, I adore you.
You're the best friend ever.</i>

683
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,625
<i>Loads of kisses for you.</i>

684
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:45,542
<i>Nanie, babe, I adore you.
You're the best friend ever.</i>

685
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,542
<i>Loads of kisses for you.</i>

686
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,875
She filmed him.

687
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,292
What?

688
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:01,708
She filmed him.

689
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:03,750
Where?

690
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:05,292
Someone's on the bench.

691
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,250
Could be the tree's shadow.

692
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:10,625
No, look.

693
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,542
It's the bench.

694
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:14,792
He's waiting for her.

695
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:20,458
Even if it's him, it's no use,
they're just pixels.

696
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,708
C'mon, I'm freezing my nuts off.

697
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,708
Yohan?

698
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,583
Are you with the police?

699
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,333
Are you investigating Clara's death?

700
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,667
Why are you interested?

701
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,875
I've been watching you a while.

702
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,542
Who are you?

703
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:11,458
Denis.

704
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:13,500
Denis who?

705
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:14,542
Douet.

706
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,208
I sent you the lighter.

707
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,833
What lighter?

708
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,583
A transparent yellow lighter
I found.

709
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,458
Maybe the killer dumped it
on leaving the crime scene.

710
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,000
Didn't you get it?

711
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,375
Show us where you found it.

712
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,083
I found the lighter here.

713
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,917
Where do you live?

714
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,500
Here.

715
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,125
How do you mean?

716
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,167
Right there.

717
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:28,083
Why didn't we see you
during our house-to-house?

718
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,250
No idea. I was here.

719
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:33,250
Maybe your colleagues
thought it was empty.

720
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:35,958
- You live here?
- Yeah, it's my uncle's.

721
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,917
He does the vegetable garden.

722
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:39,875
I'm not into that.

723
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,667
I'm not big on veggies.

724
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,083
What do you do all day?

725
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,625
Not a lot lately.

726
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,708
I sleep badly
so I have a lie-in each morning.

727
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:54,750
I felt so bad about Clara
I smoked like a pig.

728
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,917
I shouldn't say that, you'll jail me.

729
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,875
You knew Clara?

730
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,250
Yes.

731
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,083
I'm one of her exes.

732
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:07,292
- An ex?
- Yes.

733
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,708
We slept together a few times.

734
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,125
But we'd split up.

735
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,125
Well, we saw each other less.

736
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:21,500
We were never officially together,
we met in secret.

737
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,208
She'd come here
when she fought with her parents.

738
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,208
I gave her cigarettes when she ran out.

739
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,333
When did you last see her?

740
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:34,625
I don't know.

741
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,750
I can't say.

742
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,583
On the night she was killed?

743
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:40,333
No.

744
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,083
She wasn't far from here.

745
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,500
I didn't see her.

746
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:45,750
You heard nothing?

747
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:47,792
No.

748
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,750
Hello.

749
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,542
I'd like to see Stéphanie Béguin.

750
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:05,042
I'll fetch her.
She's in the kitchen.

751
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,458
Can you tell me about Denis Douet?
Know him?

752
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Denis?

753
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,208
Yes, by sight.

754
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,500
I left him off the list?

755
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,083
Exactly.

756
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,000
Sorry.

757
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,750
Clara vaguely knew him.

758
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:47,042
He squats a shed in the allotments.

759
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,208
Did she sleep with him?

760
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,583
With him?

761
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,792
No way.

762
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,667
He's gross. He disgusted her.

763
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,083
Just talking about him, she...

764
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,125
Says who? Her or you?

765
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:00,917
What do you mean?

766
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,500
What did <i>she</i> tell you?

767
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:05,083
What I said. That he was gross.

768
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:07,792
Did he come on to her?

769
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,625
He was a leech.

770
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:13,667
She got mad once as he was too clingy.

771
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,667
She kept away after.

772
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:19,000
She didn't tell me much.
I didn't approve.

773
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:24,000
He doesn't work,
all he does is smoke and jerk off.

774
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,542
Sorry, but it's true.

775
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,458
Could she have slept with him?

776
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
No.

777
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,875
Maybe she didn't tell you.

778
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,208
What difference does it make?

779
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,292
It wasn't her.

780
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:56,958
You don't get it.
It wasn't her. She did nothing.

781
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,542
You ask what she did with him.
And with the others.

782
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:05,333
It makes her sound like a slut.

783
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,542
Did she sleep with them?
Does it matter?

784
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,208
She didn't commit a crime.

785
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,958
No one's saying that.

786
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:18,000
No one's saying it,

787
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,167
but you say she slept around.

788
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:23,083
And you ask me
if it might be her fault.

789
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,750
And I give you answers.

790
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:32,208
Want to know why she was killed?

791
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,333
I know, so I'll tell you.

792
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,708
Because she was a girl.

793
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,875
That's why.

794
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:41,333
She was a girl.

795
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,375
That wasn't Clara.

796
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,375
She wasn't like that.

797
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:03,000
Clara loved to be liked, that's true.

798
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,875
She always fell for the wrong guy.

799
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe she didn't refuse
that jerk's advances. I don't know.

800
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,000
But she was a sweet girl.

801
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:22,250
She wanted to laugh and have fun.

802
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,208
And all I can say about her
is sick stuff.

803
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,333
She was my best friend.

804
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,750
I miss her.

805
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,208
Where'd you buy the lighter?

806
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,167
I found it.
I showed you where.

807
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,417
When did you find it? How?

808
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:10,083
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

809
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:14,750
On the 15th, I went to buy food
and found it lying by my car.

810
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,958
- Like that, on your path?
- Yes.

811
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:18,875
Why send it to us?

812
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,458
- To help.
- To help find you?

813
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:25,000
- What?
- You wanted to get noticed?

814
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:26,500
I don't understand.

815
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,583
Know you disgusted her?
She erased all your messages.

816
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,250
You felt her scorn
and wanted to punish her!

817
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:36,375
- Take it easy.
- You don't speak, counsel.

818
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,250
Punish her for rejecting you.

819
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:41,417
You're crazy.

820
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,708
Yeah?
So what was it you thought?

821
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,417
Nothing, I could never do such a thing.

822
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:49,125
Get a lie detector
if you don't believe me.

823
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,500
You'll see.

824
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:56,625
So, "I went to buy food on October 15th.

825
00:56:56,667 --> 00:57:00,583
The lighter was by my car
and I sent it to help the police."

826
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,458
- Is that right?
- Yes.

827
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,083
- "I didn't kill Clara Royer."
- Exactly.

828
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,833
I didn't do a thing.

829
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,083
Are you angry or is it me?

830
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,333
Is what you?

831
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,875
Thinking you're angry when you're not.

832
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,083
Or maybe I get you angry.

833
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,292
Carry on and you might.

834
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,042
Ok, you're angry.

835
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,458
What are you saying?

836
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:38,125
Nothing.

837
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:42,625
I'm angry and stressed,
trying to calm down.

838
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,750
But if you piss me off, I can't.

839
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,542
We do a weird job.

840
00:57:59,083 --> 00:57:59,917
Don't we?

841
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:02,333
Save the riddles.
Say it or shut up.

842
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,417
I'm tired.

843
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,083
I'm just saying we do a weird job.

844
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:10,875
We question people, search their stuff,
listen to their calls

845
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:14,250
and we write reports.
One report after another.

846
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,792
Right.

847
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,000
We fight evil by writing reports.

848
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,292
We fight nothing.

849
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:24,292
Not one solid lead, no evidence.
Not even a decent printer!

850
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:27,833
It's good versus evil,
with a wonky printer.

851
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:59,708
It's a region too.

852
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,833
Where?

853
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,500
In Botswana.

854
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,292
It's a bit of wood too.

855
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:06,417
He's a geographer now!

856
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,083
Pass the harissa.

857
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,833
Careful, it's hot.

858
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,958
Why d'you look so happy?

859
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,833
Finally got laid?

860
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,208
C'mon, spit it out.

861
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:20,083
I'm getting married.

862
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,125
What?

863
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,542
I'm marrying Pauline.

864
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,750
- Who's Pauline?
- My girlfriend.

865
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:27,208
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

866
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,542
Babies can marry now?

867
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,750
A proper wedding by the mayor?

868
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,042
Yes, by the mayor.

869
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,542
I proposed and she said yes.
It'll be in March.

870
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,125
- Is she pregnant?
- No.

871
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,750
Not yet anyhow.

872
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:42,042
Why get married then?

873
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,375
For the fun of it.

874
01:00:43,417 --> 01:00:46,375
To make her my wife,
to be her husband, that's all.

875
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,750
And to throw a big party.

876
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,625
Just to party?

877
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:51,750
Yeah.

878
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:53,958
Known each other long?

879
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,625
- Six months.
- Six months?

880
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,000
We're in love.

881
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:01,000
Ok, if you're in love...

882
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,000
Snap out of it.

883
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:05,375
Rushing things is a bad idea.

884
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:06,708
Why d'you all say that?

885
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,708
- We're lucid.
- Leave him, he's happy.

886
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,833
No, someone has to tell him.

887
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:13,458
Ok, I'll explain.

888
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,000
Marrying and starting a family
is already a dumb idea.

889
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:20,625
But for a cop, at your age,
it's suicide.

890
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,417
- I don't agree.
- You'll see.

891
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,917
- I'll see.
- When you hit the wall.

892
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,917
Not all marriages fail like yours.

893
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:32,125
You're bitter, you believe in nothing.

894
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,167
It was love at first sight.

895
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:36,792
For Christ's sake!

896
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:39,583
You're freaking me out,
you're killing me.

897
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:42,333
She knows you do hookers?

898
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,625
I often go to the playground to...

899
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,292
to see who thinks of Clara.

900
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,042
Maybe it's stupid...

901
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,750
This morning, I found this.

902
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,333
This T-shirt.

903
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,792
I think it's a bloodstain.

904
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,250
I didn't touch it.

905
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,000
I went home for some gloves

906
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,167
and put it in that plastic bag.

907
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:17,083
I took some photos too.

908
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,833
To show you where it was.

909
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,208
Here.

910
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,083
I hope it's a lead.

911
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:41,167
The blood is that
of Vincent Caron, 31, on file.

912
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:44,042
Three years ago,
he beat up his kid's mother.

913
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:47,292
Triple jaw fracture,
five broken teeth.

914
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,875
With his fists,
in front of his 4-year-old.

915
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,750
She lost consciousness
after he tried to choke her.

916
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:58,042
Apart from her face,
she had bruises all over,

917
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,250
broken ribs...

918
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:04,458
After four months, he was released
and is still awaiting trial.

919
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:09,625
He now lives in Modane
with a schoolteacher, Nathalie Bardot.

920
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,750
- Hello.
- Hello, police.

921
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,333
- Vincent Caron?
- Yes.

922
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:25,250
Marceau!

923
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,458
Fetch them.

924
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,083
Is this yours?

925
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,042
This isn't my place.

926
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,750
Can you answer them?

927
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,417
I use it as stain remover.

928
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,250
Stain remover?

929
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:04,958
Yes.

930
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,500
All right...

931
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,292
Your lawyer had two hours
to get here.

932
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,083
- We'll start.
- He's in Lyon.

933
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:35,667
Not my problem.
You refused a court-appointed lawyer.

934
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:38,292
Screw lawyers, you don't scare me.

935
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:41,083
- Recognize this?
- Yeah, it's mine.

936
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:42,875
And the blood?

937
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,167
It's mine too.

938
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,625
- You knew Clara Royer?
- Yes.

939
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:48,833
How come?

940
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,333
Be less direct, we aren't friends.

941
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:53,875
All right...

942
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,500
How did you know her?

943
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,917
She friended me on Facebook

944
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,292
and we exchanged on there for a while.

945
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,625
And then?

946
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,875
Then we met for real.

947
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:15,167
She was shy at first,
but unstoppable once the ice broke.

948
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,375
Meaning?

949
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,167
Meaning she liked my animal side.

950
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,417
Can you specify?

951
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,583
We fucked hard.

952
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,667
- Where?
- It depended.

953
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,250
At my girl's place when she was out.

954
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:34,208
In my car.
Where inspiration took us.

955
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,042
She knew your legal issues?

956
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,125
Not as far as I know.

957
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:41,083
But she wasn't biased.

958
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:45,000
- Biased how?
- That people are black or white.

959
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:49,042
- Did Vincent tell you about Clara?
- Yes.

960
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,958
What did he say?

961
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,250
That they had sex.

962
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,250
When did he tell you?

963
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:57,708
In January, I think.

964
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,250
When they saw each other.

965
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,375
He wanted to make you jealous?

966
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:04,000
No, not at all.

967
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:07,333
I know he needs to see others.
That's how it is.

968
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,583
- You don't mind?
- No.

969
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,042
I knew she was hooked.

970
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,833
But I didn't push my luck.

971
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,208
Hooked on what?

972
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,417
Hooked on me.

973
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,583
I saw her as a kid.

974
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,125
I liked her.

975
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,375
That's why I put the T-shirt there.

976
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,625
- A gift.
- A gift?

977
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,083
Yeah, a gift.

978
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:31,083
I cut my arm, bloodied the T-shirt
and left it there.

979
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,125
Why wait so long to do it?

980
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:36,542
I wanted to avoid the circus.

981
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,208
Did he tell you Clara was dead?

982
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,875
No, I saw it in the paper.

983
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,542
When I realized it was her,
I told Vincent.

984
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,583
- You thought he'd killed her?
- No.

985
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,167
He was at my place that night.

986
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:55,292
From when to when?

987
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:56,708
All night.

988
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,292
After the evening together,
he stayed.

989
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,208
The date?

990
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,833
I forget now...

991
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,417
The night of the 12th.

992
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:06,833
- What day was it?
- I forget.

993
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,042
The date, not the day?

994
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,042
You're trying to influence me.

995
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:14,125
I didn't work the next day, the 13th.

996
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,082
He slept over, I know.

997
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,500
- Were you sleeping?
- Yes.

998
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,875
He could've slipped out.

999
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:21,917
No.

1000
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,917
I woke several times.
My cat was sick.

1001
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:26,582
Vincent didn't move.

1002
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:30,500
Where were you on October 12th?

1003
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:33,082
I was with Nathalie at her place.

1004
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,792
- When did you last see Clara?
- April.

1005
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:37,292
- Not since?
- No.

1006
01:08:37,332 --> 01:08:38,332
Why?

1007
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,957
Cos she'd met someone else.

1008
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:43,457
- Were you mad at her?
- No.

1009
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:46,792
I respect people's choices.
I force no one.

1010
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:52,250
You force no one?

1011
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,457
Respect broke your ex-wife's jaw?

1012
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,417
It was just a fight.

1013
01:08:58,457 --> 01:08:59,542
Of course.

1014
01:08:59,582 --> 01:09:02,832
She was hysterical and fell.
I had to calm her.

1015
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:05,082
- With your fists?
- No.

1016
01:09:05,832 --> 01:09:07,125
That's different.

1017
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,957
You know he's accused
of marital violence?

1018
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:12,832
That was an accident.

1019
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,000
You don't know him.

1020
01:09:18,582 --> 01:09:20,542
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

1021
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:22,332
- Is he violent with you?
- No.

1022
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,917
Why are you protecting him?

1023
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,667
You know nothing.

1024
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,042
He didn't do anything.

1025
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:40,417
Clara's friends
didn't know Vincent Caron.

1026
01:09:40,457 --> 01:09:43,042
She told no one, not even Nanie.

1027
01:09:43,082 --> 01:09:46,042
Maybe she was ashamed.
The guy is twisted.

1028
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:48,500
She picked some really odd guys.

1029
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:49,750
Meaning?

1030
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:50,792
Nothing.

1031
01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:52,000
Just saying.

1032
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,000
Saying what?

1033
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,500
She went for freaks.

1034
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,208
- She was no saint.
- Who mentioned sainthood?

1035
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,875
No one. I was just saying.
I don't believe in chance.

1036
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,292
You don't believe in chance?
Meaning?

1037
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,583
What's your idea?
That she asked for it?

1038
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,458
That's your way to the culprit?

1039
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,583
Can't I say what I think?

1040
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,250
- Not if it's shit!
- Guys...

1041
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,500
Calm down.

1042
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:17,583
I know chicks who love edgy stuff
and can't get enough.

1043
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,750
Edgy stuff? She was torched!

1044
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:21,583
Know women who like to burn?

1045
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:24,500
All I said
was some women like bad guys.

1046
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,125
But you're above that.

1047
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,250
- Above what?
- Malice.

1048
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,375
You're a nice guy, on the side of good.

1049
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:33,167
- Enough!
- I'm serious.

1050
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:35,042
He thinks he's irreproachable.

1051
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,375
I'm a shithead,

1052
01:10:36,417 --> 01:10:37,792
but you're perfect!

1053
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,917
Shut your mouth.

1054
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,625
Just shut up.

1055
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,958
Can I ask something?

1056
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,750
Why not cycle on roads like everyone?

1057
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,792
You keep on doing laps...

1058
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,583
It's weird, right?

1059
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,500
You're like a hamster.

1060
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:33,667
I'm quitting.

1061
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,542
Quitting what?

1062
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,542
Everything.

1063
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,875
I'm sick of these assholes.

1064
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,500
I only feel hate.

1065
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,042
This isn't what I wanted to do.

1066
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,417
I wanted to teach French.

1067
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,792
To pass on the power
of the French language.

1068
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:05,625
I'll get you a sleeping pill.

1069
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,417
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1070
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:10,875
After sleeping on it.

1071
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,292
<i>- We fucked hard.
- Burned alive.</i>

1072
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,000
<i>She's cute and all...</i>

1073
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,500
<i>I'm not violent!</i>

1074
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,833
<i>At my girl's place when she was out.</i>

1075
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:54,625
<i>We slept together...</i>

1076
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,625
<i>I forced myself to date her.</i>

1077
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,792
<i>It was simple with Clara.</i>

1078
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:00,875
<i>We were sexfriends.</i>

1079
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:05,292
<i>- The thing is...
- ...my animal side...</i>

1080
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:06,792
<i>Not my type...</i>

1081
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,958
<i>- Jealous.
- I let myself be tempted...</i>

1082
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,292
<i>Not the faithful type.</i>

1083
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,750
<i>You'll burn in hell</i>

1084
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,958
<i>Get ready for the flames</i>

1085
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,792
<i>I'll torch you, scorch you</i>

1086
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:20,792
<i>Burn you to ashes...</i>

1087
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:44,042
<i>This is Nathalie Bardot.
Please leave a message.</i>

1088
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,500
<i>It's Vincent. Why won't you pick up?</i>

1089
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:52,125
<i>This is Nathalie Bardot.
Please leave a message.</i>

1090
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:54,917
<i>It's me. Isabelle told me
you're not at work.</i>

1091
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,875
<i>- Hi.
- Where are you?</i>

1092
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,958
<i>- At home.
- Where were you earlier?</i>

1093
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
<i>I was here.</i>

1094
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:08,042
<i>Don't fucking lie to me.</i>

1095
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,083
<i>I was here.</i>

1096
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:11,292
<i>Why didn't you pick up, bitch?</i>

1097
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,750
<i>I didn't move.
Maybe the phone didn't ring.</i>

1098
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:15,833
<i>I'm not fucking stupid.</i>

1099
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:19,167
<i>You're fooling around,
you cock-sucking bitch.</i>

1100
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:21,208
<i>We need to talk this over.</i>

1101
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,292
<i>Hear me, you piece of shit?</i>

1102
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:27,375
<i>I'm coming over
and I'll smash your face in, slut.</i>

1103
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:30,583
<i>I'll waste you
and pound your ass, cunt.</i>

1104
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,958
<i>So wait for me.</i>

1105
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,958
<i>Say you'll wait for me.</i>

1106
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:36,833
<i>Ok, I'll wait for you.</i>

1107
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:52,667
Yohan...

1108
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:55,542
Marceau's gone to see Caron.

1109
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,250
Fuck!

1110
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,333
- <i>Yes?
</i>- What's going on, Marceau?

1111
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:16,625
I'm going to see Caron.

1112
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,542
<i>Not a good idea.</i>

1113
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,417
It's a very good idea.

1114
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:22,167
<i>No, come back.</i>

1115
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,333
I can handle it.

1116
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,417
Fuck...

1117
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:46,250
<i>You've reached Marceau.
Leave a message.</i>

1118
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:47,583
Pain in the ass...

1119
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,250
Who is it?

1120
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:18,792
Police, open up.

1121
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,042
- Is Caron here?
- No, he went out.

1122
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,667
What are you doing?

1123
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,500
I guess I'll wait for him.

1124
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:02,167
You share names with my wife.

1125
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:03,333
I'm sorry?

1126
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:05,708
You share names with my wife.

1127
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,625
What sign are you?

1128
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,333
Scorpio.

1129
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,500
Really?

1130
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:14,958
My wife's Aries.

1131
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,042
You share a name anyhow.

1132
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,875
Listen, Nathalie.

1133
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:27,833
If you alter his alibi,
we'll make sure he won't hurt you.

1134
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,500
On the night of the 12th,
you woke and he was gone.

1135
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:33,542
You checked the time.
It was 1 am.

1136
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,125
- He got back at 4:30.
- Not true.

1137
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:39,500
He was here.
I got up for my sick cat.

1138
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:41,542
Enough of the cat!

1139
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,125
- Got a warrant?
- Shut up.

1140
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,417
Oh yeah?

1141
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:50,042
You like hitting women?

1142
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,333
You like that?

1143
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,625
Like that too? And that?

1144
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:55,958
How about this?

1145
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,667
Gimme more.

1146
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,000
And this one?

1147
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:00,458
Marceau!

1148
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,625
Stop! Stop!

1149
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,208
Stop it!

1150
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,333
Come on.

1151
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:08,750
Come on.

1152
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:19,917
If he presses charges,
I'll run him down.

1153
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,083
Shut the fuck up!

1154
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,250
You think I wouldn't do it?

1155
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,083
- Where're you going?
- Grenoble.

1156
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:28,375
No, you ride with me!
That's an order!

1157
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:29,417
Marceau!

1158
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,750
Keep quiet and no one will know.

1159
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,833
You're dreaming. They'll know.

1160
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:38,292
They'd hassle me
for slapping that scumbag?

1161
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:39,583
Are you stupid?

1162
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,333
It's an investigation.

1163
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,333
We respect procedure or else!

1164
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,583
I'm not an idiot.

1165
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,167
Really, you're not an idiot?

1166
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:50,958
If he's the murderer

1167
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,667
and his lawyers get him off
over your shit,

1168
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,042
I won't forgive you.

1169
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,917
I'm serious, Marceau.
I won't forgive you.

1170
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,875
Know what? You piss me off.

1171
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:06,333
You all piss me off!

1172
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,708
Stop the car!

1173
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,000
Stop!

1174
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,667
Stop the car right now!

1175
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,000
Stop it right now!

1176
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:44,000
Captain Vivès?

1177
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:45,958
Yes.

1178
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,208
Hello. I'm Judge Beltrame.

1179
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,208
Follow me.

1180
01:21:58,625 --> 01:21:59,958
Have a seat.

1181
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:06,083
Sorry, it's not very welcoming.

1182
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:10,625
I inherited 130 cases on arriving here.

1183
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:14,667
Even if you know,
it's always worse than you imagine.

1184
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:20,375
But I'm pretty methodical,
so I hope to get it all sorted.

1185
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:23,042
I'm glad to meet you anyhow.

1186
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:26,333
Emails and phone calls
are great but...

1187
01:22:26,917 --> 01:22:29,958
face to face communication is better.

1188
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,875
I hear you're not talkative.

1189
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:40,208
- Is that so?
- You're surprised?

1190
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,667
Not really.

1191
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,750
I wanted to see you
about Clara Royer's murder.

1192
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:55,000
I was surprised to find the case
at the bottom of the pile.

1193
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,625
At the bottom and deep in a cupboard.

1194
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,792
I don't understand.

1195
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,083
- My unit is no longer on the case.
- I know.

1196
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,292
Why?

1197
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:14,042
I asked the chief to transfer it
as I felt it needed a fresh approach.

1198
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,042
After the first weeks,
things get a lot harder.

1199
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:20,625
It's three years now.

1200
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:24,917
It makes me sick to say it,
but it's over.

1201
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:30,000
Clara was 21.
She was burned alive.

1202
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:32,417
You can't just say it's over.

1203
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:37,208
Even without media attention,
she deserves better.

1204
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:41,833
I worked hard on it.

1205
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,958
That's why I sent for you.

1206
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:46,375
Resume the investigation.

1207
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:49,125
That may not be a good idea.

1208
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,833
I read the case. It's strong.

1209
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,667
It's well constructed.

1210
01:23:56,042 --> 01:24:01,167
Even the reports are precise,
with plenty of attention to detail.

1211
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:05,125
If I may say so,
I found them very well written.

1212
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,625
Well written but no use.

1213
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,583
Eliminating leads is of use.

1214
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:11,417
We didn't find the killer.
That's a fact.

1215
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,417
We screwed up,
I don't know where.

1216
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:17,000
I understand your bitterness.

1217
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,167
But it's beside the point.

1218
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:21,417
I'm not bitter.

1219
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:29,333
They say every investigator
has a crime that haunts him.

1220
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,708
No one knows why.
A case that hurts more.

1221
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,208
It nags at you
until it obsesses you. It...

1222
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,500
It devours you.

1223
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:40,458
Or destroys you. You're right.

1224
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,083
It eats you up inside.

1225
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:49,167
When I began in Rouen,
I had a colleague...

1226
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:53,042
For him, it was a little girl
they never found.

1227
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,917
20 years on, he wasn't over it.

1228
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:58,917
I was young.
I thought he was rambling.

1229
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:03,500
For Tourancheau, our old unit boss,
it was a grandmother

1230
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:06,708
beaten to death with a pan and fists.

1231
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:11,000
She wiped up her blood
before wrapping up in the dog's blanket

1232
01:25:11,042 --> 01:25:13,042
to die without leaving a mess.

1233
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,750
That misled him for a while.

1234
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:19,292
He couldn't figure out
who had wiped up the blood.

1235
01:25:20,417 --> 01:25:22,208
When he finally realized,

1236
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,167
it broke his heart.

1237
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,208
For you, it's Clara.

1238
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:38,042
It drove me crazy
that every guy we saw could've done it.

1239
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:43,000
Maybe none of them is the killer.
But each one could've done it.

1240
01:25:43,042 --> 01:25:45,667
That's the only way I can put it.

1241
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:49,375
Each one she met,
even those who aren't shits.

1242
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:52,542
And maybe all the men she never met.

1243
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:57,792
I may be mad,
but I believe we can't find him

1244
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:00,458
because all men killed Clara.

1245
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,083
Something's amiss
between men and women.

1246
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:09,208
I'm a woman.

1247
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:11,958
And an examining magistrate.

1248
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:17,792
I'd be blind not to see
something's amiss between men and women.

1249
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:19,792
As you say.

1250
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:27,167
I realized the other day

1251
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:30,458
it's almost the anniversary
of Clara's death.

1252
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:32,250
In a fortnight,

1253
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:34,333
it'll be three years
since she was killed.

1254
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:39,000
The person who committed the crime may

1255
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:41,542
feel remorse. Who knows?

1256
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:44,375
Or want to get another kick out of it.

1257
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:48,917
I'd like to tap
the main suspect's phones again.

1258
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:50,917
Something might happen.

1259
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,083
We wanted to try that
for the first anniversary.

1260
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:57,667
I even considered staking out
the crime scene.

1261
01:26:58,417 --> 01:27:01,125
We weren't able to
for budget reasons.

1262
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:04,292
Then other cases took precedence.

1263
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:07,500
That's a pity.

1264
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,625
What is she expecting?

1265
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:14,042
The culprit calls his mum
to say he's felt bad

1266
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,333
for three years?

1267
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:17,042
Something like that.

1268
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,750
Isn't it a waste of time?

1269
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:22,292
The judge is hopeful, so I am too.

1270
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,542
Is she pretty?

1271
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:27,250
Why d'you ask?

1272
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,208
I dunno. No reason.

1273
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,292
That's mine.

1274
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:55,458
Sorry, I was going to ask.

1275
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,875
A gentian.

1276
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,292
It's odd. Not a great photo,

1277
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,542
but I'm getting to like it.

1278
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:06,250
A friend sent it.

1279
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:09,125
A colleague who left three years ago.

1280
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:11,417
- He retired?
- Not really.

1281
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:13,625
It's complicated.
He was transferred.

1282
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:16,792
I heard about him. Marteau.

1283
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:17,958
Marceau.

1284
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,542
But no mime.

1285
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:23,750
No news since he left,
now he sends this.

1286
01:28:24,917 --> 01:28:27,708
Without a note.
Now I'm printing it.

1287
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,000
On paper, not in your mind.

1288
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:32,917
You're right.

1289
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:34,292
That's it exactly.

1290
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,625
The other day, you mentioned

1291
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,500
staking out the crime scene.
Let's do it.

1292
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:05,167
It's hypothetical,
but it's worth trying.

1293
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:09,083
I'll ask narcs for the tank
for the night of the 12th.

1294
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,292
Very good.

1295
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:12,500
- Another thing...
- What?

1296
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,083
Her grave.

1297
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:18,333
We could hide a camera
in the cemetery by Clara's grave.

1298
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:21,375
Who could see to that?

1299
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:25,417
Our tech guys,
but it's pretty short notice.

1300
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,500
Ask them to consider it.

1301
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:32,042
I was thinking of a fake gravestone
to hide the camera.

1302
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,958
Are you serious?

1303
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:37,083
Is it a stupid idea?

1304
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:40,542
- A little, but I like it.
- Good.

1305
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,833
- Can you get funding for that?
- Yes.

1306
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:47,208
Actually, I already have it.

1307
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:53,167
I think I'm falling in love with you.

1308
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,875
Don't talk nonsense.

1309
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,125
October 12th, 2019

1310
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:44,250
- Want a coffee?
- No thanks.

1311
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,000
Why pick the crime squad?

1312
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:54,917
Top of your year,
you had your choice of postings.

1313
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:58,208
With faster promotion.

1314
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I'm not into uniforms.

1315
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,208
I love investigation.

1316
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:08,042
Finding evidence, questioning,
matching facts...

1317
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:10,000
Other cops investigate.

1318
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,833
I mean real investigation.

1319
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:14,625
You like the violent side?

1320
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:16,125
Yes, I like it.

1321
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,458
That's not the tough part.

1322
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:22,250
What is?

1323
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,875
I was told it was the elite.

1324
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:28,375
- With more evolved guys.
- It's not true?

1325
01:31:30,542 --> 01:31:33,083
You're less racist than most cops,

1326
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:35,125
but there are plenty of shitheads.

1327
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,208
- It's that bad?
- Yeah.

1328
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But I don't mean you.

1329
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:55,583
Don't you find it weird
most crimes are committed by men

1330
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:58,542
and mostly men
are supposed to solve them.

1331
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:02,667
Men kill and the police are men.
Odd, isn't it?

1332
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,667
I don't know.

1333
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,417
A man's world.

1334
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,083
Think he'll come?

1335
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:42,083
He's not going to find much.

1336
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:16,875
Look.

1337
01:34:36,542 --> 01:34:37,875
It's going to rain.

1338
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:52,417
Where's the camera?

1339
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:54,750
On the next grave, they said.

1340
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:57,083
That must be it.

1341
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:01,167
Here it is.

1342
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:08,542
Try to swivel it.

1343
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:31,250
Well?

1344
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:32,250
Nothing.

1345
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:35,000
An old lady visiting a grave.

1346
01:35:40,292 --> 01:35:42,000
The gardener. Want to see?

1347
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,083
No. Fast-forward it.

1348
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:48,917
A cat.

1349
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,042
Night-vision now.

1350
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,750
Another cat.

1351
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,833
Funny, that one has white paws.

1352
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,125
Go on, speed it up.

1353
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:21,875
Stop!

1354
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,500
It's for you.

1355
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:50,333
It's for you.

1356
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:59,458
We have a guy on Clara's grave!

1357
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:10,333
Do we know him?

1358
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:12,125
No, never seen him before.

1359
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:42,917
Ok.

1360
01:37:43,542 --> 01:37:45,042
No kidding.

1361
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:05,083
He's speaking.
Do we have sound?

1362
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,167
Just the picture.

1363
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,042
Hello.

1364
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:31,500
Follow me, please.

1365
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,375
He's singing.

1366
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:50,708
In English, not French.

1367
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:57,125
But I don't know English sign language.

1368
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:59,250
- Sign language isn't universal?
- No.

1369
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:03,417
She'll translate.
Can we see it again?

1370
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:22,083
Night... Angel...

1371
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:23,625
Angel in the night.

1372
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,208
Angel in the night?

1373
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:33,542
Then what?

1374
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:36,417
Come and hold me tight.

1375
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:39,792
What's that in English?
Can she write it?

1376
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,625
Can you check?

1377
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:12,708
There's an <i>Angel in the Night</i>, 1983,
by The Toxic Ivies.

1378
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:40,000
What do we do with this?

1379
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,000
"Angel in the night
Come and hold me tight

1380
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:05,875
Save me from the shadows
Chase away my sorrows..."

1381
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,583
<i>Not a hit or even famous.</i>

1382
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:10,208
Does it help?

1383
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,417
Not really.

1384
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:14,458
This angel in the night thing...

1385
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:17,167
It keeps bugging me.

1386
01:41:17,917 --> 01:41:20,208
It's familiar but I don't know why.

1387
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:23,208
<i>Maybe there's a thread to pull.</i>

1388
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,750
Anything on the city CCTV?

1389
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:29,375
Nothing. They can't pay the provider.

1390
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:31,583
No video surveillance for months.

1391
01:41:33,042 --> 01:41:34,750
You showed the screenshot

1392
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:36,083
<i>to Clara's entourage?</i>

1393
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:38,083
Yes. No one recognizes him.

1394
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:42,125
Talk to you soon. Thank you.

1395
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:44,833
Can you move, please?

1396
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,375
- Hold on.
- Watch the door.

1397
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,542
Go on, turn the couch.

1398
01:41:54,417 --> 01:41:56,208
Careful, it's hitting.

1399
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:57,500
Are we good?

1400
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:59,292
It's through.

1401
01:42:00,917 --> 01:42:02,292
Thanks, guys.

1402
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:12,083
It's huge, it takes all the space.

1403
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,042
We'll move the small one.

1404
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:17,083
- Where do we put it?
- I'm taking it.

1405
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:19,292
- You asked?
- No.

1406
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:23,375
That's a three-seater, this is two.
We win.

1407
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:26,292
Fred, this isn't eBay.

1408
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:28,667
You know I need the couch.

1409
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:30,042
My new place is tiny.

1410
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:32,000
Take the microwave too!

1411
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:33,750
I've found him.

1412
01:42:33,792 --> 01:42:35,250
The cemetery guy.

1413
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,750
I checked comments
on news site reports.

1414
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:44,375
This was on the first article
about Clara's death, with a photo.

1415
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:48,042
Look what's written.

1416
01:42:49,792 --> 01:42:50,917
Mats.

1417
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,875
There are thousands of Mats
on social networks.

1418
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:57,167
Using filters,
I found this profile.

1419
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,750
It's him, isn't it?

1420
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,208
Yeah, it's him.

1421
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,250
Well done.

1422
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:09,625
Here he is.

1423
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,792
Let go of me!

1424
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:58,792
Were you at the St Jean cemetery
on October 12th?

1425
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,250
- Yes, I was there.
- What for?

1426
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,125
To see someone.
It's not a crime.

1427
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,583
Who were you seeing?

1428
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:09,125
A girl who died.

1429
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:13,125
You were on Clara Royer's grave?

1430
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:17,917
Why?

1431
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:21,833
To pay my respects and talk to her.

1432
01:44:21,875 --> 01:44:24,042
- Talk to her?
- Yes.

1433
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,333
You talk to the dead?

1434
01:44:26,208 --> 01:44:28,917
No. I wanted to talk to <i>her</i>.

1435
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:30,667
What did you want to say?

1436
01:44:33,083 --> 01:44:35,250
- I can't tell you that.
- Really?

1437
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:36,458
You'll have to.

1438
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,000
I can't help you.

1439
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:41,792
Don't jerk us around.

1440
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:43,792
How did you know her?

1441
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:45,667
- From the hospital.
- Which one?

1442
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:47,125
In Chambéry.

1443
01:44:47,625 --> 01:44:50,083
- You met her in the hospital?
- Yes.

1444
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,125
Ok, and what happened?

1445
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:55,917
Nothing.

1446
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,917
I found her pretty.

1447
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:00,417
True, she was pretty.

1448
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:03,958
So you wanted to burn her?

1449
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:07,333
- It's not that.
- What then?

1450
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:10,833
What then?

1451
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:14,583
I was sad
about what was done to her.

1452
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:16,375
What <i>you</i> did to her!

1453
01:45:16,417 --> 01:45:17,542
I don't understand.

1454
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,208
You knew her address?

1455
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,375
No.

1456
01:45:20,417 --> 01:45:21,417
Yohan...

1457
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:34,250
You didn't know her address.

1458
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:38,708
A problem.
Mats was in the Chambéry psych unit.

1459
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,458
Jérôme has them on line.

1460
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,583
You mean 2016, right?

1461
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57,958
Thanks, I'll be in touch.

1462
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:01,583
It's not him.

1463
01:46:02,292 --> 01:46:04,917
His shrink says
he was interned then.

1464
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:10,250
He read about Clara's death in the press
and got fixated on her.

1465
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:14,250
He was still talking about her
three months ago.

1466
01:46:40,792 --> 01:46:43,042
I'm sorry. I was so sure.

1467
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:53,250
Do you believe in ghosts?

1468
01:46:58,083 --> 01:47:00,208
There's no need to believe in ghosts.

1469
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:03,000
I think the dead are with us.

1470
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:05,292
They torment us so we don't forget them.

1471
01:47:12,417 --> 01:47:15,042
I lost both my parents eight years ago.

1472
01:47:15,417 --> 01:47:17,833
I thought I'd die of grief.

1473
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:21,375
I felt I was in a parallel world,

1474
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:24,833
with them alive somewhere
while I was dead.

1475
01:47:27,333 --> 01:47:29,167
But, in the end, no.

1476
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:31,208
I accepted it.

1477
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:36,042
Now I know some of the dead
stay with us forever.

1478
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:40,625
And the important things we do
are for them.

1479
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:57,500
<i>Hi Marceau.</i>

1480
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:20,417
<i>Hi Marceau. How are you doing?</i>

1481
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:24,250
<i>Your gentian photo
is on the office wall.</i>

1482
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:27,708
<i>I often look at it
to try to pierce its mystery.</i>

1483
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:31,792
<i>The Clara case is still unsolved,
despite a tough new judge.</i>

1484
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:35,542
<i>We thought we had the culprit,
but we were wrong again.</i>

1485
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:38,375
<i>Maybe you were right.</i>

1486
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:39,958

<i>She's young but has something.</i>

1489
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,167
<i>Ghosts don't scare her.</i>

1490

<i>I have high hopes for her.</i>

1491
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:55,125
<i>And I took your advice.</i>

1492

<i>I escaped from the velodrome.</i>

1493

<i>My first goal
is the Croix de Fer Pass.</i>

1494
01:49:00,125 --> 01:49:03,292
<i>A 22-kilometre ascent
with 11% gradients.</i>

1495
01:49:03,333 --> 01:49:04,917
<i>I may as well aim high.</i>

1496
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:08,083
<i>I'll tell you if I make it.</i>

1497
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:09,833
<i>Don't be a stranger.</i>

1498

<i>Yohan.</i>
