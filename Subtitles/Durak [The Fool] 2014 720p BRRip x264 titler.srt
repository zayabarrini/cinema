00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,576
You're blocking the TV!
Move!

3
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:19,457
Who's gonna vacuum
the floor then? You?

4
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,918
How can I watch TV with
your ass in the way?

5
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,161
Let me finish this first!

6
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:33,241
Stupid cow!
I'm missing my show!

7
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,036
Go fix the light!

8
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,039
You can stick your
lights up your ass!

9
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,749
Vera, where's the money?

10
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,787
What money?

11
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:50,033
- You know what money.
- I haven't got any.

12
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,909
I spent the last of it
on bread yesterday.

13
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,495
Nothing left till payday.

14
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:58,709
I hid some under the
shelf in the cupboard.

15
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,537
Oh, yes?

16
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:05,335
There's no food at home,
and you have a stash?

17
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:12,078
Where's the money?
Can't you see I'm shaking?

18
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,743
Kolya, I didn't take it.

19
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:19,085
I'm gonna beat your face in.

20
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:25,241
I swear I didn't take it.
Please don't hit me.

21
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:36,995
How on earth did I end up
with a lazy parasite like you?

22
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:40,417
Laying on the couch
all day like a log!

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,786
I can't take it anymore!

24
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,747
Where's the money?

25
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,538
- You took it.
- I didn't. Go away.

26
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:55,868
- Get away from me, you freak!
- Where's my money?

27
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,870
I'll strangle you.

28
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,702
- Where's my money, you whore?
- Are you nuts?

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,746
- Where is it?
- Get your hands off me!

30
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:09,162
Where's my money?
Where is it, you whore?

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,744
Let go of her! Get away from her,
you bastard!

32
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,871
- Don't you dare touch her!
- Where's my money, you scum?

33
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,331
- Don't touch her!
- Bitch!

34

00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,627
THE FOOL

37
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,917
...He's come back drunk.

38
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:14,243
<i>Dilapidated walls, collapsed ceilings,
and pervasive mould:</i>

39
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,624
<i>all realities of life
for residents living</i>

40
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,999
<i>right opposite the local
government building</i>

41
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,116
<i>but it seems that the window in the
governor's office faces the other way.</i>

42
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,117
<i>These wooden shacks were built
back in 1950 as temporary dwellings</i>

43
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,451
<i>and have not
been repaired since.</i>

44
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,409
<i>Meanwhile, across the road,
a construction project is well under way</i>

45
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,668
<i>not for a residential building,
but a two-story parking lot</i>

46
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,627
<i>for local government officials...</i>

47
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,827
Do you really think
you'll pass?

48
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,503
What do you think?

49
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,452
Everyone says you've
got to bribe someone.

50
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,543
So don't listen.

51
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,787
You're not a kid, Dima.

52
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,750
It's worth a try at least.

53
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,997
Or should I drop everything
and go borrow some money?

54
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,376
Why do you need
this anyway?

55
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,662
Well, I could take over
Fedotov's position.

56
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,534
You'd need to be buddies
with everyone,

57
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:37,118
and to them you're
just some student.

58
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,495
They'll say you're
trying to be smart.

59
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:44,792
They certainly will.
Definitely.

60
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,874
Masha, go set the table.

61
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,170
One moment...

62
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:01,248
Dima, watch Anton please.

63
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,661
Dad, they're breaking
the bench again!

64
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,874
- Where are you going?
- Mom...

65
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,246
- They'll rip your heads off!
- Stop it already.

66
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,246
Get out of the way!

67
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:28,329
Dima, enough chasing after them.
What's the point?

68
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,702
I'm tired of repairing that bench.

69
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,327
We'll catch them
this time for sure.

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,995
Come on, let's go.

71
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:51,212
Scram!

72
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,203
What the hell are you doing,

73
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:57,002
- you bastards?
- Suck it!

74
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,540
These punks need to get
their legs ripped off.

75
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,874
You didn't catch them?

76
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,494
I'll find out who hangs
out around here

77
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,294
and go talk to their parents.

78
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:28,286
What's the point?
They'll just tell you to go to hell.

79
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:32,578
Let's go eat.
I'll fix it later.

80
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:53,411
Not too fatty?
Have some bread with it.

81
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,455
You'll get heartburn otherwise.

82
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,249
- Want some more?
- Let me finish what I have first.

83
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,081
Is it cold?

84
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,336
It's fine, relax.

85
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,462
Come on, sweetheart, yum-yum.
You like yum-yum?

86
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,087
"Yum-yum"... You give him candy,
then expect him to eat real food?

87
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,661
Please don't start.
Come on, yum-yum.

88
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,123
When he gets hungry at night,
you'll be the one heating things up.

89
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,789
Come on, eat some.

90
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,832
Well, did you catch them?

91
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,961
Who can keep up with them?
They're like galloping horses.

92
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,626
Give up on that bench already.
You've repaired it a hundred times.

93
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:39,328
- The neighbors are laughing at you.
- Instead of repairing it themselves.

94
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,503
Freezing their asses sitting
on the cold ground isn't funny.

95
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,586
Those gorillas will realize
their strength any day now

96
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,204
and next time, they'll bash
your heads in.

97
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,795
- We'll call the cops then.
- You think the cops care?

98
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:55,541
They didn't even do anything
to stop the fight.

99
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,754
Dima...

100
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,212
You know what I was thinking?

101
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,454
Ivlev is selling his garage,
his cottage

102
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,289
and his car for next to nothing.

103
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:08,076
He's a useless drunk nowadays.

104
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,372
You should take out a loan.

105
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:13,379
My driver's license
might come in handy.

106
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:18,083
Mom, I told you I need
to pay for the semester.

107
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,088
You tell him.

108
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,126
What am I supposed to tell him?
He's his own master.

109
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:31,287
Two dupes in a pod, I swear.

110
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:36,209
You will never get anywhere
in life like that. Never.

111
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,752
This one has spent his entire life

112
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,498
righteously thumping his chest.

113
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,912
And now my son plans on doing
the same thing.

114
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:47,500
Mom, I only have 2 years left.
Then we'll buy the garage.

115
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,167
You all can live as you like.

116
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,245
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

117
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,253
Other people have everything,

118
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,460
I'm ashamed to look them in the face.

119
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,462
Even our health is poor.

120
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:02,084
Dad has a bad back
and high blood pressure.

121
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,709
And my legs can barely
get me to the kitchen.

122
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,543
Ivan, did we really think that
fortune would smile on us?

123
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,501
I spent twenty years slaving away
as a doctor in the hospital.

124
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:21,250
And now I'm mopping floors
in my old office.

125
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,536
But I have no choice.

126
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,505
Try living on a pension!

127
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:27,338
And your dad has
one foot in the grave.

128
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:31,120
He's been breathing in ashes
on that crane for almost 30 years.

129
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,959
His lungs are clogged,
he's coughing.

130
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,413
We'll see what will come first -
disability, or...

131
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:39,628
I'll take you both
to get treatment.

132
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,918
What do I want with
your treatments?

133
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:44,921
Did we get all these
ailments for nothing?

134
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,502
We did it so that you could
become a man

135
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,580
and live life as it should be lived.

136
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,002
And for Anton.

137
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:58,745
- And I'm not a man?
- You're a fool!

138
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,996
Leave them alone already.
He's sitting here, studying.

139
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,004
What do you want from them?

140
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,121
I'm his mother.

141
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:16,170
You're the one who
never needs anything.

142
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:18,544
The apple didn't fall far
from the tree.

143
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,670
- Here we go.
- Am I wrong?

144
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:24,921
You just say, "We don't need what
doesn't belong to us".

145
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,879
And nothing ever belongs to us!

146
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:31,001
So here you are, all righteous,
but living in dirt your whole life.

147
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,295
Enough already.
I've had it with you.

148
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,580
Look at you sitting here
gathering dust.

149
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,794
Everyone here is sick
and tired of you.

150
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,501
That's right!
You especially!

151
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,793
People stealing left and right,
but not me!

152
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:52,334
Exactly! You never brought
anything home!

153
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,829
The pipes are leaking,
and you don't give a shit.

154
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,547
Even the Karasevs replaced theirs!

155
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,172
He stole them from the warehouse!

156
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,211
So drown here with
your righteousness!

157
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:03,795
People take things for themselves!
Why don't you?

158
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,204
So that no one can point
their finger at you?

159
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,459
In the end, everyone does!

160
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,958
They avoid you like a leper!

161
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,371
Nobody wants anything
to do with you.

162
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,004
- You old fool.
- Find a young one.

163
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,829
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,454
- Dad...
- Let him go!

165
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:32,464
- What's gotten into you?
- Oh, so I'm the one to blame?

166
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:36,247
- First you raise them, and then...
- I've had it with you.

167
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,912
What's wrong with kids nowadays?

168
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:03,456
Don't listen to her, Dad.

169
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:19,788
I came to work once and saw
a bunch of guys acting shifty.

170
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,870
"Come over here. "
I said, "What for?"

171
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:28,756
"We need to steal some pipes
from the warehouse".

172
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:33,295
So I said,
"They don't belong to us".

173
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,746
And now they avoid me
like the plague.

174
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,665
Don't even say hello anymore.

175
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:44,338
Your mother is right.

176
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:50,256
I've lived sixty years and have
neither friends, nor enemies.

177
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,878
Everyone considers me a fool.

178
00:12:55,881 --> 00:13:00,338
At work, it's because I work
and don't steal.

179
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,214
Here it's because I replace
stolen light bulbs.

180
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:10,754
And because I repair
the bench every evening.

181
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,624
I am a fool.

182
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,000
You're not a fool.

183
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,792
Oh, come on...

184
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:28,379
Dima! Somebody from dispatch
called for you.

185
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,546
Mom, tell them
I'm off duty today.

186
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,004
They say it's urgent.
Filimonov went on a bender.

187
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,706
- I should go.
- Sure.

188
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,500
<i>Tell us what happened.</i>

189
00:13:57,673 --> 00:14:01,122
<i>What's there to tell?
The pipes are 20 years old.</i>

190
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,580
<i>Good thing I wasn't
taking a shower,</i>

191
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,795
<i>or I would've been boiled alive.</i>

192
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:09,372
<i>I don't care about the pipes.</i>

193
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,713
<i>Why the hell did
you beat your family?...</i>

194
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:16,456
Andrey, did you shut it
off downstairs?

195
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,542
What, and leave the whole
building without water?

196
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:23,128
I'm just worried...
Look at how it burst.

197
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,248
<i>...Come on, chief,
it's family matters.</i>

198
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:27,881
<i>We'll sort it out ourselves.</i>

199
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,715
<i>Yeah right, and next time
we'll come here</i>

200
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,292
<i>to collect dead bodies?</i>

201
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:35,667
Let's just wait for
the chief to get here,

202
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,168
and let him decide.

203
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:42,292
- You drank yourself to insanity.
- Aha, right.

204
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't talk back.

205
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:48,415
<i>Everything's fine,
it's family matters.</i>

206
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,501
- When did you drink last?
- Why?

207
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,000
- Because the shot won't work.
- I hope it won't.

208
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,837
Let the bastard suffer.

209
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,249
- Our daughter's covered in blood.
- Shut up, bitch.

210
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:04,380
Quiet, you.

211
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,538
I haven't touched the
stuff in three days.

212
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,792
The hangover wasn't easing up.
I went for my stash - it was gone.

213
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:14,001
Almost had a heart attack.
Put yourself in my shoes.

214
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:18,003
My liver's not big enough
to fill your shoes.

215
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:22,129
Well, the burn isn't serious.
It's just a scald.

216
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,215
I'll give you some ointment,
put it on at night.

217
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:29,463
But if you drink,
the shot won't work.

218
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,126
Just so you know.

219
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,088
Do you want us to take him in?

220
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:48,164
He has to be at work tomorrow.
Or he won't get his bonus again.

221
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,672
Sign the waiver then.

222
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,962
<i>Do we really need all this hassle?</i>

223
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:26,503
<i>Why should we be
dealing with this?</i>

224
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,797
What, you can't handle
a burst pipe?

225
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,502
Should we turn
the water off in the basement?

226
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,591
- What the hell for?
- Take a look yourself.

227
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:37,589
What, you felt sorry for me?

228
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,376
I felt sorry for our girl.

229
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,252
Her boots are falling apart.
She needs new ones.

230
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:45,708
Her feet are always wet and cold,
she'll get sick.

231
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,795
Well, are you gonna fix it or not?

232
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:00,000
Shut up, or you're gonna
fix it yourself.

233
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:03,998
- Is this a bearing wall?
- You should know better.

234
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,625
Fuck!

235
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:12,705
What's with him?

236
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:14,337
Let's go.

237
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,206
<i>Get ready for bed.</i>

238
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,498
<i>Mom, let's stay over at Lena's place.
I'm scared of him.</i>

239
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,124
<i>Do what you're told.</i>

240
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,795
<i>There are too many people
in their room as it is.</i>

241
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,748
<i>Go to bed, it's 10 pm already.</i>

242
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,040
<i>Well, are we gonna sleep or not?</i>

243
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:45,875
<i>I'm not going to bed with you.
Go sleep on the sofa.</i>

244
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:50,045
<i>- Oh come on.
- Hands off me.</i>

245
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,174
Come here.

246
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:40,925
What happened?

247
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,497
Have there been any other
complaints from the tenants?

248
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,669
Not today, but this place is
a pain in the ass.

249
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,592
It's an old building.
Been standing for 40 years.

250
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:56,083
- Why are you so agitated?
- Shit... This isn't my district.

251
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:59,462
Has there been a thorough
overhaul of this building?

252
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:04,548
What overhaul?
Like you don't know Fedotov.

253
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,918
They painted the walls,
and he pocketed the rest.

254
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:12,841
What about inspections?
Was everything in order?

255
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,794
Are you joking?

256
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:18,001
The inspectors were given cash
to shut up - problem solved.

257
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,877
Time's up for this building.

258
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,622
We're tired of always having
to come out here.

259
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,587
The roof leaks,
the pipes are rusty.

260
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,042
We patch a hole, and six new
ones appear the next day.

261
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,332
What about Filimonov?

262
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,050
Has he talked to
Fedotov about this?

263
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,296
Why would he care?

264
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,459
His wife left him,
so he's been drunk

265
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,713
for 3 days straight.

266
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:41,341
You'll probably be
transferred to our crew.

267
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,833
The most problematic neighborhood.

268
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,419
What's wrong, anyway?

269
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:48,878
Hell knows.

270
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,672
I think the foundation is shifting.

271
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,539
Are you serious?

272
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:57,624
There's a crack on the outside
from the first to the ninth floor.

273
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:00,587
I looked around, it's a
through-wall crack.

274
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:03,498
And the entire building's tilting.

275
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,672
Fucking hell...

276
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:12,212
- What do we do now?
- Quiet, calm down.

277
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:17,005
Just shut off the water for now
and go home.

278
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:21,005
I'll go talk to Fedotov tomorrow.
That's all. Bye

279
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,425
Dima, what are you doing?

280
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,631
- Go to sleep.
- I need to check something.

281
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:29,293
You and your damn school.
You've got exams tomorrow?

282
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:32,172
Close your eyes, Anton.

283
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:45,427
Dima, are you nuts?
What are you doing?

284
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,838
- Where are you going?
- I don't know why he got up.

285
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,008
I'm going to the 32nd dormitory.

286
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:55,385
- Where I was today. Got it?
- No. What are you talking about?

287
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:59,963
- The dormitory, remember?
- I guess. So what?

288
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:03,335
Things are pretty bad there.
The building's barely standing.

289
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,260
There's a crack, the building's tilting.
It's going to collapse.

290
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,920
- Are you joking?
- I'm serious.

291
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,132
I just looked
at the stability calculations

292
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:11,712
for a 9-story panel building.

293
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:15,253
- It's won't stand another 24 hours.
- Bite your tongue.

294
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,426
So, go see Fedotov tomorrow.

295
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:20,338
The foundation is crumbling.
We need to evacuate people now!

296
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,592
And who's going to let you do that
without an inspection, you lunatic?

297
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,965
Some people have been
there for 30 years.

298
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,625
You want them out
in the middle of the night?

299
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,758
It has to be done right now!

300
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:35,082
But how? Do you have
Fedotov's number? Call him.

301
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,550
He won't do anything.
He pocketed the overhaul money.

302
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:42,169
Do you know anyone from the
administration?

303
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,293
- Your mother does.
- Whom?

304
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,083
Razumikhina, the chief accountant
at the mayor's office,

305
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,209
is your friend, right?

306
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:51,009
We haven't seen each other in ages.

307
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,419
I'm not going to bother her at this hour
with this nonsense.

308
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:58,298
It's not nonsense, Mom!
People can die at any minute! Call her!

309
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:01,007
- Don't yell
- I said, call her!

310
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:09,002
Here's her number, call her yourself,
you raving lunatic!

311
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,172
- Is it that serious?
- It's very serious.

312
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:17,382
Don't you know that
you won't get anywhere?

313
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:19,793
If they didn't care about
that building for 30 years,

314
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,048
why would they start now?

315
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,166
- Yes, I know everything.
- You will raise a panic, and then what?

316
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:29,212
People will have to be put up
somewhere for the night.

317
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:30,630
They can't be on the street

318
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:32,877
with their children
and suitcases in the cold.

319
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,380
They will have to be resettled,

320
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:36,259
and you know what
our town hall's like.

321
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:37,542
A bunch of thieving rats.

322
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,798
Complaints will come in,

323
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,458
people will be fired and courts
will get involved.

324
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:42,549
Stay out of it.

325
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:45,671
- What are they going to do, kill me?
- Idiot.

326
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:48,719
Calm down. Go put Anton to bed.

327
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:54,458
Hello, Galya? It's Dmitry Nikitin.
I apologize for calling so late.

328
00:25:55,386 --> 00:26:00,044
Galya, I really need your help
to contact someone.

329
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,003
The mayor.

330
00:26:04,927 --> 00:26:06,635
Yes, with Galaganova.

331
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:12,008
No, no, not during
office hours, no...

332
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:15,297
Yes, it's urgent,
and no, I'm not joking.

333
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,343
Really?

334
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,136
Where?

335
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:27,173
Got it.

336
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,924
I'll be right there. Yes.

337
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,465
What did she say?

338
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,426
The entire administration is celebrating

339
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,302
Galaganova's birthday
in a restaurant.

340
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,710
There's my meeting -
couldn't be better.

341
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:42,928
- They're all drunk right now...
- Maybe they're better drunk.

342
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:44,511
They'll be more kind.

343
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,042
We'll see.

344
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:47,839
Are you sure?

345
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:54,428
Wait for me.

346
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:59,417
Oh good Lord, what a mess...

347
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:02,214
Oh God...

348
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:06,584
- Go put the kettle on.
- Oh God... Alright.

349
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,800
- Hey, careful, bro.
- You could step aside.

350
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:20,543
- I could do anything.
- I'm happy for you.

351
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,171
- Hey, let's get introduced.
- Later.

352
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:39,470
Easy...
Is it that bad?

353
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:42,334
- The vodka's bad.
- Get some food in your stomach.

354
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,836
Excuse me, where can
I find Nina Galaganova?

355
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,423
She's in the dining hall.

356
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,797
- Thank you.
- Only she's married

357
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,757
- Good to know.
- But I'm not.

358
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,842
- Where are you going?
- Where I need to go

359
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:01,721
- To see her again?
- Go drink some more.

360
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:05,379
I'll divorce you, you bastard!

361
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:08,045
It's about time.
Been waiting for 3 years.

362
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,005
Let's dance!

363
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,712
Come on, girls!

364
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:20,385
Dear friends!
May I have your attention please?

365
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,677
I think we shouldn't
just raise our glasses

366
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,336
to the health of our dear Nina

367
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:34,177
but also say the most
important things about her!

368
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,050
We've all wished her
good health, a long life,

369
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:42,632
happy friends and family.

370
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:44,009
But most importantly,

371
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,298
we all owe her a debt of
gratitude for our thriving town

372
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:50,595
that grows and gets more
beautiful every year.

373
00:32:56,138 --> 00:33:01,522
The life that every resident enjoys
is entirely thanks to her.

374
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:05,347
I ask the people closest
to Nina to say a few words

375
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:08,180
of gratitude on this fine evening.

376
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:18,923
I came here about 20 years ago.

377
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,422
I had to get the zoning documents
for the factory.

378
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,546
So I walk into the records
office and see.

379
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:31,128
A skinny girl,

380
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:35,856
in a dress that blends
into the filing cabinets.

381
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,673
I ask her to bring me this,
give me that,

382
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,632
but she acts like
she doesn't see me.

383
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:47,093
I bark out an order -
and she tells me to go to hell.

384
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:52,011
So then I look at her and say:

385
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,844
"You're going to be
a big boss one day".

386
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:59,347
That girl's name was Nina.

387
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:09,547
Nina was from a small village.

388
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:12,805
Her mother had six children,

389
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:17,796
a cow and her husband's grave
in the backyard.

390
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:24,422
This place was a real
pigsty twenty years ago.

391
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,639
Unless you held your nose
and closed your eyes

392
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:31,804
walking down the street,
you'd be driven to drink.

393
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:35,346
This was one big shithole.

394
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,421
But now,
twenty years have passed.

395
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:45,089
I'm thinking of buying a house
somewhere on the outskirts.

396
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:49,218
And moving there with my family
when I get old.

397
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,837
And all thanks to you, Nina.
You're the boss.

398
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:59,011
And others even call you
by a different name.

399
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,341
Don't be shy, come on,
all together now!

400
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:05,336
Mama!
Mama!

401
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,383
Nina, this is Dmitry Nikitin,
a repair crew chief

402
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,263
for the public utility works.

403
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:48,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

404
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,757
I'm here on a work-related issue.

405
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,053
Now? I'm celebrating.
Have a drink.

406
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,718
Really, I can't.
It's an urgent matter.

407
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,431
Have a drink, busy man.

408
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:02,055
Do you know each other?

409
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:05,305
No. He doesn't like
to do introductions.

410
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:07,929
I'm Dmitry Nikitin.

411
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:12,797
- Nina, an incident has occurred.
- What incident?

412
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:17,136
An emergency situation at one
of the "A" district dormitories.

413
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:21,008
Can't Fedotov or his assistants
handle this?

414
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:25,467
I'm afraid he won't care,
because he never has before.

415
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:28,011
This case could end
with many deaths

416
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:29,592
in the next few hours.

417
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:32,972
Please get all the department
heads together,

418
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:34,966
firemen, police, ambulances.

419
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,550
We need a plan of action.

420
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:39,259
I will give a detailed account
of the situation.

421
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,546
Mrs. Galaganova,
I understand that

422
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:47,466
this is a party and all.

423
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,836
But something terrible is
about to happen.

424
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm not joking.

425
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,929
Emelyanov!

426
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:11,056
Get all the chiefs together
in the other hall.

427
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:13,179
Who exactly do you need,
Nina?

428
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:18,467
They're all wasted.
Sayapin left already, blind drunk.

429
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:22,056
And Tulsky's wife took
him home...

430
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:25,590
Call them and tell them
to come back.

431
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:29,135
I don't care if they puke
or take pills;

432
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:30,682
they have to be here.

433
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,796
Watch out, Dmitry Nikitin,
repair crew chief.

434
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:33,504
Thanks.

435
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,883
What are you stirring
shit up for?

436
00:38:51,224 --> 00:38:53,014
Sit down, Fedor.

437
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:09,261
Well, go ahead and inform us.

438
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:27,637
A crew was called to the 32nd
dormitory in district A,

439
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:30,890
to repair a burst hot-water pipe.

440
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:34,098
They saw that things
were bad and called me.

441
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:37,265
Why not Filimonov?
He's the chief engineer.

442
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:43,921
He went on a bender, Fedor.
It's been three days.

443
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:53,133
The pipes burst due to the
displacement of bearing walls.

444
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,755
The dormitory was built

445
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:56,805
even before the town
was founded.

446
00:39:57,182 --> 00:40:01,722
- So that was about 40 years ago...
- 38.

447
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,016
Whatever.

448
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:07,430
A major overhaul
was never done...

449
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:08,803
What do you mean?

450
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,305
There was one in 1984,
and another three years ago.

451
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:14,928
I'm not prepared to argue
about the quality

452
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:16,641
of these repairs right now.

453
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:18,847
The concern here is
that the building

454
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,593
could collapse at any minute.

455
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:28,433
Who gave you this idea?
Like this very minute?

456
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:32,548
Yes. Practically as we speak.

457
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,594
There are two huge cracks
on the bearing walls,

458
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,473
from the first to the ninth floor.

459
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,348
And the entire building's tilting.

460
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:41,673
The foundation is crumbling
and shifting.

461
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:45,762
The vibrations of the units are
visible to the naked eye.

462
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:51,095
- How many people live there?
- Who are you listening to, Tolya?

463
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:56,348
This requires a regional inspection,
about 10 specialists.

464
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:58,093
There are many aspects.

465
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:01,262
He just probably fucking
some girl

466
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:04,930
in that dorm and promised her
a new apartment.

467
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,804
- It's 2 am, Fedor...
- Shut up!

468
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:12,551
That sounds about right.
Balls rolled up - now pay up.

469
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:16,093
Go and look for yourselves.
Even a child can see...

470
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,011
Maybe a child can, but
it's not clear to us.

471
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:25,100
- Are you the chief housing engineer?
- No.

472
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:27,799
- Exactly.
- Neither are you!

473
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:37,423
Foundation, tilt -

474
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,390
do you know
much about that?

475
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:41,882
Yes, I'm studying construction,
second year.

476
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:44,215
Need the diploma
to get promoted, right?

477
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,846
I told you to be quiet!

478
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:51,390
You can really see everything
with the naked eye.

479
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,266
The stability factor of
a nine-story panel building

480
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,638
doesn't allow for a
tilt of even 5 degrees.

481
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,475
And that building is leaning
by around 10 degrees.

482
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:03,714
The tilt is beyond the point
of maximum deviation

483
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:07,009
from the gravity-bearing
perpendicular.

484
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,511
This means that
the building is falling,

485
00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:14,883
and it will fall no matter what.

486
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:18,972
Taking into account
the angle of deviation,

487
00:42:19,142 --> 00:42:22,508
the building won't stand
more than a day.

488
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:55,433
Do you realize that in that case

489
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:57,681
we need to declare an emergency

490
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,174
and evacuate
the people immediately?

491
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:01,929
Yes.

492
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,342
How many are in there?
A thousand?

493
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:06,892
There are 820 people.

494
00:43:08,142 --> 00:43:09,933
820 people.

495
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:14,430
They will need to be resettled.

496
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,638
And the town has a
housing shortage as it is.

497
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:20,264
Go ahead,
call a regional inspection,

498
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:23,302
let them check everything
and make a decision.

499
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,054
Because I'm not taking
on these costs.

500
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:28,466
You want to end up
in jail then?

501
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:33,428
Sayapin can take care of that
as our friend.

502
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:39,883
800 people.

503
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,595
What if they all
get buried under there?

504
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,050
You pocketed the money
for repairs,

505
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:48,383
I never checked.
We're both going down.

506
00:43:48,684 --> 00:43:51,469
- I pocketed the money?
- You did!

507
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:53,682
Oh come on, Fedor!

508
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,682
Did your daughter's
house build itself?

509
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,389
Or did you help her
with your salary?

510
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,638
Look who's talking!

511
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:06,554
What about your house?
Or his house?

512
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:11,883
Why don't we tell this kid here
who pocketed what.

513
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:16,476
Or how we survive around here,
washing each other's hands.

514
00:44:16,976 --> 00:44:20,224
What hands?
Watch what you say!

515
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,883
- I've got my own patch.
- What patch?

516
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:26,259
The whole town together with its
30,000 residents is the patch.

517
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:27,507
One of us gets caught,

518
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:29,592
he'll take everyone down
with him.

519
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,601
Journalists will come,
and up in smoke we go.

520
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:35,512
I'm all clean.
I've had inspections already.

521
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:38,050
Crime detection rate
was within norm.

522
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:40,798
No drug addicts,
no prostitutes at all.

523
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:45,264
But you and Matyugin
will be going up

524
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:46,928
in smoke in his fire truck.

525
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,099
Any more threats?

526
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:51,757
What did you do
with the prostitutes?

527
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,428
Are they at your harem?

528
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:56,384
Quiet, all of you!

529
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:04,467
A fish rots from the head down.

530
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:07,428
If I'm tainted,
then so are all of you.

531
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:10,970
They'll go through everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

532
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:12,138
And for 800 people,

533
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,431
they'll find shit
even in your "patch".

534
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,263
What, do you have
the cleanest department?

535
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,881
Right, go to the place with him.

536
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:34,674
- I'm...
- Have a look once you're there.

537
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,639
If everything is as he says,

538
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,725
then we'll think about
what to do.

539
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:55,216
Let's go, shit-stirrer.

540
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,552
Dima, stay for a moment.

541
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:10,932
If he tries to threaten you,
don't listen.

542
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,892
He's cunning and sly.

543
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:16,309
If not him, then
we'll have to deal with it.

544
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:18,682
Not to mention
those poor people.

545
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:28,057
I'll go too. Fedotov's
angry right now,

546
00:46:28,226 --> 00:46:29,306
and the kid's naive.

547
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,723
OK, good luck.

548
00:47:23,393 --> 00:47:26,143
- Show us what you've got.
- It's this way.

549
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,598
- Here it is.
- What is it?

550
00:47:37,143 --> 00:47:39,763
The crack goes through
the whole building.

551
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:43,017
So what? I saw this crack
two years ago.

552
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:45,799
Fine.

553
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:48,679
Look here.

554
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:55,310
The wall is crumbling,
the foundation is shifting.

555
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:57,725
Shifting where?

556
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,059
In fall the soil gives
a little from the rain.

557
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,851
Don't get smart, builder.

558
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,265
OK, come with me.

559
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,018
Come on, let's go.

560
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,018
Man, it stinks in here.

561
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,226
Fix the sewage pipes,
then it won't stink.

562
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:04,718
You scum!
Stop torturing us!

563
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:08,178
Your child is scared of you!
I'll call the cops.

564
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,886
Go ahead, you piece of shit!
You think they'll show up?

565
00:49:12,061 --> 00:49:14,550
- I'll cut you up, you bitch!
- Calm down, man.

566
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:15,676
What did you say?

567
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,058
Nothing, but you're asking
for a kicking.

568
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:22,096
All right guys, no offence.

569
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,226
My daughter steals
money from me,

570
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,852
I need it for my treatment.

571
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:28,301
The bitch buys smack with it.

572
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,768
I'll go have a smoke.

573
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,634
These people need their
brains repaired, not the pipes.

574
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:46,469
That's why it stinks here.

575
00:49:48,144 --> 00:49:50,017
Different people live here.

576
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:53,102
Go away.

577
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,135
We're from the housing department.
I've got the chiefs here with me.

578
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:16,633
Hello, Fedor.

579
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:21,808
Can we take a look at your bathroom?

580
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:28,435
Sure, sure, go ahead.

581
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:39,559
It's one thing after another.

582
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:43,101
Pipes burst, and then this
son of a bitch goes crazy.

583
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:46,347
That scum beats his own daughter,
can you imagine?

584
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,309
He needs to be taken away,
but the pigs,

585
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:53,517
sorry, police, never do.

586
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:57,180
Although, I let them go myself.

587
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:00,265
Help us.

588
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,555
With what?

589
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,640
Sure, we'll deal with it.

590
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:12,602
Will they fix the pipes soon?

591
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:16,718
They shut the water off and we
can't wash or cook anything.

592
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:18,555
Soon, soon.

593
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:15,473
- Go home.
- Yes sir!

594
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,807
- What did you say?
- Don't get involved.

595
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:20,141
They're all punks.

596
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:29,015
Look, the old bat is
going to crawl out.

597
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,057
We're from the housing department.
May we come in?

598
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,101
Get out of there, you punks!

599
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:38,139
Chill out, granny. Come over here,
we'll get you stoned.

600
00:53:27,396 --> 00:53:29,186
They're all yours.

601
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,804
I'm off for a piss.

602
00:53:43,604 --> 00:53:46,603
Oh, hi guys.
What are you doing here?

603
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,639
We're from the housing department.
Checking the pipes.

604
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:54,223
I don't give a fuck about the pipes.
I only shower once a week.

605
00:53:54,646 --> 00:53:56,637
There's plenty of water right now.

606
00:53:57,062 --> 00:54:01,602
I bring in snow from outside,
and problem solved.

607
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:07,853
And if the building collapses,
I don't give a fuck as well.

608
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:12,559
This is no life anyway, is it?

609
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:21,553
Hey guys, how about
a shot or two, huh?

610
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:27,270
Well? Come on!
Let's have some.

611
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,437
Right...

612
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,846
Let's get going.

613
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:37,891
One more game?

614
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:39,853
- What did they want?
- Fuck knows...

615
00:54:40,063 --> 00:54:41,556
Hey...

616
00:54:43,729 --> 00:54:46,894
What are the chiefs doing here?
Something serious?

617
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:49,512
- We don't know yet.
- Listen...

618
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:51,729
Trouble sleeping?

619
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:54,602
- What?
- It's late.

620
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:57,889
Why do you even care
about us lowlives?

621
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:02,678
- Compassionate, are you?
- I am what I am.

622
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,849
- What were you doing there?
- Fuck off.

623
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:31,807
- That's some building...
- No kidding.

624
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,353
- Well?
- This way.

625
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:54,355
- What's the bottle for?
- Look.

626
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:31,355
Come here.

627
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:50,014
Look down.
Just be careful.

628
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:12,181
- Far from the wall?
- About three meters.

629
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:19,181
- Did you give everyone their tasks?
- Yes.

630
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:25,433
Nina, what should I do
about the guests?

631
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:28,015
Entertain them.

632
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:30,894
Turn up the music.

633
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:34,683
Tell the kitchen to hurry up
with the main course.

634
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:36,558
Many are getting ready to leave.

635
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:38,888
Vostrikov is upset that
you're not there.

636
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,353
Well, make sure that he isn't upset.

637
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:44,189
I can't be there.
I've got other things on my mind.

638
00:58:44,356 --> 00:58:47,355
- Maybe we should let them go home?
- Yeah right!

639
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:51,398
So they'd know we have a mess
on our hands?

640
00:58:52,314 --> 00:58:55,266
Give them enough booze
to put them to sleep.

641
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:59,147
Tell them I had to leave,
but will be back shortly.

642
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:00,560
Got it.

643
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:10,056
The rumors will spread.

644
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:14,305
The neighbors won't keep quiet.
They'll get more from the budget.

645
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:17,848
The most important thing is that
the building does not collapse.

646
00:59:18,023 --> 00:59:20,559
Then there'll be facts, not rumors.

647
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:27,096
Well?

648
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,183
Speak!

649
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:32,641
It's not good.

650
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:35,146
It will probably collapse.

651
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:38,690
Really?

652
00:59:39,481 --> 00:59:42,267
Don't know. Looks
like Nikitin was right.

653
00:59:43,315 --> 00:59:45,934
We need to get the people
out of there.

654
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:57,113
I told you we needed
to be careful...

655
00:59:57,502 --> 01:00:00,428
with district A.

656
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:06,140
It was built in a rush,
on unstable soil.

657
01:00:07,231 --> 01:00:10,894
We should've resettled everyone and
demolished the building ages ago.

658
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:13,679
Resettle them where, smart guy?

659
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:17,730
Give me two buildings with
a hundred units each.

660
01:00:17,898 --> 01:00:21,478
We should have built them
when we had the money.

661
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:24,306
But you were too greedy!

662
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,644
Get out!
Get out!

663
01:00:34,315 --> 01:00:37,184
Half the budget goes up
to grease the palms

664
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:38,898
at the regional office!

665
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:42,231
Everyone there practically
lives at resorts!

666
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:45,148
They all have cars, houses,
wives all decked in gold.

667
01:00:45,315 --> 01:00:48,018
And if I refuse - they won't
give us a penny.

668
01:00:54,232 --> 01:00:56,472
How much money did
we get this year?

669
01:00:56,815 --> 01:01:00,015
Just enough to tar a few roofs
and replace a few main pipes.

670
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:04,565
Pensioners are going hungry,
three suicides a year.

671
01:01:04,732 --> 01:01:07,482
The disabled are waiting
to get treated by the state.

672
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:10,813
What about orphanages,
and large family allowances?

673
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:13,224
I built a new maternity hospital!

674
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:15,022
Do you think I'm made
of money?

675
01:01:15,273 --> 01:01:18,308
And how am I supposed
to survive and raise my children?

676
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:21,648
I'm constantly under stress.

677
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,352
I lived in fear for
my life through the '90s.

678
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:26,521
I'm responsible for everything:

679
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,974
for taxes, for military enlistment,
for elections.

680
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:33,101
They'll either send me to prison,
or pat me on the head.

681
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,265
I want to live like a normal person!

682
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,768
I have 3 scars on my head,

683
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,015
hypertension,
ulcers and two divorces!

684
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:45,399
I'm a woman, mother and wife -
I want to live like a normal person!

685
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,856
And so do you.

686
01:02:03,524 --> 01:02:05,848
That's why you grab
a piece for yourself

687
01:02:06,024 --> 01:02:07,648
without a thought for others.

688
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:11,147
You don't give a fuck whose
walls are crumbling

689
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,023
or whose roof is leaking.

690
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:16,938
Because you have to finish
laying down your own roof.

691
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:22,395
Your house isn't much smaller
than mine, four stories tall.

692
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:26,308
Your son, a spoiled brat,
rapist and drug addict

693
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:28,604
with 6 arrests and 2 court cases.

694
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:32,561
Has an apartment in Moscow
and goes to a private school.

695
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:40,977
This one will soon have people
dying from simple infections,

696
01:02:41,149 --> 01:02:43,721
while he steals all the supplies,
down to the antiseptics.

697
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,855
I bought new equipment
for the hospital,

698
01:02:46,024 --> 01:02:46,938
he sold half of it.

699
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,270
If I wasn't helping,

700
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:51,144
you'd be treating people
with roadside herbs.

701
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:56,473
And this one has turned the
police department into a racket.

702
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:59,347
I looked the other way,
"Go ahead, Sergey.

703
01:02:59,524 --> 01:03:00,520
"Make some money".

704
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:04,441
I don't even know what you do.

705
01:03:04,607 --> 01:03:06,813
Sit on your ass all day,
signing papers.

706
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:11,311
There hasn't been a fire
in the town for ten years.

707
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:15,315
But we still allocate
funds to get hoses,

708
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:17,770
equipment,
who knows what else!

709
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:30,061
Yeah, I make something
out of every deal.

710
01:03:32,899 --> 01:03:35,223
But whose hands are clean here?

711
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:40,855
Perhaps one of you would like
to take my place? Be my guest!

712
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:50,643
Only you oafs won't be
able to hack it.

713
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:54,190
Sucking that teat dry,

714
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:57,689
but when something happens -
blame "mama".

715
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:02,980
And you call yourselves men?
Pussies.

716
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:04,098
Enough, Nina!

717
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,855
We all know that.
We weren't born yesterday.

718
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:13,310
I've always lived well,
never had to beg,

719
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,475
and don't plan on starting.

720
01:04:15,983 --> 01:04:19,645
And I don't give a shit
what people think of me.

721
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:26,024
If you can't take what you need,
you'll live like a worm in shit.

722
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:30,565
This never-ending talk
about "corruption" -

723
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,187
the whole country lives on bribes!

724
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,522
Even in the Soviet days, when
my mother was dying of cancer

725
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:50,100
we had to grease some palms
to get her medication.

726
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,020
And now, you can't do anything
without money!

727
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:57,772
I hate to interrupt such nice
bureaucratic confessions,

728
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:02,014
but what are we going to do now?
Time's ticking.

729
01:05:06,817 --> 01:05:08,855
What are we going to do?

730
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,144
Evacuate the people.

731
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:14,267
- Is this official?
- Of course.

732
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:17,233
I'll call the regional office
and let them know.

733
01:05:17,608 --> 01:05:19,185
Why?

734
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,025
Regulations.

735
01:05:21,442 --> 01:05:23,812
Let's not raise a stink right now.

736
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:26,396
Get the people out,
and tomorrow we'll bring in

737
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:27,895
the experts and equipment.

738
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:29,774
Maybe it can still be repaired.

739
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:33,604
And who will be responsible for
the fuckups? Me or him?

740
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:37,355
And what should we tell the tenants?
They're not a flock of sheep.

741
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:40,097
If they realize
that the building is failing,

742
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:41,354
they won't go back.

743
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,809
Well, then stage a fire,
or any emergency situation.

744
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,350
Anything. We need to keep them
all out overnight.

745
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,313
And in the morning,
the experts will come.

746
01:05:59,483 --> 01:06:01,807
If there are really no other options...

747
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:04,350
We'll have to resettle everyone.

748
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:08,599
I'll fall at Safronov's feet.
He's building an entire block.

749
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:24,729
Come on, go already!
Do something!

750
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:52,098
We found all the documents.
They're in the car.

751
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:55,523
- If we need to, we can lose them.
- And what do you have?

752
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:57,893
Things are in pretty bad shape.

753
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:01,149
The deficit in the repairs budget
is 120 million.

754
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:03,061
Oh God...

755
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:05,392
We certainly could have spent it...

756
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:08,767
but what do we have to show for it?
That's a lot of money.

757
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,932
A new construction site
could justify it,

758
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:14,645
but Safronov's investors
won't cooperate.

759
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:20,526
How much would it cost
to resettle the dormitory?

760
01:07:20,692 --> 01:07:22,898
There are 820 residents.

761
01:07:23,192 --> 01:07:26,725
An emergency means resettling
all of them, and fast.

762
01:07:27,067 --> 01:07:31,062
At least 600 in the first two months.
That's about 200 families.

763
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:33,439
83 of those are multi-child families,

764
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:35,850
there are 27 disabled,
and 10 veterans.

765
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:38,183
So we'll need about
60 two-room apartments,

766
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:39,734
and the rest are one-room.

767
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:44,564
I think that amounts
to approximately...

768
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:48,315
...260 million.

769
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,481
God damn it...

770
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:57,519
Oh God...

771
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:02,771
I'm such an idiot...

772
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:07,021
Right...

773
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:11,858
- Tanya, bring Safronov. Is he here?
- He left about two hours ago.

774
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:15,234
- Then I need to go find him
- Wait, Nina.

775
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:16,812
There's no time.

776
01:08:16,984 --> 01:08:20,565
If you have something
to say, come with me.

777
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:39,933
Go and get another unit there!

778
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:41,900
So wake them up!
The gas workers too.

779
01:08:42,068 --> 01:08:43,182
That dormitory uses gas.

780
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,067
Although I'm not sure.
Find out.

781
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:47,522
Get the guys ready.
Two trucks at least

782
01:08:47,735 --> 01:08:49,726
Check the fire hoses
and the equipment,

783
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:51,608
it's been ages since we used it.

784
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:55,268
Set up a blockade around
the perimeter. How long?

785
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:57,275
How long is the perimeter?

786
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:59,980
We'll talk about overtime later.

787
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:03,731
Hey, watch your mouth,
or I'll get you fired.

788
01:09:04,235 --> 01:09:08,395
Get me three ambulances, each with
a doctor and two paramedics.

789
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:11,100
You guys ready? Let's go.

790
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,066
Wait!

791
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,063
- What happened?
- Stand down for now.

792
01:09:19,318 --> 01:09:21,109
- Why?
- We have to wait.

793
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:24,187
- For whom?
- I don't know. Nina said, wait.

794
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:48,731
Right... Let's go have a drink, guys.

795
01:09:56,777 --> 01:10:00,522
Hey shit-stirrer, what are you
standing there for? Let's go!

796
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,023
You've got ulcers or what?

797
01:10:36,068 --> 01:10:38,735
Let's talk here.
My relatives are visiting,

798
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,107
I don't want them to know anything.

799
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,850
I urgently need to resettle
600 people.

800
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:47,145
I need 200 apartments, 2 buildings.
Please help.

801
01:10:50,152 --> 01:10:53,601
Are you insane?
How can I get you two buildings?

802
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:59,435
The nine-story buildings you built
are still vacant, aren't they?

803
01:11:00,485 --> 01:11:04,562
Those apartments were sold
even before we broke ground.

804
01:11:06,277 --> 01:11:09,608
Only for a couple of months.
I really need this, help me out.

805
01:11:09,777 --> 01:11:12,349
My budget will be approved soon,
I'll buy them.

806
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:16,184
What? I could be locked up
for something like that.

807
01:11:17,735 --> 01:11:21,600
For a month at least,
and then I'll think of something.

808
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,523
Then I'll resettle them
somewhere else.

809
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,857
I have inspections
and showings every week.

810
01:11:30,027 --> 01:11:32,351
There can't be anyone there.

811
01:11:33,902 --> 01:11:36,439
What are you doing, you bastard?

812
01:11:37,611 --> 01:11:40,610
I sold you that land
for next to nothing.

813
01:11:40,777 --> 01:11:42,852
Don't you have a conscience?

814
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:49,236
I have 800 people living in a
dangerous building.

815
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:52,686
I can't get them evacuated without
having a place to resettle them.

816
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:54,936
The housing budget will come
under scrutiny.

817
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:58,608
They will put me away for 15 years,
like they did with Sorokin.

818
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:00,817
No one will touch you.

819
01:12:01,152 --> 01:12:03,855
You pay a kickback to the governor,

820
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:06,896
giving him some votes.
There you go.

821
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:10,069
If he starts to pressure you,
threaten to give him up.

822
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:13,402
- He'll get you off the hook.
- Right, or kill me.

823
01:12:13,902 --> 01:12:16,226
I could be killed too.

824
01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:24,394
Nina, I'm sorry, I can't.

825
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:31,017
My investors used to tear people
to shreds back in the 1990s.

826
01:12:31,736 --> 01:12:33,526
Sorry, I can't.

827
01:12:57,194 --> 01:13:00,478
Nina, you have no choice.

828
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,770
What do you mean?

829
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:08,394
You can't evacuate anyone
from that building.

830
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:14,028
So what should I do?
Bury them all in the rubble?

831
01:13:16,194 --> 01:13:19,229
Who said the building
will collapse for sure?

832
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:23,028
- Nikitin.
- That punk?

833
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:29,308
He just wants to sabotage Fedotov
and take his job.

834
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,478
And don't listen to that idiot
waste-of-space Matyugin.

835
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:36,233
What about the risk?

836
01:13:36,403 --> 01:13:40,184
The risk...
There's always a risk.

837
01:13:42,736 --> 01:13:45,522
Are you one of Safronov's investors?

838
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:48,818
Nina, stop it.

839
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,350
Are you?

840
01:13:50,528 --> 01:13:53,148
I saw how he looked at you.
Well?

841
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:58,147
I am.

842
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:03,068
And what about the people?

843
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:07,445
Living, breathing people,
you scumbag.

844
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,519
Shut your mouth, you bitch.

845
01:14:22,695 --> 01:14:25,895
When did you start worrying
about the people?

846
01:14:28,237 --> 01:14:32,397
Only when 800 of them might
perish at once?

847
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:37,028
Were you worried about them
when they were dying one by one?

848
01:14:40,487 --> 01:14:44,861
When you took a piece for yourself
out of every line in the budget.

849
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:48,816
The roads are shit, one pot-hole

850
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:52,021
on top of another,
accidents every day.

851
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:55,232
The people are drinking
themselves to death,

852
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:56,601
killing each other.

853
01:14:56,778 --> 01:15:01,022
Because there are no decent jobs here,
and the wages wouldn't suit a beggar.

854
01:15:01,987 --> 01:15:05,851
Kids are wasting their lives
and shooting up in basements.

855
01:15:06,737 --> 01:15:11,609
The schools are a mess; teachers
and doctors can't afford to buy food.

856
01:15:13,278 --> 01:15:16,277
Old people and the disabled
are better off dying.

857
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,479
You and I have been through this.

858
01:15:18,654 --> 01:15:20,277
How much have I done for you?

859
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:23,017
You've been feeding
off me your entire life.

860
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:32,060
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a secretary.

861
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,647
Because you're a nobody,
and I'm a somebody.

862
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,358
And the higher-ups know that.

863
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,019
Well?

864
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:46,942
What's the matter with you?
Get yourself together.

865
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:50,611
Here, you either live like
a human being, or like cattle.

866
01:15:50,987 --> 01:15:53,524
There's not enough of the good life
to go around.

867
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,187
Divide it evenly, and
nobody will get anything.

868
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,893
Everyone will be equally poor.

869
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,564
Come on...

870
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:07,649
Would that be better? No.

871
01:16:09,696 --> 01:16:11,901
I helped you become somebody,

872
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:15,402
and you're biting the hand
that holds you.

873
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:29,024
Think about it long and hard -
are you with them or with us?

874
01:17:03,404 --> 01:17:05,479
So what do we do now?

875
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,940
We'll think of something.
Get in the car.

876
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:36,570
Look at them, all shitfaced,
and not giving a damn.

877
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,400
What do they care?

878
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:43,696
They'll have different bosses,
but they will still have their jobs.

879
01:17:43,946 --> 01:17:47,644
Stop whining,
nothing's happened yet.

880
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:55,563
Sometimes I think, why the hell
did I have to become the chief?

881
01:17:58,196 --> 01:18:02,606
I could've continued
working as a surgeon;

882
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,150
cut this, stitch that.

883
01:18:08,696 --> 01:18:12,394
God forbid I'm ever on your
operating table.

884
01:18:13,363 --> 01:18:18,519
You will take out a kidney
and sell it.

885
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:26,228
And you're an unselfish soul,
I suppose?

886
01:18:27,196 --> 01:18:29,899
Catch a lot of crooks?

887
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:33,229
You're not so easy to catch.

888
01:18:33,405 --> 01:18:36,605
I try to put you away,
but you bribe me.

889
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,903
And I'm Russian,
can't help but take it.

890
01:18:48,696 --> 01:18:51,268
- Fedor, come dance with us...
- Get lost.

891
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:01,940
Are you from another planet
or something?

892
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,197
Anyone else
would've taken one look

893
01:19:06,363 --> 01:19:08,272
and gone back home to bed.

894
01:19:10,572 --> 01:19:12,314
Why do you care?

895
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:18,022
- There are human beings in there.
- What human beings?

896
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:22,231
Trash...

897
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:25,523
and rejects.

898
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,062
- Maybe they should just die.
- Children too?

899
01:19:34,947 --> 01:19:38,645
The ones smoking junk
and fucking in the attic?

900
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:44,112
What will they grow up to be?
You tell me!

901
01:19:59,905 --> 01:20:03,236
You shouldn't be grinding
that axe here, kid.

902
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:09,940
We're old and seasoned.

903
01:20:11,155 --> 01:20:15,613
We have seen a lot in this life.
Especially me.

904
01:20:17,114 --> 01:20:20,445
Every other person
in that dormitory either

905
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:24,027
has an arrest or
a conviction to their name.

906
01:20:25,114 --> 01:20:27,271
If there were fewer
of those buildings,

907
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,320
the world would be
a better place.

908
01:20:29,655 --> 01:20:33,733
And life would be easier
for normal people like us.

909
01:20:44,197 --> 01:20:45,608
Yes?

910
01:20:47,406 --> 01:20:48,864
I'll be right back.

911
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:50,901
Yes...

912
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:21,401
One more round before we leave.

913
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:42,069
So, looks like everything's back on.

914
01:21:42,406 --> 01:21:46,068
We're evacuating the tenants,
and waiting for inspectors.

915
01:21:46,698 --> 01:21:48,777
Nina wants...

916
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:53,733
to discuss something with
the three of you. On the spot.

917
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:58,113
- My boys will drive you there.
- We'll drive ourselves.

918
01:21:58,573 --> 01:22:00,031
What, drunk?

919
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:04,528
I forbid it as the chief of police.

920
01:22:29,948 --> 01:22:34,855
...That's two more years of work.
I'm so sick of it.

921
01:22:35,823 --> 01:22:38,147
- Hey...
- Go home.

922
01:22:41,948 --> 01:22:46,274
- Look, our very own bodyguards.
- Very funny. Get in.

923
01:23:45,698 --> 01:23:47,524
Well, are you happy now?

924
01:23:53,948 --> 01:23:56,900
Why is there so few of you guys?

925
01:23:59,115 --> 01:24:01,190
More are on their way.

926
01:24:06,365 --> 01:24:09,364
Where are we going?
The 32nd is the other way.

927
01:24:11,782 --> 01:24:14,615
Don't listen,
drive where you were told.

928
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:18,529
Why? He's driving
in the wrong direction.

929
01:24:19,448 --> 01:24:21,903
He's driving where we need to go.

930
01:24:22,532 --> 01:24:25,732
Hey, if you don't know the way,
let me drive.

931
01:24:26,324 --> 01:24:28,280
Shut up already!

932
01:24:31,324 --> 01:24:34,406
Watch who you're talking to.

933
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:53,324
Galaganova...
That ruthless bitch...

934
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,155
What's the matter with you?

935
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:02,735
Tolya, that building will collapse.

936
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:06,694
And we "ran away".

937
01:25:07,615 --> 01:25:09,488
What was it you said?

938
01:25:09,657 --> 01:25:12,028
I "pocketed the money,
kicked some back to you",

939
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:14,107
and you "never bothered to check"?

940
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:17,151
They will blame everything
on the two of us.

941
01:25:17,824 --> 01:25:20,360
Sayapin is a bitch too.

942
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:25,397
We're done for, Tolya.

943
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:33,023
What are you, nuts?
There are 800 people there.

944
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:40,437
She'll get them out,
and blame us for the building.

945
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:52,774
Hey guys, are you going to kill us?

946
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,155
Well? Answer me!

947
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:09,032
Shut your mouth and sit still.

948
01:26:56,908 --> 01:26:58,318
Stop here.

949
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,693
Get back here.

950
01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:47,447
Let the kid go.

951
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:51,440
He's just a plumber.

952
01:27:54,325 --> 01:27:56,281
He won't say anything.

953
01:27:57,075 --> 01:27:59,232
Are you fucking crazy?

954
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:02,110
What the fuck is all this?

955
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:04,234
- Shut up!
- What?

956
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:21,605
Go.

957
01:28:22,408 --> 01:28:25,740
Take your family and
leave town tonight.

958
01:28:26,325 --> 01:28:30,651
If you give us away,
we'll find you and kill you.

959
01:28:52,742 --> 01:28:54,366
What are you waiting for?

960
01:28:55,492 --> 01:28:57,567
You really are a fucking fool.

961
01:28:58,075 --> 01:29:00,612
Get lost! Now!

962
01:29:33,617 --> 01:29:36,900
- Take him to his bed.
- Leave it.

963
01:29:45,325 --> 01:29:47,447
Where is he?

964
01:29:49,409 --> 01:29:54,482
- At work, that's where.
- What's this work at 3am?

965
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:57,861
It is what it is.

966
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:04,567
Get packing.
Mom, help her.

967
01:30:04,784 --> 01:30:07,534
- Her things, Anton's and mine
- What happened?

968
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:09,450
There's no time!
Get ready!

969
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:11,609
Oh dear Lord...

970
01:30:12,326 --> 01:30:13,701
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

971
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:15,147
I barely made it out alive.

972
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:17,401
We need to leave, for a long time.
Otherwise...

973
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:22,400
- Oh God! Holy Mother...
- Shut it and do as you are told!

974
01:30:23,326 --> 01:30:26,408
- Let's get you a taxi.
- Too risky. We'll catch a ride.

975
01:30:26,576 --> 01:30:29,575
- I'll go ask the neighbor for his car.
- I won't be able to return it!

976
01:30:29,742 --> 01:30:33,026
We won't get any poorer. Go pack.
I'll pull up to the entrance.

977
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:34,446
Thanks.

978
01:30:34,784 --> 01:30:36,326
Should I take the summer clothes?

979
01:30:36,492 --> 01:30:38,200
Take everything.
And all money we have.

980
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:40,655
- How long will you be gone?
- Forever, Mom.

981
01:30:43,076 --> 01:30:46,857
- Masha!
- Easy, easy. Sit down!

982
01:31:00,076 --> 01:31:02,447
My baby, oh dear God...

983
01:31:02,951 --> 01:31:04,409
My son...

984
01:31:06,743 --> 01:31:10,026
- Oh dear God!
- Quit it, you'll wake everyone up.

985
01:31:10,326 --> 01:31:11,488
Oh Masha...

986
01:31:11,868 --> 01:31:15,116
- Where are you headed?
- I'll think about it on the way.

987
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:18,823
We must get out of town.
I'll call you when we get there.

988
01:31:19,243 --> 01:31:20,239
Mom.

989
01:31:20,451 --> 01:31:24,825
- I knew you'd get yourself in trouble!
- Enough already, stop it.

990
01:31:26,284 --> 01:31:30,279
Off you go.
She'll keep wailing until you leave,

991
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,573
and wake everyone up. Go!

992
01:31:35,076 --> 01:31:37,648
- Oh God...
- Calm down, calm down.

993
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:45,034
Dima! Son! My son...

994
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:48,450
- My son...
- Easy, easy, calm down.

995
01:31:48,826 --> 01:31:50,735
Dima...

996
01:32:01,993 --> 01:32:04,198
Good thing we got everyone drunk.

997
01:32:04,743 --> 01:32:06,865
And found all the documents.

998
01:32:08,368 --> 01:32:11,486
In the morning, nobody will
remember a thing.

999
01:32:14,285 --> 01:32:15,529
Yes?

1000
01:32:21,743 --> 01:32:23,118
It's done?

1001
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,940
All clean?

1002
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:33,906
Good. Go home now.

1003
01:32:34,785 --> 01:32:36,528
Get rid of the guns.

1004
01:32:36,993 --> 01:32:40,525
I know they are government-issue,
but we'll write them off.

1005
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:47,449
God forbid they find the bodies and
we get caught over something stupid.

1006
01:32:48,452 --> 01:32:49,447
Bye.

1007
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,405
It's done.

1008
01:33:07,535 --> 01:33:09,408
God forgive us.

1009
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:15,115
God created this life
and made us live it.

1010
01:33:18,077 --> 01:33:20,033
All the documents are here.

1011
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,156
Do it.

1012
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:20,742
My husband is with Polosuhina
right now. Bastard.

1013
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,033
Quit sobbing.

1014
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,699
We'll send her away. Let her shake
her ass somewhere else.

1015
01:34:31,202 --> 01:34:33,526
And send your husband in to see me.

1016
01:34:34,286 --> 01:34:37,320
I'll explain to him how a man
ought to treat his wife.

1017
01:35:22,202 --> 01:35:23,910
Has he calmed down?

1018
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:26,202
He's asleep.

1019
01:35:29,994 --> 01:35:31,488
What happened?

1020
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:36,027
Everything's rotten there, Masha.

1021
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:38,024
Where?

1022
01:35:39,286 --> 01:35:41,361
The administrative board.

1023
01:35:46,536 --> 01:35:48,279
It's a snake pit.

1024
01:35:52,411 --> 01:35:54,237
A bunch of crooks.

1025
01:35:55,953 --> 01:36:00,030
Ready to eat each other alive.
Vampires.

1026
01:36:02,411 --> 01:36:04,782
When they realized
that they fucked up,

1027
01:36:04,953 --> 01:36:06,944
they decided to frame their own.

1028
01:36:09,703 --> 01:36:15,569
They put me, Fedotov
and the fire chief into a police car.

1029
01:36:16,744 --> 01:36:18,950
And drove us to a quiet place.

1030
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,858
Fedotov turned out to be
a decent person

1031
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:33,528
I didn't expect that.

1032
01:36:35,536 --> 01:36:37,575
He stood up for me

1033
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,241
and they let me go.

1034
01:36:58,286 --> 01:37:00,657
So where are we going now?

1035
01:37:04,078 --> 01:37:06,200
We need to get out of town.

1036
01:37:08,578 --> 01:37:10,819
We'll spend the night in a hotel

1037
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:15,620
and think of something
in the morning.

1038
01:37:16,286 --> 01:37:17,910
I promise.

1039
01:37:23,162 --> 01:37:25,034
Well, thank you very much.

1040
01:37:27,078 --> 01:37:29,153
We had a normal life.

1041
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:32,951
What were you thinking?

1042
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,527
I was thinking about
the people, dear.

1043
01:37:37,078 --> 01:37:39,070
And Anton and I are not people?

1044
01:37:40,245 --> 01:37:41,490
There are 800 people there.

1045
01:37:41,662 --> 01:37:43,653
Are all of them your wives
and children?

1046
01:37:43,995 --> 01:37:45,489
- Masha, don't.
- Don't what?

1047
01:37:45,703 --> 01:37:47,944
I didn't know it would end this badly.

1048
01:37:48,537 --> 01:37:52,614
How else could it have ended?

1049
01:37:54,078 --> 01:37:57,492
They've been stealing for years.
They sucked the town dry.

1050
01:37:58,078 --> 01:38:00,284
Did you go there to preach
and open their eyes?

1051
01:38:00,578 --> 01:38:04,075
Did you expect them to start
righting their wrongs?

1052
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,194
Saving people?

1053
01:38:05,453 --> 01:38:08,785
- For them other people do not exist!
- For me they do!

1054
01:38:09,162 --> 01:38:11,035
And I had to try.

1055
01:38:11,912 --> 01:38:14,152
I will not be responsible
for the deaths

1056
01:38:14,329 --> 01:38:15,573
of 800 people, got it?

1057
01:38:16,454 --> 01:38:18,077
I get it.

1058
01:38:20,204 --> 01:38:21,911
I get everything now.

1059
01:38:22,537 --> 01:38:26,235
- I get to suffer because I live with you.
- So don't!

1060
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,120
I'm sorry.

1061
01:38:42,787 --> 01:38:44,162
I'm sorry.

1062
01:38:45,454 --> 01:38:47,990
But I proved to them that
the building will collapse.

1063
01:38:48,162 --> 01:38:51,244
At least they're getting the people
out of there right now.

1064
01:38:51,745 --> 01:38:54,697
Out of where?
There's your dormitory over there.

1065
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:57,111
No one's around -
everyone's asleep!

1066
01:39:29,996 --> 01:39:33,160
What the fuck are you
standing here for? Let's go!

1067
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:36,366
No one is there.
No firemen, no cops.

1068
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:39,737
Say that louder -
maybe they'll appear.

1069
01:39:39,912 --> 01:39:41,703
They were supposed to be here.

1070
01:39:43,954 --> 01:39:46,076
And supposed to do what?

1071
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:50,279
You sound like a kid.
What world do you live in?

1072
01:39:50,621 --> 01:39:53,821
You were almost killed!
Snap out of it and let's go!

1073
01:39:55,746 --> 01:39:57,488
What's the matter with you?

1074
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:02,202
Take Anton and go.

1075
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:08,621
You mean without you?

1076
01:40:09,454 --> 01:40:11,114
Yes, I'm staying.

1077
01:40:14,163 --> 01:40:16,119
Are you leaving us behind?

1078
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:22,158
Masha, I'm not leaving
anyone behind.

1079
01:40:22,538 --> 01:40:25,323
Can't you see? They're not getting
the people out.

1080
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:29,070
- They decided to just leave them there.
- So what?

1081
01:40:31,496 --> 01:40:33,239
Don't make me angry.

1082
01:40:33,954 --> 01:40:36,491
Get in the car and go -
you have a license.

1083
01:40:36,746 --> 01:40:41,286
- What are you doing, you freak?
- Listen to yourself, you idiot.

1084
01:40:42,163 --> 01:40:45,446
There are hundreds
of people in there.

1085
01:40:45,621 --> 01:40:47,198
Have you no heart?

1086
01:40:49,496 --> 01:40:50,694
Dima...

1087
01:40:51,538 --> 01:40:53,115
they're nobodies to us.

1088
01:40:56,913 --> 01:40:58,656
Shut your mouth.

1089
01:41:11,288 --> 01:41:15,781
Masha, dear,
get in the car and leave.

1090
01:41:18,246 --> 01:41:20,818
Don't you see that
I hate you right now?

1091
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,154
Don't you understand?

1092
01:41:28,246 --> 01:41:31,695
We live like animals
and die like animals

1093
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:35,119
because we are nobodies
to each other.

1094
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,074
Tonya...

1095
01:43:18,622 --> 01:43:21,905
Have a drink.
You'll feel better.

1096
01:43:40,164 --> 01:43:43,163
- Why are you here?
- I had to come back.

1097
01:43:43,497 --> 01:43:46,069
Bastard!
Are you out of your mind?

1098
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:50,456
Leave, you hear me?
They'll catch you, you fool!

1099
01:43:50,706 --> 01:43:53,823
- Leave!
- Calm down.

1100
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:02,738
- Why didn't you leave?
- I just couldn't.

1101
01:44:05,289 --> 01:44:06,783
People will die.

1102
01:44:08,622 --> 01:44:11,906
We drove past the dormitory -
nothing is happening.

1103
01:44:14,872 --> 01:44:16,070
They are not evacuating.

1104
01:44:16,247 --> 01:44:18,819
Because it's just
your stupid idea, you fool!

1105
01:44:18,997 --> 01:44:23,490
The administration knows better.
It's not going to collapse!

1106
01:44:23,706 --> 01:44:25,579
Who would want
to be responsible

1107
01:44:25,747 --> 01:44:27,407
for so many deaths?
Fedotov?

1108
01:44:27,581 --> 01:44:29,703
They killed Fedotov!

1109
01:44:41,373 --> 01:44:43,779
Is Galaganova covering
her tracks?

1110
01:44:45,206 --> 01:44:46,664
So what are you going to do?

1111
01:44:49,164 --> 01:44:51,618
If anyone spots me, they'll kill me.

1112
01:44:52,956 --> 01:44:54,829
Do the people
in the dormitory know

1113
01:44:54,998 --> 01:44:56,575
that the building's unstable?

1114
01:44:57,331 --> 01:44:58,529
No.

1115
01:44:59,748 --> 01:45:02,284
So what are you waiting for?
Go tell them.

1116
01:45:02,498 --> 01:45:04,039
Who's gonna listen to me?

1117
01:45:04,289 --> 01:45:06,743
Who wants to be left out
on the street?

1118
01:45:07,081 --> 01:45:08,326
I need an official order.

1119
01:45:08,498 --> 01:45:10,655
The information has
to come from the top.

1120
01:45:10,914 --> 01:45:13,748
Who am I?
I'm just a plumber.

1121
01:45:16,289 --> 01:45:18,328
Are you sure that it will collapse?

1122
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,456
I'm sure.

1123
01:45:31,914 --> 01:45:34,202
Forgive your mother and me, son.

1124
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:38,575
What for, Dad?

1125
01:45:42,456 --> 01:45:44,448
What did we ever give you?

1126
01:45:45,623 --> 01:45:47,033
Life.

1127
01:45:48,206 --> 01:45:52,415
And what are you supposed
to do with this life?

1128
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:58,781
Look at your mom and I -
we argue every day.

1129
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:03,195
There's no love or joy left
between us.

1130
01:46:08,831 --> 01:46:11,535
And we never taught you
how to live.

1131
01:46:14,415 --> 01:46:17,449
We are to blame for everything
that's happened to you.

1132
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:20,955
Stop it, Dad.

1133
01:46:24,873 --> 01:46:27,872
People are stealing
by the truckload.

1134
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,320
By the millions.

1135
01:46:29,706 --> 01:46:33,536
They step over each other
and don't think twice.

1136
01:46:33,707 --> 01:46:36,954
And you repair shitty pipes
for a living.

1137
01:46:37,873 --> 01:46:40,789
You wanted to help,
to save people's lives -

1138
01:46:40,957 --> 01:46:42,747
and they almost killed you.

1139
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:56,658
Leave, son.

1140
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:06,364
Things will never change
around here.

1141
01:47:09,998 --> 01:47:11,871
Never.

1142
01:48:27,957 --> 01:48:31,040
The building is collapsing!
Get outside! Quickly!

1143
01:48:33,457 --> 01:48:35,449
Get outside, hurry!

1144
01:48:43,124 --> 01:48:44,404
Get out of the building.

1145
01:48:44,624 --> 01:48:47,030
- What happened?
- The building is collapsing!

1146
01:48:47,249 --> 01:48:49,490
Quickly! Get out!

1147
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:57,499
Olya, get dressed.
I said, get dressed! Move it!

1148
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:03,493
Get up! Run, outside!
The building is collapsing!

1149
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:14,906
Go outside!

1150
01:50:15,083 --> 01:50:17,868
The building is falling,
you hear me?

1151
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,572
The building is falling.

1152
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:06,782
Oh yeah? Really?

1153
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:09,829
Even I don't drink that much!

1154
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:16,614
The building is falling.

1155
01:51:39,667 --> 01:51:40,865
Let's go.

1156
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:48,455
Anyone here?

1157
01:52:55,084 --> 01:52:58,664
What's all this about?
Is this a set-up?

1158
01:53:07,459 --> 01:53:11,406
Why are you standing here?
Move away!

1159
01:53:11,792 --> 01:53:14,827
The building is collapsing!
Do you understand?

1160
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,661
Listen to me!
If you don't believe me...

1161
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:25,118
Quiet, everyone!
Calm down!

1162
01:53:26,126 --> 01:53:28,829
Here's our hero!

1163
01:53:29,667 --> 01:53:31,873
He's the man!

1164
01:53:32,376 --> 01:53:35,410
- Don't...
- Everything's fine.

1165
01:53:36,167 --> 01:53:40,245
He is so brave!
Look how many people he saved!

1166
01:53:40,417 --> 01:53:42,125
- Stop it...
- Quiet!

1167
01:53:42,334 --> 01:53:45,203
There are decent people
left in this world!

1168
01:53:47,834 --> 01:53:48,997
You're fired!

1169
01:53:49,167 --> 01:53:50,542
He's been sneaking around here.

1170
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:52,617
Since yesterday, stirring
shit up! Get him!

1171
01:54:14,709 --> 01:54:18,953
Go home, everyone!
Everything's fine.

1172
01:54:20,376 --> 01:54:22,332
Don't touch me, you scum!

1173
