1
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,017
Right.

2
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,488
Right. That...

3
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,287
and that.

4
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:42,329
And that is cricket, hon.

5
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,233
Do you want it?

6
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,462
Sure.

7
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,834
Doesn't matter if you don't.

8
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:56,239
You know, I won't be offended.
Jody's never offended.

9
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,245
- What you say your name was?
- Jude.

10
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:02,976
Jude. Why, that suits you, Jude.

11
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,917
- The teddy bear?
- No! Fuck this bear.

12
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,319
The name: Jude.

13
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:12,325
And it is Jude, right?

14
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,530
I gotta piss, Jude.

15
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,623
Over here.

16
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,508
Here. Don't run off, Jude.

17
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,512
You don't know me, do ya?

18
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,014
- What if I did?
- You'd know I wouldn't run off.

19
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,017
Oh!

20
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:46,319
- Never pissed holdin' a girl's hand, Jude.
- Ya didn't?

21
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:49,794
- You know what?
- Tell me, Jody.

22
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,297
It's nice.

23
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,595
Not here.

24
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,606
- Who gives a fuck?
- Ya never know.

25
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,767
I never know nothing.

26
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:06,779
- People. They could be lookin'.
- Let 'em look.

27
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,642
- Come and get me, soldier.
- Whatever you say, Jude.

28
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,028
What the fuck--

29
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,366
Get off. Get off.

30
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,906
Get it on! Get it on.

31
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:13,446
Come on!

32
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,953
Jude!

33
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,570
So, what's your name, soldier?

34
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:41,130
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

35
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,582
The situation is simple.

36
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,958
You're being held hostage
by the Irish Republican Army.

37
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:40,159
They've got one of our senior members
under interrogation in Castlereagh.

38
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:44,295
We've informed 'em that if they don't
release him within three days...

39
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,272
you'll be shot.

40
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,801
You'll be treated as our guest
until further developments.

41
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,777
Have you anything to say?

42
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,544
Give him a cup of tea.

43
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,713
You want a cup of tea?

44
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,001
Thanks, Jude.

45
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,005
See does he want some.

46
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,575
Do you want some food?

47
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,417
Hey.

48
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:40,358
What's he like?

49
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,294
Horny bastard.

50
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,663
Did you give him it?

51
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,968
There're certain things
I wouldn't do for my country.

52
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,672
Have a look at him.

53
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,748
Can't.

54
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,081
Poke him or somethin'.
See if he's still alive.

55
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:11,181
- He's all right.
- Hasn't moved for twelve hours.

56
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,257
Go on. Have a heart.

57
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,780
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!

58
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,716
You fucking whore!

59
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,721
You fucking whore!

60
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,223
Give me a knife!
I'll cut his fuckin' heart out!

61
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,794
Give me a knife! Jesus!

62
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,599
You all right?

63
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,370
- Fuckin' animal.
- Come on, Jude.

64
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:07,174
What do you mean "Come on"?
I had him all over me!

65
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,648
Yeah.

66
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:15,654
- Tough work, that.
- Well, someone's gotta do it.

67
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:20,156
Nah, it was a breeze.

68
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:23,788
I just thought of you.

69
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,800
- You know what, Fergus?
- What?

70
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,463
One of you made me want it.

71
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,006
Which one?

72
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:47,620
Hold it there. To your left.

73
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,958
Walk on. It's okay.

74
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,290
Around, around to your left.

75
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,996
Gonna open the door.

76
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,437
Move to your left.

77
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,805
Walk in. That's it.

78
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,847
Listen, soldier, you should eat somethin'.

79
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,510
- Can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

80
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:22,715
I can't eat through a canvas bag.

81
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,125
Okay. Okay.

82
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,131
Here.

83
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,928
Fuckin' hell, man! This is a farce!

84
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,273
- How is it a farce?
- I seen your fucking face!

85
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,246
So, what do I look like?

86
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:53,343
You're the one about 5' 10"
with the killer smile...

87
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,581
and the baby face.

88
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,283
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

89
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:02,294
And the brown eyes.

90
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,364
You're the handsome one.

91
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,532
- Thank you, handsome.
- My pleasure.

92
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,543
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.

93
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:32,217
Be a Christian, will ya?

94
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,220
Tell him to take the hood off, honey.

95
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,629
How'd you know it was her?

96
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,567
I can smell her perfume.

97
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:47,107
See, if we took the hood off,
we'd have to shoot you.

98
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,006
As it is, you got a fifty-fifty chance.

99
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,476
I thought you liked me, you bitch.

100
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,811
It was fun while it lasted.

101
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,146
Nice lady.

102
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:05,091
Please, man. I'm suffocatin' in here.
Take it off.

103
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:10,323
- Can we not take it off?
- Have to check with himself.

104
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,227
Here. You mind him.

105
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,804
Don't leave me with her, man!

106
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:21,534
She's dangerous!

107
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,081
Peter? Can I take the prisoner's hood off?

108
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,083
Why do you want to do that?

109
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,415
- Poor whore's suffocatin' in the heat.
- So?

110
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,011
- Anyway, he's seen our faces.
- He's seen your face.

111
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:40,184
Yeah, and he saw Jude as well. Peter--

112
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,524
If you don't mind him seein', I don't mind;

113
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,531
- but you're the only one he looks at.
- Right. Thanks.

114
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:48,534
It's your decision.

115
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:57,100
- Leave him to me, Jude.
- My pleasure.

116
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,468
Thank you, soldier.

117
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,545
Never thought fresh air
would taste this good.

118
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:40,016
Now, if you loose up my hands,
I could feed myself.

119
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,953
No fuckin' way.

120
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:46,117
I'm only joking.

121
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:51,225
You know, I was wrong about one thing.

122
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:55,132
- And what's that?
- You're no pinup.

123
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,966
- No?
- No. You're not handsome at all.

124
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:02,008
- Are you tryin' to hurt my feelings?
- No.

125
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:06,443
- It's the truth.
- I could say the same thing about you.

126
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,981
- Could you?
- But I won't.

127
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:14,988
- We're more polite around these parts.
- So I've noticed.

128
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:20,751
- Hey.
- What is it now?

129
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,694
You're gonna have to do it, aren't you?

130
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:28,359
- Do what?
- Kill me.

131
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:31,336
What makes you think that?

132
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,498
They're not gonna let that guy out...

133
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,372
and you're gonna have to kill me.

134
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,742
- They'll let him out.
- You want to bet?

135
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,214
- I'm not a gamblin' man.
- And even if they do...

136
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:46,081
you can't just let me loose.

137
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:49,246
- Why can't we?
- Not your nature.

138
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,256
What do you know about my nature?

139
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,952
I'm talkin' 'bout your people, not you.

140
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,895
What the fuck do you know about my people?

141
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,229
Only that you're all tough,
undeluded motherfuckers...

142
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,361
and it's not in your nature to let me go!

143
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:08,373
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

144
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,315
Here.

145
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,510
You know a funny thing?

146
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:23,716
- No. What's the funny thing?
- I didn't even fancy her.

147
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,759
Didn't look like that to me.

148
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,954
She's not my type.

149
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,395
No?

150
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,195
No.

151
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,898
- Come here.
- No.

152
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,564
Come here.

153
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,609
I wanna show you something.

154
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,407
- What?
- My inside pocket.

155
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,960
Take out my wallet.

156
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,458
Open it.

157
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,336
Inside there's a picture.

158
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,001
No, not that one.

159
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,011
There's another.

160
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,975
Now, she's my type.

161
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,447
- She'd be anybody's type.
- Don't you think of it, fucker.

162
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,458
- Why not?
- She's mine.

163
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,858
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

164
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:40,423
- No?
- Absolutely not.

165
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,697
Is she your wife?

166
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,637
I guess you could say that.

167
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,473
- You make a nice couple.
- Don't I know it.

168
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,479
So what were you fuckin' around for then?

169
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,606
You fuckers set me up.

170
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,582
That-- That bitch.

171
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,590
She's a friend of mine.

172
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,687
Okay. That nice lady.

173
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,595
She meets me in a bar.

174
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,526
I'm thinkin' to myself:

175
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:19,731
"What the fuck am I doin' here anyway?"

176
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,400
- What the fuck were you doin' here?
- I got sent.

177
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,205
- You could've said no.
- Can't once I signed up.

178
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,748
- Why did you sign up?
- It was a job.

179
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,908
Ah, yeah, a job.

180
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,612
So I get sent to
the one place in the world...

181
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,450
where they call you "nigger" to your face.

182
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,024
Shouldn't take it personally.

183
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:45,593
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger."

184
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,226
There's no use tellin' 'em
I come from Tottenham.

185
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:53,238
- And you like cricket?
- Best game in the world.

186
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,365
Ever see hurling?

187
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,342
That game where a bunch of paddies
whack sticks at each other?

188
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,209
- Best game in the world. The fastest.
- Never.

189
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:04,842
Well, in Antigua, cricket's
the black man's game.

190
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,853
Kids play it from the age of two.

191
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:11,015
My dad had me throwin' googlies
from the age of five.

192
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:14,184
Then we moved to Tottenham
and it was somethin' different.

193
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,922
- How was it different?
- Toffs' game there.

194
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,659
But not at home.

195
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,203
So, when you come to shoot me, Paddy...

196
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,934
remember you're gettin' rid
of a shit-hot bowler.

197
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:34,507
I'll bear it in mind.

198
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,517
Oh, and by the way...

199
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:44,180
it's not "Paddy." It's Fergus.

200
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,852
Nice to meet you, Fergus.

201
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,363
My pleasure, Jody.

202
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,107
Stay. Wait. Wait!

203
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,573
Take it easy now. Just go slow.
Down by that tree.

204
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,580
Tree. Tree.

205
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,547
Right.

206
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:18,724
- You gotta loosen my hands.
- Can't.

207
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,885
Can't?

208
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,829
Then you're gonna have to take my dick
out for me, aren't you?

209
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:31,370
Come on, man! I'm gonna wet my pants.

210
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,712
Take the fucker out, man. I'm dying.

211
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,522
I gotta lean forwards,
or dribble all over myself.

212
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,964
Would you hold my hands for me?

213
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,377
Now, that is worth waiting for.

214
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:18,247
- Hurry up, will ya?
- These things take time, Fergus.

215
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:22,048
It's amazing how these small details...

216
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:26,023
take on such importance, isn't it?

217
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:28,822
Now put it back in.

218
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:34,400
- Give us a break.
- I can't do it!

219
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,402
It's only a piece of meat.

220
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,962
For fuck's sake,
it's got no major diseases!

221
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,515
Thank you.

222
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,046
I had a case of the clap two years ago.

223
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,987
- Crabs in Ulster.
- Shut up, will ya!

224
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,991
But, all in all, it served me pretty well.

225
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,722
- Get inside, will ya?
- I didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

226
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,936
Fergus.

227
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:14,097
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

228
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:18,701
I-- I know that wasn't very easy for you.

229
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:22,873
The pleasure was all mine.

230
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,554
Oh, no, it was mine.

231
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:33,023
Believe me, it was my pleasure.

232
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,863
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin', man.

233
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,593
He just took me out for a pee.

234
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,636
Put the fuckin' hood on him.

235
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,205
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothin'.

236
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,544
He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.

237
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,551
When you're on duty
you'll keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

238
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,885
- Go on and get some sleep.
- Yeah, get some sleep.

239
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:24,408
Did he talk?

240
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,548
Didn't make you laugh?

241
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,041
Here, have some breakfast.

242
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,381
Good morning, Fergus.

243
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,922
- So, he knows your name?
- Yeah, I told him.

244
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,117
Are you all there? Come here.

245
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,196
I said come here!

246
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,992
Back in a minute, Jody.

247
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,099
You'll have minimum contact
with that prisoner!

248
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,368
Yeah, okay.

249
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,670
- You know why?
- Why?

250
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:02,237
Because tomorrow we might
have to shoot him, that's why.

251
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:17,489
They givin' you trouble, Fergus?

252
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,531
It happens.

253
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:22,534
There's two kinds of people:

254
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:26,538
those who give and those who take.

255
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:31,210
Take off the hood, man.

256
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,080
It's okay.

257
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:40,218
I understand.

258
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,847
Don't mind if I prattle on, do you?

259
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:51,625
I take it by your silence that you don't.

260
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,632
Two types, Fergus:

261
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:58,568
the scorpion and the frog.

262
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:01,004
Ever heard of 'em?

263
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,876
A scorpion wants to cross the river,
but he can't swim.

264
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:12,543
Goes to a frog who can and asks for a ride.

265
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:16,053
Frog says,
"If I give you a ride on my back...

266
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,556
you'll go and sting me."

267
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:22,116
Scorpion replies, "It would not be
in my interest to sting you...

268
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:25,891
since, as I'll be on your back,
we both would drown."

269
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,560
Frog thinks about this logic for a while
and accepts the deal.

270
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:34,265
Takes the scorpion on his back,
braves the waters...

271
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:39,471
halfway over feels a burning spear
in his side...

272
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,913
and realizes the scorpion
has stung him after all.

273
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:48,215
And as they both sink beneath the waves...

274
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,222
the frog cries out...

275
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,760
"Why'd you sting me Mr. Scorpion?

276
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:59,594
For now we both will drown."

277
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:03,635
Scorpion replies...

278
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:08,970
"I can't help it. It's in my nature."

279
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,545
So what's that supposed to mean?

280
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,775
Means what it says.

281
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:23,220
A scorpion does what is in its nature.

282
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,387
Take off the hood, man.

283
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:35,434
- Why?
- 'Cause you're kind...

284
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,437
and it's in your nature.

285
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:59,189
See? I was right about you.

286
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,261
Don't be so sure.

287
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,592
Jody's always right.

288
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:12,030
Where would you most like to be now, man?

289
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:16,598
- Doesn't matter where.
- Come on, man.

290
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:21,271
If this shit was all over.

291
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,110
Havin' a pint in the Rock.

292
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,121
You lack imagination, Fergus.

293
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:34,091
Think of something more... alluring.

294
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,788
Like what?

295
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,491
Like... havin' a pint in the Metro.

296
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,103
- Havin' two pints in the Rock.
- Havin' a pint in the Metro...

297
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,733
and Dil's havin' a margarita.

298
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:53,472
- Who's Dil?
- Special friend.

299
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,707
Oh, yeah.

300
00:26:55,815 --> 00:27:00,980
- We got simple tastes, you and me.
- Yup, the best.

301
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:05,419
But you guys never get a break, do you?

302
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:08,323
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

303
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:12,125
We do a tour of duty and we're finished.

304
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:15,133
But you guys are never finished, are you?

305
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:19,171
We don't look on it that way.

306
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,604
Often wonder how you do it.

307
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,302
It depends what you believe in.

308
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,208
- What do you believe in?
- That you guys shouldn't be here.

309
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,178
- That simple?
- Yeah.

310
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,581
- Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
- He's hot!

311
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,214
Doesn't matter if he's hot.
Just cover the fucker up.

312
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,418
You got no feelings, woman!

313
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:44,429
You shut your face!

314
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,796
- You're headed for trouble, Fergus.
- Okay, okay.

315
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:53,566
He's a good soldier--

316
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:57,268
I said shut the fuck up.

317
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:02,110
- He believes in the future.
- Is that right?

318
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:32,311
Is it bad?

319
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,313
Not bad.

320
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,445
Women are trouble.

321
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,886
- Do you know that, Fergus?
- I didn't.

322
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:48,226
Some kinds of women are.

323
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:51,559
She can't help it.

324
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:59,895
Dil, she was no trouble, no trouble at all.

325
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:05,276
- You liked her?
- Present tense, please, please.

326
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,440
Love her...

327
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,541
wherever she is.

328
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:19,423
I'm thinkin' of her now.
Would you think of her too?

329
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,458
I don't know her.

330
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:25,622
I want you to do something for me.

331
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,529
What?

332
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:31,570
- If they kill me--
- Don't think that way.

333
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,172
But they will...

334
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,175
as sure as night follows day.

335
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,745
They have to.

336
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:43,247
I want you to find her out.

337
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,807
Tell her I was thinkin' of her.

338
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,686
- See if she's all right.
- I don't know her.

339
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,056
Take her picture. It's--

340
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,187
Come here. It's in my inside pocket.

341
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,901
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

342
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:11,340
I told you not to talk that way.

343
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:16,143
Go to Millies Hair Salon in Spittalfields.

344
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,218
Take her to the Metro for a margarita.

345
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,050
You don't have to tell her who you are.

346
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,350
You just tell her
Jody was thinkin' of her--

347
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,685
Stop it.

348
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,632
Volunteer?

349
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:50,409
We need you inside.

350
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,294
We've heard word.

351
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:12,894
They've used every trick in the book
and he's beginnin' to talk.

352
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:17,273
You're gonna have to do it in the mornin'.

353
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,781
You okay about that?

354
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,747
- I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
- Good.

355
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,879
Beginnin' to have me doubts
about you the past few days.

356
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,889
- Not the only one.
- Shut up, Jude.

357
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,019
Better get some sleep tonight, Fergus.

358
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:40,929
- Peter.
- What?

359
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,695
Request permission to guard
the prisoner tonight.

360
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:46,465
- You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
- Shut the fuck up, Jude.

361
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:52,408
- What do you want to do that for?
- It would make me feel better about it.

362
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:56,039
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

363
00:31:57,517 --> 00:32:01,977
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.

364
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:16,261
- Don't.
- I-- I'm sorry.

365
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,442
Help me.

366
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:30,940
- How can I?
- I don't know.

367
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,918
I don't know.

368
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:38,116
Just help me.

369
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,354
Give me a cigarette.

370
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,683
I don't even-- I don't even smoke.

371
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:12,588
Thought it was the right thing to do.

372
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:29,397
- Go to sleep now.
- I don't want to sleep.

373
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,534
Tell me something.

374
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:35,842
- What?
- A story.

375
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:39,042
- Like the one about the frog?
- And the scorpion?

376
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,813
No. No.

377
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,586
Tell me anything.

378
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,593
- "When I was a child...
- Yeah?

379
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:56,592
"I thought as a child.

380
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,603
But when I became a man...

381
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,402
I put away childish things."

382
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,946
What does that mean?

383
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,845
Nothing.

384
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,350
Nothing?

385
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,979
Tell me something.

386
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,990
Anything.

387
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:29,833
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?

388
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,699
Me?

389
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:39,568
No.

390
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,204
I'm not good for much.

391
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,145
Come on, stand up.

392
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:18,681
Turn to your right.

393
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:23,414
Okay, step up. One step.

394
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,783
Okay, turn to your right.

395
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,793
Go forward. Step up.

396
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:39,028
Now to the left.

397
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,005
I wish to say on behalf of
the Irish Republican Army--

398
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,442
Leave him be!

399
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,262
Take the hood off, Fergus.

400
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:06,194
No.

401
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,564
I want to see you a bit, please. Please.

402
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,572
Don't make me die like an animal.

403
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:29,917
I'm glad you're doin' it.

404
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,320
Do you know that, Fergus?

405
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:36,657
- Why?
- 'Cause you're my friend.

406
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:41,665
- And I want you to go to the Metro.
- Stop that talk now!

407
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,896
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

408
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:47,199
The fastest.

409
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,604
- Faster than cricket?
- Cricket's in the ha'penny place.

410
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,201
So if I ran, there's no way
I could beat you, is there?

411
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,679
- You won't run!
- But if I did...

412
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:59,080
you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back.

413
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:00,550
Jody!

414
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,848
- You stupid bastard!
- What'd you say, faster?

415
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:08,586
- I said you bastard! Stop!
- Gotta catch me first.

416
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,855
Used to run the mile, you know,

417
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,590
four times around the cricket pitch.

418
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,099
- What was that game called?
- Hurling!

419
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,362
- What? What?
- Hurling!

420
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,470
Told you I was fast, huh?

421
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,214
Don't do it.

422
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,321
Jody!

423
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:47,591
All line up! Follow me!

424
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,309
Over here now!

425
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,905
Jude! Run!

426
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,879
Fergus.

427
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,977
You're back on the bike, Tommy?

428
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,922
- How're ya keepin'?
- All right.

429
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:52,930
- And notice I've asked you nothin'.
- That's wise, Tommy.

430
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:57,025
All right then. I like bein' wise.

431
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:03,167
So what do you need, Fergus?

432
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:06,608
- Need to go across the water.
- Do ya now?

433
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,203
Need to lose myself for a while.

434
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:12,045
Aye.

435
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:16,554
There's a man I know
ships cattle to London.

436
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:49,746
We're closing.

437
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,950
You deaf?

438
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:56,215
- I'll see you tomorrow, Dil.
- 'Night.

439
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:59,780
- Want something in particular?
- Just a bit of a trim.

440
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:02,053
Come on.

441
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,542
- Someone recommended you?
- In a way.

442
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:27,278
- Who?
- A guy I work with.

443
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:31,117
- What's his name?
- Does the water not get to your nails?

444
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:34,420
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

445
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,055
- You American?
- No.

446
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,997
- You're not English.
- No.

447
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:45,400
- Scottish?
- How'd you guess?

448
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:49,736
- The accent, I suppose.
- Oh. What's it like?

449
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:53,204
Like treacle.

450
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:58,381
Nice laugh.

451
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:09,817
There. That should make her happy.

452
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,625
- Who's "she"?
- Don't know. Who is "she"?

453
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:53,702
- Hi, Dil.
- Hi ya, hon.

454
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:56,331
- All right?
- I suppose.

455
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,544
- Yes? What'll it be?
- Bottle of Guinness.

456
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,584
Bottle of Guinness.

457
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,851
- See that, Col?
- See what, Dil?

458
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:13,550
- He gave me a look.
- Did he?

459
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:16,059
- I just cut his hair, you know.
- Yeah?

460
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:20,393
- So what do you think?
- Nice.

461
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,699
There. He did it again.

462
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:29,365
- I saw that one. That was a look.
- What would you call that?

463
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,000
Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.

464
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,205
She wants to know do you want
to know what she's drinking.

465
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,282
A margarita.

466
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,955
Now he can look.

467
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,159
Ask him does he like his hair, Col.

468
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:56,098
She wants to know, sir,
do you like your hair.

469
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:59,830
- Tell her I'm very happy with it.
- He's Scottish, Col.

470
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:02,839
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

471
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,967
- What he say?
- He agreed that he was.

472
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:09,411
And what do you think his name might be?

473
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:11,949
I have no thoughts on the subject.

474
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,245
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy?

475
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:16,651
Jimmy. That's what he said.

476
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:19,121
Hi ya, Jimmy.

477
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,283
Hi, Dil.

478
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,588
- Sing us a song, Dil.
- Fuck off, Dave.

479
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,293
Come on, babe. You know what I like.

480
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,496
Easy!

481
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:44,644
- Shit.
- Where d'you think you're goin'?

482
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,742
Piss off, Dave. Get off my case!

483
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,753
Fuckin' cow!

484
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:06,434
- Go on, get in there!
- Stop pushing.

485
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,802
This is the last time.

486
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,347
- One run!
- Come on!

487
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,792
So, Pat's a cricket fan, is he?

488
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,730
It's not Pat. It's Jim.

489
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:12,133
I don't actually give a fuck
whether it's Jim, Pat or Mick...

490
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,933
as long as you remember
you're not at Lords, all right?

491
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:25,682
Here, love.

492
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:29,982
- So, I see you're a regular, sir.
- Is that good or bad?

493
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:34,886
Well, you get to say, "The usual, Col,"
things like that.

494
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:44,132
- Here. Let's call this the usual.
- Thanks.

495
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:47,103
- No, no. It's on me.
- Thanks very much.

496
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,166
You can take it out if you want.

497
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,981
Came to see her, didn't you?

498
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,744
Listen, there's something
I should tell you. She's--

499
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:03,548
- She's what?
- She's on.

500
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:07,643
- He's still looking, Col.
- Persistent.

501
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:10,772
- Good thing in a man.
- An excellent quality.

502
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,612
- Maybe he wants something.
- I expect he does.

503
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:17,552
- Ask him.
- Ask him yourself.

504
00:49:17,656 --> 00:49:20,625
So tell me.

505
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:23,319
- Everybody wants something.
- Not me.

506
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,396
Not you? How quaint.

507
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:29,024
How old-fashioned and quaint,
isn't it, Col?

508
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,568
- You old-fashioned?
- Must be.

509
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,934
- Got the money, Dil?
- Fuck off, Dave.

510
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,701
- You fuckin' promised.
- Did I?

511
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:40,175
You fucking did! Well, didn't you?

512
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,836
Well, come on!

513
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,484
It takes all types.

514
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:51,779
- So who's he?
- He's what she should run a mile from.

515
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:54,992
Then why doesn't she?

516
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,288
Who knows the secrets of the human heart?

517
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:11,972
All right, good night.

518
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:13,476
You can't come in here, love.

519
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,811
- Don't be like that.
- You heard me.

520
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:26,390
We're fuckin' grand all of a sudden, eh?

521
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:30,188
- Talk to me, you stupid bitch!
- Piss off, Dave.

522
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:31,785
Hi.

523
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,227
Hi. You forgot your bag.

524
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,632
- Thank you. Jimmy.
- Who the fuck's he?

525
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:40,705
- It's him, isn't it?
- Maybe.

526
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:48,909
- See, they get the wrong idea.
- Cunt.

527
00:50:49,014 --> 00:50:51,642
- What was that?
- They all get the wrong idea.

528
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,514
- Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt!
- Charming.

529
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,678
- What'll I do?
- Break his neck.

530
00:50:57,756 --> 00:50:59,189
No, don't.

531
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:02,192
He's gonna take his foot off
slowly, David...

532
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:05,855
and you're to go home
like a good boy, you hear?

533
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:08,159
Cunt.

534
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,994
Come on, honey.

535
00:51:17,676 --> 00:51:22,079
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

536
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,580
What was all that about?

537
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:27,584
He wants me to perform for him.

538
00:51:27,686 --> 00:51:31,486
- Perform?
- You know.

539
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,491
- You on the game?
- God, no.

540
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:37,494
I'm a hairdresser.

541
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:40,531
He's gettin' up.

542
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:45,160
Can't leave me then, can you?

543
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:03,019
- You want me to ask you in, right?
- No. Didn't say that.

544
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:07,182
But I'm not cheap, you know that?
Loud, but never cheap.

545
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:13,524
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt!

546
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:19,029
If you kiss me,
it would really get his goat.

547
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:35,853
Now, if you ask me to meet you tomorrow...

548
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:39,822
it would really drive him insane.

549
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:44,122
- Where?
- Half-five at Millies.

550
00:52:58,977 --> 00:53:00,569
Give me that look again.

551
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,581
- What look?
- The one you gave me in the Metro.

552
00:53:09,054 --> 00:53:11,955
Darling, you shouldn't have.

553
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:16,792
- What's that about?
- They're jealous.

554
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:20,888
- Why?
- I wonder.

555
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:37,913
Now's the time you
meant to do something, isn't it?

556
00:53:38,016 --> 00:53:41,452
- Like what?
- Make a pass or something.

557
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:45,455
- Isn't that the way it goes?
- Must be.

558
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:53,392
- Have you got a special friend, Jimmy?
- How special?

559
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:57,059
- Do you want one?
- Christ!

560
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,701
Jesus.

561
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,769
- That Dave?
- The things a girl has to put up with.

562
00:54:07,879 --> 00:54:11,280
I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like him.

563
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,654
Piss off, Dave!

564
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:22,484
Tough guy, huh?

565
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:25,495
Are you gonna be all right on your own?

566
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,862
But I'm not on my own, am I?

567
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:42,105
It won't hurt you to come in.

568
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,441
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

569
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:51,420
- What'll it be?
- Uh, whiskey.

570
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:58,692
Yeah! Hey!

571
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:02,062
- Come on, Dil!
- Somebody out there.

572
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:04,362
Jesus fucking Christ.

573
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:07,402
Hey, Dil!

574
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,699
- Hey, Stirling fucking Moss!
- It's Dave!

575
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:16,406
- Come on, Dil, talk to me!
- Sure, Dave.

576
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:19,142
Come on! Hey, Dil--

577
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,219
- Hey, they're my clothes!
- Take your clothes...

578
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,154
- Don't throw my clothes out the window!
- and fuck off...

579
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:29,192
- back to Essex!
- Fuckin' mad!

580
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:32,525
Don't chuck my clothes out!

581
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,836
Take your fucking goldfish too!

582
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:42,464
My fuckin' fish!

583
00:55:46,578 --> 00:55:47,840
Murderer!

584
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,250
Sorry.

585
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:58,454
How does he drive with his neck in a brace?

586
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,456
Must be in love to manage that.

587
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:03,925
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.

588
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,691
- Did he live here with you?
- He tried to.

589
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,367
Sit down, will you?

590
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:15,337
What about him?

591
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,533
He was different.

592
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:21,043
How different?

593
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:24,637
As different as it's possible to be.

594
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:27,377
Tell me about him.

595
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,385
No.

596
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:34,925
Shouldn't I go?

597
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:36,994
Yes.

598
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,414
No.

599
00:57:00,018 --> 00:57:03,510
Did you do that to him?

600
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:07,148
- You want to know how I kissed him?
- Yes.

601
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:11,319
- Are you jealous?
- Maybe.

602
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,697
That's good.

603
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:12,748
What would he think?

604
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:16,657
He can't think. He's dead.

605
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:25,360
In Ireland. He was a soldier.
Went there like a fool.

606
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,928
- Do you miss him?
- What do you think?

607
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:35,907
- I think you do.
- You say that like a gentleman.

608
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:39,006
- Do I?
- Like you're concerned.

609
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:51,118
You can't stay. You know that.

610
00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:53,857
Didn't think I could.

611
00:58:53,965 --> 00:58:55,865
Real gentleman.

612
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,937
- Shouldn't you be in mourning?
- I am.

613
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,037
- Look, Dil, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off, Dave.

614
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,110
No, I won't fucking fuck off.

615
00:59:40,211 --> 00:59:43,271
- I said I'm sorry, didn't I?
- Yeah. I heard.

616
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:45,281
You hear, Jimmy?

617
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:50,616
I was only gonna ask her for a dance.

618
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,621
Shall we?

619
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,533
Did he come here too?

620
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:08,332
- Is this an obsession of yours?
- Maybe.

621
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,464
He did, sometimes.

622
01:00:10,575 --> 01:00:12,907
Did he dance with you?

623
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,844
What do you want with me, Jimmy?

624
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:19,883
- I want to look after you.
- What does that mean?

625
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,844
It's something I heard someone say once.

626
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:27,083
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

627
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:29,557
Why?

628
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,691
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

629
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:02,451
You're not havin' me on, are you?

630
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,721
'Cause Dil can't stand that.

631
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:08,256
No.

632
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:11,130
She does get very upset.

633
01:01:38,496 --> 01:01:40,487
One for him too.

634
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,029
Drink.

635
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:49,072
- What is this?
- I'm superstitious. Drink.

636
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:55,744
- Can't leave me now.
- Aha.

637
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:58,644
The thing is, can you go the distance?

638
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:02,082
- Depends what it is.
- Depends on nothing.

639
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,783
In one.

640
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,935
What you thinkin' of, hon?

641
01:02:21,339 --> 01:02:24,331
- I'm thinkin' of your man.
- Why?

642
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:27,002
I'm wonderin' why you keep his things.

643
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:29,272
I told you.

644
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,405
I'm superstitious.

645
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,743
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?

646
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:39,584
All the time.

647
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,352
Even now.

648
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,725
- What do you mean?
- He looks after me.

649
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,230
He's a gentleman too.

650
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,211
Wait just one minute.

651
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:44,750
Would he have minded?

652
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,374
You did know, didn't you?

653
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:09,909
Oh, my God.

654
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,541
Jesus, I feel sick.

655
01:04:16,187 --> 01:04:18,781
Don't go, Jimmy! Oh!

656
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,383
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

657
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,939
What were doing in the bar
if you didn't know?

658
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:42,245
Oh, I'm bleeding.

659
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,046
It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.

660
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:55,091
Just not on the face.

661
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,695
See, I'm not a young thing any longer.

662
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:06,629
Funny the way things go.

663
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,103
Don't you find that, Jimmy?

664
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,197
Never the way you expect it.

665
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:18,445
I'm sorry.

666
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:21,814
You mean that? Don't go! Say something!

667
01:05:26,557 --> 01:05:28,457
Jesus.

668
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:20,641
- He's back, Col.

669
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,412
Hi.

670
01:06:23,514 --> 01:06:25,414
Don't want any of those looks, Col.
They don't mean much.

671
01:06:25,516 --> 01:06:28,508
- Stop it, Dil!
- No! Tell him to go fuck himself!.

672
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,746
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself!.

673
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:32,823
- I'm sorry.
- Tell him to stop messin' Dil around!

674
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:34,754
- Dil!
- Tell him it hurts.

675
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:38,590
- I've got to talk to her, Col.
- He says he's got to talk to you.

676
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:40,095
- Come on, Dil.
- Where?

677
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,097
Tell him again, Col, go fuck himself!.

678
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:30,077
- Come here, darlin'!
- Hey! Hey!

679
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:44,918
Off you go.

680
01:07:47,598 --> 01:07:50,362
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?

681
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,367
200 quid, Mr. Deveroux.

682
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:56,599
Well, your bloody Pat
has just cost me 200 quid.

683
01:07:56,707 --> 01:07:57,901
Sorry.

684
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:00,374
Sorry isn't gonna bring
the bloody thing back, is it?

685
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,741
- Not in my experience.
- No.

686
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,847
- Off his wages.
- Do you mean that?

687
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:11,285
He wants to know whether
I mean it, Mr. Franknum.

688
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:12,878
I'm sure you do.

689
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,890
Bloody right I do.

690
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,753
Well, is that Pat's tart?

691
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:22,298
- Does Pat have a tart?
- She's not a tart.

692
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,392
- No, of course not. She's a lady.
- No, she's not that either.

693
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:43,015
Darlin'. Never let the sun
go down on an argument...

694
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,851
- as Jody used to say.
- What are you doing here?

695
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,948
Got your note.

696
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,254
- So let's kiss and make up, honey.
- Don't call me that.

697
01:08:51,362 --> 01:08:53,057
- Sorry, darling.
- Stop it, Dil.

698
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,154
Apologies, my sweet.

699
01:08:58,369 --> 01:09:01,532
That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

700
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:10,678
You're somethin' else, Dil. You know that?

701
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:13,215
Never said a truer word.

702
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,751
I was always best lookin' after someone.

703
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:19,186
- Must be something in the genes.
- Must be.

704
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:21,450
And the fact that you didn't know...

705
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,458
is basically the fault of yours truly.

706
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,758
And even when you were throwin' up,
I could tell you cared.

707
01:09:27,865 --> 01:09:32,029
- You could?
- Do you care, Jimmy?

708
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:35,003
Yeah. Sure I do.

709
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:37,903
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

710
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,873
I care, Dil.

711
01:09:44,148 --> 01:09:45,513
Are you crying?

712
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:55,084
I'm tired and emotional.

713
01:09:56,627 --> 01:10:00,222
- Do it on your own time, Pat.
- What?

714
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,355
Whatever it is she does for you.

715
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:04,434
If I was her, I'd consider that an insult.

716
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:09,234
Consider it how you like.
Just get the bloody tart out of here!

717
01:10:11,275 --> 01:10:14,574
Didja ever pick your teeth up
with broken fingers?

718
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,611
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A simple question.

719
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:28,019
- Come on, dear.
- He didn't answer, honey.

720
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:33,824
Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

721
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:36,798
- My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
- Shut up.

722
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,767
- Made me feel all funny inside.
- I said stop it.

723
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:42,600
Ask to meet me again, Jimmy.

724
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:46,767
- Do you think that's wise?
- Nothing's wise.

725
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:51,246
- I didn't mean to hit you.
- I know that.

726
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:55,011
- I kinda liked you as a girl.
- That's a start.

727
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,179
- So, I'm sorry.
- So, make it up to me, then.

728
01:10:58,288 --> 01:11:00,848
- How?
- Ask to meet me again.

729
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:06,788
- Will you meet me again?
- When?

730
01:11:06,897 --> 01:11:09,422
Whenever.

731
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:11,433
Tonight.

732
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:27,208
- Good night.
- See ya later.

733
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:31,349
- Do they know?
- Know what, honey?

734
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,979
Know what I didn't know--

735
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,024
- And don't call me that.
- Can't help it.

736
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,151
- A girl has her feelings.
- Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.

737
01:11:38,262 --> 01:11:40,856
- Details, baby, details.
- So they do know.

738
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,961
- All right, they do.
- Don't.

739
01:11:46,837 --> 01:11:49,465
- I shoulda known, shouldn't I?
- Probably.

740
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:53,134
- Kinda wish I didn't.
- You can always pretend.

741
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,211
Ah, that's true.

742
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,780
Your soldier knew, didn't he?

743
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,646
Absolutely.

744
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:04,516
Won't be quite the same, though, will it?

745
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,316
Are you pretendin' yet?

746
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,323
I'm workin' on it.

747
01:12:11,128 --> 01:12:13,187
There's Dave.

748
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:16,095
- He knew too.
- Stop it, Jimmy.

749
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,397
Am I becoming repetitious?

750
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:21,403
- A little.
- Sorry.

751
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:26,405
- No, don't ask me in.
- Please, Jimmy.

752
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:30,810
No. Can't pretend that much.

753
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:33,644
- I miss you, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

754
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,651
- Shoulda stayed a girl.
- Don't be cruel.

755
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:42,287
Okay.

756
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,519
Be a good girl. Go inside.

757
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,188
Only if you kiss me.

758
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:03,144
- Now are you happy?
- Delirious.

759
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:17,626
Hello, stranger.

760
01:13:19,363 --> 01:13:21,263
You vanished.

761
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,566
What was it, Fergus?
Did you blow the gaff on us...

762
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:28,069
or did you just fuck up?

763
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,730
Leave me alone, Jude.

764
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:34,402
No. That's the last thing I'll do.

765
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:47,084
- You never asked what happened.
- I heard.

766
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,489
- Eddie and Tinker died.
- I know.

767
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:53,028
Maguire and me got out
by the skin of our teeth--

768
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,597
No thanks to you.

769
01:13:57,367 --> 01:14:00,029
What do you think of my hair?

770
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:02,731
- Suits you.
- Aye.

771
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:06,468
I was sick of bein' a blonde.

772
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:10,068
I needed a tougher look,
if you know what I mean.

773
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:22,926
Fuck me, Fergus.

774
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:28,521
Am I to take it that's a no?

775
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:34,767
We had a court-martial in your absence.

776
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,964
They wanted to put
a bullet through your head.

777
01:14:37,074 --> 01:14:39,201
I pleaded for clemency.

778
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:43,439
Said we should find out
what happened first.

779
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:45,447
So what did happen?

780
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,550
He ran.

781
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:51,485
I couldn't shoot him in the back.

782
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:54,455
Tried to catch him.

783
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:58,654
He made it to the road
and got hit by a Saracen.

784
01:14:58,762 --> 01:15:02,994
- So you did fuck up.
- Yes.

785
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,399
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

786
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:08,562
No. What is the thing?

787
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:12,233
You vanished quite effectively.

788
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,469
Became Mister Nobody.

789
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:17,741
You've no idea how useful that could be.

790
01:15:17,848 --> 01:15:21,113
- What do you mean?
- We've got some plans here...

791
01:15:21,218 --> 01:15:24,710
and we'll need a Mister Nobody
to execute them.

792
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:27,346
No way, Jude. I'm out.

793
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:30,426
You're never out, Fergus.

794
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:35,327
Maybe you don't care about yourself, but--

795
01:15:35,432 --> 01:15:37,627
Consider the girl, Fergus.

796
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:41,766
The wee black chick.

797
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:44,534
- Leave her out of this!
- Jesus, Fergus!

798
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,336
You're a walkin' cliche.

799
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:49,844
You know we won't leave her out of it.

800
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:53,609
But I'm glad to see you care.

801
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:56,311
And, I must admit...

802
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,116
- I'm curious.
- What the fuck do you know, Jude?

803
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,383
You fuckin' tell me, boy!

804
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,789
She's nobody. She likes me.

805
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:10,196
Oh, so I suppose a fuck
is out of the question.

806
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:15,032
You keep your head down, Fergus.

807
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:17,333
No sudden moves.

808
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:20,433
And not a whisper to her.

809
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:22,478
You'll be hearin' from us.

810
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,550
Keep the faith.

811
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,429
He your boyfriend?

812
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,844
Lucky you.

813
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,647
Carnations.

814
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:04,652
- What?
- He'd bring me carnations.

815
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:08,019
- Oh, so I got it wrong, huh?
- Not at all, honey.

816
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,286
- Don't.
- Okay.

817
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,995
- Come on. Come on.
- Why, honey?

818
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:21,798
- Gonna tell me why?
- No.

819
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,502
What's wrong, Jimmy?

820
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,805
- You gonna tell me what's wrong?
- No. Not here.

821
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:42,824
You gonna tell me what it is?

822
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:45,952
- Ah. What is it?
- You know her, Jimmy?

823
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:48,929
Jimmy, is it? You know me, Jimmy?

824
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:51,398
- Dil, this is Jude.
- You following me?

825
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,969
Yeah! Just checkin'.

826
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:58,097
- Has he been nice to you, Dil?
- Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

827
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:02,201
That's good. I'm glad.

828
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:06,942
- Young love, as they say.
- Absolutely. The younger the better.

829
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:10,816
- Doesn't come much your way, I suppose.
- Don't go lookin' for it, Dil.

830
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:14,015
Well, maybe you'll get lucky someday.

831
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:16,786
Bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?

832
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:21,159
- A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
- Oh, absolutely.

833
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:23,858
As long as she can keep it.

834
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,697
Isn't that right, James?

835
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:38,811
- It's her, isn't it?
- What's her?

836
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:41,975
She's the thing you had to tell me.

837
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:44,349
Kind of.

838
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:48,413
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.

839
01:18:50,327 --> 01:18:53,592
- You see that, Col?
- Saw it, Dil.

840
01:18:53,697 --> 01:18:56,598
- "Fuck it" is what I say.
- Yeah, fuck it.

841
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,999
- Fuckin' men, Col.
- Fuck 'em.

842
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:03,264
Fuck you, Jimmy!

843
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:27,295
- You could always make it up to her.
- How?

844
01:19:27,397 --> 01:19:28,921
When a girl runs out like that...

845
01:19:29,032 --> 01:19:30,522
she generally wants to be followed.

846
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:33,662
She's not a girl, Col.

847
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,398
Whatever you say.

848
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:53,686
She went that way, but you go with me.

849
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:25,817
So, it was you all the time.

850
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:29,323
- Who'd you think it was?
- I thought it was Dave.

851
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:33,287
And who's Dave when he's at home?

852
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:36,024
He's at home.

853
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:39,124
- Should blow you away, you know that.
- Yeah, I know.

854
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,831
I'm gettin' emotional, and I don't like
gettin' fuckin' emotional!

855
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,841
You understand, Hennessy?

856
01:20:46,943 --> 01:20:49,070
- Yeah. I understand.
- Fuck you too.

857
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,079
Fuck you.

858
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,513
Leave him alone, Peter.

859
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:57,746
- He's in love.
- That right, Fergus? You in love?

860
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:00,448
- Absolutely.
- What's she like between the sheets?

861
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:03,720
- Definitely unusual.
- And who is she?

862
01:21:03,827 --> 01:21:06,557
Just a girl.

863
01:21:06,663 --> 01:21:10,258
You know what'll happen
if you fuck up again, don't ya?

864
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:13,859
- Yeah, I do, Peter.
- Good.

865
01:21:26,416 --> 01:21:28,577
So, what do you think that is, Hennessy?

866
01:21:28,685 --> 01:21:29,811
A hotel?

867
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:35,783
It's a knockin' shop. <i>Tres</i> discreet, huh?

868
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,124
He visits his ladies
Tuesdays and Thursday nights...

869
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:40,491
and Saturday mornings.

870
01:21:40,597 --> 01:21:42,326
That's his security in the car beyond.

871
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:47,360
Who is he?

872
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,870
Doesn't matter who he is.
He's a legitimate target.

873
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:51,235
Thank God for that.

874
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,408
- You tryin' to be cynical, Hennessy?
- Hope not.

875
01:21:55,512 --> 01:21:56,706
Good.

876
01:21:56,813 --> 01:21:59,714
So, what do you think?

877
01:22:04,454 --> 01:22:07,912
Whoever hits him will be hit,
if those men are any good.

878
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:13,086
- And I presume you can't get inside.
- Right.

879
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:16,791
- So it's on the street?
- Right.

880
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,800
Kind of suicide, isn't it?

881
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,466
But then, I don't have a choice.

882
01:22:23,573 --> 01:22:26,508
Oh, you do, Fergie.

883
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,134
Of course.

884
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:31,304
I forgot.

885
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:33,905
Come on.

886
01:22:34,017 --> 01:22:35,917
Rehearsal.

887
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:50,524
You keep your mind on your job, boy.

888
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,693
- Then you'll leave her out of it?
- Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

889
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:03,210
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes
to get to the door.

890
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:08,716
- And what if I say no?
- You know what. Go.

891
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,738
Pardon me, young man!

892
01:23:40,817 --> 01:23:42,717
- You were made for this.
- Was I?

893
01:23:42,819 --> 01:23:45,219
- Perfect!
- What happens then?

894
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:46,686
We'll be on the other side.

895
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:49,519
- We'll move when you do.
- And what if you don't?

896
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:52,925
- Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
- You may be right.

897
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:59,034
Stay late at your work tomorrow night
and I'll bring you the gear.

898
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,729
- Jude.
- Yes?

899
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:03,738
Who is the old geezer?

900
01:24:05,108 --> 01:24:07,008
Some judge.

901
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:24,360
- Why'd you follow me, Dil?
- I was jealous, Jimmy.

902
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:28,191
- You shouldn't be.
- Why shouldn't I be jealous?

903
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:32,090
Don't. My makeup.

904
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:43,842
- She own you, Jimmy?
- Yes.

905
01:24:43,947 --> 01:24:48,350
- She's from Scotland too?
- Yeah, you could say that.

906
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:52,581
- And you're not gonna tell me more?
- Can't.

907
01:25:02,165 --> 01:25:04,156
What you doing, Jimmy?

908
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,500
I don't know yet.

909
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:14,233
Do you like me even a little bit?

910
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:20,314
More than that.

911
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,981
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

912
01:25:27,624 --> 01:25:31,560
- Do something for me, Dil?
- Anything.

913
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:34,129
You'd do anything for me?

914
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,130
I'm afraid so.

915
01:25:36,232 --> 01:25:38,723
You got the keys to the shop?

916
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:53,239
Want another haircut, Jimmy?

917
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:56,113
No. Come on, sit down.

918
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:08,487
- You'd do anything for me?
- Anything.

919
01:26:09,966 --> 01:26:13,026
- No way.
- You said anything, Dil.

920
01:26:13,136 --> 01:26:15,832
A girl has to draw the line somewhere.

921
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:20,939
- Want to change you to a man.
- Why?

922
01:26:21,044 --> 01:26:23,740
It's a secret.

923
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,009
Would you like me better that way, Jimmy?

924
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:28,310
Yes.

925
01:26:28,418 --> 01:26:30,613
- And you wouldn't leave me?
- No.

926
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,154
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

927
01:26:36,092 --> 01:26:38,083
Go on, then.

928
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:04,042
- You want to make me like him?
- No.

929
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:07,122
I want to make you into something new...

930
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:10,317
that nobody recognizes.

931
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:25,897
I don't recognize myself.

932
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:32,736
No. Better in the dark.

933
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:35,147
- So it's true, then.
- What?

934
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:38,582
- You like me better like this.
- Yes.

935
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,595
No, no. Dil. Dil. Come on.

936
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,971
Dil.

937
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:15,124
Turn around. Turn around.

938
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:23,397
Baby.

939
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,295
What you doin', honey?

940
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:33,671
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry.

941
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:36,870
- What you doin'?
- Try this on.

942
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:40,005
- Why?
- For me.

943
01:28:40,116 --> 01:28:42,243
- For you.
- Yes.

944
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:52,820
- What we doin' here, Jimmy?
- Look on it like a honeymoon.

945
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:07,299
You a handyman, Fergie?

946
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:10,531
Take a pride in my work.

947
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,938
I sincerely hope so.

948
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,560
Tools of the trade, now.

949
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:41,227
And forget about the girl.

950
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,115
Dil!

951
01:31:05,494 --> 01:31:07,359
Dil!

952
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:11,724
Dil!

953
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:13,927
What the fuck are you doing here?

954
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:16,732
- I'm goin' home!
- I told you to stay in the hotel!

955
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:18,739
I thought you was foolin' me.

956
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:21,207
- I thought you were leavin' me!
- I had to go to work!

957
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:25,007
I stayed all day in the hotel
thinkin' every noise was you!

958
01:31:25,114 --> 01:31:26,206
Come on.

959
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:28,044
There's something you're
not telling me, Jimmy.

960
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:32,280
- Come on!
- No! I'm goin' home.

961
01:31:32,388 --> 01:31:35,414
- Dil!
- So tell me!

962
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,583
I was tryin' to get out of something!

963
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:40,924
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy!

964
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,625
You-- You gotta forget
you ever saw me, Dil.

965
01:31:44,734 --> 01:31:46,634
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

966
01:31:48,104 --> 01:31:50,971
Stop it, would ya?

967
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:53,507
Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake!

968
01:31:56,879 --> 01:32:02,215
I'm sorry. I get nervous.
I've got this blood condition.

969
01:32:02,318 --> 01:32:05,947
Just help me inside, Jimmy,
and I'll be all right.

970
01:32:19,068 --> 01:32:21,468
Did you hear what I said, Dil?

971
01:32:33,783 --> 01:32:35,683
Get my pills.

972
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:41,587
- What pills?
- Prescription for my condition.

973
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,453
What condition?

974
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:46,687
My condition. Ennui.

975
01:32:56,906 --> 01:32:59,534
Are you supposed to take that many?

976
01:32:59,642 --> 01:33:02,167
Only in times of extreme stress.

977
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:09,850
See, they all say good-bye sometime.

978
01:33:09,952 --> 01:33:11,852
Except for him.

979
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,854
Are you all right, Dil?

980
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:15,947
I will be.

981
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,254
Go on.

982
01:33:20,362 --> 01:33:22,592
Good-bye, Dil.

983
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:31,168
- Jimmy.
- What?

984
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,241
Don't go like that.

985
01:33:36,245 --> 01:33:38,179
Can't help what I am.

986
01:33:56,265 --> 01:33:58,256
I knew you had a heart.

987
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:07,298
Dil, can I tell you somethin'?

988
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:10,242
I knew your man.

989
01:34:10,346 --> 01:34:12,576
You knew which man?

990
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:16,048
- Your soldier.
- You knew my Jody?

991
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,913
Lifted him from a carnival outside Belfast.

992
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:25,289
Held him hostage for three days.

993
01:34:25,394 --> 01:34:27,692
You knew my Jody?

994
01:34:27,796 --> 01:34:30,287
- Are you listenin'?
- Yes.

995
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:34,635
Got the order to shoot him.

996
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:39,865
Before I could do it, he ran.

997
01:34:39,975 --> 01:34:42,466
Ran into a tank and died.

998
01:34:42,578 --> 01:34:45,570
- Died?
- Did you hear me?

999
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:49,981
- You killed my Jody?
- In a manner of speakin'.

1000
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:55,851
- It was you.
- You should scream.

1001
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:58,426
You should beat my head off.

1002
01:35:05,067 --> 01:35:07,558
- You killed my Jody.
- No.

1003
01:35:09,104 --> 01:35:11,595
You didn't?

1004
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:15,336
- I suppose I tried.
- Tried.

1005
01:35:15,444 --> 01:35:17,469
Don't you want to kill me?

1006
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,075
Bang.

1007
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:32,425
Don't leave me tonight.

1008
01:35:32,528 --> 01:35:34,553
Might kill me too.

1009
01:35:36,265 --> 01:35:38,324
Okay.

1010
01:36:48,304 --> 01:36:50,704
What the fuck?

1011
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:53,673
So, tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.

1012
01:37:19,468 --> 01:37:21,936
Didn't really listen last night.

1013
01:37:22,037 --> 01:37:24,801
I heard, but I didn't listen.

1014
01:37:24,907 --> 01:37:27,137
Dil.

1015
01:37:27,242 --> 01:37:29,233
That won't do you no good.

1016
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:31,313
Dil knows how to tie a body.

1017
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:38,985
I wondered why you came on
to me like that...

1018
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:42,956
- when you gave me the look.
- He asked me to see were you all right!

1019
01:37:58,107 --> 01:38:02,066
See, I fix on anyone who's nice to me.

1020
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:05,203
Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

1021
01:38:05,314 --> 01:38:07,214
Stop it, Dil!

1022
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:10,774
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched.

1023
01:38:10,886 --> 01:38:13,684
Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.

1024
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:20,784
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy.

1025
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:24,195
But I can't... yet.

1026
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,199
- Let me go, Dil.
- Why?

1027
01:38:26,301 --> 01:38:30,431
- I gotta be somewhere!
- So try and go then.

1028
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:38,979
Where the fuck is he?

1029
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,981
Christ.

1030
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:45,382
Let me go, for fuck's sake, Dil...

1031
01:38:45,487 --> 01:38:49,048
- or they'll be here.
- Let them come, then.

1032
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:50,785
Can't stay here, Peter.

1033
01:38:50,893 --> 01:38:53,487
- Drive around once more.
- Bollocks.

1034
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:56,359
See, I just want your company...

1035
01:38:56,465 --> 01:38:58,660
for a little while longer.

1036
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:09,399
- That fucker's dead.
- No, we are.

1037
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:12,708
You don't know what you're doin', Dil.

1038
01:39:12,815 --> 01:39:14,715
Never did.

1039
01:39:23,859 --> 01:39:28,057
- Shit. Give me the shooter.
- What? You're crazy!

1040
01:39:28,163 --> 01:39:31,462
- Give me the fuckin' shooter, Jude!
- Peter!

1041
01:39:32,668 --> 01:39:34,932
Peter!

1042
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:39,565
You like me now, Jimmy?

1043
01:40:39,668 --> 01:40:43,160
Yeah, I like you, Dil.

1044
01:40:43,272 --> 01:40:46,469
Give me a bit more, baby. A bit more.

1045
01:40:46,575 --> 01:40:49,567
- More what?
- More endearments.

1046
01:40:51,013 --> 01:40:54,141
- I like you, Dil.
- Love me.

1047
01:40:54,249 --> 01:40:57,548
- Yeah.
- Tell me you love me.

1048
01:40:57,653 --> 01:41:01,680
- Whatever you say, Dil.
- Then say it.

1049
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:04,691
I love you, Dil.

1050
01:41:04,793 --> 01:41:06,693
You do?

1051
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:10,287
Yeah.

1052
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,199
What would you do for me?

1053
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,804
Anything.

1054
01:41:17,906 --> 01:41:20,966
Say it again.

1055
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:24,773
I'd do anything for ya, Dil.

1056
01:41:39,027 --> 01:41:42,929
You'd never leave me?

1057
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:45,659
Never.

1058
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:49,328
I know you're lying, Jimmy,
but it's nice to hear it.

1059
01:41:54,943 --> 01:41:57,605
I'm sorry.

1060
01:42:05,587 --> 01:42:08,784
You stupid shit!

1061
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:11,381
Once was bad enough, but twice?

1062
01:42:11,493 --> 01:42:13,518
You didn't knock, honey.

1063
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:18,495
- Dil!
- Get that thing off me, Fergus!

1064
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,897
What was that she called you, Jimmy?

1065
01:42:20,002 --> 01:42:23,233
- Fergus! It's my name, Dil!
- What's Fergus?

1066
01:42:23,338 --> 01:42:26,432
- What happened to Jimmy?
- I said get her off!.

1067
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:27,803
What's she gonna do, Jimmy?

1068
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:30,002
- She gonna blow you away?
- Dil!

1069
01:42:30,112 --> 01:42:31,636
- Dil!
- Was she there too...

1070
01:42:31,747 --> 01:42:32,839
when you got my Jody?

1071
01:42:32,948 --> 01:42:34,939
- Dil!
- I asked you a question.

1072
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,881
Were you there too?

1073
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:39,852
You sick bitch.

1074
01:42:39,955 --> 01:42:41,752
- Dil!
- You was there, wasn't you?

1075
01:42:41,857 --> 01:42:44,121
You used those tits and that ass
to get him, didn't you?

1076
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:56,403
- She was there, wasn't she?
- She was.

1077
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:02,476
She used her tits and that cute
little ass to get him, didn't she?

1078
01:43:03,812 --> 01:43:05,279
Yes.

1079
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,508
Tell me what she wore.

1080
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,653
Can't remember.

1081
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:26,099
I can't do it, Jimmy.

1082
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:30,070
He won't let me.

1083
01:43:39,815 --> 01:43:42,215
You won't let me, Jody.

1084
01:44:06,141 --> 01:44:08,268
You've got to go now, Dil.

1085
01:44:08,376 --> 01:44:11,436
- Do I?
- Yes.

1086
01:44:11,546 --> 01:44:13,138
Now.

1087
01:44:13,248 --> 01:44:16,809
- Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
- Not if you go.

1088
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:19,478
- Will I see you again?
- Yes.

1089
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:21,488
- Promise?
- Promise.

1090
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:27,258
- Where am I to go, Jimmy?
- The Metro.

1091
01:44:28,697 --> 01:44:30,927
- And meet Col.
- Yeah.

1092
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:33,000
Say hello to Col.

1093
01:45:20,382 --> 01:45:22,350
You shoulda stayed at home.

1094
01:46:15,971 --> 01:46:18,599
I got the multivitamins
and the iron tablets, hon.

1095
01:46:18,707 --> 01:46:21,267
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry, love.

1096
01:46:21,376 --> 01:46:23,344
- The white one's magnesium supplement.
- Stop it, Dil.

1097
01:46:23,445 --> 01:46:27,973
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy.
I'm counting the days.

1098
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:30,916
Two thousand, three hundred
and thirty-four left.

1099
01:46:31,019 --> 01:46:33,579
- Thirty-five.
- I'm sorry, darlin'.

1100
01:46:33,688 --> 01:46:35,588
I keep forgetting the leap year.

1101
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:36,748
Dil.

1102
01:46:36,858 --> 01:46:38,325
What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?

1103
01:46:38,426 --> 01:46:40,986
- Fergus.
- Fergus.

1104
01:46:42,964 --> 01:46:47,264
Fergus. My love. Light of my life.

1105
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:50,361
- Please, Dil.
- Can't help it.

1106
01:46:50,472 --> 01:46:52,133
You're doing time for me.

1107
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:55,801
No greater love, as the man says.

1108
01:46:55,911 --> 01:46:57,811
I wish you'd tell me why.

1109
01:46:57,913 --> 01:47:01,405
As a man said, it's in my nature.

1110
01:47:01,516 --> 01:47:03,450
What's that supposed to mean?

1111
01:47:04,486 --> 01:47:05,851
Well...

1112
01:47:05,954 --> 01:47:09,117
there's this scorpion, you see...

1113
01:47:09,224 --> 01:47:10,748
and he wants to go across a river.

1114
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:14,056
Well, he can't swim, so...

1115
01:47:14,162 --> 01:47:16,790
he goes to this frog,
who naturally enough can swim,

1116
01:47:16,898 --> 01:47:19,389
and he says...

1117
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:20,934
"Excuse me, Mr. Froggy.

1118
01:47:21,036 --> 01:47:25,029
I want to go across the river."

1119
01:47:27,142 --> 01:47:29,337
So the frog accepts the idea.

1120
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:34,973
Scorpion hops on the frog's back.

1121
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:38,883
Suddenly, the frog-- "Aah!"
He feels this sting!

1122
01:47:38,987 --> 01:47:43,720
"You stung me!"

1123
01:47:43,825 --> 01:47:47,488
"Why did you go and do that?"

1124
01:47:47,595 --> 01:47:50,428
The scorpion looks at him and says...

1125
01:47:52,534 --> 01:47:56,630
"I can't help it. It's in my nature."
