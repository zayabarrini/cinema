1
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,820
Hi! Hi! Hi!

2
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,740
Does it hurt?

3
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,870
Okay.

4
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,610
Name?

5
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,880
Kevin Abdela.

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,300
Kevin Abdela. Good, Mary. You'll be fine.

7
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,260
So, fine.

8
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,620
She has to keep it on for four weeks.

9
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,100
Even when the pain stops, she has to keep it on.

10
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,180
Let's wrap it up in ten minutes,
folks, please! Ten minutes, thank you!

11
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,750
Najeeb?

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,550
Yeah?

13
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,970
We take two more, each.

14
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,700
Two?

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,340
OK, we can have four more.

16
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,460
She will have to give her something for the fever.

17
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,540
Three times a day.

18
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,300
Come back here...

19
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,900
Najeeb, stretcher please!

20
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,380
Prepare to operate!

21
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,410
Easy, easy. Come, come, come.

22
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,380
Tie me on the back.

23
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,540
I need help here.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,950
She can make it.

25
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,380
Check her pulse. She can make it.

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,250
I need some light.

27
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,100
Patient asleep?

28
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,590
Yes, doctor.

29
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,620
Swabs.

30
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,300
Take the swab.

31
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,150
Clamp.

32
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,770
What's the pulse?

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,950
Pulse at 78.

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,620
Stable.

35
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay. Hold tight.

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,470
Clamp.

37
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,550
Looks stable now.

38
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,080
I didn't think she'd make it.

39
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,240
I've seen that type of injury before.

40
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,210
It's the work of a local villain. Big Man.

41
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,730
He takes bets with his boys as to what sex the child will be.

42
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,140
Then he cuts the girls open to see.

43
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,140
"And Death gave back these treasures for a song.

44
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,770
The nightingale sang on.

45
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,180
It sang of the quiet churchyard, where white roses grow,

46
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,180
where the elderflowers make the air sweet,

47
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,020
and where the grass is always green,

48
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,820
wet with the tears of those who are still alive.

49
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,780
Death longed for his garden.

50
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,700
Out through the windows drifted
a cold gray mist as Death departed.

51
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,660
'Thank you, thank you,' the emperor said.

52
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,100
'Little bird from Heaven, I know you of old.

53
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
I banished you once from my land,

54
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,500
and yet you have sung away the evil faces from my bed,

55
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,540
and Death from my heart.

56
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,260
How can I repay you?'

57
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,060
'You have already rewarded me,' said the nightingale.

58
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,460
'I brought tears to your eyes when first I sang for you.

59
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,850
To the heart of a singer, those are
more precious than any precious stone.

60
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,910
But sleep now, and grow fresh and strong while I sing. '

61
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,340
He sang until the emperor fell into a sound, refreshing sleep,

62
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,460
a sweet and soothing slumber."

63
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,760
She used to read it to me before I'd go to sleep.

64
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,380
I think it's good that he did it.

65
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,570
So do I.

66
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,500
Hey, Hanna. This is my mother. This is Hanna.

67
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,080
You're the one they'll be staying with?

68
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,900
Yes.

69
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,820
I think Christian is looking forward
to getting back home, right?

70
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,410
It's so hard to believe she's gone.

71
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,930
Christian?

72
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,660
I just want to tell you that you did really well.

73
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm really proud of you.

74
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,760
Mom would have been too.

75
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,050
You don't have to say something all the time, dad.

76
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,180
We can talk, can't we?

77
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,060
You don't have to on my account.

78
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,540
Are you ready?

79
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,420
Coming.

80
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,070
Good morning, Mohammed.

81
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,120
Good morning, sir.

82
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,740
OK, let's go.

83
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,470
Hello.

84
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,740
Hello, my darling.

85
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
Welcome.

86
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
Hi, mom.

87
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,970
Here's so much space.

88
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,580
Lots of peace and quiet. I won't bother you.

89
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,540
Internet has been installed for you,
and you can choose which room you want.

90
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,460
This is the smallest room.

91
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,320
It's fine.

92
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,650
You don't have to decide now.

93
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,240
Can I choose myself or can't I?

94
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,540
Of course, but your desk and your bed won't fit in here.

95
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,900
But you decide.

96
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,970
Your call.

97
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,200
The view is great.

98
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,050
You'll get it.

99
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,980
What's up, ratboy?

100
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,370
Got air in your tyres?

101
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,180
Lost your bottom jaw?

102
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,900
Excited?

103
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,300
Yes.

104
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,980
Want me to come with you?

105
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,650
No. Of course not.

106
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,140
Take care.

107
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,960
Yep.

108
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,300
See you.

109
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,220
Crawl between our legs, rat.

110
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,740
Go home and eat some cheese.

111
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,540
Aren't you a rat?

112
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,800
Is there a problem?

113
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,680
Walking fountain.

114
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,540
Damn swede.

115
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,020
Mutant! Damn, you're ugly!

116
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,570
Fucking rat!

117
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,660
Please sit down, and try to be quiet.

118
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,820
Sit down!

119
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,730
Whose is this?

120
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,500
This is Christian.

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,620
Be quiet.

122
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,120
Christian lived in lots of countries
and has just moved here from London.

123
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,260
Does he speak danish?

124
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,420
Of course he does, Trine.

125
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,020
Well, I'll just mark your birthday on the calendar.

126
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
When's your birthday?

127
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,860
July 7th.

128
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,220
The same as Elias. That's quite funny.

129
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,540
That's quite funny. Be quiet.

130
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,960
You can sit next to Elias then.

131
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,680
Stop it!

132
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,400
Poor you!

133
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,160
Then we can talk about London
during form time. That'll be fun.

134
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,980
Now please get out your history books.

135
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,220
I don't wanna fight you.

136
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,340
No!

137
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,620
Want to borrow my bicycle pump?

138
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,360
No thanks. It's all right.

139
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,100
The took the valves too.

140
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,100
They always do that.

141
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll just walk. It's okay.

142
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,020
Why not take some from the other bikes?

143
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,460
Then he'll have to walk.

144
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,940
Then today is his turn.

145
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,920
Here.

146
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,500
Thanks.

147
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,140
Letting other peoples' tyres down?

148
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,620
And who the hell are you?

149
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm Christian.

150
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,570
Christian?

151
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,150
What are you doing with ratboy?

152
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,030
Ratboy?

153
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, he's got the teeth of a rat.

154
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,300
I don't go around looking in other peoples' mouths.

155
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,900
You're supposed to catch it.

156
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,900
And you'll just walk home, ratboy.

157
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,060
Are you okay?

158
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,900
Yeah.

159
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,540
I'm really sorry.

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
Want me to help you?

161
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,820
No, I'm OK.

162
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,840
You sure?

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,420
Yeah.

164
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,300
I'm really sorry.

165
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,090
That one was really stuck in there.

166
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,150
How many did you eat?

167
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,300
Hi, sweetheart.

168
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,230
How was your day?

169
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,180
It was all right.

170
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,660
Look at me? Are you sure?

171
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,460
Yes.

172
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,880
Sure?

173
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,780
Yes.

174
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,720
If you lie to me, I'll eat you up!

175
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,230
Me too!

176
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,440
Leave me alone!

177
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,930
Just leave me alone.

178
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,120
Elias...

179
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,850
I hate you.

180
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,540
Aren't you sleeping?

181
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,420
No, I had to finish my game.

182
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,780
Is that blood on your shirt?

183
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,740
We were playing soccer.

184
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,020
Did someone punch you?

185
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,970
No.

186
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,060
It was an accident.

187
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,620
Won't you come down to the kitchen
and keep me company?

188
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,820
That'd be nice.

189
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,930
I'll be right there.

190
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,090
Hi, dad!

191
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,730
Hi, sweetheart.

192
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,050
It's so good to see you.

193
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,450
You too. I missed you.

194
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,220
How are you?

195
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,350
How was your trip?

196
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,100
Long. But all right.

197
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Hi.

198
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,950
Hi.

199
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,340
Morten made you a present, in case you were hungry.

200
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,380
Did you get a haircut?

201
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,220
No.

202
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,140
It was good hearing from you, Elias.

203
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,620
But now we'd like to talk
to your parents alone, if that's okay?

204
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,740
What do you say?

205
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,050
Let's be reasonable.

206
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,330
Elias isolates himself a lot.

207
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,880
We have to relate to that.

208
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,570
His tyres are let down every day.

209
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,580
The other kids call him ratboy.

210
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,970
It's not Sofus who lets his tyres down.

211
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,970
Maybe not him personally,

212
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,440
but he has his own little mafia.

213
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,100
He'll get the others to it, but he's behind it.

214
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,240
We shouldn't give Sofus too much credit...

215
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,540
Other pupils' tyres are let down too.

216
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,700
We are of course aware of that.

217
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,140
It's not an easy situation for Elias...

218
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,400
With you, Anton, who travels a lot.

219
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,580
It must be hard for Elias, that his father is away so often.

220
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,100
And if there are other problems between you...

221
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,090
What problems are those?

222
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,880
Your separation, Marianne.

223
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,600
Let me tell you something.

224
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Don't you interfere with our personal life.

225
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,510
That has nothing to do with anything!

226
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
No, stop.

227
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm shocked that we have to listen to this.

228
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,980
We'll end up having to move Elias
to another school, because Sofus is a...

229
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,460
...sadistic little psychopath!

230
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,840
If we could try

231
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,580
to be a little constructive, what do you suggest?

232
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,260
Maybe you should try buying some flowers for mom?

233
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,150
Or some chocolate.

234
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,100
You're even uglier up close.

235
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,520
Fuck off!

236
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,360
Shut up. You're from Sweden.

237
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,540
Kiss my shoe if you want to pass.

238
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,220
What's up, loser?

239
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,580
You're so gross.

240
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,500
What's up, Elias?

241
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,220
You know, yesterday?

242
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,460
If anyone asks...

243
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,380
I won't tell.

244
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,220
Nothing happened to him.

245
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,780
Just keep your mouth shut.

246
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,490
If you talk, you're dead.

247
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,060
Never touch me again!

248
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,220
I won't do anything.

249
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,180
Not me or anyone else.

250
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,740
I don't give a fuck if you die.

251
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,180
Do you understand?

252
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,840
Hide the knife. You'll be expelled.

253
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,440
We changed your medication.
You might get a little confused.

254
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,210
Did you eat anything yesterday?

255
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,640
It ate it all. Pork roast.

256
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,640
It was delicious.

257
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,500
Then you are getting really confused, huh?

258
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,780
Marianne?

259
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,130
They have called twice from Elias' school.

260
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,740
You have to call them back.

261
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Did they say what it was about?

262
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,110
You forgot to turn on your cellphone.

263
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,480
I don't have it on me.

264
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,290
You're lying, Elias.

265
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,560
Why are you lying?

266
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm not lying.

267
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,920
Christian admitted that he had a knife.

268
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,580
He hit him several times in the head with a bicycle pump.

269
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,460
I only saw them hitting each other. There was no knife.

270
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,560
Listen to me.

271
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,320
Elias just told us that you had a knife.

272
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,420
I didn't have a knife.

273
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,340
Okay.

274
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,730
If everyone is lying, then you tell me the truth.

275
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,840
He hit me.

276
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,080
Then I hit him.

277
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,900
You hit him with a bicycle pump?

278
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,920
I had to.

279
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,260
He's much bigger than me.

280
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,080
He was going to beat me up.

281
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,700
Elias,

282
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,740
this is serious.

283
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,160
He might go blind in one eye.

284
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,100
Then he should leave people alone.

285
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,220
Hi.

286
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,100
Hi, Marianne.

287
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,340
Where is Elias?

288
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,350
They're talking to the police.

289
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,400
What happened?

290
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,540
It was a vicious assault.

291
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,600
Apparently, there was a knife involved.

292
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,110
That can't be right.

293
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,380
That doesn't sound like Christian.

294
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,500
They haven't found one.

295
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,460
What has this got to do with Elias?

296
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,040
Did Elias hit Sofus?

297
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,940
We don't know.

298
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,920
The police are interviewing them,
and then we'll find out what happened.

299
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,420
Is it true that Sofus has been blinded?

300
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,560
Who told you that?

301
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,600
The police.

302
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,370
No.

303
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,010
He will have a headache, and probably
get a scar, but he will be all right.

304
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,450
It could have been much worse.

305
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,320
Why didn't you tell me that he hit you?

306
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,970
Then we could have talked to him and his parents.

307
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,740
A lot of kids saw it.

308
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,780
That's no answer.

309
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,420
If I hadn't fought back,
then everyone would think I was weak.

310
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,500
Just tell me if he had a knife.

311
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,960
I promise I won't tell anyone.

312
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,520
He didn't have a knife. Stop asking.

313
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,420
If you hit him, then he'll hit you. It'll never end.

314
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,930
Don't you understand?

315
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,440
That's how wars start.

316
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,640
Not if you hit hard enough the first time.

317
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,240
You don't know a damn thing about it.

318
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,020
It's like that in every school.

319
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,500
Now no one dares touch me.

320
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm not going to ask you about the knife again.

321
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,300
You understand?

322
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,810
But I want you to know

323
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,900
that you can tell me everything.

324
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,660
Understand?

325
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,310
Yes.

326
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,270
It's me.

327
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,040
Hi.

328
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,040
Were you sleeping?

329
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,580
No.

330
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,460
What are you doing?

331
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,580
I'm at a discotheque.

332
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,860
What do you want?

333
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,240
Just talk.

334
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,260
I'm bored without you.

335
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,960
Did you talk to Elias?

336
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
Of course.

337
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,840
I miss you.

338
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,370
Don't do that.

339
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,790
I told you I was sorry.

340
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,560
And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

341
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,500
I was quite proud of us actually.

342
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,040
I was.

343
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,500
Proud that we weren't like all the other idiots
who just give up and get divorced.

344
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,730
I was proud that we loved each other.

345
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,500
We still do.

346
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,970
But Anton...

347
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,240
I messed up big time.

348
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,340
I tried...

349
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,880
I tried to explain, how it got that far

350
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,920
and I was so stupid. I tried...

351
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,610
You only paid attention to her, every time you were home.

352
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,060
It still hurts.

353
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,060
Everything we had together.

354
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,080
And when you were here, it was all lies.

355
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,120
It was all make-believe.

356
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,780
I love you.

357
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,310
I would like to forgive you, but I can't keep up.

358
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,680
That's how it is. Good night.

359
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,500
No, wait. Don't hang up.

360
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,460
I think, we can consider this matter closed.

361
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,990
You have messed up.

362
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,940
All three of you.

363
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,780
But you have learned that no good comes from fighting.

364
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,970
That's right.

365
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,780
It could have ended much worse.

366
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,300
Now Elias and Sofus shake hands.

367
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm sorry, Elias.

368
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,890
Good.

369
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,640
And Christian and Sofus. Please shake hands.

370
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,570
Sorry.

371
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,680
And you'll be back Monday. No hard feelings, OK?

372
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,990
Looking forward to the theme week?

373
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,840
Yes.

374
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,390
The whole school is excited.

375
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,820
We're looking forward to it.

376
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,270
What will you be doing, Sofus?

377
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,080
I'm in the weapons group.

378
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,420
We'll be making muskets.

379
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,360
Of course you will.

380
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,100
And Elias?

381
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm in the same group as Christian.

382
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,590
We'll be making a model of The Round Tower.

383
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,180
I'm looking forward to that.

384
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,740
Want to walk with me, Christian?

385
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,640
No.

386
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,660
Come on, Elias.

387
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,260
Here it is.

388
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,020
Do you want it?

389
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,660
Thanks.

390
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,100
Cool!

391
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Christian?

392
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,560
Yes?

393
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,300
I'm leaving now.

394
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,030
I'll try to make the flight at four tomorrow.

395
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,200
I'll call you.

396
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,380
You can stay for dinner, if you want?

397
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,060
Thank you, but I should be going home.

398
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,410
Then maybe on the weekend.

399
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,380
Just go, dad.

400
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,720
See you.

401
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
Take care, Elias.

402
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,600
You too.

403
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,700
Where's he going?

404
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,780
London.

405
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,660
Where's your mom?

406
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
She's dead.

407
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,700
My parents are in the middle of a divorce.

408
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,060
Why did she die?

409
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,720
She had cancer.

410
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,180
At first they thought she'd get well, but she didn't make it.

411
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,980
She was cremated.

412
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,220
Okay.

413
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,110
Funerals are disgusting.

414
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,540
The bodies rot and seep into the groundwater.

415
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,930
I want to be cremated when I'm dead.

416
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,050
What about you?

417
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,410
Perhaps.

418
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,900
I never really thought about it.

419
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,630
What are we doing here?

420
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,440
Going up.

421
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,720
You can do that?

422
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
Of course.

423
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,260
Come on.

424
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,460
Wow, this is crazy.

425
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,650
Yeah.

426
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,260
I used to come here when I was home on vacation.

427
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,860
Where's your house?

428
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,330
My house?

429
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,620
Out there somewhere.

430
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,840
Okay.

431
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,980
It's a long way down.

432
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Yeah, like that.

433
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,980
We were on this silo down by the docks.

434
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,810
You can't do that.

435
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,380
Christian is up there every day.

436
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,840
You can see our house from up there.

437
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,540
I know it. That's why I tell you not to play there.

438
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,250
It's dangerous.

439
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,220
Promise me that you won't do it again.

440
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,740
Don't "mmm" me.

441
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,930
Promise. Where's the pump?

442
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,390
Here you go.

443
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,160
Promise?

444
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,880
Yeah.

445
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,660
Promise what?

446
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,210
That I won't go back up there.

447
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,450
Let's pump it up.

448
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,990
Put it down here, boys.

449
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,200
Can we have an ice cream?

450
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,700
Yes. Put it down gently.

451
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,980
I wanna try the swing.

452
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,450
Thanks for the help.

453
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,380
Kayaking was so much fun.

454
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,490
Don't!

455
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,660
Come on, boys.

456
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,140
Hey!

457
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,200
What are you doing? Morten!

458
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,740
Stop that. What are you doing?

459
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,830
Why are you fighting?

460
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,860
What's going on?

461
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,680
He took my swing.

462
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,200
Why?

463
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,960
He punched me for no reason.

464
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,460
Why did you hit him?

465
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,400
I didn't.

466
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,420
Why are you fighting over a swing?

467
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,140
What's going on here, man?

468
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,380
I was just using the swing,
and he came up and started bothering me.

469
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,460
Don't steal his swing!

470
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,740
Kids will be kids...

471
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,540
I don't wanna see you touch my boy again.

472
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,670
You understand?

473
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,180
I didn't touch him.

474
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,220
Get the hell outta here.

475
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,820
Fuck off!

476
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,000
What the hell is wrong with you? Look at me.

477
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,340
You're always fighting.

478
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,940
Always fucking trouble with you.

479
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,850
I'm sorry, dad.

480
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,540
You did nothing wrong.

481
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,380
Doesn't it hurt? Are we going to the hospital?

482
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,940
No, we're not.

483
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm very sorry.

484
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,760
Shouldn't you call the police?

485
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,620
Yeah, dad. Call the police.

486
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,140
No, I won't do that.

487
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,680
He hit you.

488
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,200
Let's go home. You can't eat your ice cream in the car.

489
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,140
End of discussion.

490
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,340
We shouldn't be up here.

491
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,020
Why not?

492
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,320
What are you doing?

493
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,610
Just hanging out.

494
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,240
I gotta get home.

495
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,490
There he is.

496
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,700
Who?

497
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,180
The idiot who hit your dad.

498
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,620
Come on.

499
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,710
There he is.

500
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,920
We'll look up his address online.

501
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,000
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

502
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,220
Run dammit!

503
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,720
Hey, dad.

504
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,680
Hey.

505
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,450
Come, sweetheart.

506
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,860
You okay?

507
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,800
Sure.

508
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,410
What are you doing here?

509
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,260
I just wanted to give you this.

510
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,090
I know where the guy who punched you works.

511
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,900
How did you find out?

512
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
I just did. He works there.

513
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,180
How did you find out?

514
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Christian and I saw him. It was on his car.

515
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,510
Have you been up on that silo again?

516
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,880
No, no.

517
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,410
Christian might have been. He's up there every day.

518
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,060
But you haven't?

519
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,360
I haven't.

520
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,300
Are you sure?

521
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,120
Yeah.

522
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,750
Aren't you going to do something about it?

523
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,060
Like what?

524
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,800
Go and beat him up.

525
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,740
Are you serious?

526
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,380
Yes.

527
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,300
Are you afraid?

528
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,550
That's not the point.

529
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,580
You don't go around beating people up.
Nobody benefits from that.

530
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,040
What kind of world would we live in then?

531
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,810
He's an idiot.

532
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,620
If I beat him up, I'll be just as big an idiot.

533
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,340
I'll go to jail, and you'll have no dad. He wins.

534
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,460
Maybe mom would like it if you weren't such a wimp.

535
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,940
I promised mom I'd be home, so I'd better get going.

536
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,680
Who's the wimp now?

537
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,570
You are.

538
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,500
Bye!

539
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,660
Say hi to your mom.

540
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,270
Hello?

541
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,380
Hello?

542
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,530
Hi.

543
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,080
Hi.

544
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm looking for a Lars.

545
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,180
Say what?

546
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,620
Does a Lars work here?

547
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,290
Lars?

548
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,740
Lars?

549
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,300
Lars!

550
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,020
Sweden calling.

551
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,820
Hi.

552
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,000
Hi.

553
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,250
Remember me?

554
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,440
I'm Anton.

555
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,840
We met on the playground.

556
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,040
You slapped me.

557
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,050
Remember?

558
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,420
Yeah, I remember.

559
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,620
What do you want?

560
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,500
Why did you do it?

561
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,060
Don't touch my kids.

562
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,470
I broke up a fight over a swing.

563
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,600
Good for you. Know what you should do?

564
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,050
Stay away from me and my son.

565
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,480
And nothing will happen. Okay?

566
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,380
You understand?

567
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,480
Do you want me to tell you why you did it?

568
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,820
No, shut the hell up.

569
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,860
And get your ass back to Sweden.

570
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,190
Nobody understands you here anyway.

571
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,140
Did you hit me because you could?

572
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,980
That's right.

573
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,310
Maybe you should shut up now, Lars.

574
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,390
Do you want me to hit you again?

575
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,580
You're an idiot who likes to feel he's in charge.

576
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,860
You're not.

577
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,190
Stop it, Lars.

578
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,780
It's all right, boys.

579
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,760
What do you want?

580
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,390
What do I want?

581
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,620
Yeah, what do you want?

582
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,940
I want to show the children that I'm not afraid of you.

583
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,580
You can't hurt me.

584
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,330
You're not afraid of me?

585
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,100
And I can't hurt you?

586
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,360
That's exactly what I can do.

587
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,200
I think you should go now.

588
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,180
Take your kids, and go home.

589
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,340
You frightened the children

590
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,580
when you hit me.

591
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,440
Good.

592
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,860
They were very upset and found out where you work.

593
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,840
That's why we're here.

594
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,340
That's very clever of them, finding out where I work.

595
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,380
Good job.

596
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,400
You're such a big idiot that you can't even apologize
when I'm here with the kids

597
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,140
but continue to fight.

598
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,580
Huh? Want some more?

599
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,740
Let's go home.

600
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,900
Want some more?

601
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,890
Get the hell back to Sweden, you fag.

602
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,530
It didn't hurt. I'm okay.

603
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,860
Let's go. Thank you for seeing us.

604
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,000
It didn't hurt.

605
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,210
Nothing to be afraid of.

606
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,000
That's all he knows how to do. He lost.

607
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,180
He's a moron.

608
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,720
You understand?

609
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,030
Understand what?

610
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,180
That he's a moron, and not worth our time.

611
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,780
He's a big moron.

612
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,560
Exactly.

613
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,470
I don't think he feels he lost.

614
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,360
Maybe not, but he did.

615
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,700
I'm not sure.

616
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,930
Let's go. We're done here.

617
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,480
Giant wanker moron.

618
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,440
Get in the car.

619
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,230
He was such an asshole.

620
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,440
Giant wanker moron.

621
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,830
That's enough.

622
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,910
Giant wanker moron!

623
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,580
Put your seatbelt on. All right, stop.

624
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,340
Should we let Morten try?

625
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:09,980
Yes!

626
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,030
Wait a second.

627
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,530
There.

628
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,320
Come on, Morten.

629
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,870
Perfect!

630
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,100
No, let go at the same time.

631
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,460
Look at that.

632
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,820
Has the fever gone down?

633
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,540
Yeah, it's gone down.

634
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,860
That's perfect.

635
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,100
There he is.

636
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,020
Everybody's afraid of him,
but no one does anything about it.

637
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,340
I'll try to find something we can use as a fence.

638
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,820
Come here for a second.

639
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,980
Must be something my granddad bought.

640
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,760
We shouldn't keep it here.

641
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,800
It could blow up the whole house.

642
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,050
They're just fireworks.

643
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,740
You know how much black powder's in this?

644
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,580
Several pounds.

645
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,420
You could make a huge bomb.

646
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,220
Really?

647
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,900
Yeah.

648
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,180
I'll show you online.

649
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,180
He just kept hitting your dad.

650
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,360
Your dad might not be afraid,

651
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,890
but he just kept hitting him.

652
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,370
If we get back at him, he might learn his lesson.

653
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,010
How loud will this be?

654
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,080
Very.

655
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,570
Won't anyone hear?

656
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,580
Not out here.

657
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,260
Hold the bomb.

658
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,660
You want to light it?

659
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,300
You'll have to run.

660
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,890
You do it.

661
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:02,840
Are you sure?

662
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,850
Run fast, OK?

663
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,660
Yeah.

664
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,280
Fuck, that was sick!

665
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,100
Imagine if we use one of the big ones!

666
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,560
His car will be blown to pieces.

667
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,700
Whose car?

668
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,380
That asshole, Lars'.

669
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,140
You want to blow up his car?

670
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,720
Sure.

671
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,130
Someone will find out.

672
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,660
A car is really expensive.

673
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,900
Your dad will be pleased.

674
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,060
I'm not so sure.

675
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,620
Doesn't matter. No one will find out.

676
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,340
Are you in or out?

677
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,020
I'm not sure...

678
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,060
If you're not in, I would like my knife back right now.

679
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,660
Easy, easy.

680
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,780
Stretcher! Stretcher!

681
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,260
Lift.

682
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,540
Keep on moving. There's a pulse.

683
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,100
Move on! Up, up, up.

684
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,900
Prep the patient. Put down IV.

685
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,740
Antibiotics.

686
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,180
Thank you. Patient asleep yet?

687
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,740
Yes.

688
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,710
Let me take a look.

689
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,860
Swab. Thank you.

690
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,140
Swab. Hold that, please.

691
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,210
Tell him she's alive.

692
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,400
We've done all we can. Now we must wait and see.

693
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,080
Thank you, doctor.

694
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,290
Ask him what happened.

695
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,910
People came in cars. His wife could not run fast.

696
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,810
The Big Man cut open two other girls, who died.

697
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,520
We'll know tomorrow.

698
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,140
What have you got there?

699
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,200
Nothing special.

700
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,450
If it's nothing special, then I can see it.

701
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,320
No!

702
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,090
Mom, you can't do that!

703
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,520
Elias, this is a knife.

704
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:58,360
Have you been lying to me and to the police?

705
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,060
Have you gone mad!?

706
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:01,940
No.

707
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,580
What the hell is going on?

708
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,620
Nothing.

709
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,480
Nothing?

710
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,170
Christian...

711
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,080
Christian.

712
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,860
What the hell were you thinking?

713
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,840
Stabbing someone?

714
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,680
You want to ruin your life?

715
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,100
Look at me.

716
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,380
Look at me, Christian.

717
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,400
Look at me!

718
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,180
Christian...

719
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,760
I love you. But this isn't easy for me either.

720
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,540
We have to talk to each other.

721
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,940
Did you fuck her?

722
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,900
Did you fuck Elias' mom?

723
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,110
Why would you say that?

724
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,160
You want to. I can tell.

725
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,820
You achieve nothing by acting like this.

726
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,970
You said we should talk.

727
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,530
Stop it, right now!

728
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,210
Stop thinking and saying crap like that.

729
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,310
It's not crap!

730
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,850
It's crap!

731
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,940
Is that why you're upset with me?

732
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,400
You're such a liar!

733
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,920
Mom knew you were lying. Everyone knows you're lying.

734
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,250
You know what, Christian?

735
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,810
If mom could see you know,

736
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,730
she would be very unhappy to see what you've become.

737
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:23,440
Why do you say such mean things? What did I do to you?

738
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,680
I don't care who you're banging.

739
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,080
You don't tell me what's right and wrong.

740
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,920
This is wrong. And illegal.
Never bring a knife to school again.

741
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,060
Do I make myself clear? Never!

742
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,820
You wanted her to die.

743
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,340
No, I didn't.

744
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,580
Yes, you did!

745
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:50,100
You can't just say it was the best thing for her.

746
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,040
She didn't want to die, and you gave up.

747
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,440
I can't stand people who give up.

748
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,050
Okay?

749
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,010
Christian...

750
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,570
Hi, Sofus.

751
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,930
See you later. Have a nice day.

752
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,550
I didn't tell.

753
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,860
My mom found the knife and freaked out.

754
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,260
Don't you believe me?

755
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,740
Just leave me alone.

756
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,980
Don't text me anymore.

757
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,530
It hurts all the way into his hand.

758
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,880
I can imagine that. I'm gonna give
him some pills, and it will get better.

759
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,980
Easy. Easy. Stay calm.

760
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,160
Are you doctor?

761
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,800
Yes, I am.

762
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,030
Can you fix my leg?

763
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,900
I want to keep it.

764
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,860
I don't want you to cut if off.

765
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,780
I can try.

766
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,420
You can't have any weapons in the camp.

767
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,200
I decide that!

768
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,860
No.

769
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,620
I decide.

770
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,460
Weapons and cars gotta be far away from the camp.

771
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,050
It's Big Man. He's the one that cuts the pregnant women.

772
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,770
He's a monster.

773
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,410
Cars gotta go away.

774
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:11,210
Cars and weapons gotta go far away from the camp.

775
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,610
Otherwise I can't treat you, and you might lose your leg.

776
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,450
Nurse...

777
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,630
Nurse?

778
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,580
Don't help Big Man. He's evil.

779
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,980
Why do you want to help Big Man?

780
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:29,420
Because I have to.

781
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,580
He killed all my babies.

782
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,380
I'm so sorry.

783
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,430
He's evil.

784
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,900
I have to go.

785
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:12,640
You are a strange man.

786
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:36,290
I think it's malaria. I'm treating her for malaria.

787
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,210
She will be well in two, three days.

788
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:01,580
I thought we agreed upon only two here at a time.

789
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,300
Take it easy, doctor. See what they've brought me.

790
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,260
They leave now.

791
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,170
Still bad.

792
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,750
Why is it taking so long?

793
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,900
It's a bad infection.

794
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,700
It takes time. Okay?

795
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,740
I have to regain my strength.

796
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,740
You see Omar over there?

797
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,140
He wants to take my position.

798
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,940
Are you my friend?

799
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,150
No, I'm not.

800
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,660
But I'm doing my best to help you.

801
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,150
Everybody has killed here.

802
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,520
Men, women, children.

803
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,410
As long as I don't kill you, we could be friends.

804
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,620
I can be a very powerful friend.

805
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,400
Answer me!

806
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,530
Bag.

807
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,080
Bag.

808
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,010
Anton.

809
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,350
Anton!

810
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,330
She's gone.

811
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,840
Bag.

812
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,920
She's gone.

813
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,900
Anton.

814
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,660
Bag.

815
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,890
Check her pulse.

816
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:30,280
Please, Anton, stop.

817
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,660
She can make it.

818
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,060
Look at me. She's gone.

819
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,720
She's gone.

820
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,980
Help me please.

821
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,340
Little pussy, big knife.

822
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,160
What did you say?

823
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,500
Little pussy, big knife.

824
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,260
Are you done with her?

825
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,860
Maybe Omar can have her.

826
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,660
Omar likes things that don't move.

827
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,140
Now you go. Out.

828
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,420
Out, out! You leave! Leave! Leave right now!

829
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,380
If you can stand up, you can go! Go! Go!

830
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,980
You're not sick anymore. You leave! You go!

831
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,300
You go!

832
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,860
You're not sick! You leave the camp!

833
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:07,390
Doctor, I'm unarmed. I've got enemies all over.

834
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,940
Not my responsibility. You go now. You're not sick anymore.

835
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,910
Elias.

836
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,760
Hi, sweetheart.

837
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,700
Hi, dad.

838
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,490
Good to see you, my boy.

839
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:32,810
Did we talk about calling each other today?

840
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,390
I just wanted to talk to you.

841
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:43,260
I've had such a busy day. I couldn't remember if we

842
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,000
planned to talk today.

843
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,970
You know Christian?

844
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:56,100
His granddad died a long time ago
and left some fireworks in the barn.

845
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,770
Nobody found them.

846
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:05,960
Dad, can you hear me?
I have to tell you something important.

847
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,970
Christian made a bomb, and he's going to blow up a car.

848
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,610
Hello?

849
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,560
Dad?

850
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,010
I'm here.

851
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,890
Could we... I have had a very stressful day.

852
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,460
Could we talk again tomorrow, same time?

853
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,270
Are you okay?

854
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,500
You seem weirder than usual.

855
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,620
I'm okay.

856
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,800
Can we talk tomorrow?

857
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,140
I have to go.

858
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,670
Okay, dad.

859
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,220
I love you. Kisses.

860
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,660
Come on.

861
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,530
I'm in.

862
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,140
I want to make that bomb.

863
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,500
Let's blow up the asshole's car.

864
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,520
I agree. He deserves it.

865
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,820
Come on, we've got classes.

866
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,490
What about the other cars?

867
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,850
The ones next to it will be hit too.

868
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:11,460
A lot of windows.

869
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,320
What if there are people?

870
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,330
There won't be any.

871
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,210
How do you know?

872
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,220
We'll do it early in the morning.

873
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:24,740
We'll do it Sunday, when everybody's
asleep, and no one will get hurt.

874
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,730
I have a soccer match Sunday.

875
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,440
Not at seven in the morning.

876
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,190
Don't be such a pussy.

877
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,040
I'm not.

878
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,090
You can't back out now.

879
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:39,840
Let's do it.

880
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,970
Sure.

881
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,100
Hold the fuse.

882
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,110
Finished playing?

883
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,980
If I died, would you stay here?

884
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:26,700
I don't wanna argue with you. Don't give me that look.

885
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,540
You're not going to die.

886
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,590
I could.

887
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:32,220
No, you couldn't.

888
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,410
Would you move back to London or live here with grandma?

889
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:40,900
I would be so devastated
that I wouldn't want to live anywhere.

890
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,350
It would be good.

891
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,340
You would have to live somewhere, even if I wasn't here.

892
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:48,400
Why won't you answer my questions?

893
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,280
What do you want me to say?

894
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,580
Like you would be homeless, if I died.

895
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,760
Why do you keep lying to me?

896
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,580
This is crazy. I have never lied to you.

897
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,310
Look at me. I haven't lied to you.

898
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,220
You told me that mom would be OK!

899
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,450
You told me she wasn't in pain.

900
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,040
I'm just as upset about it as you.

901
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,850
I don't think you are.

902
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,330
You wanted her to die.

903
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,980
I know it. Admit it already!

904
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,180
You wanted her to die!

905
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,950
I did want her to die.

906
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,080
In the end.

907
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,200
Because she wanted to.

908
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,420
I couldn't take it anymore.
And she couldn't take it anymore.

909
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:54,060
She was screaming in pain,
and her brain was eaten away by the cancer.

910
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,850
She asked me to help her so many times. To do it.

911
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:00,140
I couldn't do it, because I knew how sad it would make you.

912
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:05,020
And if that is giving up, then I gave up.

913
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,700
I gave up.

914
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,220
But that doesn't mean that I wanted her to die.

915
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:19,980
Christian.

916
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,180
Are you sure about this?

917
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,810
Yep.

918
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,600
You made it bigger.

919
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,780
Come on.

920
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,180
Okay.

921
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,620
We've got about a minute before it blows.
We'll walk calmly back to our bikes.

922
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,980
Don't look back.

923
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:37,850
No!

924
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:38,560
What is it?

925
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:42,980
Elias!

926
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,520
Stop!

927
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,380
Go back! Back! There's a bomb!

928
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,190
No!

929
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:00,840
No!

930
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,850
Elias!

931
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,220
Call an ambulance!

932
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:12,060
Elias? Elias!

933
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,530
What have you got?

934
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,200
Elias, age 12.

935
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,170
He blew up a car.

936
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:40,610
How is he doing?

937
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,020
Breathing steadily, but unstable pulse.

938
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,660
Okay. Someone take care of the mom please?

939
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,260
He's got a large open wound in his abdomen.

940
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,400
Any other injuries?

941
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,420
Stay here.

942
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,780
We'll pack the abdomen with tissues
and examine him thoroughly.

943
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:37,100
Listen to me. What you did is very bad.

944
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,130
But if others are involved, that's another matter.

945
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:46,100
I have to make sure there isn't.

946
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,420
I did it all on my own.

947
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,540
With Elias?

948
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:52,670
It was my idea.

949
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,420
He just tagged along.

950
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:58,580
I called the shots.

951
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,780
So you haven't talked to anyone online?

952
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,700
Gotten ideas from someone?

953
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:05,630
No.

954
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,620
Only the websites I told you about.

955
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:16,500
One of my colleagues is going to
ask you all these questions again.

956
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,610
How about your other son?

957
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,120
How's he doing?

958
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,050
He's at my mother's.

959
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,180
He doesn't know.

960
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:12,960
I would like you to stay here.

961
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,250
Just...

962
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,420
Just stay here.

963
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,100
Sure.

964
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:45,340
Christian is out here. He would like to see Elias.

965
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,550
Can I send him in?

966
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,540
How is he?

967
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,110
Why aren't you with the police?

968
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:17,860
I was.

969
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,820
My dad picked me up.

970
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,270
Where's your dad?

971
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,220
I would like to see Elias on my own.

972
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,090
You shouldn't be here.

973
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,240
You hear me?

974
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,540
You killed him, you psycho!

975
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,690
You killed him.

976
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,200
I did?

977
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,870
Just stay away, okay?

978
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,600
Just stay away.

979
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,070
You killed him because you're such a

980
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:51,870
spoiled, little brat who thinks
he can control other people's lives.

981
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,700
Just get out!

982
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,080
That's enough. Stop!

983
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,940
Come with me.

984
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,290
Marianne, we have the results of the CT scanning.

985
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:09,340
No hemorrhaging in the brain.
Minimal free fluid in the pelvis.

986
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,420
Most likely from the operation.

987
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,620
And no sign of other injuries.

988
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,320
Thank you.

989
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:52,540
That's all from me. Thank you for the help.

990
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:54,900
What will happen to them now?

991
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,800
I couldn't say.

992
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,780
Could they take him away?

993
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,370
No.

994
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:04,520
There are mitigating circumstances.

995
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,380
It will be a case of malicious property damage.
Social services will take over.

996
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,770
Remember that your son saved those people.

997
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,090
Hope he gets well soon.

998
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,140
Thanks.

999
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,220
Elias?

1000
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,310
Elias?

1001
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,320
Good.

1002
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,340
I'll just remove this.

1003
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,250
Look who's here.

1004
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,020
Hi.

1005
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,410
I'm sorry.

1006
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:48,220
Honey...

1007
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,040
Don't be mad at Christian.

1008
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,250
We'll deal with that later.

1009
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,530
Later.

1010
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,210
It was my own fault.

1011
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,620
I wanted to do it.

1012
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,170
I talked Christian into it.

1013
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,660
We'll talk about that later. You just rest.

1014
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,630
How could he do such a thing?

1015
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:21,630
I don't know.

1016
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,510
He'll be fine.

1017
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,160
He'll be okay.

1018
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:36,200
Yes.

1019
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:46,770
I'll take you home, and then I'm going to the summerhouse.

1020
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,600
I don't know what to do.

1021
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,610
Eva said he would hate me.

1022
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,610
Do you think he hates me?

1023
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,440
She was so mean in the end.

1024
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,310
She was...

1025
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,140
She was so mean.

1026
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,140
Bitter.

1027
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,310
I don't know how to make it better.

1028
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,900
He's my little boy, you know?

1029
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,700
Yes?

1030
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,040
Is that Marianne?

1031
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,070
Yes.

1032
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,360
Hi, Marianne. Claus here.

1033
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:22,480
Christian's dad. Sorry to call you at this hour,
but I can't find Christian.

1034
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,880
Is he at your place?

1035
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,640
No, he's not here.

1036
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:41,710
What was that about?

1037
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:47,140
That was Christian's dad. Christian is missing.

1038
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,140
I'm the one who called.

1039
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:54,020
I checked the workshop, but he wasn't there.

1040
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,500
Christian!

1041
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,380
Christian.

1042
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:57,140
It's Elias' dad, Christian.

1043
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,730
Step away from the edge.

1044
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,860
Get away from the edge, Christian.

1045
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,790
Elias is going to be all right.

1046
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:42,430
He's going to be okay.

1047
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,740
You think I would come up here

1048
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:58,180
if Elias wasn't going to be okay?

1049
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,380
I would be with him.

1050
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:04,940
Wouldn't I?

1051
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:10,120
He's going to be okay.

1052
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,900
You have to believe me.

1053
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,250
So I didn't kill him?

1054
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,330
No.

1055
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,810
I thought he was dead.

1056
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,440
He's alive.

1057
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:43,860
And he's going to be okay.

1058
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:47,490
I couldn't picture him.

1059
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,330
I don't know if children look younger.

1060
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,760
When they are dead?

1061
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:56,880
Adults look like children when they are dead.

1062
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,660
I know my mom did.

1063
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,280
She looked like a little girl.

1064
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,140
Like she never grew up.

1065
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,940
Like she was never my mom.

1066
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:28,670
I miss her so much.

1067
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:47,720
Sometimes it feels like there's
a veil between you and death.

1068
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:54,010
But that veil disappears when you...

1069
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:59,280
...lose someone you loved
or someone who was close to you,

1070
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:04,140
and you see death clearly

1071
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,490
for a second.

1072
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,860
But later the veil returns

1073
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,330
and you carry on living.

1074
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,550
Then things will be all right again.

1075
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:25,930
You think so?

1076
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,340
Christian?

1077
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:31,780
Elias' mom is downstairs and would like to talk to you.

1078
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,770
Ow!

1079
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,760
Stop it. Just stop it.

1080
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,020
It's not funny. Stop it!

1081
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,140
Ow! Stop it!

1082
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,930
Morten, stop it already.

1083
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:04,860
That's enough.

1084
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,780
Take it easy.

1085
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,140
Stop it.

1086
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,400
Morten is so annoying.

1087
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,310
Morten, come on. How are you?

1088
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:26,460
Look at this. He can't do anything.

1089
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,530
Stop it!

1090
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:31,280
Let's leave them alone and go to the cafeteria.

1091
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,340
I want a Coke!

1092
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:33,660
You can have a small one.

1093
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:34,910
A large one.

1094
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,980
Didn't you have one when we got here?

1095
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:39,290
I would like another one.

1096
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,970
Doesn't it hurt?

1097
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,780
They give me these pills.

1098
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:05,450
I told the police everything that happened.

1099
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,450
Me too.

1100
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:15,260
It's weird. I've slept for days, but I'm still tired.

1101
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:20,020
I just want to say I'm sorry.

1102
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,500
You don't have to.

1103
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:24,500
Yes, I do.

1104
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,120
I've been an idiot.

1105
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:30,020
That's all right.

1106
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,330
I can't wait till you're back in school.

1107
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:41,680
Same here.
