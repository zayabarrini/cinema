1
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,351
"This isn't a tale of heroic feats.

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,939
It's about two lives running parallel for a while,

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,610
with common aspirations and similar dreams."
Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, 1952

4
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,083
Goodbye boys, life-long companions

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,253
Dear old-time gang

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,809
The plan:

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,354
8000 kilometres in four months.

8
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,732
The method:

9
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,442
improvisation.

10
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,031
We've got to be ready for certain things in life...

11
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,158
The goal:

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,245
to explore a continent
we had only known in books.

13
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,875
the motorcycle diaries

14
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,585
Good night, Granado.

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,088
The equipment:

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,173
"The Mighty One,"

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,968
an aged, leaky 1 939 Norton 500.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,144
The pilot:

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,646
Alberto Granado,

20
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,482
chubby, 29, friend and biochemist,

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,526
self-proclaimed "wandering scientist".

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,653
Alberto's dream:

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,780
to finish the journey on his 30th birthday.

24
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:03,205
Co-pilot: me, Ernesto Guevara de la Serna.
"El Fuser", 23.

25
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,207
Is Ernesto really going?

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,291
No, Ernesto is staying.

27
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,461
Ernesto, will you take me with you?
Let's go together!

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,630
Sorry Dad but the more you tell me...

29
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,758
You're only one semester away
from becoming a doctor.

30
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,218
That can wait.

31
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,391
Medical student, specialising in leprosy,

32
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,059
Here comes furious Serna!

33
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,478
...amateur rugby player,

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,563
Kick it!

35
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,149
Nice shot, Fuser!

36
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,568
...and occasional asthmatic.

37
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,747
Date of departure, January 4th.

38
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,832
The route:

39
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,335
Buenos Aires to Patagonia, and then into Chile...

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,799
then north, 6000 metres up
the rugged spine of the Andes to Machu Picchu.

41
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,929
Then, the San Pablo Leper Colony
in the Peruvian Amazon.

42
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,769
The final destination:
the Guajira Peninsula in Venezuela.

43
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,189
We land on the Guajira Peninsula.

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,274
The tip of this grand continent.

45
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,195
Bellies full of wine and two
tropical beauties, hopefully sisters...

46
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,321
That beer's good, huh?

47
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,033
ByJanuary 4th you'll have
finished your exams, right?

48
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:27,998
If you'd like, I'll agree to make a little detour,
go by Miramar, see your girlfriend.

49
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,541
My girlfriend...

50
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,626
A couple of days.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,465
Check out that guy over there.

52
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,633
Yeah?

53
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,718
Do you want to end up like that?

54
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,597
You don't wanna end up like that, Fuser.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,476
All you want is to get laid
in every country in South America.

56
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,897
In every town too, if we're lucky.
Adds a little spice.

57
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,982
What we had in common:

58
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,569
our restlessness, our impassioned spirits,

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,365
and a love for the open road.

60
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,037
Come on Ernestito, we don't have all day.

61
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,206
-Isn't this too much stuff?
-Just enough.

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,334
Norton 500. A real motorcycle.

63
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,254
Don't worry about your son,
he'll be well taken care of.

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,338
Son...

65
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,011
Tough times are ahead.

66
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,349
To tell the truth, I've always dreamt
of doing something like this.

67
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,518
I confess that if I were a few years younger

68
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,479
I'd climb on that motorcycle with you.

69
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,147
Imagine I'm doing it for both of us.

70
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,191
Ten years, planning this trip, Uncle.

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,567
You were a kid...

72
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,780
Meanwhile, I trust you.

73
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,659
So, when's the revolution coming?

74
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,035
Here?

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,789
-In about a century.
-We should learn from the Russians.

76
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,667
-Leaving already?
-Yes. I'm off.

77
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,591
The only thing you need to worry about
is taking your medicine...

78
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,385
and writing to me.

79
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,596
The most beautiful letters you'll ever read, Mum.

80
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,473
-Goodbye, my darling.
-You'll see.

81
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,858
Bye, sis! Take care!

82
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,819
Bye!

83
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,529
-No.
-Juan Martín!

84
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,239
-Bye!
-Write to me.

85
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,490
Okay?

86
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,996
Send me postcards.

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,124
Enough sentimentality,
you're gonna make me cry.

88
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,043
Take care.

89
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,173
So, just like Don Quixote had Rocinante,
San Martín had his mule,

90
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,717
-we have "The Mighty One."
-Yeah, which pees oil.

91
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,804
Yeah, she pees oil. What I'm trying
to say is that in this very instant,

92
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,098
young Fuser and your servant here,

93
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,268
embark on a journey to
the farthest reaches of the human spirit,

94
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,606
where we will encounter new lands,
hear new anthems, eat new fruits...

95
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,026
Granado, I'm holding you responsible.
Anything that happens to Ernesto,

96
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,029
I'm going to burn you down.
Put on the scarf, honey.

97
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,367
Don't worry, ma'am. He'll come back
and be the doctor we all want him to be.

98
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,786
It's time to go!

99
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,624
That bike is a good excuse for walking.

100
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,629
So long!

101
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,931
Watch out!

102
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,015
He's crazy!

103
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,517
Animal!

104
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,607
Careful with that bike!

105
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,498
Dear Mum,

106
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,458
Buenos Aires is behind us.

107
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:05,382
Gone is "this wretched life," the uninspiring
lectures, the papers and medical exams.

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,552
All of Latin America is ahead of us.

109
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,972
From now on, we only trust in "The Mighty One."

110
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,250
I wish you could see us! We look like outlaws,
commanding attention everywhere we go...

111
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,767
Open it up, Mial! Put her into orbit!

112
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,314
-Don't quit on me, Mighty One!
-Come on!

113
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,651
-What happened, Mial?
-Fucking shit!

114
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:18,288
I am glad we've left "civilization" behind
and are now a bit closer to the land.

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,125
What's going on?

116
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,502
We're losing our bags!

117
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,337
Problems! Problems!

118
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,132
Damn! Fucking shit!

119
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,386
-Fuser, are you all right?
-Yeah, you?

120
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,516
What's up, little one?

121
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,439
Are you okay?

122
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,401
-What the fuck is that?
-What the fuck does it look like?

123
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,030
-A fucking dog!
-You're a fucking shitty driver!

124
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,366
Fuck you! What's that fucking dog
doing on my bike?

125
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,701
It's for Chichina. His name is "Come-back".

126
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,414
Go on, pick up the bike.

127
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,813
Where the fuck are we, in Switzerland?

128
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,278
-Good day.
-Good day.

129
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,948
-Chichina?
-She's at the beach with the family.

130
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,451
The bike's not doing so well.

131
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,499
So, Esteban, tell us about your trip.

132
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,126
It was fantastic, Don Horacio.

133
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,587
I had the opportunity
to take a seminar in Cambridge

134
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,341
and spend a couple of weeks in London,
a fascinating city.

135
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,844
-Oh, what a privilege.
-Yes. A privilege.

136
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,306
Esteban is about to get his doctorate...

137
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,183
In medicine?

138
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,393
No. In law.

139
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,854
Oh, law...

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,625
One, two, three, four. Tango, Fuser!

141
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,794
It's your turn now...

142
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,339
I've never seen a pig who liked to dance. Ever.

143
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,760
-Yeah.
-Fuck off.

144
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,307
With this foot, one... back, back...

145
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,017
What are you laughing at?

146
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,270
-What are you laughing at?
-You.

147
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,696
Tonight?

148
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,282
Dad asked Aunt Rosana
not to let me out of her sight.

149
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,161
And Mum promised the Virgin
that she'd walk to her sanctuary...

150
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,996
if we break up.

151
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,543
Don't your parents realise
that the deeper you bury the diamonds,

152
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,962
the more determined the pirate is, to take them?

153
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,339
Believe me,

154
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,300
this diamond wouldn't mind being taken.

155
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,056
Dance.

156
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,648
Look at them.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,318
Check out La Negra!

158
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,162
Let's check out the bathroom.

159
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,751
Good night.

160
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,336
-Good night, girls.
-Good night.

161
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,259
-Good night.
-Good night.

162
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,512
So, Aunt Rosana,

163
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,848
which room do I get?

164
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,652
Get out, Come-back. Scat!

165
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,914
What happened there...?

166
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,459
-Come here.
-Don't tickle me!

167
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,618
How long did you say we'd be here?

168
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,953
You know how long.

169
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,037
Two days.

170
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,373
And how long has it been?

171
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,583
Are you gonna use wire
in the operating room, too?

172
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,377
Six days, Fuser!

173
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,092
They're going to kill us!

174
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,573
If you stayed we could do many things,
Ernesto, but only if you stayed.

175
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,996
-That didn't sound so good.
-What do you want to hear?

176
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,999
That I'll wait for you?

177
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,459
I told you I'm coming back.

178
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,337
I have the dog to prove it.

179
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,381
Don't you like him?

180
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,260
What do you want, Ernesto?

181
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,762
What do you want to hear?

182
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,308
That I'll wait forever, that I'll
wait months on end for you to return?

183
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,107
-What's up with you?
-What do you want?

184
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,110
What?

185
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,950
I'd like for you to stay like this, silent.

186
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,916
I want to look at you.
I won't see you for a long time.

187
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,261
I will wait for you, but don't take forever.

188
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,644
Define "forever."

189
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,647
Thin ice, mister!

190
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,738
I won't touch you again.

191
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,539
Oh, no, I hurt you. Did I hurt you?

192
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,086
It's a trick. A really bad one.

193
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,799
Okay, lovebirds, it's time to go.

194
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,925
Fuser...

195
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,221
Take care, Miss Ferreyra.

196
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,557
Thanks for everything.

197
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,831
On the boat I heard
the moist slap of bare feet

198
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,583
and foresaw faces
dark with hunger.

199
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,421
My heart was a pendulum
between her and the street.

200
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,759
I don't know what strength broke me
free from her eyes, loose from her arms.

201
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,639
She remained clouded by tears,
her anguish hidden by the rain.

202
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,808
-Is that Lorca?
-No.

203
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,227
-Neruda?
-No.

204
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,854
Who?

205
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,939
I don't remember.

206
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,635
Goodbye!

207
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,141
Wait, wait... there.

208
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm getting snot all over this...

209
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,981
So with Chichina - nothing?

210
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,029
Even after you gave her
a purebred German shepherd, nothing?

211
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,658
At least tell me you saw one tit. One little tit.

212
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:06,000
Ah, so you saw her titties then. All right, my man!

213
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,295
Scalpel.

214
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,965
American dollars.

215
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,842
Fifteen.

216
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,344
Chichina?

217
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,428
Yup.

218
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,514
That girl's perfect for you. I've always said so:

219
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,933
that is Ernesto's girlfriend.
No we'll be able to eat like kings.

220
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,518
-No.
-A succulent protein-filled meal.

221
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,354
She gave me this money in case
we make it to the United States.

222
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,731
She asked me to buy her a bathing suit.

223
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,984
I said I would.

224
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,278
What?

225
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,490
Pretend this money doesn't exist. It's off-limits.

226
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,701
He's testing me... I'm gonna kill him.

227
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,203
Are you talking to the bike again?

228
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,707
What the hell are you thinking?
This girl's got you by the balls!

229
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,292
-No...
-Fuser!

230
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,086
Don't get all worked up, fatty.

231
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,463
-Hello.
-Good afternoon.

232
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,942
How's the bike feel?

233
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,652
It's amazing, you can fix anything with wire.

234
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,737
It's riding better than ever.

235
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,621
Damn it! Fucking shit!

236
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,916
You all right, Fuser?

237
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,087
Damn curve.

238
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,930
Look at the exhaust pipe!
Damn it to hell and back!

239
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,475
Get more pegs! I've run out!

240
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,602
Don't bust my balls!

241
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,021
-Just grab it!
-You had to choose this spot, asshole!

242
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,024
-You're the one that chose it!
-Hold on to that side!

243
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,776
-You hold on to your side first!
-Come on!

244
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,487
-I just can't!
-Come on!

245
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,574
The ground is wet!
What the fuck do you want me to do?

246
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,619
Fucking shit!

247
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,122
No, the river took it!

248
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,790
Get it, get it!

249
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,960
It's gone!

250
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,131
Just take it...

251
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,099
Why don't we go up to that ranch?

252
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,517
With those snobs?

253
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,103
We'll find help down here,
among the people, don't you think?

254
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,188
Yeah.

255
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,903
-Should we do the broken headlight thing?
-Red October.

256
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,280
-What's Red October?
-You have your medical ID, right?

257
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

258
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,079
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

259
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,373
What do you want?

260
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,877
It may not look like it,
but, well, we're both doctors...

261
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,089
from Buenos Aires and Córdoba, respectively.

262
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,883
We are travelling the length
and breadth of the country...

263
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,760
Well, he's got one, too.

264
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:07,848
We're travelling all over doing some
research with the hope of curing

265
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,560
some of the most terrifying diseases
of the 20th century.

266
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,521
Plagues that not only consume our energies

267
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,650
but also keep Argentina under total dependence.

268
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:22,321
As a matter of fact, if you read
the medical literature, you'll note, as we have...

269
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,616
What the fuck do you bums want?

270
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:33,416
Look, sir. The wind took our tent.
We're starving and need a place to sleep.

271
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:40,673
There's a shed out there with a good floor.
You can sleep with the migrants.

272
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,093
But we're doctors...

273
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,430
I like your face very much.

274
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,807
Yours, fatty, I don't like.

275
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,646
-It's cool.
-It's okay.

276
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,162
Dear Mum.

277
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:17,376
We're still going strong, though
"The Mighty One" isn't so mighty any more.

278
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:36,312
Money and food are scarce but we've
managed to scrounge some free food,

279
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,566
thanks to our secret weapon,

280
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,069
Alberto's impeccable bullshitting.

281
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,572
...trying to wipe out some of the most
terrifying diseases of the 20th...

282
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,950
-So you two are doctors?
-Well, no...

283
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,120
Alberto is a biochemist and I'm in medical school.

284
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,707
He practically has a degree.
We're as good as doctors.

285
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,669
Then I'd like you to look at this lump on my neck.

286
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,632
-Mister...
-Von Puttkamer.

287
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,347
Does it hurt?

288
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,310
It's a tumour.

289
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,561
What so you mean, a tumour?

290
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,771
Yes.

291
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,857
-You think so?
-Yeah.

292
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,738
-I don't know, Fuser.
-I do.

293
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,116
It looks like an adipose deposit,
it could be a cyst.

294
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,159
No. It's a tumour.

295
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,622
It's a tumour in the occipital zone,
probably of hydatid origin.

296
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,001
Schatzie, these gentlemen say I have a tumour!

297
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,462
No... Good day, ma'am.

298
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,007
Honestly, I don't think it's a tumour,
it's a sebaceous cyst.

299
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,344
If you'll give us some food and a place
to crash, we may be able to treat you.

300
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,263
No, look, we can't treat you.

301
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,807
Don't worry, you just need to go to Buenos Aires,

302
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,934
I can recommend you to a specialist, but...

303
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,727
We could try to help him.

304
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,607
How? With a couple of herbs
from their garden? With prayers?

305
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,277
I see, there's nothing you can do for me.

306
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,946
Yes, we can. If you give us food
and a place to sleep...

307
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,782
There's a lake full of fish and a tool shed nearby.

308
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,534
Sir, it's a very premature diagnosis.

309
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,703
This conversation is over, doctors.

310
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,789
Let's go, Schatzie.

311
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,881
Work with me next time, okay?

312
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,551
Sure, I'll work with you
but not at the expense of a man's health.

313
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,762
Let's suppose you were right,
the geezer had a tumour,

314
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,140
how the fuck can you just tell him
like that? Unbelievable!

315
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,185
It's the truth.
If he can't take it, that's his problem.

316
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,563
You made him shit his pants,
you can't treat a patient like that.

317
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,733
The guy has a tumour,
the sooner he deals with it, the better.

318
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,570
It's the proper treatment,
or didn't you learn that in pharmacy school?

319
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,367
Look, you idiot, don't talk to me
about proper medicine.

320
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,621
You little nurse. Get your degree, then we'll talk.

321
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,831
Fucking know-it-all.

322
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,458
Let's look for food.

323
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,420
Duck, duck, duck.
Give me the gun, man! Come on!

324
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,765
-I got it, man!
-Very good!

325
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,393
-How did you do that?
-Now we're totally fucked.

326
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,356
Well, there is no choice now
but to jump in the lake and get our food.

327
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,484
Fuser, jump in the water and get our food.

328
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,278
You're nuts if you think I'm getting in.
Do you have any idea how cold it is?

329
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,741
Yeah. I know you're allergic to the cold,
the water, the heat and all that...

330
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:40,412
but you know what? I'm older,
wiser, and I did all the shooting.

331
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,289
It was dumb luck! Besides, I have asthma.

332
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,751
Okay, you're right. If you can't, I'll do it.

333
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,546
-I never said "can't."
-"Can't," "won't"...

334
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,130
-What's the difference?
-I didn't say, "I can't."

335
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,132
Or don't want to, same thing.

336
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,927
Otherwise, give me Chichina's dollars,

337
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,054
and we'll feast like kings.

338
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,432
Look, if I get that fucking duck,
I'll eat it by myself.

339
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,310
Like a duck to water, quack, quack, quack!

340
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,397
I'm freezing my balls off!

341
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,482
So what? You're not using them.

342
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,484
Come on.

343
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,240
Good, Fuser! Good! Bring that ducky with fries...

344
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,616
Is it cold out there?

345
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,660
Hey! You cold?

346
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,328
I'm not.

347
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,165
Duck?

348
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,504
Are you feeling shitty?

349
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,757
No, I feel wonderful.

350
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,853
Here.

351
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,109
Fuser...

352
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,045
Okay...

353
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,382
Fuser, listen to me.

354
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,887
Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars
and we'll go to a real hospital.

355
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,350
Ask again and I'll vomit on you.

356
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:14,274
Dear Mum, what do we leave behind
when we cross a frontier?

357
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,444
Each moment seems split in two:

358
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:24,952
melancholy for what is left behind,
and the excitement of entering a new land.

359
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,665
Look, Mial!

360
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,542
Chile.

361
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,918
Chile!

362
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,212
Long live Chile!

363
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,593
-Is it the first time you've left the country?
-Yes.

364
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,387
You're practically a man.

365
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,434
Listen, when we're old and tired of travelling,

366
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,355
we should come back
and set up a clinic on this lake.

367
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,151
-Huh?
-Not a bad idea.

368
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,988
We'd treat everybody.
If anybody comes out here...

369
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,823
Count me in, brother.

370
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,827
Things are looking up, Fuser.

371
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:13,292
-Is that snow piling up?
-Nah, that's just a little frost, man.

372
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,692
One, two, three...

373
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,362
That's it!

374
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,532
I hope the chain doesn't freeze up
because we'll be screwed...

375
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,659
Come on!

376
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,998
Come on! Come on! Come on!

377
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,958
There you go...

378
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,590
Fuck, it's cold.

379
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,092
Nice little summer we're having...

380
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,822
Hey, you said we'd enter Chile like conquerors,

381
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,408
-not like a pair of assholes.
-If you don't like it, go fuck yourself, Ernesto.

382
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,662
Why don't we dump this thing?
It's nothing but trouble.

383
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,748
Oh, yeah? And travel the whole continent
on foot, genius?

384
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,294
Yes. We'd see more, meet more people...

385
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,171
you could lose a few pounds.

386
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,883
Come on, you queer, with a couple of
Chichina's dollars, this is history.

387
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,427
Same old song! Forget the money!

388
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,181
If that's your answer,
you go to Venezuela on foot,

389
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,226
just leave me the hell alone
and take your boss's money.

390
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,272
I could probably make it there in half
the time if you'd mind your own business.

391
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,023
You motherfucker!

392
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,781
Ooh, Ernestito, bring me
those Yankee panties, from Miami...

393
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,200
Don't you realise you'll never
see her wearing them,

394
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,786
and she'll never take them off for you, asshole!

395
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,373
Fuser!

396
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:25,549
You know what your problem is, Fuser?
Your fucking honesty.

397
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,012
You could help out
with a little lie once in a while.

398
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,223
AUSTRAL NEWSPAPER

399
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,392
Just hold it.

400
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,145
Hey!

401
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,188
What are you doing?

402
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,107
What's up?

403
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,859
Come in!

404
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,910
Thank you.

405
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,828
-Maté?
-Yes.

406
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,122
-Thank you very much.
-No sugar.

407
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,832
-What is your name?
-Teresa.

408
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,668
-Teresa. Ernesto.
-Nice to meet you.

409
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,213
There, hold it up.

410
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,924
It'll make a nice souvenir.

411
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,801
A souvenir, huh?
I'll take it back to Argentina with me.

412
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,095
-Are you travelling?
-Yeah, we are.

413
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,847
We're the ones with that beat-up bike out there.

414
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,474
-Oh, that big one over there?
-Yeah.

415
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,185
-And what is this?
-Mussels.

416
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,187
-And these? These are clams, no?
-They're clams.

417
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,607
-Just normal clams?
-Clams are always clams.

418
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,859
Maybe next time.

419
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:36,370
The Austral News!
The Austral News for only 3 pesos!

420
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,874
News of Chile and the world, the Austral News!

421
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,584
Just 3 pesos!

422
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,545
News of Chile and the world, the Austral News!

423
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,382
Yesterday afternoon,
Temuco was honoured by the arrival

424
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,551
of two of the most prestigious leprosy experts
in South America.

425
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,846
Dr Alberto Granados from Córdoba...

426
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,349
-What do you mean, "Granados?"
-Yeah, that's what it says.

427
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:02,521
And Dr Ernesto Guevara de la Serna
from Buenos Aires,

428
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:07,109
have embarked on an epic journey from their
native soil to the northern tip of Venezuela.

429
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,238
The charismatic scientists-adventurers,
experts in their field,

430
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,241
have treated 3000 patients across the continent.

431
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,534
All right!

432
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,787
They expect to complete their marathon-trek

433
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,747
in a record-setting five months,

434
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,127
just in time to celebrate the youthful,
Dr Granados' 30th birthday.

435
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,922
-It says "youthful."
-Yeah, they lied a bit too.

436
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,757
Think it'll work?

437
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,106
Hello. Good afternoon.

438
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,068
My friend and I are having problems
with our bike.

439
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,238
The steering is broken, the brakes are shot...

440
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:57,242
-and the gears are all messed up.
-My ass is killing me.

441
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,204
Well, the steering, brakes and gears I can fix...

442
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,083
but I'm afraid your ass is out of luck.

443
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,003
And we're broke.

444
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,550
What? You don't have a penny?

445
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,178
We're getting some money in Valparaíso,

446
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,637
we'll send it to you then.

447
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,681
I have no disrespect in my heart...

448
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,726
but if you have no money,
you have no business being here.

449
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,563
Forgive me for interrupting, sir,
but if you help us out now,

450
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,233
you'd be doing incalculable service to
bilateral relations among our countries.

451
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,821
-You expect me to fix it for free?
-I don't think we're being clear.

452
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:39,493
We can't assume everyone will know who's
who in the Latin American medical field.

453
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,579
-Doctor, if you will.
-Yes, of course...as it so happens...

454
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:49,544
an article came out just today
in The Austral...the newspaper.

455
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,677
Allow me.

456
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,351
Look, Piedad.

457
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,480
Tulio!

458
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,651
-The picture isn't very good.
-Yeah, it's not very flattering.

459
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,820
It's them.

460
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,534
Gentlemen, it would be an honour
to fix your motorcycle.

461
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,660
Thank you very much.

462
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,703
After I finish playing this card game
with my wife, of course.

463
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,122
Of course.

464
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,207
Priority number one!

465
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,044
You know, there's a dance
at the City Hall tonight...

466
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,839
and God willing, all the young girls
in town will be there.

467
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,924
That's too bad!

468
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,884
Should I bring the bike in later?

469
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,303
Leave it right here, we'll fix it up for you.

470
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:56,111
My love, I'm gonna buy...
a little plane for us to fly

471
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,904
Allow me...

472
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,199
during our sweet honeymoon, my love

473
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:08,081
My love, I'm gonna buy...
a little train to take a ride

474
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,419
during our sweet honeymoon

475
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,298
Listen to his voice as he walks on

476
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,759
he sings us Chipi Chipi
to dance along!

477
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,223
-Chipi Chipi...
-Hey...

478
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,351
Learn to dance the rhythm
of the Chipi Chipi...

479
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,298
You know, I was just thinking about you...

480
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,967
Yeah? Why?

481
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,430
You made a strong impression on me
from the start.

482
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,977
Thanks.

483
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,859
Do you want to dance?

484
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,822
No...I don't dance.

485
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,202
My husband's fallen asleep. He's drunk.

486
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,663
I have no one to dance with.

487
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,833
Well, if you teach me.

488
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,335
Yes?

489
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,356
You finally remembered you're a man, huh?

490
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,358
Oh, had you forgotten?

491
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,361
I haven't danced for a long time...

492
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,990
but it's all coming back.

493
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,421
I can't dance any more.

494
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,261
Do you want to keep dancing?

495
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,639
Wouldn't you like to step out?

496
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,395
-I'd love to.
-Yes.

497
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,647
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay, let's go then.

498
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,695
-What's wrong?
-Not now!

499
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,824
-Come on, it's okay.
-Let me go!

500
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,077
Hey, asshole, the Argentinian
is hitting on your wife!

501
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,829
Let me go!

502
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,581
I'm sorry, excuse me!

503
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,791
You motherfucking Argentinian!

504
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,044
Fuser!

505
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,589
I'm gonna get you,
you Argentinian son-of-a-bitch!

506
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,557
You Argentinian bastards!

507
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,812
Let's get them!

508
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,984
-Fucking shit!
-The chain!

509
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,112
Hit it, hit it!

510
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,115
-Yeah!
-Yes!

511
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,867
Faster, faster!

512
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,010
Are you tired?

513
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,637
No.

514
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,347
Do you want to switch?

515
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,390
No.

516
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,933
Are you sure?

517
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,161
Cows!

518
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,288
-Hit the brakes!
-What brakes?

519
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,874
-What do you mean?
-The brakes are gone!

520
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,709
Fucking mechanic!

521
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,393
You all right?

522
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,020
I'm great! What do you want me to say, Fuser?

523
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,362
Goddamn mechanic!

524
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,937
Is he your dad?

525
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,690
Yes.

526
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,741
That cow's going blind.

527
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,538
All she's going to see is shit.

528
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,479
We are 25 days behind schedule.

529
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,990
Hello...

530
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,661
It is rumoured that Chilean girls are
the most daring in the continent.

531
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:24,874
Rumours have no scientific value,
Dr Granado. Time to do some research.

532
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,002
-Don't you like him?
-No.

533
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,963
You don't like either of them?

534
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,798
Here they come.

535
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,720
Hi, girls.

536
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,473
Excuse us, but this place is packed.

537
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,850
-Can we join you?
-Yes.

538
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,978
-You don't mind?
-Thank you.

539
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,145
Hello.

540
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,148
-Ernesto.
-He's Alberto.

541
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,609
-Miss?
-Jazmin.

542
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,570
-Daniela.
-A pleasure.

543
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,862
A real pleasure.

544
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,117
-Are you two Argentinian?
-How'd you know?

545
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,329
Well, because of your accent,
because Argentinians always say "che"...

546
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,249
-Had you noticed, che?
-Not at all, che.

547
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,504
Do you know what day it is?

548
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:16,217
February 26.

549
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,512
Sounds unbelievable, but it's been a year.

550
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,975
-A year since what?
-One year since we started this trip.

551
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:30,189
One year, and we're flat broke,
we can't even celebrate. What a shame.

552
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,775
Why don't you let us treat you
to a bottle of wine?

553
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,360
-Wine?
-Wine...

554
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,862
Lucho!

555
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:41,743
A bottle of wine for our
courageous, Argentine visitors.

556
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,290
Girls, don't be offended, but I can't drink wine.

557
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,500
Why couldn't you drink just a bit?

558
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,379
Exactly... There's an old custom in Argentina...

559
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,048
No, please don't.

560
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,382
What is it?

561
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:01,763
-I think they deserve an explanation.
-They do.

562
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,181
Thank you, Lucho.

563
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:10,396
An old custom in Argentina doesn't
allow us to drink on an empty stomach.

564
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:14,192
Since we're flat broke, we can't buy food

565
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:20,490
and must reject your generous offer. That's it.

566
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,368
Come on, lighten up.

567
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,744
Lucho.

568
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,831
Lucho, could you bring us some empanadas?

569
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,043
-Do you like Chilean empanadas?
-I've never tasted Chilean empanadas.

570
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,169
Four? Eight?

571
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,462
Well...they do look hungry.

572
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,630
Twelve.

573
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,466
What a nice number.
I've always liked that number.

574
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,929
-Wish we could stay!
-Too bad we have nowhere to crash.

575
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,597
We'll sleep out in the park.

576
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,685
Listen...my dad's fond of Argentinians.

577
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,188
-No joke!
-Honest. He might be able to help you.

578
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,316
Since Dad's chief of the fire brigade,
he knows lots of people.

579
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,568
What? You two are sisters?

580
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,904
Of course.

581
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,365
Look.

582
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,200
Can't you tell?

583
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,454
The mechanic won't be in until tomorrow,
but the bike can stay right here.

584
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,706
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much, Sir.

585
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,624
Guys! Cañaco! Come!

586
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,877
I'm going to introduce you
to two Argentinian volunteers

587
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,629
that will be spending the night here with you.

588
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:21,008
This is Doctor skinny Che,
and this is Doctor chubby Che.

589
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,593
-Pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

590
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,973
-Why don't we go take in the town?
-Good idea, but...

591
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,642
Don't you worry, sir.

592
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,645
Excuse me. Sorry!

593
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,647
Hello.

594
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,360
I don't want to bother you,
but are you really doctors?

595
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,528
-No.
-Yes.

596
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,905
Actually, I'm a biochemist.

597
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,741
Could you come see a sick woman?

598
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,536
-Yes. Whenever you say, just...
-Could we do it now?

599
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,831
It's been a long time since she's
seen a doctor, she's really in bad shape.

600
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:55,001
Sure. Let me get my things.

601
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,005
Well, one has to remain faithful
to the Hippocratic oath...

602
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,841
-Ernesto.
-Moncho.

603
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,843
-Poncho?
-Moncho.

604
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,179
Excuse me.

605
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,312
Look me in the eye.

606
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,572
I'm going to touch your neck.

607
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,540
Has she eaten?

608
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,794
I don't know.

609
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,617
Look, Mrs Rosa,
I'm going to leave these little pills.

610
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,998
Take one with each meal
and one before sleeping.

611
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,752
This will help you feel better.

612
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:33,057
I knew I was powerless to help her, Mum...

613
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,937
This poor old woman who only a month ago
waited tables, wheezing like I do,

614
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,606
trying to live with dignity.

615
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,862
In her dying eyes there was
a plea for forgiveness

616
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:51,075
and for solace, now vanished,

617
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:57,832
just as her body will soon be lost,
in the great mystery that surrounds us.

618
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:10,678
Fuser, you still haven't asked about
the research I did on our Chilean sisters.

619
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,431
You can't imagine how depressed I am

620
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,142
that you're the sexual ambassador of Argentina!

621
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,393
It's true.

622
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,062
Are you the clowns that ride
that crippled piece of shit?

623
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,649
Her name is "The Mighty One."

624
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,817
Her name was "The Mighty One."

625
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,404
Now she can be baptized "The Deceased,"
"The Dearly Departed," "The Paraplegic"...

626
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,657
-Really? And why's that?
-Why?

627
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,284
Because I am the mechanic.

628
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:38,873
You could make a buck selling her
for scrap. Chile is her last stop.

629
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,183
Gonna miss you, girl.

630
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,028
I'll carry yours today. Come on.

631
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,620
What'll we do? Go on?

632
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,455
Of course.

633
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,124
A man turns 30 only once, right?

634
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,927
You're something else, Ernesto de la Serna...

635
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,432
-I mean, if we spend Chichina's...
-Nope! Don't even think it.

636
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,902
Hey! Hey!

637
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,822
He stopped! Come on!

638
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,642
There she is, Valparaíso.

639
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,395
"I love Valparaíso,

640
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:31,027
all you encompass, all you radiate,
lover of the ocean, far from..."

641
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,863
-Federico García Lorca.
-No!

642
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,197
Neruda!

643
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,594
Thank you.

644
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,014
-From Chichina?
-From Chichina. And the money?

645
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,934
-Should I open it?
-Go ahead.

646
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,480
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

647
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,200
I love you so much, Celia de la Serna.

648
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,958
What happened?

649
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,173
Fuser?

650
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,439
-Hey, you ready?
-Me?

651
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,151
-Yup.
-Of course...

652
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,360
Right away!

653
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,778
You know what?

654
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,739
I liked my plan better, Fuser!

655
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,245
You are such an arrogant bastard.
You could at least answer me!

656
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,790
What do you wanna do? Go back?

657
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,792
Go on, go back!

658
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,129
I'll get to the mine and tell you all about it.

659
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,757
Are you saying I can't make it?

660
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,720
If you can, little asthmatic doctor, then I can.

661
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,431
-Just shut up and walk!
-Pain in the ass!

662
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,266
Now you wanna beat me?

663
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,816
Stop, goddamn it!

664
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,787
Good afternoon, hi.

665
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,874
I'm Ernesto, good to meet you.

666
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,136
Yes.

667
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,846
Right there.

668
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,516
Home.

669
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,938
We didn't have much, just some tough, dry land.

670
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,649
It belonged to his grandpa.

671
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,696
It was ours. Until a land speculator forced us off.

672
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,532
That's what they call progress.

673
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,703
So we had to leave our son
with our family and hit the road,

674
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,621
looking for work,

675
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,542
trying to escape from the police
who want to throw us in jail,

676
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,419
Why?

677
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,380
Because we are communists.

678
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,674
Now we're going to a mine.

679
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,135
If we're lucky, I'll find some work.

680
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,056
It's so dangerous, they don't
care what party you belong to.

681
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,562
Are you two looking for work?

682
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,064
No, we're not looking for work.

683
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,733
No?

684
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,236
Then why are you travelling?

685
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,951
We traveljust to travel.

686
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,668
Bless you...

687
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,590
Blessed be your travels.

688
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,015
-Here.
-Thank you.

689
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,145
-Have a maté.
-Thank you.

690
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,108
Their faces were tragic and haunting.

691
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,531
They told us of comrades who had
mysteriously disappeared,

692
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,702
and were said to be somewhere
at the bottom of the sea.

693
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,542
It was one of the coldest nights of my life,

694
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:28,634
but also one which made me feel closer
to this strange, for me anyway, human race.

695
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,813
You!

696
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,065
You, too.

697
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,734
You, over there.

698
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,444
You.

699
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,577
Not you! The one next to you!

700
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,289
Move it, move it! Get a move on, guys!

701
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,506
You there, you too. Up there!

702
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,467
Move along!

703
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,476
The one in the back. You, too.

704
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,523
The one up there, you.

705
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:29,987
Hurry up. Get on the truck.

706
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,947
The rest of you, go home!

707
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,908
Hurry up, move it!

708
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,411
This truck is full...

709
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,676
Hey, come on!

710
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,224
You two! What are you doing here?

711
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,227
-Nothing, just looking.
-Looking at what, asshole?

712
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,605
This is not a tourist attraction, get lost!

713
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,940
Don't you see these people are thirsty?

714
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,234
Why don't you give them some water, damn it?

715
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,613
Get out before I call security
and have you locked up, asshole.

716
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,615
-What would they?
-Why?

717
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,535
Trespassing. This is property
of the Anaconda Mining Company.

718
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,371
Watch the door.

719
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,461
You son-of-a-bitch!

720
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,075
As we left Chuquicamata
we could feel the world changing

721
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,785
or was it us?

722
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,417
The deeper we go in the Andes,
the more indigenous people we encounter,

723
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,380
who are homeless in their own land.

724
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,680
We finally entered Peru,

725
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,933
thanks to a half-blind trucker named Félix.

726
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:30,566
And guess what? Alberto turned 30,
but not in Venezuela as he had planned.

727
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:36,655
We were so tired, Mum, we couldn't celebrate.

728
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,327
Fuser...

729
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,000
This is not humanly possible.

730
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:18,071
We finally arrived in Cuzco,
"the heart of America."

731
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,039
Our first day in the city we met Don Néstor,

732
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:31,168
an old soul, Mum, and our official guide.

733
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,254
Sir, I wonder, which of these walls is Incan?

734
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,007
This one here is Incan and that one is Spanish.

735
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,886
As a joke we say this wall was made by the Inca,

736
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,556
and that wall was made by the In-capables.
That's what we call the Spanish.

737
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:50,228
Curing the Inca period, Cuzco was the capital.

738
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,815
When the Spanish came
they started to trash it all,

739
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,985
-and made Lima the capital.
-Lima?

740
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,487
Yes.

741
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,491
This belongs to Jesus Christ Inc.

742
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,576
-Are they still in business?
-Yes.

743
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,788
Are they still in business...?

744
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,717
She says she never went to school

745
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:25,847
because she was always with the livestock,

746
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,685
and that's why she doesn't speak Spanish,
only Quechua.

747
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,813
When I was little there was enough,
at least I think so,

748
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,358
there was enough money to afford everything.

749
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:42,072
But now I think there is little money,
there is no work.

750
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:47,119
And this is all affecting us, more and more.

751
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:51,456
From the time I was little
I've worked with handicrafts, and,

752
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:58,922
that's why I'm not doing too bad,
not too good, just okay.

753
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,922
With both hands.

754
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,178
With both hands, Néstor.

755
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,432
Thank you.

756
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,610
Hello.

757
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,698
Good afternoon.

758
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,662
I was working for a time...

759
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,164
on some land.

760
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:18,210
And the landlord... kicked me off the land.

761
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,798
I was doing my work and he threw me out.

762
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,091
How'd he throw you out? Did he bring the police?

763
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,594
Yes, he brought the police.

764
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,472
Because he's rich, he's got lots of money.

765
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,558
He wants me to vacate his land, to get out.

766
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,393
Once it was already productive.

767
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:41,066
Yes, it was producing wheat,
corn, potato...all that.

768
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,318
And he kept most of it.

769
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:48,281
So, I can't live in the past.
I have to move on...work,

770
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:53,036
find the money to bring up my kids...

771
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,622
-How many kids do you have?
-I've got five.

772
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,333
Have you got organised with other farm workers...

773
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,835
-Yes.
-In order to fight back?

774
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:06,049
Yes. We are organised, we help
each other, work our land,

775
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,719
we help each other. Very unified.

776
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,956
Ready for the photo, Fuser?

777
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,042
That's it, that's it...

778
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,211
This one's for posterity.

779
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:36,097
The Incas knew about astronomy, medicine,
mathematics among other things,

780
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,059
but the Spanish invaders had gunpowder.

781
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:44,356
What would America look like today
if things had been different?

782
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,900
Fuser, here's my idea:

783
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,362
I'll marry an Inca descendant.

784
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,198
We'll start an indigenous party
under these conditions:

785
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,909
we'd encourage the people to vote,

786
01:05:56,535 --> 01:06:00,413
reactivate Tupac Amaru's revolution,
the Indo-American revolution, Fuser.

787
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,332
How's that sound?

788
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,168
A revolution without guns?

789
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,421
It would never work, Mial.

790
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,940
How is it possible to feel nostalgia
for a world I never knew?

791
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,737
How can a civilisation that built this...

792
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,907
be destroyed to build...

793
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,701
this...?

794
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,765
-This isn't it.
-No?

795
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,935
Wrong street ?

796
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:09,941
Mercaderes 52.

797
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,651
Let's ask.

798
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,279
-Calle Mercaderes?
-Mercaderes?

799
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,658
Straight ahead for two blocks,
turn right and go another six, seven blocks.

800
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,452
This has got to be Mercaderes.

801
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,038
That one is, too.

802
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,873
-Is this Mercaderes?
-Yes.

803
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,583
-And that one?
-Yes.

804
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,337
We have to count backwards.

805
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,548
-Fuser?
-Backwards is 2, 4,...

806
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,675
What? Yeah...

807
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,140
Can I help you?

808
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:49,022
This is Mariátegui's book.
And you must also read César Vallejo.

809
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,025
The best thing about Lima was Dr Hugo Pesce,

810
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,236
Director of Peru's leper treatment programme

811
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,198
who Alberto contacted
before we started out journey.

812
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:03,328
He gave us clothes, food, money and ideas.

813
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,958
Mariátegui speaks of the revolutionary potential

814
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,669
of the natives and farm workers of Latin America.

815
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,673
He says the problem of the Indian
is the problem of the land,

816
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,427
and that the revolution
should not be an imitation.

817
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,679
It should be original and indigenous.

818
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,208
"There are too few of us to be divided," he said,

819
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,210
"Everything unites us...

820
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,838
"nothing separates us."

821
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,673
Most of the patients are over here.

822
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,886
Pesce got us a couple of beds
in the Guia Hospital,

823
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,598
where patients suffering from
the early stages of leprosy are treated.

824
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,812
The most critical cases are sent
to the San Pablo Leper Colony, in the Amazon.

825
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,523
Zoraida, this is Alberto and Ernesto.

826
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,359
I think we know each other pretty well now...

827
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,444
Let me tell you something.

828
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:23,158
I look at you, Ernesto, and you, Alberto...

829
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:27,287
and I see great idealism and many doubts.

830
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,456
That's why I'm glad you're going to San Pablo.

831
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,293
I think you will find something important there.

832
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,503
For each of you.

833
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,423
Thank you, Doctor.

834
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,593
If you'll excuse me, I will show you something.

835
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,388
Another surprise? So many surprises...

836
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,308
-What's he getting, squirt?
-A book.

837
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,476
-A book...
-You have quite an appetite, Lito.

838
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:57,275
This is the great love of my life,
after my wife, of course.

839
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,069
It's my novel.

840
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,947
"Latitudes of Silence"

841
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,075
I hope you'll do me the honour of reading it.

842
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,870
-Of course.
-Of course, Doctor.

843
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:09,954
The honour is ours.

844
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,998
You can give me your opinion in Ucayali.

845
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,334
-Of course. May I?
-Of course.

846
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,960
Who dares go first?

847
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,046
Both of us.

848
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:22,592
He reads much faster than me.
He's really a fast reader.

849
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,139
Well, boys, that's the ship, "La Cenepa."

850
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,558
You'll be in San Pablo in 5 days.

851
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,143
All aboard!

852
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,103
Maestro...

853
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:40,026
Thank you for your hospitality,
for the tickets, for the clothes.

854
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,445
Thank you for everything. It's been an honour.

855
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:43,821
Don't mention it.

856
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,533
Thank you. Thank you very much.

857
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:51,371
One more thing, haven't
you forgotten something?

858
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,165
You haven't said anything about my novel.

859
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,003
-You've read it?
-Of course.

860
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,339
-And?
-What can I say?

861
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,385
I can say, without exaggeration, that no one...

862
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,262
can tell a story like you do.

863
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,932
It took me a lot of work.

864
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,350
Ernesto, your opinion?

865
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,685
He loved it.

866
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,688
If he loved it, I'd like to hear him tell me.

867
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,444
Look, Doctor, I think your book is a bit trite,

868
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:29,200
there are too many clichés, and I...

869
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,911
Well, that's not so bad...

870
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:35,540
No...the writing is basically - bad.

871
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,126
Basically unreadable.

872
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:44,966
It's a worthy attempt, Doctor, but I think
you should stick to what you know best.

873
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,888
I'm sorry, Maestro,
you asked my opinion and that's it.

874
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,019
Damn you, boy...

875
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,563
Nobody's been this honest with me.

876
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,982
You're the only one.

877
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,192
The only one.

878
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,905
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

879
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,617
So long, we're forever grateful. Thank you.

880
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,536
Take care!

881
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,612
Have you seen...

882
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,864
a bag that was just here?

883
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,741
-No.
-A small brown one.

884
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,535
I'll bring it over if I do.

885
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,842
What's wrong with him?

886
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,344
Call for help!

887
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,603
The pillow!

888
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,689
Hand me the pillow!

889
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,157
Take it easy, Fuser.

890
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,249
Take it easy, Fuser. Adrenaline on the way...

891
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,352
Okay, Fuser. It's over...

892
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,154
Fuser, Fuser, quiet. It's all over now.

893
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:55,466
Miss...

894
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,888
I want to thank you for helping out my friend.

895
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,932
No problem. He was in really bad shape.

896
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,058
Fuck, yeah.

897
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,060
-He scared me a lot.
-Me too.

898
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:08,312
Thank you very much, Miss.

899
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,650
You know, a little while ago
there was a bufeo out there.

900
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:13,734
A bufeo?

901
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,654
They're river dolphins but we call them bufeos.

902
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,239
Have you ever seen one?

903
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:21,117
Never. I've heard of them,
but I've never seen one.

904
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,621
I'm going to tell you a secret.

905
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:30,835
The bufeo's sex organs
are like that of a woman's...

906
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,922
and the Indians use them to...
comfort themselves.

907
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,508
But there's a little problem.

908
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,428
As soon as they're done,
they have to kill the animal...

909
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,723
because they suffer contractions
that won't release them.

910
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,939
-Miss, if I may, can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

911
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,107
Shoot.

912
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,985
What brings you to these inhospitable waters?

913
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,361
I work on the boat.

914
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,864
I come and go between Pucallpa and Leticia.

915
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,032
I'm from Pucallpa.

916
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,742
-Pucallpan.
-Pucallpian.

917
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,785
-Pucallpian, got it.
-Have you been there?

918
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,079
Yes, it's full of beautiful women,
but you are the loveliest.

919
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,165
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

920
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,042
And how do you pay for your passage?

921
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:13,544
I give the captain part of my earnings.

922
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,549
And...how do you earn your earnings, Miss?

923
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:26,098
Let's just say...if we go to your cabin,
I can show you.

924
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:31,896
The name's Luz, in case you want to
know who you're doing business with.

925
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,860
My little Luz, for a night with you
I'd pay enough gold to equal the Aconcagua.

926
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,739
But, honey, I've run out of cash.

927
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,241
Well, my friend, in that case
you'll have to excuse me.

928
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,911
-Hey...
-I've gotta go earn a living.

929
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,871
You're not going to leave me like this, are you?

930
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,760
-I need the fifteen dollars, Fuser.
-What?

931
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,095
Her name is Luz.

932
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,306
She told me a story of a fish
the Indians fuck and kissed me,

933
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,808
I'm so horny I could explode.

934
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,268
I spent them.

935
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:12,603
No, Fuser.

936
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,439
Don't bust my balls.

937
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,443
We crossed a desert together,
we starved, froze, had accidents...

938
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,363
My needs come before Chichina's bathing suit.

939
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:23,948
I don't have them.

940
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,077
I gave them to the mining couple.

941
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,421
Woo her.

942
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,299
Fuck you, Fuser.

943
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,140
The house wins, gentlemen.

944
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,809
Mr Lloyds is leaving our table.

945
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:54,145
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

946
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,730
-Miss...
-Place your bets, gentlemen.

947
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,857
-Eight soles.
-Ten soles.

948
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,859
One sol.

949
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:03,738
Sir, this is for men, not schoolchildren.

950
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,991
I didn't know that in Peru a man's balls
are measured in soles.

951
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,745
Very well. Let's play.

952
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,079
Cards, sirs.

953
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:14,331
Open.

954
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,000
-Card?
-One.

955
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,918
-Sir?
-No.

956
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,670
-Sir?
-One.

957
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,340
I'll stay put.

958
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,301
-Card.
-Sure.

959
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:28,179
Thank you.

960
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:32,892
Gentlemen, the house pays 2 1 .

961
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,518
Sir, 1 7...

962
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,854
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

963
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:40,065
-Young man?
-Pay up. 2 1 .

964
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,195
-How much did you bet?
-One sol.

965
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,448
There we go, the first one.

966
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,787
Well, gentlemen, let's continue. Place your bets.

967
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:53,913
Two soles.

968
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,184
Gentlemen, don't fall asleep on me,
let's see those bets.

969
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,103
-Thirty soles.
-Ten soles.

970
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,566
Gentlemen, once again! Blackjack!

971
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,693
That's impossible!

972
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,695
-How much do I owe you?
-Thirty soles.

973
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,822
The house pays up.

974
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,573
See you later. Thank you.

975
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,367
I'll be retiring.

976
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:35,246
I think we know who's got
the biggest balls at this table.

977
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,747
Excuse me, gentlemen.

978
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,499
Son-of-a-bitch!

979
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,460
Hey, now that we're millionaires, let's go eat.

980
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,170
Precisely, check out that morsel right there.

981
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,005
What a lucky night.

982
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,592
Ernesto... This is Luz, which means "light."

983
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:49,677
At your service.

984
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,595
"Electrifying light that dazzles my dreams.

985
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,848
Get ready, you've no clue what's coming to you."

986
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:54,932
Neruda?

987
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,058
Granado.

988
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,200
Are you Doctor Bresciani?

989
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,077
How are you, boys? Good trip?

990
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,996
-Yes.
-Long, but good.

991
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,080
A bit long, huh?

992
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,375
-Alberto, Ernesto?
-No, the other way round.

993
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:08,422
-A pleasure, I'm Bresciani.
-The pleasure is ours, Doctor.

994
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,383
Dr Pesce has spoken enthusiastically
of you, so welcome to San Pablo.

995
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,136
Oh, by the way, I have a letter from him.

996
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,680
-Do you want it now?
-Later on.

997
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:22,353
Well, since we're already here,
I can tell you about the colony.

998
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,688
The Amazon cuts the colony in half.

999
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:28,233
The patients live on the South side,

1000
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:32,196
and the staff, doctors and nurses
are here on the North...

1001
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,532
as well as a group of nuns
who do things with great efficiency.

1002
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,826
Here's your room.

1003
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:44,541
The beds are a bit hard,
but it's good for the spine.

1004
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:55,094
You can see the hospital from here,
and the lab is over there.

1005
01:22:56,096 --> 01:23:01,350
Dr Souza Lima, these are
our Argentinian volunteers, Mr Granado,

1006
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:02,893
Mr Ernesto Guevara.

1007
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,646
Alberto, I believe you have
experience in the laboratory, right?

1008
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,772
That's correct.

1009
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,818
I think he'll be able to help.
Why don't you show him the research lab?

1010
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:14,446
Ernesto, you're going to help me
at the hospital with consultations.

1011
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:20,953
We transfer the seriously ill over here,
we bring them in from the South side.

1012
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,747
Hello, Doctor.

1013
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:29,628
-Do you also operate on this side?
-Yes, we have an OR over there.

1014
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:36,510
That's Elvia, she's the daughter
of a patient. A very good nurse.

1015
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,099
How is he?

1016
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,308
-Is he okay?
-He's much better.

1017
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:48,105
-Continue the same treatment then.
-Okay.

1018
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:53,485
Doctor, how many patients
live on the South side?

1019
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,779
-Almost 600.
-All Peruvian?

1020
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,782
No, most are, but we have some from Colombia,

1021
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:01,744
Venezuela, and other South American countries.

1022
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,210
I suggest you wear these gloves.

1023
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:13,547
Although leprosy is not contagious
under treatment,

1024
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:16,467
the nuns are quite insistent on this point.

1025
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,182
If it's not contagious,
then it's just symbolic, right?

1026
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,727
Yes, I'm just telling you
so you don't make any mortal enemies.

1027
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:30,314
You know what, Doctor, you'll excuse us,
but we're not going to wear them.

1028
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,648
Thank you, Doctor.

1029
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,819
-Don't say I didn't warn you.
-All right.

1030
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:43,702
Get the boxes out.

1031
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,162
Right this way, boys.

1032
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,464
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1033
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,009
-Welcome to San Pablo.
-Thank you.

1034
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,011
Papá Carlito at your service.

1035
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,347
-Nemesio Reyna.
-I'm Ernesto Guevara.

1036
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,182
I'm Alberto Granado, a pleasure to meet you.

1037
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:12,731
Doctor, haven't you explained the rules?

1038
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,196
A pleasure.

1039
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:23,242
-How are you, Nemesio?
-Well.

1040
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:28,580
Papá Carlito is the community leader.
They are Argentinian doctors.

1041
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,042
A pleasure. See you later.

1042
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,962
Those guys are real gents.

1043
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:38,715
Doctor, these gentlemen just show up
and think they can do what they want?

1044
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,801
Mother Sor Alberto,

1045
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,887
these gentlemen have medical experience
in Córdoba and Buenos Aires.

1046
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,474
That doesn't give them the right
to break the rules.

1047
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:50,102
Why don't we talk about this later?

1048
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,020
Thank you, Mother, you are very understanding.

1049
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,647
Excuse us.

1050
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,607
She's the Mother Superior.

1051
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,403
-I think she wants me.
-I think she does.

1052
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:04,074
Hello.

1053
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,996
This is the dining hall.

1054
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,623
The nuns provide lunch here on Sundays.

1055
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,626
But only for those who come to Mass.

1056
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:21,216
Most of the patients were sent
here by their families

1057
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,218
or fired from their jobs.

1058
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,597
So they adapt the their new lives,
by building their own houses...

1059
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,807
farming and raising animals.

1060
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,434
-Doctor.
-Good day.

1061
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,604
-How's Silvia?
-She doesn't want the surgery.

1062
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:35,981
Thank you.

1063
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,277
Silvia is a somewhat rebellious patient.

1064
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,447
Surgery is the last chance to save her arm.

1065
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:47,951
Hello, Silvia.

1066
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:52,623
She's young.

1067
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,212
May I go talk to her?

1068
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,068
Can I sit?

1069
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,244
Does your arm hurt?

1070
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,508
What's wrong?

1071
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,011
I was born with shitty lungs.

1072
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,349
Pity.

1073
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,601
It's not so bad.

1074
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,772
Thanks to that, I got out of military service.

1075
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,693
I didn't have to clean anybody's boots.

1076
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:06,321
Is that why you became a doctor,

1077
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,992
because you're sick?

1078
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:12,286
Maybe...

1079
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,124
The first word I learned was injection.

1080
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,921
I want to be useful, somehow.

1081
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,135
You're wasting your time.

1082
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:29,886
Why?

1083
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,143
Life is pain.

1084
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,147
Yeah, it's pretty screwed up.

1085
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:48,030
You gotta fight for every breath,
and tell death to go to hell.

1086
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,577
Fuser...

1087
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:39,414
Bresciani's going to write me a letter
of recommendation for a residency

1088
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,750
in Caracas at the Cabo Blanco Hospital.

1089
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,044
How's that sound?

1090
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:48,090
That's good, isn't it?

1091
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,508
Good?

1092
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:53,303
What's wrong, Fuser?

1093
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,433
Have you seen the river?

1094
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,477
Of course.

1095
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,357
It segregates the ill from the healthy.

1096
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:10,904
Yes.

1097
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,439
Look at this hand.

1098
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,149
Right here.

1099
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,709
Wipe.

1100
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:10,714
Are you all right?

1101
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,508
Scalpel.

1102
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,636
It's all right.

1103
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,222
Look at me, look me in the eye.

1104
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:20,724
Are you all right?

1105
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:29,191
The nerve is coming out, it's thick.

1106
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,404
I have four siblings,

1107
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:39,743
Celia, Ana María, Roberto and Juan Martín.

1108
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:45,707
Honestly, they're what I miss most.

1109
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,001
And also my Mum.

1110
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:02,265
You have to let me know sooner.

1111
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,482
Have you been playing football lately?

1112
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:12,859
Not lately.

1113
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,071
I'd appreciate it if you wore sneakers next time,

1114
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,450
-and don't forget to invite me.
-My pleasure.

1115
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,235
All right, Northerners!

1116
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:53,668
Come on, Northerners, mark that one there!

1117
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:55,879
Come on, Southerners!

1118
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:00,508
All right, Southerners!

1119
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,010
Get out there!

1120
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,475
Mark that one!

1121
01:34:12,104 --> 01:34:13,229
Goal!

1122
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,071
What happened?

1123
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,324
What happened, Chubby? We nailed you!

1124
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:27,577
Fuck you!

1125
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,377
Some rice...corn, onion.

1126
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,170
Excuse me.

1127
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:40,715
Sister, why won't you serve us, what's wrong?

1128
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:44,344
Mother Sor Alberto's rules are very clear.

1129
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:47,097
food is served only to those
who attend Holy Mass.

1130
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,141
They won't serve us
because we didn't go to Mass?

1131
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:52,769
-Says who?
-Sor Alberto.

1132
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,271
Mother...

1133
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:56,648
Yes, sons?

1134
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,859
-We'd like to eat, if possible.
-We deserve to eat like everybody else.

1135
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,903
-But you didn't go to Mass.
-No.

1136
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:07,450
So, how do you expect to feed the body
if you haven't first fed the soul?

1137
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:10,787
Ma'am, it's unchristian to deny us food!

1138
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:14,791
We have rules in this house,
and they have to be followed.

1139
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:17,085
I didn't see any rulebook.

1140
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,171
Neither did I. I think if I find it, I'll eat it.

1141
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,013
Your lunch.

1142
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:34,310
-You stole it?
-Yes.

1143
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,895
Thank you.

1144
01:35:40,776 --> 01:35:43,570
-You stole it from Sor Alberto?
-Yes.

1145
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,321
Thanks.

1146
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,423
-Deep?
-Yeah.

1147
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,981
-Do you want maté?
-No, thanks.

1148
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:35,163
What?

1149
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,085
-From Caracas?
-Caracas.

1150
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:51,179
This is great.

1151
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:53,681
Great, isn't it?

1152
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,143
Should I take it?

1153
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,687
What do you wanna do?

1154
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:06,653
Maybe it's time to settle down, huh?

1155
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:11,074
Get a steady job, a girlfriend.

1156
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,535
Grow a gut.

1157
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:20,041
And you? Are you going back to school,
to Buenos Aires?

1158
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,586
I don't know. If I find a way of getting back, yes.

1159
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,633
You'll be 24 next week, Fuser.

1160
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:32,720
I should be thinking ahead, huh?

1161
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:00,999
He dances pretty well. Have you seen the nun?

1162
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,004
Check this out.

1163
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,644
Come on, dance.

1164
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,115
Bravo!

1165
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:37,827
Thank you. Very nice.

1166
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,377
-Good party, huh?
-Fantastic!

1167
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:49,923
Listen, it's the Tango you danced in Miramar.

1168
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,257
I like it.

1169
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,592
Did you notice? You know how to dance this one.

1170
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,845
-This one's a bit fast, isn't it?
-You dance it perfectly,

1171
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,682
and I think there's a young lady
interested in dancing with you.

1172
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:01,768
I should ask her, right?

1173
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:05,313
The bird of youth flies away and
doesn't come back. Fly, man, fly!

1174
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:07,190
Would you like to dance?

1175
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:10,401
-Do you know this dance?
-Yes.

1176
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,866
This version is a bit faster than the one I know.

1177
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,331
Mambo.

1178
01:39:26,877 --> 01:39:28,461
Let Ernesto dance!

1179
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:31,297
Did you think it was a Tango?

1180
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:33,216
It's a Mambo, Fuser!

1181
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:52,235
Make three wishes!

1182
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:54,404
All right!

1183
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:04,163
My dear friends, a moment, please.

1184
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:09,335
I think it's the perfect time
to let Ernesto and Alberto know...

1185
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:13,548
how grateful we are to them.
Not only for having come here,

1186
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:17,301
but also for the enthusiasm and dedication...

1187
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:22,348
they have shown towards San Pablo's
patients during their three weeks with us.

1188
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:27,562
To show our appreciation,
we have a little surprise for you.

1189
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:31,774
Tomorrow we're going to give you a raft
so that you can continue your trip.

1190
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,987
This raft will be named after tonight's
newly invented dance:

1191
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:37,780
the Mambo-Tango.

1192
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,868
-Nice one!
-Thank you, Doctor!

1193
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:50,043
Speech! Speech!

1194
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:58,926
Well...it's my duty to thank you for this toast

1195
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:01,220
with something more than the usual conventions.

1196
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:05,391
But, in view of the shabby conditions
in which we travel,

1197
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,019
all we have to offer you are words.

1198
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:12,565
Employing them, I'd like
to express my sincere thanks,

1199
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:19,489
to the entire staff of the colony,
who, although they barely know us,

1200
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:22,116
have shown their affection
by celebrating my birthday

1201
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:24,494
as if it were an intimate celebration
of one of their own.

1202
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:28,998
Tomorrow we leave for Peru,

1203
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:33,795
so these words are also our farewell,

1204
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:40,676
in which I'd like to say how grateful
I am to the people of this country

1205
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:46,182
who have generously looked after us
again and again.

1206
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:52,063
I'd like to add something else,
completely unrelated to this toast...

1207
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:54,899
Don't worry, I won't dance.

1208
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:07,286
Even though we are too insignificant
to be spokesmen for such a noble cause,

1209
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:10,581
we believe,

1210
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:13,793
and this journey has only confirmed this belief,

1211
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,047
that the division of America into unstable

1212
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:21,300
and illusory nations, is a complete fiction.

1213
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:28,766
We are one single mestizo race
from Mexico to the Magellan Straits.

1214
01:42:30,018 --> 01:42:33,688
And so, in an attempt to free ourselves
from narrow-minded provincialism,

1215
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:36,816
I propose a toast to Peru

1216
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,319
and to a United America.

1217
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:49,036
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1218
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,746
Cheers!

1219
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:00,214
Bravo!

1220
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:50,389
What... What's wrong?

1221
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,894
Do you know where the boat is?

1222
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:57,730
No, can't see it.

1223
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:05,488
I'm going to celebrate my birthday
on the other side.

1224
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:09,992
Sure, tomorrow, when we find the boat
you'll go across and celebrate.

1225
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,244
-No. Now.
-No, not now.

1226
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:12,328
My birthday is today, not tomorrow.

1227
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:13,913
Yeah, I know, Fuser, but you're not going to...

1228
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:17,333
Are you nuts? At night? The animals
in there will eat you alive!

1229
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:20,294
How many times did we
think we wouldn't make it...?

1230
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:22,338
-And look, here we are.
-But this is different, Fuser.

1231
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:24,507
-Why?
-Because I won't be there to help you.

1232
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,760
-I'm not going in there...
-You're always gonna be with me, Mial.

1233
01:44:27,844 --> 01:44:30,346
Come here you little shit! Come here!

1234
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,390
Your mother's gonna kill me!

1235
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,100
Fuser! Come here!

1236
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:37,144
Ernesto, listen to me!

1237
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:40,356
Ernesto, come back!

1238
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,566
Fuck you!

1239
01:44:43,193 --> 01:44:44,277
Ernesto, come back!

1240
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:50,116
Fuck, come back!

1241
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,325
What's wrong?

1242
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,411
The crazy idiot wants to swim across the river!

1243
01:44:53,495 --> 01:44:54,287
What?

1244
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:56,122
Please tell me someone has
already crossed this river.

1245
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,873
In all the years I've been here, no one.

1246
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,792
Ernesto, come back here, damn it.

1247
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:02,628
Son, listen to your friend!

1248
01:45:02,754 --> 01:45:03,754
He won't listen.

1249
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:05,881
-Come here, kid!
-Come back, Ernesto!

1250
01:45:06,883 --> 01:45:09,635
Come back! It's dangerous!

1251
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,432
Ernesto!

1252
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:24,567
-Ernesto, come back!
-Come on, come back!

1253
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:28,362
The river is very strong!

1254
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:33,659
What is it?

1255
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,411
I don't know, something's going on.

1256
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:43,836
Ernesto! Do what I say for once in your life.

1257
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,671
The current is even stronger now.

1258
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:46,839
What is he doing?

1259
01:45:46,923 --> 01:45:49,175
This idiot wants to swim across the river!

1260
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:50,593
Come back, damn it!

1261
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:52,261
Ernesto!

1262
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,309
He's swimming...

1263
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:03,981
-Is that Ernesto?
-Yes, he's swimming towards us...

1264
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,358
He's over there!

1265
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,404
Boy, get back here!

1266
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:14,950
-He's tired.
-You can do it, Ernesto!

1267
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:23,918
He's over there!

1268
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,636
Go! Go! Go, Ernesto!

1269
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,602
Come on!

1270
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:03,707
Just a bit more!

1271
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:30,234
He made it! The motherfucker made it!

1272
01:47:30,735 --> 01:47:32,570
He made it!

1273
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:43,164
All right, Ernesto!

1274
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:53,757
I always knew he'd make it.

1275
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,177
I always knew...

1276
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,554
Son-of-a-bitch.

1277
01:48:32,255 --> 01:48:33,964
I'm going to miss you so much.

1278
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,508
Take good care.

1279
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:39,303
See you, Nemesio.

1280
01:48:41,431 --> 01:48:44,642
Papá Carlito is feeling real sad...

1281
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:45,726
Take care of yourself.

1282
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:47,228
Bye, Bin.

1283
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,731
-We're gonna miss you.
-Me too.

1284
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:54,652
Thanks for everything.

1285
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,112
Don't forget us.

1286
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,573
-Take good care of yourself.
-You too, Silvia.

1287
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,285
Thank you, thanks.

1288
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:06,622
Bye, Ernesto.

1289
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:07,915
Take care.

1290
01:49:08,959 --> 01:49:11,252
Take good care of your family.

1291
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:21,095
Take care of yourselves, you guys.

1292
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:29,478
-Goodbye, Mauro.
-Safe travels.

1293
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:45,906
I'd prepared a speech full of
anecdotes and grandiose phrases,

1294
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:48,033
I can't remember shit now.

1295
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:49,451
That's how it goes.

1296
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:51,078
Che...

1297
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:52,413
What?

1298
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,751
It's not too late to come work
with me in Cabo Blanco.

1299
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:01,797
You could come back after you graduate.
I'll wait for you.

1300
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:03,549
I don't know.

1301
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:07,511
I just don't know.

1302
01:52:10,265 --> 01:52:12,975
You know, Mial, all this time
we spent on the road,

1303
01:52:15,895 --> 01:52:17,646
something happened.

1304
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:23,110
Something I'll have to think about
for a long time.

1305
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:34,955
So much injustice...

1306
01:52:40,503 --> 01:52:42,629
Come on, the plane's taking off!

1307
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:43,839
Well, I should go...

1308
01:52:44,132 --> 01:52:46,467
Wait, take this, it may help.

1309
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:51,555
-You kept it?
-It's yours.

1310
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,767
-I'd better go.
-Yes.

1311
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:07,321
I'll write, okay?

1312
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:18,499
Fuser!

1313
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,674
I have something very important to tell you...

1314
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:31,887
My birthday is not on April 2nd,
it's on August 8th.

1315
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,931
-I just said that to motivate us.
-I know.

1316
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:34,973
-You knew it?
-Yeah.

1317
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:36,058
Son-of-a-bitch!

1318
01:53:51,032 --> 01:53:53,659
-So long, Mial!
-Bye, my friend.

1319
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:31,238
This isn't a tale of heroic feats.

1320
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:37,536
It's about two lives running parallel for a while,

1321
01:54:37,745 --> 01:54:40,956
with common aspirations and similar dreams.

1322
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:47,796
Was our view too narrow, too biased, too hasty?

1323
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:51,216
Were our conclusions too rigid?

1324
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:53,468
Maybe.

1325
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:58,557
Wandering around our America

1326
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:00,767
has changed me more than I thought.

1327
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:04,771
I am not me any more.

1328
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:08,150
at least I'm not the same me I was.

1329
01:56:42,704 --> 01:56:47,749
It took eight years for Ernesto
and Alberto to meet again.

1330
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:53,130
In 1 960 Granado was invited
to live and work in Cuba.

1331
01:56:53,297 --> 01:56:57,384
The invitation came from his old friend Fuser,
now "Comandante" Ernesto Che Guevara,

1332
01:56:57,593 --> 01:57:01,304
one of the most prominent and inspiring
leaders of the Cuban Revolution.

1333
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:06,810
Che went on to fight for his ideals in
the Congo and Bolivia where he was captured,

1334
01:57:06,894 --> 01:57:10,856
and with the support of the CIA,
murdered in October, 1 967.

1335
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:14,109
Forever faithful to his friend Fuser,

1336
01:57:14,235 --> 01:57:18,363
Granado remained in Cuba where
he founded the Santiago School of Medicine.

1337
01:57:18,489 --> 01:57:22,576
He lives in Havana with his wife Delia,
their children and grandchildren.
