{1308}{1349}Looking for something?
{1351}{1397}Yes, a grave.
{1399}{1500}No one's had time to die here yet.|You can see there is no graveyard.
{1502}{1556}This was a long time ago.
{1558}{1626}Actually, not such a long time.|Nearly three years.
{1629}{1690}I buried a friend here.|A friend.
{1718}{1818}Huge trees stood here.|A cedar and a fir tree.
{1821}{1890}Remember them?
{1893}{1956}Probably chopped down|when the settlement was built.
{2014}{2059}Could it be those?
{3085}{3129}Dersu!
{4123}{4221}In the islands, the hunter
{4223}{4310}Roams all day long
{4313}{4392}But no luck for him
{4394}{4489}And he curses himself
{4491}{4574}What's he going to do
{4625}{4747}How is he to serve
{4750}{4861}He cannot be cheerful
{4863}{4976}So what|He'll try to aim better
{5002}{5094}So the hunter goes
{5097}{5167}To warmer waters
{5170}{5252}Where the fish were frolicking
{5254}{5339}In the beautiful weather
{5342}{5446}There on the shore
{5529}{5567}That year...
{5570}{5638}my assignment was|to go to the Shkotovo area...
{5641}{5688}in the Usuries region...
{5690}{5775}to make a topographic survey.
{7063}{7197}Some times mountains and forests|Look cheerful and attractive.
{7235}{7344}At other times,|they seem sullen and wild.
{7398}{7447}This isn't just my own feeling.
{7484}{7577}All the men in the unit|share this feeing.
{7636}{7736}With God's help,|we will spend the night here.
{7738}{7817}And tomorrow,|we'll find a more cheerful place.
{7819}{7865}Very well.|We'll halt here for the night.
{7867}{7913}Yes, we'll stay here for the night.
{9542}{9649}That valley reminded me...
{9651}{9698}of Walpurgis Night...
{9729}{9837}a place where witches|would gather for their Sabbath.
{11162}{11209}What's that?
{11211}{11249}A falling rock.
{11296}{11345}Is someone coming down?
{11542}{11579}It's a bear!
{11776}{11873}Please to not shoot!|Me are people!

{17254}{17359}You great hunter, shoot all beasts...
{17362}{17408}we don't have anything to eat.
{17970}{18054}Hey, you!|Enough babble!

{18545}{18638}Here. Now you can babble.
{18965}{19058}My name is Arseniev.|What's yours?
{19061}{19098}Dersu Uzala.

{20114}{20160}son and girl.
{20235}{20293}The smallpox finish all people.
{20321}{20418}Now me left alone.

{20926}{21041}We are surveying this area--
{21043}{21108}the ranges, passes and rivers.

{21446}{21515}Necessary me think.
{21536}{21605}Stop it.
{21607}{21653}Well, think it over.
{21770}{21816}Now, let's go to sleep.
{22245}{22295}The next day,|without saying a word...
{22298}{22373}Dersu took his place|at the head of our squad.
{22769}{22819}There is a road here.
{23052}{23138}- A road!|- Come here! There's a road!
{23141}{23185}What's there?
{23187}{23280}This road two, three days before,|one people come.

{23522}{23624}He wear Chinese boots.|Water in his tracks.
{23710}{23788}You the same as children.

{25704}{25750}the bed of grass...
{25827}{25909}and a discarded piece|of Chinese fabric...
{25911}{25982}all confirmed Dersu's words.
{25984}{26072}Obviously, a Chinese spent the night|a couple of days ago.
{28606}{28652}Did you see that?
{29363}{29401}Yegor!
{29723}{29824}Captain.|Rice, salt, matches, give some.

{30454}{30486}Olentiev!
{30489}{30598}Bring matches, rice and salt.
{30601}{30642}At your command.
{31099}{31153}This Goldi filled me|with admiration.
{31185}{31244}He had amazing insight...
{31270}{31339}acquired during his long life|in the forest.
{31387}{31467}Besides, he had a beautiful soul.
{31535}{31609}He provided for the needs|of a person he didn't know...
{31635}{31690}and probably wouldn't ever see.
{32254}{32350}Dersu, let's wait|until the rain stops.
{32353}{32398}Time to get ready.
{32430}{32507}Listen good.|Birds are starting to sing.

{32859}{32934}Dersu, do you know what the sun is?
{32937}{32982}Everyone knows the sun.
{33042}{33113}Could be that|you've never seen the sun?
{33115}{33169}Look, there it is.
{33854}{33909}Captain.

{36674}{36727}- Why shoot?|-Just for fun.
{36730}{36785}- Step back, Dersu.|- Waste bullets, bad.
{36788}{36853}What waste? We're soldiers.|We're practicing.

{38113}{38165}Good shooter not miss.
{38168}{38235}Go ahead, old man.|Try it yourself.
{38238}{38339}Why shoot and smash? Why break?|Where in forest you find bottle?
{38342}{38399}Are you trying to|worm your way out of it?
{38402}{38433}Just admit you won't hit it.

{40541}{40593}- He's sitting by the river.|- What's he doing?
{40596}{40665}Sitting by the fire and singing.|Probably drunk.
{40798}{40844}Let me tie it.
{44269}{44323}May I sit with you|for a while, Dersu?
{44833}{44870}Captain.
{44900}{45028}Over there my wife and kids die.
{45030}{45061}Smallpox.
{45150}{45216}Everyone afraid of smallpox.
{45218}{45341}Wife, kids, house,|all together burn.
{45554}{45693}Last night bad dream had.
{45765}{45857}Yurt will be soon fall down.
{45888}{45968}Wife, kids in this yurt...
{45970}{46034}all get freezing.
{46037}{46094}No eat.

{47742}{47803}Young man always walk on his toes.
{47806}{47882}Old man always walk on his heels.
{48115}{48222}I met that old Chinese|a few days Later.

{49862}{49947}He went into the mountains.
{49950}{49995}For 40 years live alone.
{50139}{50188}Thank you.
{51867}{51904}It's cold already.
{52087}{52148}Maybe we should invite the old man|to come over to our fire.
{52185}{52232}Don't, Captain.
{52234}{52282}Don't disturb him.
{52544}{52625}Him now think very much.

{53830}{53876}Him now go home.
{56461}{56516}The ultimate goal|of this expedition...
{56518}{56610}was to explore the area|around Lake Khanka.
{56642}{56763}We had to cross big swamps|and road-less tracts.
{56766}{56877}I sent most of the men|and horses to Chernigovka.
{56879}{56976}Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinov and I...
{56979}{57045}set out for the Lake in a flatboat.
{57639}{57736}Olentiev, stay here and make camp.

{58960}{59058}Lake Khanka is not far.|We won't stay there long.
{59061}{59137}All right, Captain,|you see for yourself.
{59139}{59197}What is okay is okay.
{59706}{59839}Silence Layover|the frozen reaches of the Lake.
{59890}{60030}Some menace to humans|was lurking in this silence.
{60253}{60302}Captain!
{60305}{60373}Have to go back quick.
{60375}{60424}The wind cover our tracks.
{60426}{60472}Yes, yes, let's go.
{62791}{62855}Never mind, Dersu.

{67668}{67737}Soon night come.|Night come, we die.
{67739}{67808}If the camp is close by,|they'll hear us.
{68256}{68307}We'll have to spend|the night here, Dersu.
{68310}{68383}It's dangerous to go on.|What shall we do?
{68474}{68546}Captain! Listen.|Listen good.
{68578}{68690}Have to work fast.|Us not work good, us die.

{79250}{79357}As the wind howled,|I sank into darkness.
{79395}{79453}I don't know how long I slept.
{80334}{80398}Hey, bear!
{80401}{80489}Climb out of the den!|Sun is up!
{83326}{83399}Only then did I realize|what Dersu had done for me.
{83425}{83482}His wits had saved me.
{83699}{83764}Thank you, Dersu.|Thank you.
{83766}{83812}What would I have done without you?
{83814}{83892}Go together, work together.|No need thanks.
{84028}{84073}That's Olentiev!
{85093}{85149}From that point on...
{85151}{85197}our expedition became more difficult.
{85377}{85422}Let's go! Go!
{85533}{85591}Severe frost.
{85594}{85640}Exhaustion.
{85642}{85676}Hunger.
{85714}{85841}Man is very small|before the face of nature.
{88170}{88269}Forward! Forward! Don't stop!
{88272}{88317}Forward!

{96245}{96307}Good-bye, military men.
{96478}{96516}Farewell.
{96599}{96681}Good-bye, Dersu.|Maybe we'll meet again.

{97729}{97817}He's a fine man.|I never met anyone like him.
{97820}{97905}He's a rare man.|May God give him good health.
{97982}{98081}In the islands, the hunter
{98115}{98210}Roams all day long
{98241}{98332}But no luck for him
{98360}{98460}And he curses himself
{98462}{98572}What’s he going to do
{98575}{98681}How is he to serve
{98683}{98787}He cannot be cheerful
{98789}{98897}So what|He’ll try to aim better
{98900}{98975}So the hunter goes
{98977}{99049}To warmer waters
{101670}{101701}That spring...
{101704}{101797}once again I set out to travel|across the Ussuri area.

{104122}{104208}Careful! Look after the horses!
{106455}{106518}For three months, we have been|walking in the forest.
{106521}{106601}Spring in the forest|quickly gave way to summer.
{106604}{106684}We’ve explored a large area.
{106686}{106808}But if we had Dersu,|we; have accomplished more.
{106843}{106913}All this time,|I was thinking with anticipation...
{106915}{106995}that maybe I would meet him again.
{106997}{107043}Where are you, Dersu?
{107473}{107577}Up the spring, go!
{108036}{108085}Faster, guys.|Bring the water.
