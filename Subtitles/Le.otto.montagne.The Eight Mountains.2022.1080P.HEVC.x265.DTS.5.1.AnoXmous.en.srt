1
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:42,558
I didn't think I'd find
a friend like Bruno in life

2
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:47,766
nor that friendship was a place
where you put your roots

3
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,516
and what is waiting for you.

4
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,266
I was raised as an only child
in a city apartment.

5
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,516
I wasn't used to doing things in twos.

6
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,937
But in the summer of 1984

7
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:16,227
my parents rented a house
in a mountain town,

8
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:19,977
where, ironically, there was only
one little boy living at the time.

9
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,567
Bruno.

10
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:54,145
Bruno!

11
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:56,645
Bruno!

12
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:01,817
Bruno!

13
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,764
Excuse me, there's one here.

14
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,937
Come on!

15
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,104
Come on.

16
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,764
Come on!

17
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,395
Ah!

18
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,395
- Oh! Oh!
- Thank you, thank you.

19
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:23,187
- I'm Frances.
- Hello, Wilhelmina Sonia.

20
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:25,104
- Pleasure.
- I'm going.

21
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:26,645
Goodbye.

22
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,067
- Love!
- Hmm?

23
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:53,264
- Come on, it's late.
- Okay.

24
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,354
- Good night.
- Good night.

25
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:58,727
Hey!

26
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:03,477
- Would you like some breakfast?
- Hmm.

27
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:06,977
We have just arrived,
but we have things.

28
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:10,104
- Do you want a biscuit?
- Yes.

29
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:14,264
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

30
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:17,266
Do you have brothers, Bruno?

31
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,607
No,
I'm the last child in the country.

32
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:23,437
- I don't understand.
- I'm the last kid in the village.

33
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,975
Hello, Pietro!

34
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,317
This is Bruno.

35
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,437
Hi.

36
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,187
- Are you coming to have breakfast?
- Hmm.

37
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:56,067
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,937
How old are you, Bruno?

39
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,937
- 12 in November.
- Same as Pietro!

40
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,187
Only he's in January.

41
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,146
Where do you live?

42
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,516
Over there, with my uncles.
My father isn't here.

43
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,766
And where is he?

44
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:27,937
He's away, he's a bricklayer.
In Switzerland or maybe in Austria.

45
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,317
And where is mom?

46
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:36,396
- Can I have another cookie?
- Yes.

47
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,016
- Ready?
- Wait.

48
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,067
Yes!

49
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,475
One two three!

50
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:26,187
One two three!

51
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,266
Ah!

52
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,766
- Hey, Bruno.
- Hi.

53
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,607
Holy shit!

54
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,317
You scared me.
Are you hurt?

55
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,107
No, it works, let's go.

56
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:58,187
In Grana there were 183 people.

57
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,146
Oh! And now?

58
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:03,266
- 14, including me.
- Hmm.

59
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,187
There were two shops, a bar,

60
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:09,646
the school, the bakery...

61
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:13,516
At a certain point,
they built the road.

62
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,857
You know, to get people to Grana.

63
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,975
- But do you know what happened?
- What?

64
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,896
They've all gone away.

65
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,975
Ah, so your father too?

66
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:27,516
Yeah, away. Even yours?

67
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,225
Yes, he's at home in Turin,
he's working.

68
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:33,567
Meanwhile I'm here with my mother,

69
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:37,817
because we rented the house
for the whole summer.

70
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,225
What does he do?

71
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:44,105
So, he's an engineer
in a huge factory,

72
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:49,725
where, he thinks, 10,000 people work.

73
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,937
- Damn it?
- Eh!

74
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,767
-  Bruno!
- 10,000.

75
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,475
Where are you?

76
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:58,437
Shit, my aunt! It's time to milk.

77
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:15,767
Ah!

78
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,147
According to my father,

79
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:21,017
for every season of lightness
there follows one of gravity,

80
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,517
work time,
of the plain and the black mood.

81
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:34,187
Shit! But what the fuck are you doing?

82
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:35,897
<i>Go...

83
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,605
Wait!

84
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,767
Wait!

85
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,475
Go! Go now! Go!

86
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,517
Meanwhile
my legs turned pale,

87
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:57,113
the scrapes and scabs healed
and they forgot the itch of the nettles.

88
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:03,317
The days of Grana
seemed so far away,

89
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,105
I wondered if they really existed.

90
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,975
- Ah, I see you!
- Argh!

91
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,767
Argh!

92
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,397
Argh

93
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,067
I'm glad you're back, Berto.

94
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,437
- What did you call me?
- Berto.

95
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:46,317
Means "rock" in my language,
like "Pietro".

96
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,647
- When you're here, I'll call you that.
- Oh.

97
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:50,937
"Berto".

98
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,475
Come on, can you teach me your dialect?

99
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:56,225
All right, what do you want to know?

100
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,267
<i>Um...

101
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,567
- Trees.
- Okay.

102
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,017
Like that one there.

103
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:06,517
That there is an "Iares"
and it has soft needles.

104
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,017
Bruno!

105
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:13,817
-  Bruno!
-  Fuck off!

106
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,067
Bye.

107
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:20,517
- I didn't hear anyone.
- Oh! Really?

108
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,105
Argh!

109
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:41,605
Hi Dad!

110
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,725
These lines are called
"level curves".

111
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,017
Hmm.

112
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,105
The closer they are, the steeper the slope.

113
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:07,147
Okay.

114
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,317
The numbers, on the other hand,
are the altitude.

115
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,267
- It's here...
- Like this, this, this...

116
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,437
Exact.

117
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,437
This is where I want to get to tomorrow.

118
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:22,937
- "3010".
- Hmm.

119
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,067
Madonna!

120
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:27,767
Can I come too?

121
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:31,687
Are you serious?

122
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,267
- Tell me you know what are you agreeing to?
- Yes.

123
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,817
Are you sure?
There's no going back.

124
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:37,855
Here they are.

125
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:43,017
Matterhorn, Grand Tournalin, Breithorn

126
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,267
and that is the Lyskamm.

127
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:49,725
The crest they call it
"Man eater". Did you know that?

128
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:50,767
No.

129
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,017
Huh.

130
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,225
Don't you miss that crappy city?

131
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:07,817
No!

132
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:11,897
Let's go?

133
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,605
Come on, dad, we just got here!

134
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:19,105
Okay.

135
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,975
How is your friend?

136
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,105
Well, I believe.

137
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:29,897
He went to the pastures
with his uncle to help him,

138
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,687
so I never saw him again.

139
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,855
It takes an hour on foot to get there.

140
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,975
An hour isn't that much, is it?

141
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,567
We can go together if you want.
What do you say?

142
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:47,605
All right.

143
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,725
Done.

144
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,355
Okay.

145
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,975
- Let's go!
- Wait!

146
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:02,475
- Come on, boy, go! Go!
- Wait, wait!

147
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,767
Excuse me for continuing to insist.

148
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,517
I think I understand
he didn't go so well,

149
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,067
so, he must repeat the year?

150
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,147
I don't know.

151
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,437
Well, if he failed ...

152
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:43,397
Bruno is smart. It would be a pity,
if he stopped studying, right?

153
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,437
Oh.

154
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,855
He needs someone
to help him study

155
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:48,267
so definitely passes.

156
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:51,147
Yes, you should talk
to my husband about it.

157
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,517
- Hello, Pietro!
- Hello, Bruno!

158
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:11,144
Hi, you must be Bruno.
Pietro told me a lot about you.

159
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:13,317
- Good morning.
- Hi.

160
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,317
- Is that your uncle?
- Yes.

161
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,182
Come, I'll show you something.

162
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:26,355
- Let's take the black and white one over there.
- All right, let's try.

163
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,517
Heh! Heh!

164
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:38,855
Do you like it?

165
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:44,817
Yes.

166
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:50,355
I'm learning to be a cheese maker.

167
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,227
What does it mean?

168
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:56,105
- The one who makes the cheese.
- Did you make these yourself?

169
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:59,644
No, my uncle. I turn them round
and keep them in order.

170
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:02,977
- It's too little.
- Eh.

171
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:07,182
There are absurd rules, we
get by, but it's mostly hard work.

172
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:12,227
The mountains,
what are their names?

173
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,017
- Grenon.
- Which one is Grenon?

174
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:17,767
The lot. We don't name the peaks here.

175
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:23,267
The glacier then?
Has he ever gone there?

176
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:26,227
No, never had the time.

177
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:32,017
In the next few days
I want to go there with my boy.

178
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:36,477
If it's okay with you, we could take you
too, Bruno. What do you think?

179
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:41,977
All right.

180
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,517
Pass the wine.

181
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,644
- Pietro, do you know that once I touched...
- Shh!

182
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,932
We'll talk later.

183
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,767
Now we don't talk,
we talk when we stop.

184
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:00,817
Okay.

185
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:32,144
Isn't that wonderful?

186
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,227
Yes.

187
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:45,727
The glacier fascinated the man
of science that was my father.

188
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,977
It reminded him of
his studies in chemistry and physics,

189
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:51,317
the mythology on which it was formed.

190
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:56,727
He told us that the glacier is
the memory of past winters

191
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,855
that the mountain holds onto for us.

192
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,817
Above a certain height
it retains the memory

193
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:06,355
and if we want to know
of a distant winter,

194
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:08,105
that's where we must go.

195
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,394
The water you are drinking

196
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,567
it's not last year's snow.

197
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,855
That will be water from 100 years ago.

198
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:23,317
- 100 years?
- Maybe even 150.

199
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,817
It's hard to know.

200
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,817
The beautiful thing about the glacier, then,
is that it never stands still.

201
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,144
In your opinion, why?

202
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,144
Why does everything go down?

203
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:38,605
Good boy.

204
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,105
You're smart.

205
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,977
Because everything goes down.

206
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,682
- What a beautiful day, huh?
- Hmm.

207
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,477
Your father knows a thing or two!

208
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:12,727
Yes.

209
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:16,017
It's nice that he teaches you too.

210
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,894
Why, doesn't your father?

211
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,932
Eh... My father is always away.

212
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,682
When I see him, he speaks very little.

213
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,267
It seems like I bother him.

214
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,682
Are you OK?

215
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:38,727
Yes.

216
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,855
- Do you want a glass of water?
- No, no, no.

217
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:47,188
- Shall I call your father?
- No, no, no.

218
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:49,188
Now I'll try to sleep, OK?

219
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,978
- Good night.
- Good night.

220
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,144
Where are you going?
On the glacier?

221
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:07,018
Yes.

222
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:09,768
Nothing in particular,
let's go for a ride.

223
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,855
Please,
be careful with these children.

224
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,268
Go.

225
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:47,894
Oh! What happened?

226
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,567
Nothing.

227
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,688
Let's not stop, let's go.

228
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:56,518
Rhythm!

229
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:45,105
Oh!

230
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,688
You jump first,
Bruno, go!

231
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,688
Take a deep breath and jump.

232
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,518
Ready?

233
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:59,018
Watch out for the ice axe.

234
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,605
One, two... Go!

235
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:03,518
Good boy. Come.

236
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,855
Good boy! My God...

237
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,605
Incredible! Give me five.

238
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,518
Good boy.

239
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,394
Go, Pietro!

240
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:14,688
It's your turn now.

241
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,018
- Oh!
- Everything OK?

242
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,268
What happened?

243
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,188
- Nothing, nothing.
- Everything OK?

244
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,394
-  Did you slip?
- Yes.

245
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:25,978
- Nothing, nothing.
-  Go.

246
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:27,067
Jump!

247
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,605
Dad, I can't do it.

248
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:39,855
Yes, you can do it, come on!

249
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:42,394
We can't go back, forward.

250
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,855
You just want to, come on.

251
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,978
Bruno did it, come on.

252
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:49,438
- Come on, Pietro!
- Oh!

253
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:51,894
Pietro! Pietro!

254
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,268
Come on, hey. Everything OK?

255
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:59,644
- Sorry, dad, sorry.
- Shh. No need to be sorry.

256
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:03,605
It's just a bit of altitude sickness.
It's nothing.

257
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,768
Shh, look at me.

258
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,938
It's a little altitude sickness, okay?

259
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:09,855
It's nothing, get up.

260
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:13,567
Breathe, take small breaths.

261
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:14,728
All right?

262
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,728
- Bruno, can you jump?
- Yes.

263
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,438
Take your ice axe and watch the ropes,
which are intertwined.

264
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:25,317
Good boy! Good boy.

265
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:27,394
- Are you good?
- Yes.

266
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,438
All right.

267
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:30,644
Now get up.

268
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:34,478
You'll lead the rope, okay?

269
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,817
- Are you leading it, okay?
- Okay.

270
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:40,438
Don't worry, it's nothing, now it's over.

271
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:43,067
The lower we go down
the more it passes.

272
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,478
Bravo, you are a champion! Go.

273
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:56,268
The next day
my father returned to Turin,

274
00:25:56,317 --> 00:26:00,644
but the memory of that morning
would remain with me forever.

275
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:10,268
Together on the glacier,

276
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,228
just the three of us,

277
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:15,817
like it would never happen again.

278
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:26,768
Hello!
Come, come! Sonia?

279
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:28,567
No thanks, I'll leave you.

280
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:39,067
"I don't know
how long our sleep lasted,"

281
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:43,978
"but it was undoubtedly lo... long."

282
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,978
"Long, because..."

283
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:50,438
"Because it refreshed us..."

284
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:53,105
- "Refreshed..."
- "Completely."

285
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:59,768
"I woke up first and carefully exami..."

286
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,067
"Examined..."

287
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:07,317
- "I carefully examined our cell."
- "Cell."

288
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:08,768
Pause.

289
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:11,144
"The waiter..."

290
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:18,144
"The waiter,
taking advantage of our rest,"

291
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:22,228
"he had cleared the table, but..."

292
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,018
Hey!

293
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,894
Do you still have a lot more to do?

294
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:45,518
Go outside, I'll be right there. Go!

295
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:46,817
Come on.

296
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:53,728
Your parents have spoken
with my uncle, did you know?

297
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:54,938
No.

298
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:58,688
- Strange, I don't understand anything anyway.
- About what?

299
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:00,768
The secrets you keep between you.

300
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,688
What did they talk to your uncle about?

301
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:07,817
That after the summer you'll take me
with you to Turin to go "liscio".

302
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:11,228
- High school?
- Yes.

303
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:14,768
They made me pick a school,
and I'll live with you.

304
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,478
And your uncle what did he say?

305
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:25,978
- He's fine with it. Do you know why?
- Why?

306
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:29,228
For the money,
he cares only about who pays.

307
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:33,978
They said they'll take care of
food, lodging, and school.

308
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:39,938
- What?

309
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:42,268
Would you like that? Would you?

310
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,355
I don't know.

311
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:48,228
I've never been to Turin,
I can't even imagine it.

312
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,728
You know, it's different.

313
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,938
You stay inside all the time,

314
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:56,438
because everything is a danger,
you can't go out.

315
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,355
And you? Would you like it?

316
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:09,605
Pietro, it's for Bruno's good,
it is for his future.

317
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:12,644
What's the problem if he grazes cows
and makes cheese?

318
00:29:12,688 --> 00:29:14,105
- None.
- Here you are.

319
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:18,188
But he has the right to study, then
decide whether to go back to his cows.

320
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:22,105
You want to bring Bruno
to that shitty city we hate?

321
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:23,894
We don't hate the city, Pietro.

322
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,817
- Turin will ruin someone like Bruno!
- It's not true.

323
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:28,355
I don't understand you.

324
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,394
It can be a beautiful thing
for him and for you.

325
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:36,394
This was your idea, not mine,
but he's my friend, not yours!

326
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,067
Well, that's a bit selfish...

327
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:41,188
- Fuck you!
- Oh! Don't you dare!

328
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,018
Don't be vulgar, it's not like us!

329
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:22,768
Damn it!

330
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,478
What is this lake called?

331
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:29,768
- Grenon.
- Oh.

332
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:41,067
But maybe you should tell him.

333
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,228
What?

334
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:47,317
That you don't want to go to Turin,
that you want to stay here.

335
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:48,355
No?

336
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:50,228
You're crazy?

337
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,978
I've been going up and down
this mountain all my life.

338
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,355
Oh!

339
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:05,067
It's me, Guglielmina Bruno,
and I'm leaving!

340
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:06,855
Understood?

341
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:30,478
Yes?

342
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:34,644
- Good morning.
- Sonia!

343
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:38,768
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, come on, have a seat.

344
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,268
Can I make you a coffee?

345
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,144
No thanks, I just wanted
to leave you these.

346
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:49,018
So many eggs!
How nice, you didn't have to!

347
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:51,817
- Where are you going?
- To Bruno.

348
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:52,894
Bruno’s gone.

349
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:55,438
Where?

350
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:58,518
His father took him away,
to work with him.

351
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:00,894
He didn't want him to go to Turin.

352
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:04,144
Bruno will be away all summer.
I'm sorry.

353
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:10,188
Pietro!

354
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:12,855
Pietro!

355
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:49,817
My parents' urgency
to help Bruno, to educate him

356
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,894
had separated us.

357
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:57,144
While I was bored in the summer,

358
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,644
he worked with his father
on construction sites.

359
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,188
His adult life
started when he was 13.

360
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:05,938
Mine, who knows.

361
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,855
I don't think he knew
what adolescence was.

362
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,768
- Hello.
- Hi.

363
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:25,688
- Been waiting long?
- No.

364
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,768
-  Hello!
-  Hello.

365
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,355
- Can I ask you for a cigarette?
- Yes, certainly.

366
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:38,317
- Thank you. And do you have to light?
- Yes.

367
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,518
- Yes, they 're here...
-  Hello! Hi, Paul!

368
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,567
Hello, Alessandro, are you alright?
How is it going?

369
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:08,148
He nodded his head.

370
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:09,768
I raised my hand

371
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,478
and then nothing else.

372
00:34:12,568 --> 00:34:16,188
-  I'll pay.
-  Bravo, bravo!

373
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,978
I didn't ask him how he was,
how much he earned,

374
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,688
if he had a girlfriend,
what he wanted from the future,

375
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,818
what he thought
of what had happened.

376
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:31,478
He didn't ask me how I was,
how my family were

377
00:34:31,518 --> 00:34:35,318
and I didn't answer:
"My mother's well, my father I’ve no idea."

378
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:41,148
Oh, fuck.
There’s also those to bring in.

379
00:34:41,188 --> 00:34:44,068
- Lunch...
- Holy shit, come on.

380
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:47,398
- Don't worry. These tie on the outside.
- Yes.

381
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:51,148
- Come, try it, this is yours. Come on.
- Yes, wait.

382
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,728
Here. Come on.

383
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,228
It's heavy.

384
00:34:56,858 --> 00:34:59,268
- Will you be okay?
- Of course he will.

385
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,728
- Hop!
- I can't do it.

386
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,818
Yes, you can!

387
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:08,108
- No, sorry, it's too much.
- Put it... Let's empty it a bit.

388
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,648
- No, it's not necessary.
- All right, don't worry.

389
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:15,768
Wait.
Now, let's do it again together, okay?

390
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:17,688
- That's no good.
- What's wrong with it?

391
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:19,648
- Nothing's right.
- Let's move things.

392
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:23,318
- What "nothing"? Come on!
- The tent, the lake, nothing's right.

393
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,438
Pietro, please!

394
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:27,688
What do you expect from me?

395
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:30,478
What, am I going fishing with dad?

396
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:36,228
Maybe we'll light a bonfire, uncork
a bottle and sing together, huh?

397
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,728
Pietro...

398
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,568
- It's stuff you do with friends.
- Come on, Pietro.

399
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:43,728
- You have no friends.
- Pietro, please!

400
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,608
So, you ask me to do these things?

401
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,478
- Come on, Pietro.
- I don't feel like it.

402
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:08,228
The following year I returned to
the mountains just for a few days,

403
00:36:13,268 --> 00:36:15,478
after that I stopped
going there altogether.

404
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:26,068
Bruno and I would never see
each other again for 15 years.

405
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,518
Why can't I make my own choices?

406
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:52,818
Do you want to make
your own choices? Make one. Hm?

407
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:54,938
Do you want to <i>do...</i> doc...

408
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,188
- Documentaries.
- Documentaries? Hm?

409
00:36:57,228 --> 00:37:00,568
Do you want to study American Literature?
What do you want to do?

410
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:03,068
Write? Travel around the world?

411
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:07,068
You've started your studies.
Finish them! Concentrate!

412
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:12,318
There will always be time to...
fucking dream!

413
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,188
Pietro, I beg you.

414
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,018
Don't throw your life away.

415
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:20,108
Listen to me.

416
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:24,518
- You're the one who wasted yours.
- Pietro!

417
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:28,728
Ri... R<i>i...

418
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:32,688
- Take back what you said.
- No.

419
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:41,438
Take it back.

420
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:50,858
I know one thing.

421
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,188
I won't become like you.

422
00:37:55,228 --> 00:37:56,228
I swear.

423
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:57,398
- Hey, Pietro!
- Hey.

424
00:38:57,438 --> 00:39:00,148
Are you coming with us to Mad Dog? Huh?

425
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:04,018
- Come on, when you get off, come.
- No, I wanted to wake up early tomorrow.

426
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:06,898
- Yes, okay, as usual.
- Yes, well. Bye, Pietro.

427
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:09,148
- Bye.
- We'll see each other later.

428
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:41,268
In this first half

429
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:44,318
Juventus showed little attention
in the opponent's half.

430
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:46,358
Enter the area...

431
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,768
- Cannavaro's advances...
- Ah...

432
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,518
Cannavaro finally
gets rid of the ball...

433
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:22,768
Yes.

434
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,978
- Mom, is there anyone there with you?
- Alessandra is here.

435
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:29,188
- Is there anyone there with you?
- Alessandra is here!

436
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:30,228
Yes?

437
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:34,268
- Okay, I'm coming home.
- I didn't hear.

438
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:37,608
- I'm coming home!
- All right.

439
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:39,768
Okay.

440
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,318
Hi, Bruno.

441
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:40,768
Hi, Pietro.

442
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:56,148
Condolences.

443
00:43:58,018 --> 00:43:59,018
Thank you.

444
00:44:00,648 --> 00:44:03,188
- Thanks for the fire.
- No, my pleasure.

445
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:07,518
Nice beard.

446
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:13,518
Yours is more beautiful, a real beard.

447
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:19,228
Come on, let's go, it takes a while.

448
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,148
Jump off.

449
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,188
- Here?
- We'll walk.

450
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,188
"We'll walk".

451
00:46:11,898 --> 00:46:13,018
Go.

452
00:46:14,768 --> 00:46:16,108
If you stop, it's worse.

453
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,858
Yeah?

454
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:31,108
This is the terrain.

455
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:34,228
Those are the old walls.

456
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:48,938
It's a ruin.

457
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:57,228
When your father saw it,

458
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,018
he immediately understood
that it was the right one.

459
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:06,898
Then I had to look for the owners
and get them to sell.

460
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:09,858
It's called Barma Drola.

461
00:47:09,898 --> 00:47:11,858
- What?
- Barma Drola.

462
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:26,188
- What did he want to do with it?
- A house.

463
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,188
"A house"?

464
00:47:29,148 --> 00:47:31,608
He wanted to build a house here.

465
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,148
He asked me to build it.

466
00:47:52,648 --> 00:47:54,518
I inherited a pile of rocks.

467
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:58,148
I'm free this summer.

468
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:02,608
- For what?
- To build it.

469
00:48:02,648 --> 00:48:06,608
No. Thanks, no need.

470
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:12,228
I promised him.

471
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:17,358
It was right there
where are you now,

472
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:20,818
when he made me promise.

473
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,608
Even if he's gone,
for me it doesn't change anything.

474
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:31,318
And with what money?

475
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:37,188
- It's just buying the material.
- Who'll pay you?

476
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,818
Don't worry about me.

477
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:43,688
The only thing I need

478
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:45,978
is the labourer.

479
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:48,648
No.

480
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:51,068
So, we finish
in three or four months.

481
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:54,768
I'm clumsy.

482
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:56,728
I'm sorry.

483
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,148
I'll teach you.

484
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:04,108
Four months?

485
00:49:06,148 --> 00:49:08,768
Well then let's get started
after winter,

486
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:11,358
after the snow's melted.

487
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:21,018
Thank you.

488
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:29,068
My father died
when he was 62 and I was 31,

489
00:49:29,108 --> 00:49:31,228
the age he was when I was born.

490
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:39,268
But I wasn't married,
I hadn't had a child,

491
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:42,108
I didn't even have a steady job.

492
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:46,728
My life seemed to me
half that of a man

493
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:48,608
and half that of a boy.

494
00:49:57,648 --> 00:49:59,688
What was my father's wish?

495
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:05,398
He, who never succeeded
in stopping work

496
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:08,768
and that hardly a summer day
passed in the mountains.

497
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,188
What was I to do
with his lost dream

498
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:20,318
and with a promise that wasn't mine?

499
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:11,818
I must be the red marker,
because he's always been the black one.

500
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:16,728
This is when we went
on the glacier with Bruno,

501
00:51:19,938 --> 00:51:22,518
so Bruno must be
the green marker.

502
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:24,318
No?

503
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:27,478
They often went to the mountains.

504
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:29,648
Up?

505
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,018
Yes.

506
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:35,688
Bruno was very close to us
in these years.

507
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:38,518
Yes?

508
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,938
And dad helped him a lot.

509
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:48,068
How so?

510
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,188
Hmm, with everything.

511
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:56,398
At some point,
Bruno had a fight with his father

512
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:59,438
and when he needed advice,
he came to us.

513
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:04,438
He trusted what dad said.

514
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:06,648
Okay.

515
00:52:09,478 --> 00:52:11,438
That's what happens to those who leave.

516
00:52:13,228 --> 00:52:14,228
What?

517
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:17,438
The others continue
to live without him.

518
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,148
Bruno always asked for news of you.

519
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:36,018
He asked?

520
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,228
Yes, and I told him
everything I knew about you.

521
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:45,108
It wasn't much,
but I told him.

522
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:43,978
On three, push.

523
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:46,978
- Are you tearing down the wall?
- With your feet, come on.

524
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:49,188
One, two, three.

525
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:55,108
Go, go! Go!

526
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,568
It will take a week
to clear it.

527
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,148
It's possible, yes.

528
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:18,438
Oh shit.

529
00:55:08,478 --> 00:55:09,818
Are you saying we can do it?

530
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:15,018
It's hard to know.

531
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,978
This here is a strange plant.

532
00:55:19,268 --> 00:55:21,648
It's strong when it grows where it was born,

533
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:25,438
but it's weak if
you put it somewhere else.

534
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:28,568
- Have you already tried it?
- Yeah.

535
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:30,858
- How did it go?
- Bad.

536
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:36,648
- Shall we leave this stuff here?
- No.

537
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:39,898
I'll stay with it too.

538
00:55:40,768 --> 00:55:42,148
You want to sleep up here?

539
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:47,518
I can't lose
four hours of work travelling each day.

540
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:53,438
The bricklayer is
on the construction site,

541
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,018
that's how it's done.

542
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:02,358
So, I go up and down
and you stay here for four months?

543
00:56:02,398 --> 00:56:04,188
That's what it takes.

544
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:08,268
Then on Saturday I go down
and I sleep in my bed.

545
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:21,018
I'll wait for you at 9 in the morning.
At six you are free.

546
00:56:22,018 --> 00:56:23,534
Is that okay with you?

547
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:25,818
Yes.

548
00:56:26,688 --> 00:56:27,688
Well.

549
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:29,478
Then bye.

550
00:56:31,228 --> 00:56:32,228
Bye.

551
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:18,398
Shh, calm down.

552
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,478
Shall we put it on?

553
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,898
Okay, later. We'll do it later.

554
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,478
Hey, hey...

555
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:37,398
Hey! Hey!

556
00:57:37,438 --> 00:57:39,818
Hey! Hey! Hey!

557
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:25,768
You don't have to think too much in this job,
otherwise, you'd go crazy.

558
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:28,858
Look, what a beautiful day.

559
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:31,148
What's it like when it's bad?

560
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:42,358
Berto?

561
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:45,518
Let's go!

562
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:19,438
Absurd... I remember it much bigger.

563
00:59:22,648 --> 00:59:24,438
- Here.
- Hmm.

564
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:44,108
In the last ten years

565
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:49,068
I never spoke to my father.

566
00:59:52,148 --> 00:59:53,148
I know.

567
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:01,268
Did he talk to you about me?

568
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:08,268
No.

569
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:17,978
And your father?

570
01:00:20,188 --> 01:00:21,188
Is he still there?

571
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,818
He didn't leave me alone.

572
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:28,438
I finally had to give him one.

573
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:35,148
I must have hurt him,
because I haven't seen him since.

574
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:36,728
I'm sorry.

575
01:00:41,188 --> 01:00:42,518
Old drunk.

576
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,070
I imagined the evenings there among them
when Bruno was 20, 25 years old

577
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,980
and he was there talking
with my father instead of me.

578
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,400
Maybe it wouldn't have happened
if I had stayed,

579
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,980
or maybe we would share those moments.

580
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,820
I felt like I lost
the most important things,

581
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:47,150
while I was busy with others,
so trivial that I don't even remember them.

582
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:13,110
concrete, stones, concrete, concrete,

583
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,768
stone so to speak.

584
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,320
Ti, ta, pum, concrete, the house.

585
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,730
- "The House".
- Broadly speaking.

586
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,190
A great master build.

587
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,730
All thanks to Bruno.

588
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,940
Seriously, he's very good.

589
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,518
I'm just the handyman.

590
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,150
Starting tomorrow I'm moving up too.

591
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:40,320
- Oh.
- Yes.

592
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:03,820
He would have been happy
to see what you're doing, you know?

593
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,320
Yes?

594
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,070
Thank you.

595
01:03:35,518 --> 01:03:37,570
Hey, hey.

596
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,320
Let's go.

597
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,018
Roy!

598
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,230
Roy!

599
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
<i>Ah...

600
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Roy!

601
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,110
Roy!

602
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,730
Easy, Roy! Where the fuck are you running?

603
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,480
Bruno, come here!

604
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:04,768
Let's go.

605
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,610
- Ah!
- Go on, go on.

606
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,150
Ah!

607
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,190
Wait.

608
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,268
- Go.
- Ah.

609
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:21,480
Go on.

610
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,268
Wonderful.

611
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,268
How do you get to the top of Grenon?

612
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,230
It's easy, there's a path.

613
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:37,820
You arrive at the stony ground,
continue straight on and get to the top.

614
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,360
You can't go wrong.

615
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,610
Ok, I'll try it on Sunday.

616
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,518
- Go now.
- No, not now.

617
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,940
- Go now!
-  No, not now.

618
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,018
- Today I'll manage here.
- No.

619
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,900
Don't worry,
take the day.

620
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,570
- No, no.
- Go now, I told you! Go!

621
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,110
Bruno!

622
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,018
Bruno!

623
01:08:05,768 --> 01:08:07,110
Bruno!

624
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:09,070
Bruno!

625
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,359
Pietro!

626
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,359
Bruno!

627
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:40,859
No?

628
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:43,270
- Yes.
- Yes?

629
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:46,189
We finished?

630
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:49,569
"Finished" is a big word.
There's the roof.

631
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,819
Let's go down.

632
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,979
Come here.

633
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,319
Bomb.

634
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,399
Oh, damn...

635
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:52,939
What are you doing?

636
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,319
Nothing.

637
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:00,229
I'll wait.

638
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:11,479
Too bad the summer is over.

639
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,439
But you'll come back, right?

640
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:22,479
Of course, I'll come back,
it's our home.

641
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,189
- What are you laughing at?
- It's your house.

642
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:27,229
No.

643
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,649
This is home to us both.

644
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:34,359
- You're crazy.
- Look, I'm not kidding.

645
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,649
This is our summer house.
We'll see each other here every year.

646
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:47,229
Alright.

647
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:49,689
"Alright".

648
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:58,609
We're finished here, what are your plans?

649
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:03,109
I'd like to restore my uncle's pasture.

650
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:05,189
- Lovely.
- Hmm.

651
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:11,189
Get some cows, like this,
they don't cost anything anymore.

652
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,319
Do they make anything, at least?

653
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:20,770
If it was just for the money,
I'd continue laying bricks.

654
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:25,689
I wasn't born for this.

655
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,005
What was it you were born for?

656
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,359
To be a mountaineer.

657
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,020
All my ancestors lived
on the mountains with the beasts.

658
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,189
My father was the first who quit
and he took me away too.

659
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:47,149
He would have electrocuted
the cows with the current.

660
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,229
My uncle screwed up too.

661
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,319
It's a nice project, really.

662
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:58,649
Really.

663
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,729
- And you?
- Hmm?

664
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,729
- Plans?
- Me?

665
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:12,939
Nope, I guess I don't know.

666
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:17,609
What have you done these years?

667
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,819
I've done a lot of work,

668
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:25,859
But... actually nothing.

669
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:30,399
Your mother told me that you write,

670
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:33,899
that you tried to write a book.

671
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:37,569
No, it's not for me.
I'm not good enough.

672
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,520
Me, if I like something,
I do it, or at least try to.

673
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,399
What projects do I have?

674
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:05,939
That was the question..

675
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:09,069
Look,

676
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:13,979
a nice bonfire,

677
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:16,649
the fish,

678
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,399
a few mountains here and there

679
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,520
and you.

680
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:26,770
Stop this.

681
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:29,270
Don't move.

682
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:31,899
Stop.

683
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:32,939
Thank you.

684
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:34,649
Here you are.

685
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,939
I think I could stay like this forever.

686
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:46,979
I'm going nowhere.

687
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:25,899
Hello, Pietro.

688
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:29,359
- Fili, do you want a coffee?
- What?

689
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:32,649
- A coffee, do you want one?
- It's here.

690
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:33,939
Yes, thank you.

691
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:53,270
Go on.

692
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:56,109
Go! Let's get it out there.

693
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:59,149
- Where are you going? Who's that? Go.
- Come on!

694
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:02,020
This!

695
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:06,149
# And now
we complain so much

696
01:15:06,189 --> 01:15:11,189
# Our spirits are in the clouds

697
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:14,069
# And they make it rain #

698
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:31,189
- They're coming next week.
- Who?

699
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:35,439
-  Friends from Turin.
- Ah okay.

700
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:38,229
When they get here,
I'll go down to the pasture.

701
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,270
No.

702
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:43,979
Yes, I'll sleep on the construction site
and work a little.

703
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:46,979
There is space.

704
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:51,979
Okay.

705
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:57,020
- It's a smash.
- After work.

706
01:15:57,069 --> 01:15:59,319
I'll do it. Of course?

707
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,149
- Go.
- Why not?

708
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:04,069
- Oh!
- This is where we eat, outside.

709
01:16:04,109 --> 01:16:05,979
-  You're welcome.
-  May I?

710
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,359
- Voila, here we are.
- Wow!

711
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,439
- It's gorgeous.
- Huh?

712
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:12,819
- Nice, huh?
- Holy shit.

713
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:15,609
- I mean, but what is it?
- A picture.

714
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:16,899
Look out.

715
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:19,939
- No!
- Eh?

716
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:21,609
- Huh?
- It's beautiful.

717
01:16:21,649 --> 01:16:24,609
This is Bruno's brilliant invention,
not the light bulb

718
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:27,609
but a mill
which he built down by the creek.

719
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,649
We have enough electricity for you.

720
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,819
- For you.
- For that.

721
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:32,229
- All right.
- It's enough.

722
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,270
But guys...

723
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:35,899
Sir?

724
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:38,109
So, you conquered it?

725
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:39,520
Yes.

726
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:42,520
- I'm making a mess.
- I'll do it.

727
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,859
- I told you the trick.
- Thank you.

728
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:48,270
- Eh!
- Bruno! Bruno!

729
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:50,109
- Hey.
- Come, come.

730
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:52,229
- This is Massimo.
- Hi.

731
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,359
- Barbara.
- Pleasure.

732
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:55,149
- And Lara, from Turin.
- Hello.

733
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:59,439
Wow, Bruno, I have to tell you,
this place is beautiful.

734
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:04,069
- I would never leave.
- Sure, come back in November, then we'll see.

735
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:08,770
I miss the mountains.

736
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:13,770
- Do you come from the mountains too?
- Yes.

737
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:18,189
My love, we should buy
a place like this, a ruin.

738
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:19,520
We'll renovate it.

739
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:22,149
- We'll make it more beautiful than yours.
- Yes, fine.

740
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:25,229
- Enough, we're done with Turin.
- Yes.

741
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,979
We'll invite all
our friends from Turin to come.

742
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,319
We'll make ourselves a nice ecological village
here in the middle of nature.

743
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:32,649
Nice huh?

744
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:34,649
Nice.

745
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:37,270
It's just you from the city
who call it "nature".

746
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:41,939
It's so abstract in your mind
that even the name is abstract.

747
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:44,689
I get it, what do you call it?

748
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:50,069
Here we say...
woods, pastures,

749
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:52,770
river, rock, path.

750
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:57,439
Things you can point too with your finger,
things you can use.

751
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:59,359
Wait, you want to tell me

752
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:02,729
that one can't simply enjoy
the beauty of nature?

753
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,649
Yes, of course, and eat air.

754
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:08,399
Shot that one down.

755
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:12,689
We create good land,
we garden...

756
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:14,859
- Hmm.
- Nice.

757
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,689
Then in winter what do you plan to do?

758
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:20,069
Look, there are meters of snow here.

759
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:23,149
Then what do you eat?
polenta and potatoes like the old folk?

760
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:27,770
All right, I won't call it "nature" anymore,
but you'll let me dream?

761
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:30,859
- You'll let me dream? I beg you!
- Let him dream.

762
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:32,520
Please, can you let me dream?

763
01:18:34,939 --> 01:18:36,109
What was it?

764
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:39,689
He doesn't kiss.

765
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:49,729
Shit, it's freezing!

766
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,229
- Yep.
- Oh God.

767
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,109
- Are you coming?
- No.

768
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:55,520
- Come on!
- No, go.

769
01:19:55,569 --> 01:19:57,319
- Come on!
- Go, go, go!

770
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,069
- Oh...
- If you want, I'll count.

771
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:00,479
- I'm going, eh.
- I'm going.

772
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,520
Look at me.

773
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:02,569
One!

774
01:20:03,609 --> 01:20:04,649
Two.

775
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:06,979
Three

776
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,399
Oh!

777
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:13,609
Wow!

778
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:14,649
Hey

779
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:17,399
Hey

780
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:22,069
In the winter I work two jobs

781
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,939
and the summer I try
to stay ahead as much as possible.

782
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:28,109
Then there's the mortgage, the bank...

783
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:31,020
I don't sleep much,

784
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:33,359
but it's worth it.

785
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:35,229
I'll make cheese like it used to be.

786
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:38,189
Now it's a little more difficult
with the new rules.

787
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:41,149
- When would you like to start?
- With the inarpa.

788
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:43,609
- Heh?
- In June.

789
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:45,649
When you go up to the mountain pasture.

790
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:53,109
- We'll see.
- Hmm.

791
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:19,729
- Here.
- Hold the dishes.

792
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,189
- Table two.
- Give me the plates, come on.

793
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:23,229
Go.

794
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:26,819
OK, perfect.

795
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:29,229
- Did you finish?
- Yes, I'll continue.

796
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:32,020
Hurry up please
we're in trouble.

797
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:34,069
- Ready?
- Hello, Pietro.

798
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,729
- Ready?
- I'm Bruno.

799
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:39,899
- Bruno!
- Yes.

800
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:41,770
- Everything OK?
- Sure.

801
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:46,609
Listen, listen,
I wanted to ask you something.

802
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:48,319
Come on!

803
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:49,819
Lara came.

804
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,649
- "Lara"?
- Yes, YES.

805
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:55,270
She wanted to see the pastures.

806
01:21:55,319 --> 01:21:58,439
Move! Do you need to
be on the phone right now?

807
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,520
- A minute!
- There's a mess!

808
01:22:00,569 --> 01:22:05,479
I was saying, she was interested in the pastures
and I took her up to see it.

809
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,149
- She told me that she’d like to work for us.
- Okay.

810
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:14,229
I like the idea, but is a woman
in the mountains a good idea?

811
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,770
She's one who knows how to do it, 
and she has a hard head.

812
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,770
Seemed that way to me.

813
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,149
- What?
- It seemed that way to me, yes!

814
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:23,229
So?

815
01:22:23,859 --> 01:22:27,189
What I don’t know
is how things are between you.

816
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:31,859
Oh! There's nothing between us.

817
01:22:31,899 --> 01:22:32,899
Are you sure?

818
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:37,439
There's nothing between us,
we're just friends.

819
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:41,229
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

820
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:43,939
- Ah.
- Yes. No, really.

821
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:45,770
Alright, see you.

822
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:49,069
- Huh?
- See you, bye.

823
01:22:53,149 --> 01:22:55,819
She is very delicate.

824
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:56,939
Really?

825
01:22:57,729 --> 01:23:00,189
First, you have to make her relax.

826
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:04,899
Ah, here we are.

827
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:10,729
What's up?

828
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:13,319
You said she needs to relax.

829
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:19,319
Hmm? Ah...

830
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,649
We have been lucky.

831
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:25,609
I think she likes you.

832
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:28,399
Yes, it's coming out well.

833
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,319
- Hi.
- Morning.

834
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:33,520
Oh.

835
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:38,189
I'll help you.

836
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:11,859
Hey! Hey! Hey!

837
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:15,020
Come on, go. Very, very good.

838
01:24:15,729 --> 01:24:17,149
I'll act as a sideguard.

839
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:20,439
Go, go, go!

840
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:25,069
Let's go. Let's go.

841
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,899
- Go.
- Come on!

842
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,359
The calf's stomach?

843
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,819
Without that piece,
cheese would not exist.

844
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:35,609
Imagine who the fuck figured it out.

845
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:39,819
- The wild man.
- "The Wild Man"?

846
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:45,399
Part man, part animal and part tree,

847
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:47,689
like me.

848
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,189
- How do you say it in dialect?

849
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:54,689
- "Omo servadzo".
- "Omo servadzo".

850
01:24:57,149 --> 01:24:58,939
And the "servadza" woman?

851
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:01,899
She's fantastic.

852
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:04,859
She is strong, she never gets tired.

853
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:11,819
She also takes care of the accounts,
thank God. I hate that stuff.

854
01:25:13,569 --> 01:25:15,689
She even brings down the books.

855
01:25:15,729 --> 01:25:18,270
Even? Why don't you bring them?

856
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:19,359
No.

857
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:22,020
The mountaineer is in the mountains.

858
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,479
The mountaineer's woman goes up and down.

859
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:49,819
Sorry.

860
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:53,149
What?

861
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:57,859
I wish I could have
spent more time with you.

862
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,479
I never leave here.

863
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:04,319
Things change.

864
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:06,399
Hmm.

865
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,109
I'll wait for you outside.

866
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:14,819
For Bruno there were neither Saturdays
nor Sundays in the mountain pastures.

867
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:18,689
Even if it took a long time,
he persisted in milking the cows by hand.

868
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:22,939
There was a right way in his life
to do everything.

869
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:53,319
The summer that followed,
Lara was pregnant.

870
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,479
I saw her grazing the cows,
alone, in the wind,

871
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,770
with a round belly and thick ankles.

872
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,520
More and more a creature of the mountain.

873
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,069
The following year she went out to pasture
with a little girl in her arms.

874
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:26,359
Even if Bruno and Lara
always invited me to stop there,

875
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:29,109
something pushed me
to say hello to that family

876
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:31,479
and to take the path to the Barma.

877
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:41,770
Sometimes I wanted to talk
with my father.

878
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,819
"Did you see, dad?"

879
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:49,979
"One of your children
has found its way to him."

880
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:51,649
"The other one hasn't."

881
01:27:57,399 --> 01:27:59,229
I was tired of that old me.

882
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:03,689
I wanted to transform, evolve, leave

883
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:06,689
for a new, brand-new Pietro.

884
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:30,649
Yes?

885
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:01,319
Thank you. Thank you.

886
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:15,569
- Hello, "namasté" to you.
- I sure hope the Wi-Fi works here.

887
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:18,149
Does the wi-fi work?

888
01:29:19,569 --> 01:29:21,149
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

889
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:23,319
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

890
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:26,109
Can you believe that yak on the road down there?

891
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:27,149
Yes.

892
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:29,770
I thought it was going to chase you,
I was scared for a second.

893
01:29:29,819 --> 01:29:31,979
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yes.

894
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,859
What do you think she has...
Do you think she has a root beer?

895
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:46,819
"Sati".

896
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:49,069
- "Sati"?
-  Hmm.

897
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:53,649
- "Puri".
- "Purì"?

898
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:54,689
Huh.

899
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:57,569
- "Purì"?
- "Puri".

900
01:31:57,609 --> 01:31:58,609
Oh.

901
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:02,770
You...

902
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:03,819
"Purò".

903
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:07,770
- "Pure".
- "Purò, purì".

904
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:09,189
"Purò, purì".

905
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,859
- "Purò".
- "Puri".

906
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:14,899
"Purò, purì". Okay.

907
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:16,399
Husband, wife.

908
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:18,939
No "puri".

909
01:32:18,979 --> 01:32:20,520
- No "Puri"?
- No.

910
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:21,569
"Purò".

911
01:32:36,689 --> 01:32:39,729
I was wondering what
Bruno would have thought of the houses,

912
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:41,439
how they built them

913
01:32:42,439 --> 01:32:46,270
of their way of working the land,
in the hands of women,

914
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:48,859
of children's games
among the cattle.

915
01:32:50,859 --> 01:32:54,649
Perhaps he would have thought the mountain
people of the world are all one.

916
01:32:56,609 --> 01:32:58,979
He would have liked the Himalayas too.

917
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:08,020
Heh! Heh!

918
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,359
Heh! Heh! Heh!

919
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,609
- Eh!
- Oh! Oh!

920
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,399
- Hey!
- Oh!

921
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:21,229
It's Pietro!

922
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,189
Hey!

923
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:25,359
Hello, Anita!

924
01:33:48,069 --> 01:33:50,149
Hm...

925
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:58,609
Yak butter has a stronger flavour.

926
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:02,569
Yes, but they use it
for everything,

927
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:05,689
for lamps,
as a hair ointment

928
01:34:05,729 --> 01:34:08,109
and in sky burials.

929
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:12,899
There is not enough wood in Nepal
to cremate the corpses.

930
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:17,229
They skin them and leave them
on a plateau for the vultures.

931
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:21,939
They come back after a few days
and find only the bones,

932
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:25,819
which they crush
and knead with butter and flour,

933
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:27,770
which then becomes food for birds.

934
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:31,319
And so, the corpse disappears completely.

935
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:32,939
How horrible!

936
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:37,319
What an image, the sky burials!

937
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:39,020
Why "horrible"?

938
01:34:39,069 --> 01:34:41,939
Can you imagine your mother skinned

939
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:44,520
and torn apart like a...

940
01:34:44,569 --> 01:34:47,520
- It's not like they don't eat it buried underground.
- At least you don't see it.

941
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,149
I like it.
Bird feed and go, right?

942
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:56,819
- Anyone want another grappa?
- Me.

943
01:34:56,859 --> 01:34:59,899
Not for me,
it's already going to my head.

944
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:01,609
That means it's good.

945
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:13,770
What are you doing?

946
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:29,479
Ah, shall we mix a little here?

947
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,569
Hmm.

948
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,069
- Oh!
- Let's give them some too.

949
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,109
Alright.

950
01:35:38,189 --> 01:35:39,569
The women, Berto?

951
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:44,149
Around the world are they
as beautiful as those of the Alps?

952
01:35:44,189 --> 01:35:46,569
Oh:

953
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:52,069
Heh!

954
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:56,819
Come on, we know they're after you,
now that you're famous.

955
01:35:56,859 --> 01:35:59,439
"Famous"... A book they published for me.

956
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:02,979
- Don't torment him!
- I worry about my friend.

957
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:04,649
Yes? You worry?

958
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:09,689
Have you become a Buddhist monk?

959
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:10,819
Look at me, oh!

960
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:12,020
- That?
- No.

961
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:13,229
- No?
- No!

962
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:23,729
- Uh!
- Hmm.

963
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,819
- Do you want to hear some bullshit?
- Yes, yes.

964
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:28,609
Does this bother you?

965
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,229
- When I was in Nepal...
- Hmm.

966
01:36:32,819 --> 01:36:36,020
Someone stopped me and then...

967
01:36:37,689 --> 01:36:39,729
Someone stopped me.

968
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,819
He told me: "Are you doing
the tour of the eight mountains?"

969
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:46,319
And then he did this, look.

970
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:50,899
And he begins to draw.

971
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:53,069
Ah...

972
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:58,069
He tells me ...

973
01:36:58,109 --> 01:36:59,229
He tells me:

974
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,649
"This is the world for us."

975
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:06,069
"There are eight mountains and eight seas"

976
01:37:06,109 --> 01:37:07,859
This in the middle..."

977
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:11,689
Do you see this?

978
01:37:12,609 --> 01:37:14,979
It looks like an asshole, but this...

979
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:18,069
This is the world for us

980
01:37:18,109 --> 01:37:22,609
and at the centre is this...

981
01:37:22,649 --> 01:37:28,520
There's this big mountain,
Mount Sumeru.

982
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:32,149
The question is this, listen to me.

983
01:37:32,189 --> 01:37:35,649
The question is this:
"Who learned the most,"

984
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:38,939
"who has seen the eight mountains
and the eight seas"

985
01:37:38,979 --> 01:37:43,270
"or whoever made it to the top
of Mount Sumeru?"

986
01:37:44,189 --> 01:37:45,479
Answer.

987
01:37:49,689 --> 01:37:52,189
I am the one

988
01:37:53,319 --> 01:37:56,689
who is on the mountain

989
01:37:56,729 --> 01:37:58,649
and you're the one
who made the rounds...

990
01:37:58,689 --> 01:38:00,859
- Of the eight...
- Of the eight...

991
01:38:00,899 --> 01:38:04,899
- Very good, good.
- Who wins?

992
01:38:04,939 --> 01:38:06,189
I win.

993
01:38:06,899 --> 01:38:07,899
Always.

994
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,859
I win.

995
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:13,189
Put a little grappa, the last one,

996
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:16,020
goodnight grappa.

997
01:38:16,069 --> 01:38:17,689
I'll sleep here, Bruno.

998
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:21,359
Good night.

999
01:39:45,149 --> 01:39:47,479
Espresso.

1000
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:09,770
- Hi.
- Hey, hi.

1001
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:13,729
- How are you?
- Well.

1002
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:19,399
- Can I take this?
- Yes.

1003
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,939
An espresso, "krpaya".
Cold if possible.

1004
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:26,979
Yes.

1005
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:30,399
"Krpaya" is not a word
that we use every day.

1006
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:31,899
- No?
- No.

1007
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:34,362
It's a bit outdated.

1008
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:37,270
- We say "please".
- As in English.

1009
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:38,572
- Yes.
- "Please".

1010
01:40:38,612 --> 01:40:41,729
- How do you say it in your language?
- In mine?

1011
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,652
"Per favore".

1012
01:40:43,692 --> 01:40:44,729
How, sorry?

1013
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:46,979
- "Per favore".
- Per fava...

1014
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:50,229
- No, "per favore".
- "per flavour".

1015
01:41:07,362 --> 01:41:08,652
Ah...

1016
01:41:30,729 --> 01:41:31,729
One...

1017
01:41:34,652 --> 01:41:35,822
- Ready?
- Yes.

1018
01:41:37,822 --> 01:41:39,112
Smile!

1019
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:41,479
Hmm.

1020
01:43:04,152 --> 01:43:05,192
Berto?

1021
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,020
Hey!

1022
01:43:08,652 --> 01:43:10,020
Do you want me to pass them to you?

1023
01:43:10,692 --> 01:43:13,192
Yes, I'll do it first.

1024
01:43:56,902 --> 01:44:00,612
- You know what we say here when we're sad?
- What?

1025
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:02,362
- "I'm elsewhere."
- "I'm elsewhere?"

1026
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:05,192
"How are you?"
"I'm elsewhere." That's it.

1027
01:44:07,652 --> 01:44:10,770
It's when I started
to read that I understood

1028
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:14,229
how many ways there are
to say things.

1029
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:20,229
If not... poor words, poor thoughts.

1030
01:44:23,192 --> 01:44:24,362
Beautiful.

1031
01:44:28,692 --> 01:44:31,520
I'm happy that you have found 
your words, Berto.

1032
01:44:35,822 --> 01:44:37,072
Yes, it's absurd.

1033
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:41,692
There is a publisher who believes in you

1034
01:44:43,192 --> 01:44:45,072
and poof, he changes everything.

1035
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:53,020
I won't get rich, but I can stay
quiet in Nepal for a while.

1036
01:44:54,362 --> 01:44:55,479
Do you like it there?

1037
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:57,152
Yes.

1038
01:45:03,822 --> 01:45:04,822
What?

1039
01:45:11,152 --> 01:45:12,612
I met someone.

1040
01:45:12,652 --> 01:45:14,402
- Oh!
- Yes.

1041
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:18,652
- I knew it.
- Did you know that?

1042
01:45:19,322 --> 01:45:21,479
Her name is Asmi.

1043
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,652
She does the same job as my mother, more or less.

1044
01:45:28,192 --> 01:45:31,770
The other day I was
thinking that it's absurd

1045
01:45:31,822 --> 01:45:37,072
how one finds
one's place in the world

1046
01:45:37,112 --> 01:45:40,902
in the least unpredictable ways
than one imagines.

1047
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:51,362
Nice.

1048
01:45:52,322 --> 01:45:54,020
I'm happy for you.

1049
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:09,442
I don't know if I will come back next year.

1050
01:46:27,942 --> 01:46:29,402
It's time to milk.

1051
01:46:31,229 --> 01:46:33,902
- Come to dinner one of these days.
- Yes.

1052
01:48:16,152 --> 01:48:19,270
"Here with my 11-year-old son Pietro."

1053
01:48:19,322 --> 01:48:23,822
"This will be my last as lead climber,
because in a while he'll pull me up."

1054
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,072
"I will always carry the memory of
these days as the most beautiful refuge."

1055
01:48:29,112 --> 01:48:33,270
"Giovanni Guasti, August 1984."

1056
01:49:38,362 --> 01:49:42,770
"Went up from Grana
in two hours and 37 minutes. Great run."

1057
01:49:42,822 --> 01:49:45,362
"Sighted six ibexes and an eagle."

1058
01:49:46,692 --> 01:49:49,692
"Today I'm 21 again,
like my companion here."

1059
01:49:50,612 --> 01:49:55,729
"John Gusti
and Bruno Guglielmina, July 1994."

1060
01:50:56,902 --> 01:51:01,112
Then I found what must
be the last message from him.

1061
01:51:02,902 --> 01:51:05,572
"It would be nice to stay
up here forever,"

1062
01:51:05,612 --> 01:51:09,822
"without seeing anyone, without having to go
down to the valley again."

1063
01:51:13,072 --> 01:51:17,979
Here is the sentiment that had made him
dream of a home away from the world.

1064
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:42,822
Only now did I understand, I had two fathers.

1065
01:51:43,902 --> 01:51:47,822
The first was the stranger
with whom I had lived 20 years in the city.

1066
01:51:47,862 --> 01:51:50,072
The second was the mountain father,

1067
01:51:50,902 --> 01:51:54,362
whom I had only glimpsed,
yet known better.

1068
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,020
This other father had left me
a ruin to rebuild,

1069
01:52:03,572 --> 01:52:06,770
but maybe he didn't know
it would be another's greatest gift.

1070
01:52:08,612 --> 01:52:11,020
Maybe we could rent rooms, right?

1071
01:52:11,072 --> 01:52:13,112
Farmhouses work well.

1072
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:18,229
We quit selling to the cooperative.

1073
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:21,479
We sell directly to customers,
which is quite a difference.

1074
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,112
- It takes longer.
- Certainly.

1075
01:52:23,152 --> 01:52:26,072
Luckily Francesca is here.

1076
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:29,822
I use her car and she also does me
the pleasure of looking after Anita.

1077
01:52:29,862 --> 01:52:33,020
Without her I don't know
what we would do, huh?

1078
01:52:33,072 --> 01:52:34,902
- Hmm.
- Don't you agree?

1079
01:52:34,942 --> 01:52:35,942
Yes.

1080
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:40,942
Now we have to make
some more effort.

1081
01:52:40,979 --> 01:52:43,229
We can't keep up with the payments,

1082
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:47,322
because they give us contributions,
but they are not enough.

1083
01:52:48,112 --> 01:52:51,020
At the bank, they always
blame the crisis.

1084
01:52:51,822 --> 01:52:53,072
One jerk told me

1085
01:52:53,112 --> 01:52:56,770
that it was better if I asked for 20 million
on loan instead of 20,000 euros.

1086
01:52:56,822 --> 01:52:59,322
You understand?
We’re of no use to them.

1087
01:53:00,072 --> 01:53:02,152
We'll sort it in the summer.

1088
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:04,979
We are at our limit,
but we'll make it in that period,

1089
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,862
we are self-sufficient,

1090
01:53:06,902 --> 01:53:10,229
but winter in Grana
it's a whole other story.

1091
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:14,072
We have stable rent
and all other expenses.

1092
01:53:14,112 --> 01:53:15,520
How do we do it?

1093
01:53:16,192 --> 01:53:19,479
We won't die of hunger,
we have a lot of cheese.

1094
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,979
God! There it is. When he doesn't know
what to do, he makes jokes.

1095
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:27,612
- Come on, Lara... - What "come on"?
Do you hear me when I speak?

1096
01:53:27,652 --> 01:53:31,362
We have terrible debts,
open your eyes to reality!

1097
01:53:31,402 --> 01:53:33,902
- Shall we discuss it now?
- God...

1098
01:53:33,942 --> 01:53:36,479
- We never see Pietro.
- So, what are we going to talk about?

1099
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,729
- You decide.
- Yes, go...

1100
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:41,612
This one lives on top of the mountains,

1101
01:53:41,652 --> 01:53:44,020
but he’s unfamiliar with the problems
of us mere mortals.

1102
01:53:44,072 --> 01:53:47,152
- You got yourself into this mess!
- Indeed.

1103
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:51,112
- Huh.
- So don't go crazy over it.

1104
01:53:51,152 --> 01:53:52,862
Hm?

1105
01:53:53,442 --> 01:53:55,942
- I'm going.
- Stay, I'll go.

1106
01:54:01,362 --> 01:54:03,112
Love. Love.

1107
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:08,729
Shh.

1108
01:54:23,362 --> 01:54:24,692
She's right,

1109
01:54:27,942 --> 01:54:30,479
but it's not like talking will fix it.

1110
01:54:34,979 --> 01:54:36,192
How much do you need?

1111
01:54:39,979 --> 01:54:41,072
Too much.

1112
01:54:42,442 --> 01:54:43,770
Way too much.

1113
01:54:45,822 --> 01:54:46,822
I'll help you.

1114
01:54:47,572 --> 01:54:51,942
I don't have much money
but I can stay here to work. Huh?

1115
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:54,652
I've decided, let's do this.

1116
01:54:56,402 --> 01:54:58,612
You already have a lot to consider.

1117
01:54:59,322 --> 01:55:01,020
- Like what?
- Your girlfriend.

1118
01:55:01,072 --> 01:55:03,822
- Don't worry, I'm glad...
- No!

1119
01:55:33,942 --> 01:55:37,902
Even if sometimes I would have
liked to talk to him when we were apart,

1120
01:55:37,942 --> 01:55:40,229
Bruno and I felt very little,

1121
01:55:41,192 --> 01:55:44,192
as if our friendship
didn't need any help.

1122
01:55:49,729 --> 01:55:51,479
Namaste.

1123
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,402
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1124
01:55:54,572 --> 01:55:55,979
A computer?

1125
01:55:57,479 --> 01:55:58,479
uh!

1126
01:56:02,362 --> 01:56:03,362
Thank you.

1127
01:56:03,942 --> 01:56:07,152
It was my mother
gave us news of each other.

1128
01:56:07,192 --> 01:56:09,979
She was used to living
among silent men.

1129
01:56:24,692 --> 01:56:27,402
They took away my pasture,
you know that?

1130
01:56:28,192 --> 01:56:30,902
- Pietro? Pietro?
- Yes, yes!

1131
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:32,362
Bad news.

1132
01:56:34,902 --> 01:56:36,112
Yes.

1133
01:56:37,402 --> 01:56:38,822
How is Lara?

1134
01:56:40,152 --> 01:56:41,729
And Anita?

1135
01:56:41,770 --> 01:56:44,479
Anita is with Lara at her family,
they have a place there.

1136
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,572
They're fine.

1137
01:56:45,612 --> 01:56:50,020
Look, I wanted to ask you
if I can stay at the Barma.

1138
01:56:50,072 --> 01:56:53,072
Do you want to go up alone?

1139
01:56:53,112 --> 01:56:55,362
Yes, I don't want to see people.

1140
01:56:55,402 --> 01:56:56,520
It's winter.

1141
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,152
For now, I'm not sure where...

1142
01:57:03,362 --> 01:57:05,402
I want to stay in the mountains for a while.

1143
01:57:09,572 --> 01:57:11,770
And it's your house, you know.

1144
01:57:11,822 --> 01:57:12,822
Thank you.

1145
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,362
- Bruno?
- Yeah?

1146
01:57:19,572 --> 01:57:20,862
Do you want me to come there?

1147
01:57:23,442 --> 01:57:26,862
Eh, yes, that would be nice.

1148
01:57:30,229 --> 01:57:32,112
Then I'll be there as soon as possible.

1149
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:34,020
"Diaul porcu"!
Shithouse chainsaw!

1150
01:58:37,692 --> 01:58:38,692
Bruno.

1151
01:58:40,442 --> 01:58:41,442
Hey.

1152
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,822
- Hello, Berto.
- Hello.

1153
01:58:49,822 --> 01:58:51,192
Let me finish this.

1154
01:58:52,902 --> 01:58:54,112
Do you need help?

1155
01:59:10,152 --> 01:59:11,942
There's plenty to eat.

1156
01:59:24,072 --> 01:59:26,902
- These?
- For the snow.

1157
01:59:28,692 --> 01:59:30,020
Turn off the light.

1158
01:59:45,362 --> 01:59:46,362
Go.

1159
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:55,442
Okay, I'll prepare it.

1160
02:00:27,193 --> 02:00:29,903
Maybe tomorrow
we can go to the lake.

1161
02:02:44,483 --> 02:02:45,863
It was beautiful, huh?

1162
02:02:52,363 --> 02:02:53,733
It was beautiful, yes.

1163
02:02:56,943 --> 02:03:00,233
When I woke up early in the
morning to milk

1164
02:03:00,273 --> 02:03:01,773
and they slept,

1165
02:03:02,483 --> 02:03:05,613
it was my favourite time of day.

1166
02:03:06,323 --> 02:03:09,323
I was under the impression
everything was under control,

1167
02:03:11,073 --> 02:03:12,863
I was taking care of them.

1168
02:03:13,733 --> 02:03:14,943
Stupid, huh?

1169
02:03:17,023 --> 02:03:18,023
It's not stupid.

1170
02:03:18,073 --> 02:03:22,113
It's stupid because it's impossible
really, caring about someone else.

1171
02:03:30,273 --> 02:03:34,023
When are you going
to visit Anita? At Christmas?

1172
02:03:36,113 --> 02:03:37,443
No, not at Christmas.

1173
02:03:39,113 --> 02:03:40,153
Then when?

1174
02:03:41,363 --> 02:03:42,653
Maybe in the spring.

1175
02:03:46,483 --> 02:03:47,823
Maybe in the summer.

1176
02:03:55,233 --> 02:03:56,403
What's the difference?

1177
02:03:59,653 --> 02:04:01,653
It's all the better
if she stays with her mother.

1178
02:04:03,903 --> 02:04:06,653
- You are a good father, Bruno.
- Hmm.

1179
02:04:07,523 --> 02:04:09,363
What should I do, bring her here?

1180
02:04:11,113 --> 02:04:13,363
See, there's a world out there.

1181
02:04:14,363 --> 02:04:16,193
You invented this border yourself.

1182
02:04:16,233 --> 02:04:18,363
- Yes?
- Yes, in your head.

1183
02:04:19,773 --> 02:04:23,523
Find yourself a normal job,
at least for the winter.

1184
02:04:24,363 --> 02:04:27,233
Berto, do you remember whose son I am?

1185
02:04:27,273 --> 02:04:29,073
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1186
02:04:30,153 --> 02:04:32,273
Your father, the asshole.

1187
02:04:34,943 --> 02:04:36,403
And now what are you doing?

1188
02:04:39,023 --> 02:04:42,073
Abandoning your daughter,
like he did with you.

1189
02:04:55,193 --> 02:04:56,323
Go away.

1190
02:04:58,323 --> 02:04:59,323
What?

1191
02:05:00,323 --> 02:05:01,363
Go away.

1192
02:05:05,073 --> 02:05:06,153
Go away.

1193
02:05:09,733 --> 02:05:10,733
What are you doing?

1194
02:06:39,523 --> 02:06:42,573
On the Alpine reliefs
heavy snow is expected,

1195
02:06:42,613 --> 02:06:43,693
over 1000 meters.

1196
02:06:43,733 --> 02:06:45,483
Decreasing temperatures.

1197
02:06:53,193 --> 02:06:54,523
- Hi!
- Hey there.

1198
02:07:02,233 --> 02:07:03,693
She's already in kindergarten.

1199
02:07:05,193 --> 02:07:08,823
At first, I can't tell you what a struggle it was
to make them follow the rules!

1200
02:07:09,983 --> 02:07:11,823
But she's getting a little better now.

1201
02:07:19,693 --> 02:07:21,193
I would like to help him.

1202
02:07:27,943 --> 02:07:30,733
You can't help someone who does
not want to be helped.

1203
02:07:35,023 --> 02:07:39,153
We could have found other solutions,
you know, other jobs.

1204
02:07:41,613 --> 02:07:44,573
They were looking for people here
at the chair lift.  Nothing.

1205
02:07:45,483 --> 02:07:48,023
For Bruno there is no other possible life.

1206
02:07:51,483 --> 02:07:56,073
At some point, I realized that Anita and I
we were much less important

1207
02:07:56,113 --> 02:07:57,443
than his mountain,

1208
02:07:58,693 --> 02:08:00,443
whatever that means.

1209
02:08:04,823 --> 02:08:08,613
Sometimes love wears out slowly,
other times it dies suddenly.

1210
02:08:13,733 --> 02:08:14,733
No?

1211
02:08:18,863 --> 02:08:19,943
You're asking me?

1212
02:08:26,273 --> 02:08:27,733
How is it in Nepal?

1213
02:08:29,863 --> 02:08:31,023
Good, right?

1214
02:08:32,863 --> 02:08:35,863
I went too far,
I should have stayed here.

1215
02:08:37,113 --> 02:08:38,113
No.

1216
02:09:24,363 --> 02:09:25,653
Berto!

1217
02:09:28,113 --> 02:09:29,193
Heh!

1218
02:09:40,863 --> 02:09:42,443
Berto!

1219
02:09:43,443 --> 02:09:44,443
Hey!

1220
02:09:50,773 --> 02:09:51,773
Ah!

1221
02:09:51,823 --> 02:09:53,773
Shit... Hey!

1222
02:09:56,023 --> 02:09:57,113
Hey.

1223
02:09:57,153 --> 02:09:59,193
Oh!

1224
02:10:00,113 --> 02:10:01,193
What the fuck are you doing?

1225
02:10:03,443 --> 02:10:04,773
Are you okay?

1226
02:10:10,233 --> 02:10:13,273
Not bad, huh?
I've been training for a week.

1227
02:10:14,443 --> 02:10:16,823
You're an idiot. Yes.

1228
02:10:33,773 --> 02:10:34,773
Wow.

1229
02:10:54,823 --> 02:10:56,823
Ah... Fuck you.

1230
02:10:59,443 --> 02:11:01,193
- It doesn't fit anymore.
- Here.

1231
02:11:03,443 --> 02:11:06,113
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles!

1232
02:11:26,363 --> 02:11:28,323
I'm sorry about last time.

1233
02:11:30,483 --> 02:11:31,483
Me too.

1234
02:11:33,023 --> 02:11:34,983
I'm glad you're back.

1235
02:11:43,863 --> 02:11:45,403
We're still friends, aren't we?

1236
02:11:47,863 --> 02:11:49,443
Fuck you.

1237
02:11:54,943 --> 02:11:56,363
I was angry.

1238
02:11:58,863 --> 02:12:02,483
I was angry, because it's no-one's fault,
but mine.

1239
02:12:04,773 --> 02:12:07,363
What did I want to be,
the entrepreneur?

1240
02:12:07,403 --> 02:12:10,983
I had to build myself a cabin like this
and bring up two cows.

1241
02:12:14,613 --> 02:12:16,693
This was supposed to be my life.

1242
02:12:17,773 --> 02:12:19,653
I don't know anything about money.

1243
02:12:21,983 --> 02:12:26,153
At some point in life, one has to
stop and ask oneself questions, right?

1244
02:12:26,193 --> 02:12:29,233
Say to yourself, "Well, this I can do,
This no."

1245
02:12:30,073 --> 02:12:32,653
I am capable
of living alone in the mountains.

1246
02:12:34,023 --> 02:12:36,653
- It's no small thing, is it?
- It's not, no.

1247
02:13:19,983 --> 02:13:23,443
Berto, don't worry about me.

1248
02:13:27,363 --> 02:13:29,693
This mountain has never hurt me.

1249
02:16:21,023 --> 02:16:23,983
- They called me from Grana.
- Yes?

1250
02:16:25,023 --> 02:16:26,903
It snowed a lot.

1251
02:16:27,863 --> 02:16:29,863
Bruno's cousins were worried.

1252
02:16:29,903 --> 02:16:34,772
They called for help and
a team went up with a helicopter.

1253
02:16:35,823 --> 02:16:39,191
At that point, they expected
to find him in his bed.

1254
02:16:39,233 --> 02:16:42,653
Maybe with an illness, right?
You know, the cold...

1255
02:16:43,653 --> 02:16:45,272
But he wasn't there.

1256
02:16:47,153 --> 02:16:51,272
They also scoured the surrounding area
with dogs, but they found nothing.

1257
02:16:51,323 --> 02:16:53,653
Imagine, with all that snow...

1258
02:16:55,153 --> 02:17:00,983
In short, they have decided
that it makes no sense to keep looking.

1259
02:17:04,653 --> 02:17:05,653
Okay.

1260
02:17:09,272 --> 02:17:12,403
They say they'll find him
when the snow melts.

1261
02:17:17,323 --> 02:17:21,111
In your opinion, was that what he wanted?

1262
02:17:22,573 --> 02:17:23,573
No.

1263
02:17:24,573 --> 02:17:25,573
No.

1264
02:17:42,691 --> 02:17:46,022
I said no, but I was lying.

1265
02:17:49,022 --> 02:17:52,611
I wondered who had known him
besides me on Earth,

1266
02:17:52,653 --> 02:17:54,861
and who had known me besides Bruno.

1267
02:18:03,823 --> 02:18:06,653
If it was only ours
what we had shared,

1268
02:18:08,653 --> 02:18:12,022
what was left of it
now that one of us was gone?

1269
02:19:17,861 --> 02:19:21,233
Then it occurred to me,
that there was a house up in the mountains

1270
02:19:21,272 --> 02:19:22,733
with a hole in the roof.

1271
02:19:23,983 --> 02:19:26,522
That wouldn't give her long to live

1272
02:19:26,573 --> 02:19:29,073
and I felt she was no longer of any use,

1273
02:19:34,233 --> 02:19:38,073
because in some lives there are mountains
to which it is not possible to return.

1274
02:19:48,903 --> 02:19:51,611
- Come on, let's go!
- Okay, okay!

1275
02:19:52,522 --> 02:19:56,772
One cannot go back to the mountain
which is at the centre of all the others,

1276
02:19:56,824 --> 02:19:59,324
as well as at the beginning of its own history.

1277
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:00,361
Go!

1278
02:20:01,361 --> 02:20:04,611
All that remains is to wander
the eight mountains,

1279
02:20:04,654 --> 02:20:06,191
for someone like me,

1280
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:11,574
on the first and highest,
I lost a friend.
