1
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,107
<i>I open my eyes and I see nothing.</i>

2
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,614
<i>I only remember there was some accident.</i>

3
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,701
<i>Everyone ran for safety
as best they could.</i>

4
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,162
<i>As best they could.</i>

5
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:06,293
<i>As for what happened to me,
I just can't remember.</i>

6
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,888
<i>How strange. Where am I?</i>

7
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,351
<i>Judging by the clothes,
this must be the 1800s.</i>

8
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,812
<i>Where are they rushing off to?</i>

9
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,739
What if we are denied entry?

10
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,242
I've never been so frightened.

11
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,539
Remember, the girl in white is mine.

12
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,083
Where are you going?

13
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,851
It's cold! Close the doors.

14
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,715
Quickly! Quickly!

15
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,092
Keep moving.

16
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:56,445
<i>Those officers don't know the way.</i>

17
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,081
<i>Can it be that I'm invisible?</i>

18
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>Or do they just not notice me?</i>

19
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,659
<i>Interesting.</i>

20
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,705
<i>Has all this been staged for me?</i>

21
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,042
<i>Am I expected to play a role?</i>

22
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,302
<i>What kind of play is this?</i>

23
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,098
<i>Let's hope it's not a tragedy.</i>

24
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,575
Which way do we go?

25
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,334
Which way do we go?
Maybe this way.

26
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,462
No. We'll go this way.

27
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:41,842
<i>That man in black,
he's wandering about too.</i>

28
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,011
<i>He nods to me, but goes away.</i>

29
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:50,351
Pardon me for speaking before
we've been properly introduced.

30
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,269
What city is this?

31
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,690
<i>What city is this?
Well, everyone speaks Russian.</i>

32
00:05:56,774 --> 00:06:00,110
I so hoped this was Chambord
during the Directory.

33
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,032
- What language are we speaking?
- <i>Russian.</i>

34
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,950
Russian?

35
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,371
How strange. I never knew Russian before.

36
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,375
<i>What are they doing in there?</i>

37
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,130
- <i>Shall we go in?</i>
- Where, in there?

38
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,465
<i>Something is going on.</i>

39
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,093
What on earth am I doing here?

40
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,595
I suddenly speak Russian.

41
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,057
I want to leave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.

42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,559
<i>Could all this be theater?</i>

43
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,437
No, no. Farewell.

44
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,399
No. Our paths must part.

45
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:42,111
Farewell. You have answered all my questions.

46
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,447
- <i>Farewell then.</i>
- Where does this door lead to?

47
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,659
<i>What a pity.</i>

48
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,454
<i>We may never meet again.</i>

49
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,004
<i>He was obviously a foreigner.</i>

50
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,260
<i>When will an opportunity like that
come again?</i>

51
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,674
<i>It's best not to get involved in this.</i>

52
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,054
<i>Let's not disturb them.</i>

53
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:58,812
<i>In any case, it's much too late.</i>

54
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:11,074
<i>Sir. Sir, I'm here.</i>

55
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,501
My Russian cicerone. Do you know the way?

56
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,212
- <i>Yes, let's go together.</i>
- This is your country.

57
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,758
<i>Yes, but not my century.
How did I come to be here?</i>

58
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,676
<i>I think I saw Peter the Great.</i>

59
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,597
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?

60
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,309
<i>Yes, very interesting.</i>

61
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,686
<i>Really.</i>

62
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,563
In Asia, tyrants are adored.

63
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,692
The more terrible the tyrant,
the more his memory is cherished.

64
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,863
Alexander the Great, Timur
and your Peter the Great.

65
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,032
<i>You're wrong about Peter.</i>

66
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,078
<i>He taught Russians to enjoy themselves.</i>

67
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,082
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?

68
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,295
I see. But why?

69
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,549
What's so interesting up there?

70
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,218
<i>You'll see.</i>

71
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,806
Peter, the man who ordered
his own son's execution.

72
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,435
The same man who taught the people
to enjoy life. How funny.

73
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,105
<i>I thought you knew where we were going.</i>

74
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,817
He built a European city upon a swamp.

75
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,612
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.

76
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,156
- Where are they going?
- <i>But the city is still European.</i>

77
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,617
To a party. But why by the back staircase?

78
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,246
<i>They were taught to have fun.
So they go to parties.</i>

79
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,415
And the officer and the lady?

80
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,334
- <i>At the party.</i>
- Where are they?

81
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,838
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!

82
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,049
And they are no more.

83
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,306
Be careful.
The stairs are steep, and it's dark.

84
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,349
<i>Thank you. I can see.</i>

85
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,524
Do you know where we are?

86
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,403
<i>No, I don't know yet.</i>

87
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,614
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

88
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,308
<i>Sir, be careful.</i>

89
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,727
<i>Don't betray our presence.</i>

90
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,688
There's no need to remind me.

91
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,401
Don't forget it was me
who brought you here.

92
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,528
<i>Please don't be offended.</i>

93
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,657
And you, don't get too close
to the actors.

94
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,075
Bend down.

95
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,412
You're beautiful.

96
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,983
- Stop pushing.
- Don't scratch me.

97
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,244
- Why is she pushing me?
- You're pushing too.

98
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,289
What an impressive orchestra.

99
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,376
They must be Europeans.

100
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,878
<i>No, they're Russian musicians.</i>

101
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,630
No, Europeans.

102
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,924
Italians.

103
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,136
<i>They're Russians, for God's sake.</i>

104
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,581
Well?

105
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,710
I say it's good.

106
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,797
Very good!

107
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,426
I need to pee!

108
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,894
I can't hold it in anymore.

109
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,979
No, no.

110
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,898
No. What? What?

111
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,735
Yes. Yes.

112
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,033
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

113
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,618
Don't shout.

114
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:33,123
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Here. My God, it's Catherine the Great.

115
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,875
Follow me.

116
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,885
I love the 18th century-
a time of genius and manners.

117
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,721
<i>I would have to agree with you.</i>

118
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,641
- Never contradict me.
- <i>Very well.</i>

119
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,228
Where's the czarina? Gone.

120
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:59,107
Russia is like a theater. A theater.

121
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,901
<i>Careful.</i>

122
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,987
I think I know where we are.

123
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:10,076
These petty officials.
How pretentious they are.

124
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,329
Don't lag behind, sir.

125
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,416
<i>I'm not lagging.
I think we're speaking too loudly.</i>

126
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,044
No matter. They're completely deaf.

127
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,799
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.

128
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,635
It's all theater.

129
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:31,264
What actors. And what costumes.

130
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,440
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.

131
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,568
They don't see me.
They don't see me.

132
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,619
Just like the Vatican.

133
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,372
Truly. It's like we're in the Vatican.

134
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,295
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?

135
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,798
What naturalism.

136
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,216
Look at them.

137
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,220
Weren't those decorations inspired
by sketches of Raphael?

138
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,972
<i>Raphael, yes.</i>

139
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,477
<i>Better than the Vatican.
This is St. Petersburg.</i>

140
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,354
So they're copies?

141
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,066
Your authorities don't have faith
in your own artists.

142
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,029
Russians are so talented at copying.

143
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,156
And why?

144
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,993
Because you don't have ideas of your own.

145
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:38,415
Your authorities don't want you
to have them.

146
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,335
In fact, they are as lazy
as all the rest of you.

147
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,005
Just lazy.

148
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,381
<i>Lazy.</i>

149
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,427
There was a gallery there for paintings.

150
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,181
- <i>On the upper floor.</i>
- 111 paintings- Italian masters.

151
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,476
- True, not the best masters.
- <i>Not the best.</i>

152
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,231
<i>The czars were mainly Russophiles.</i>

153
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,196
<i>But they dreamed of Italy.</i>

154
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,074
<i>Wasn't the Hermitage created
to satisfy those dreams?</i>

155
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,079
- Raphael isn't for you.
- <i>Not for us.</i>

156
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,789
For Italy.

157
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,499
It's warm there.

158
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,668
<i>It's warm there.</i>

159
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
What beauty.

160
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,393
The small Italian gallery.

161
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,229
<i>The small Italian gallery.</i>

162
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,779
Who are these people?

163
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,575
From which era are they from?

164
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,243
<i>Do you see that vase?</i>

165
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,580
I see. I see.
Empire style is everywhere.

166
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,415
<i>And those Voronikhin lamps.</i>

167
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,918
<i>Lamps, lamps, lamps.</i>

168
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,296
Empire. Empire. Empire.

169
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,633
I have no enthusiasm for Empire style.

170
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,635
That style is too silly.

171
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:20,683
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.

172
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,435
Then it became fashionable here

173
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,272
to the point of becoming
the national style

174
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,942
to the detriment of its originality.

175
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,236
<i>We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style.</i>

176
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,615
Who are they? Who are these people?

177
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>The people of St. Petersburg,
after the city ceased being the capital.</i>

178
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,704
It's better that way.

179
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,792
A capital city should be an ancient city,
not chimerical.

180
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,295
Like Moscow. Who are these people?

181
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,131
<i>Should I introduce you?</i>

182
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,300
- Only if it's not impolite.
- <i>No, they are friends.</i>

183
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,677
Then let's.

184
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,847
<i>This is Oleg Konstantinovich,
professor of medicine.</i>

185
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,598
<i>Lev Mikhailovich, actor.</i>

186
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,976
Shouldn't they rise?

187
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,396
<i>This is my European friend.
He is visiting Russia.</i>

188
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,857
- My pleasure.
- <i>He's European.</i>

189
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,322
Medicine is a fine profession.

190
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,868
I haven't spoken to anyone for a long time

191
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,704
aside from my new companion.

192
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,707
Such a long time. What is that odor?

193
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,417
<i>What odor?</i>

194
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,335
A curious odor.

195
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,091
- Have you been in St. Petersburg long?
- For an hour.

196
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,177
And you came straight here?

197
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,431
- I had my reasons.
- You must love art.

198
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,685
Are you interested in beauty
or just its representation?

199
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,522
- No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
- <i>"Marquis"?</i>

200
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,066
- This is how you rest?
- Just so.

201
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,612
Today, Oleg Konstantinovich
and I have come here-

202
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,363
It smells of formaldehyde.

203
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,282
<i>Yes, formaldehyde.</i>

204
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,202
Marquis, I'll show you a splendid painting.

205
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,622
These men are emitting a very strange odor.

206
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,501
Marquis, this is the
<i>Birth of John the Baptist.</i>

207
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,134
The marquis smells of formaldehyde.

208
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,555
I know this painting.
I saw it on my last visit here.

209
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,558
It comes from Paris,
from the Crozat collection.

210
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:30,521
Catherine acquired it in 1772.

211
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,067
One of the earliest pieces
of the Hermitage collection.

212
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,404
Such information, that's for specialists.

213
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,616
For us, the details are more interesting.

214
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,743
Look closely here.

215
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,830
See in the foreground?
A chicken and a cat.

216
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,626
They are symbolic figures.

217
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,837
The chicken represents greed, avarice.

218
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,591
The cat- cynicism and cruelty.

219
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,844
<i>Cynicism and cruelty. The cat.</i>

220
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,097
They are both calmed by the birth of John.

221
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,890
How interesting.

222
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,519
Very, very interesting.

223
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,854
Why is he dressed like that?

224
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,776
For example, the Cleopatra-
what do you know about it?

225
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,611
Massimo Stanzione.

226
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,491
The Cleopatra is on the same wall

227
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,036
as the <i>Circumcision of Christ</i>
by the pious Ludovico Cardi.

228
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,623
- What bothers you?
- What bothers me?

229
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:35,795
Right next to <i>Saint Cecilia?</i>
Can you imagine!

230
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,964
By Carlo Dolci.

231
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,050
And next to an <i>Eastern Still Life!</i>

232
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,554
- Why does that bother you?
- Don't argue, Oleg.

233
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,142
As a Catholic, that shocks me.

234
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,477
What do you think of Wagner?

235
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,730
Wagner? Who is Wagner?

236
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,190
Oleg, he doesn't know Wagner.

237
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:03,281
Wagner is that child who behaved badly
with my best friend, Meyerbeer.

238
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,577
I have never listened to Wagner.

239
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,497
- Broaden your horizons.
- That doctor is so insistent.

240
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:16,002
- But I'm not sick.
- We wish you much success.

241
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,838
Sir, why are they badly dressed?

242
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:24,260
<i>My friends, how could I think
that you would get along?</i>

243
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:28,848
<i>One day, I'll explain everything.
I'm in a strange situation.</i>

244
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,685
<i>Sir. Sir, why quarrel with everyone?</i>

245
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,939
<i>If you do, we will never discover
why we are here.</i>

246
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,567
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence.

247
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:46,074
Why do you find it necessary
to adopt European culture?

248
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,117
For what reason?

249
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:52,872
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?

250
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,752
My God. What is all this?

251
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,546
What is it?

252
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,717
Mother!

253
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,803
Mother.

254
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,728
Canova!

255
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,816
What a sublime approach to art!

256
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,859
What feeling for the material!

257
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,238
How wonderful!

258
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,281
How wonderful. My God.

259
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,576
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity.

260
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,747
Canova almost married my mother.

261
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,583
<i>Was your mother a sculptress?</i>

262
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,002
Yes, a sculptress. In Rome.

263
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,923
<i>In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress.</i>

264
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:49,429
In this Canova collection,
there are even sculptures

265
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,682
that Czar Alexander bought from the wife-

266
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,350
<i>The wife of Napoleon?</i>

267
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:58,604
Yes. It was 1815,
I was at the Congress of Vienna.

268
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,314
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

269
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,110
- I was a diplomat.
- <i>You were a diplomat?</i>

270
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,363
This collection was the object
of a serious dispute.

271
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,534
Look where we are now.

272
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,788
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

273
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,666
I don't know. I don't know.

274
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,171
I don't know about you,
but I'm wide awake.

275
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,677
It's amazing how well I speak Russian.

276
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,474
<i>Yes, quite well.</i>

277
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,810
Who was that small man?

278
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,729
Was that Pushkin?

279
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,691
- Good day.
- Good day.

280
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,820
Is that your great poet?
Your beloved one?

281
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,699
I read him in French. Nothing special.

282
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,326
<i>Sir.</i>

283
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,412
My God, how touchy you are.

284
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,707
Forgive me, please.

285
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,712
I'm sorry if I've offended
your nationalist sympathies.

286
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:08,758
"Nationalist sympathies." What is that?

287
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,515
What's that there?

288
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,851
- <i>Sir. Please.</i>
- Who is that?

289
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,520
<i>Please don't be rash.</i>

290
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,022
All alone, without a chaperone?

291
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,692
<i>It would be wiser not to talk to that lady.</i>

292
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,947
<i>Don't bother her.</i>

293
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,534
<i>Let's move along.</i>

294
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,716
Excuse me, madam.
Have you lost your guide?

295
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,554
Thank you for asking,
but I know this place well.

296
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,058
Of course. Do you work here?

297
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,730
Not at all. I'm here to admire
the works of the old masters.

298
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:12,822
Would you accompany me
into the next salon?

299
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,616
To see the Flemish masters?

300
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,666
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.

301
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,795
- 140 paces, straight ahead.
- 140 paces. Is that so?

302
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,633
How many are left?

303
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,389
Watch your step.

304
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,273
This way.

305
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,324
How dare you! Quiet!

306
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,175
- We're here.
- Yes, We're here.

307
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,971
Can we go closer to that painting?

308
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,766
Would you like me to tell you about it?

309
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,854
<i>Virgin with Partridges</i> by Van Dyck.

310
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,691
Catherine II acquired it.

311
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,236
Would you like to tell me
about this painting?

312
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,322
Please, tell me.

313
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,534
See the calm and serenity
around the Madonna and Joseph.

314
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:44,372
- Joseph, yes.
- God protects them.

315
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:48,834
There is no doubt about His unseen presence.

316
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,505
The apple tree represents life.
Sunflowers stand for piety.

317
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,509
On the upper right,
partridges symbolize frivolity.

318
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,844
- They're flying away.
- Partridges.

319
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,389
Angels dance and play.

320
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,183
So many other symbols
that we can only guess about.

321
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:08,354
<i>Sir, leave her be. She's an angel.</i>

322
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,746
Why have you gone quiet?

323
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,127
The partridges, the children, the Madonna.

324
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,465
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

325
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,846
I highly value your opinion
on the works of Van Dyck.

326
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,726
You'll definitely be interested
in another painting.

327
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,561
<i>Be very careful.</i>

328
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,271
A Rubens.

329
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,651
Sir, do not disturb me.

330
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,782
<i>Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.</i>

331
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,954
- Seventeen.
- I don't see it.

332
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,916
- Eighteen.
- Where is it?

333
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,719
The painting isn't here.

334
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,310
No, that painting isn't here.

335
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,695
It wasn't in the czar's collection.

336
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,575
Yes, it's here.

337
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,121
That particular Rubens is not here.

338
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:52,500
Yes. It was from Lord Walpole's collection.

339
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,543
Like the <i>Virgin with Partridges.</i>

340
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,545
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.

341
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,840
But it's here.

342
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:14,355
- Where are you?
- What a wonderful scent.

343
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,357
The scent of oils.

344
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,318
<i>Sir.</i>

345
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,988
<i>Sir, let's leave here now.
Let's leave.</i>

346
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,449
- Where are you?
- No, let's stay a while.

347
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,498
What wonderful paintings.

348
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,127
What are those men counting?

349
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:42,591
You were right. I found it.

350
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,681
Let's take a closer look.
There it is.

351
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,687
We're almost there.

352
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,565
Face the painting directly.

353
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,317
There it is. There's the painting.

354
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,449
Yes, there it is.

355
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,202
Something to say about Rubens?

356
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,745
Van Dyck.

357
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,332
Rubens considered Van Dyck
to be his best pupil.

358
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,462
You know, there was a time
when all these paintings

359
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,631
were placed much higher
and much closer to one another.

360
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,552
The czar himself supervised
how they were hung.

361
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,139
Who are you?

362
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,099
I'm a sailor.

363
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,144
- What are those insignias?
- Navy.

364
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,606
The czar visited his collection every morning.

365
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:44,194
He himself saved all this during the fire.

366
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:48,115
- Which fire?
- The fire was in 1800-

367
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,786
Are you asking me?

368
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,414
Enough, let's go.

369
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,837
It's time for me to go.

370
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,255
May I accompany you?

371
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,798
No. No.

372
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,676
What a pity.

373
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,680
I must ask you to leave.

374
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,641
The museum is closing.

375
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,852
Please see yourself to the exit.

376
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,816
Quiet. Close the doors.

377
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,154
The museum is closing.

378
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:44,523
- How was my scene?
- <i>I wasn't impressed.</i>

379
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,277
I was joking.

380
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,698
<i>Joking.</i>

381
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,303
- <i>Do you hear music?</i>
- I hear something.

382
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:30,069
Russian music makes me break out in hives.

383
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,655
<i>That has nothing to do with the music.</i>

384
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,435
<i>Why do you look at me like that?</i>

385
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,621
Rags. A dog.

386
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,542
Eternal people.

387
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,714
So, live on. Live on.

388
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,260
- You'll outlive them all.
- <i>Eternal people.</i>

389
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,937
What are you doing?

390
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,940
Eavesdropping?

391
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,197
Are you interested in painting?

392
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,828
What nice small hands.

393
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,542
Stay away from me.

394
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,037
Amen. Amen.

395
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,707
Beautiful, isn't it?

396
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,460
Beautiful. Beautiful.

397
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,422
- Are you Catholic?
- No, I'm not Catholic.

398
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,967
Why do you ask?

399
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,764
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought

400
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:08,227
while admiring these images
of the founders of our Church.

401
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,479
I don't know.

402
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,564
I wasn't thinking about that.

403
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,984
You weren't thinking.

404
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:21,865
Do you know that those are
the apostles Peter and Paul?

405
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,577
Yes, that's what someone said.

406
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,205
That's what they said?

407
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,250
And so?

408
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:40,425
I was looking at them
because it gives me joy.

409
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,177
Gives you joy-

410
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:47,349
One day, all men will become like them.

411
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,892
Really?

412
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:57,734
How can you know what will become of people

413
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:04,157
if you don't know the Scriptures?

414
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,755
Why aren't you saying anything?

415
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,725
Look at their hands.

416
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,108
The hands are beautiful. So?

417
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,660
How can you know what will become of people

418
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,662
if you don't know the Scriptures?

419
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:55,375
As for you, they're just two dusty old men.

420
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,504
Just flesh.

421
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,341
They're covered with the dust of the road

422
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,343
as they appear in the painting.

423
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,598
- <i>What happened?</i>
- They are good and wise.

424
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,851
How could you know what they're like

425
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,020
if you have not read the Gospels?

426
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,356
How could you know all that?

427
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:21,693
<i>Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid.</i>

428
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,737
He's not afraid.

429
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,531
- These people are never afraid.
- <i>Leave him be.</i>

430
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:29,368
<i>Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings.</i>

431
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,163
<i>It smells good.</i>

432
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,384
Only you're not afraid of anything.

433
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:51,139
So strange to hear those words.

434
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,768
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.

435
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,312
Yes, yes, yes.

436
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,732
I understand.

437
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,236
We're in the czar's gallery

438
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,322
near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.

439
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,992
Where have we wandered to?

440
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,124
That music was good, after all.

441
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,793
- Who was the composer?
- <i>Glinka.</i>

442
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,795
Glinka? A German.

443
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,338
<i>A Russian.</i>

444
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,842
A German. All composers are German.

445
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,302
<i>All composers are German.</i>

446
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,485
El Greco.

447
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,706
Very nice.

448
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,876
Looks like a Rembrandt.

449
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,131
El Greco. Dust from the road.

450
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,593
What dust from the road?

451
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,643
Nice, very nice.

452
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,021
- <i>Something you don't like?</i>
- Not at all.

453
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,981
It's nice, very nice.

454
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,983
<i>Nice, very nice.</i>

455
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,487
More flesh. Very nice.

456
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,827
These are nice paintings.

457
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,330
<i>Nice paintings.</i>

458
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,291
They're getting better and better.

459
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,679
<i>There's an angel.</i>

460
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:35,136
Pardon me for addressing you
without an introduction.

461
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,597
- To whom was that directed?
- What?

462
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,308
- To whom was that directed?
- What?

463
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,935
Do tell.

464
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,897
- I'm speaking to the painting.
- Speaking to-

465
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,733
Yes. How interesting.

466
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:52,904
- I must express myself.
- Do continue.

467
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,865
That's how to communicate with it.

468
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,243
Would you like to try?

469
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:02,914
I should try? Very well.

470
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,129
- Like that.
- Like this?

471
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,841
Now like this.

472
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,761
Now a turn.

473
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,392
And like this.

474
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:29,190
Sometimes I prefer to speak alone.

475
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:37,949
This painting and I, we have a secret.

476
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,954
Really?

477
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,664
- Yes.
- Now it's over.

478
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,794
That's all, gentlemen.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

479
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,382
Where are you going, madam?

480
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,555
She's offended. She has left.

481
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,391
She's left.

482
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,196
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

483
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,240
Good-bye. Good-bye.

484
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,040
Farewell, gentleman.

485
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,000
How charming!

486
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:34,673
She's offended. But so charming.

487
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,891
Where has she gone?

488
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,856
Marble.

489
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,109
White, white...

490
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,071
stone.

491
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,908
It's cold, isn't it?

492
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,829
<i>When you first came here,
it must have been a disaster.</i>

493
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,832
<i>That was just after the fire.</i>

494
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,252
I have been here before,
but it's as if I have not.

495
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,254
What luxury.

496
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,926
What is that?

497
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,347
It was under the Convention
that everything was devastated.

498
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,101
<i>You don't know 20th-century Russian history.</i>

499
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,521
<i>Our Convention lasted 80 years.</i>

500
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,149
<i>A real revolution. Very sad.</i>

501
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:45,697
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?

502
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,657
<i>I don't know.</i>

503
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,911
I have never believed
that a republic was suitable

504
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,747
for a country as large as Russia.

505
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:58,209
<i>You Europeans are democrats
who mourn the monarchy.</i>

506
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,794
You are French, is that it?

507
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,171
- Stop. Who are you?
- And who are you?

508
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,968
Excuse us. We're lost.

509
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,470
- Please be on your way.
- Spare us! Spare us!

510
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:13,391
- You are forbidden here.
- Help us, please.

511
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,477
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?

512
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,898
What language. Everything is forbidden.

513
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,400
<i>It's better not to argue. Let's leave.</i>

514
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,069
We're going, We're going.

515
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,283
<i>I know where we can hide.</i>

516
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,995
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't like military uniforms.

517
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:42,253
- <i>Don't rush.</i>
- There's a door ahead.

518
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,173
<i>Not that door, sir.</i>

519
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:49,802
But I like it. Such a beautiful door.

520
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:52,055
<i>No, not that one.</i>

521
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,852
I have never been here.

522
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,688
Why is it so cold?

523
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:03,775
<i>I told you not to enter.</i>

524
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,318
What cold!

525
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,236
Frames. But where are-

526
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,617
Where are the canvases?

527
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:17,288
<i>Let's go back, I beg you.</i>

528
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,333
- Who's there?
- It's me.

529
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,252
- What's happening?
- Nothing. I simply entered.

530
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,466
- Come closer.
- I'm coming.

531
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:33,304
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Maybe I can help.

532
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,847
What?

533
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:37,475
Who is the "kind sir"?

534
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,602
Me. You.

535
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,648
Not here, not there.

536
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,358
There is no one.

537
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,735
Only coffins and corpses.

538
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,029
Only coffins and corpses.
Come and see.

539
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,825
- I'm coming.
- That's my coffin.

540
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,869
- Your coffin?
- Yes, I made it myself.

541
00:49:56,953 --> 00:50:01,165
Why that strange tone, kind sir?

542
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,918
Why are there coffins in the Hermitage?

543
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,670
Kind sir.

544
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,382
- It's my coffin.
- Your coffin?

545
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:13,386
- It's my coffin.
- Yours. All right.

546
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,431
- He looks well-fed.
- But where are the corpses?

547
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,392
Why do you ask where?
Don't step on the corpses.

548
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,603
He looks well-fed.
You stepped on the corpses!

549
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:25,231
- What happened?
- <i>A war.</i>

550
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,442
- What?
- <i>A war.</i>

551
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,361
Which war? Against whom?

552
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:33,656
- <i>Against Germany.</i>
- Germany? What is this "Germany"?

553
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,827
<i>The unified German state.</i>

554
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:42,040
<i>In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany.</i>

555
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:47,336
<i>The German army surrounded the city,
but the city did not surrender.</i>

556
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,214
<i>More than one million people died.</i>

557
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:53,718
- What? More than one million?
- <i>More than one million.</i>

558
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,220
That's a high price to pay.

559
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,932
Very high.

560
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,269
St. Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.

561
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,980
<i>In Russia, it is said
that freedom knows no price.</i>

562
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:08,566
- A very high price.
- <i>Certainly high.</i>

563
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,818
But maybe not so high.

564
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:14,280
- <i>But it's already been paid.</i>
- All the same, I was wrong.

565
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,908
I was wrong

566
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,911
when I criticized your czars

567
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:24,582
for all this beauty and opulence.

568
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:30,296
Even if they all were... tyrants.

569
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,673
<i>Please. Not so loud.</i>

570
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,389
But it is beautiful, isn't it?

571
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:45,561
What do you see? Who is it?

572
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:52,485
<i>I'm not sure. Maybe Catherine.</i>

573
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,031
<i>Nothing could be less sure.</i>

574
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,577
That's enough. Lisa, bring the children.

575
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,331
Don't go too near her.

576
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:09,460
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense.

577
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,802
Like this.

578
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,305
Lower. Lower.

579
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,433
That will be all.

580
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,731
The candles. The candles.

581
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,401
It's stuffy in here.

582
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,446
- There?
- Over here.

583
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,907
Over here.

584
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:45,663
No, benefactress, not there.
It's much too cold.

585
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,714
Just so. Just so.

586
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,718
But it's cold.

587
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,582
Sir!

588
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,710
Where are you?

589
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,422
I hear your footsteps.
Where are you?

590
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,059
Mortals should not chase after royalty.

591
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,482
Careful not to catch up with her.

592
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,351
I hear your footsteps.

593
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,311
I hear them.

594
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:40,611
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold.

595
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,823
- Come this way.
- <i>Yes, it's cold.</i>

596
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,449
Come on, let's go.

597
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,785
- <i>She disappeared.</i>
- I know.

598
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,621
- <i>She disappeared again.</i>
- Move aside.

599
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:54,458
- <i>Do you know where to go?</i>
- Help us.

600
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:57,169
- Come on, let's go.
- <i>Isn't he letting us in?</i>

601
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,297
Let us through. We are allowed.

602
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,718
Where is the door? Where is it?

603
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:06,971
Greetings.

604
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,933
Don't be shy. Come.
We won't stay long.

605
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,561
Where are you taking me?

606
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,189
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.

607
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,693
<i>What beautiful hair you have.
Those curls!</i>

608
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,862
Thank you.

609
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,990
They're offering us tea.
Will you have tea?

610
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,038
I don't want any, but they insist.
Where is the tea?

611
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,373
We're in a hurry. Where is it?

612
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,835
- I know I'm beautiful.
- Too beautiful.

613
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,630
What do you want me to say?
What can I say?

614
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,345
No, no! I can't explain.

615
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:50,222
I have nothing to say.
What is this?

616
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:55,061
- Did you write this book?
- Not me. He did.

617
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:59,648
Neither he nor I.
But he will dedicate it.

618
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,735
Follow me.

619
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,240
<i>Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?</i>

620
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:11,452
What do I see?
Nothing for the moment.

621
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,538
Some people are obviously waiting for something.

622
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,041
Let's proceed with caution.

623
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:22,213
- These madmen could eat us.
- <i>They liked your hair.</i>

624
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:26,634
Of course. I'm a writer.
Good writers always have beautiful hair.

625
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,430
- Be more careful and quiet now.
- <i>I'm following you.</i>

626
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:36,435
- Close the doors quickly.
- <i>The doors are closed.</i>

627
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:44,235
When I was last received here
at the Winter Palace,

628
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,948
it was being renovated
after the terrible fire.

629
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,411
The parquet doesn't creak.

630
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:08,092
- The ambassador of Persia!
- Excuse us for being late.

631
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,136
Let's go, let's go.

632
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,934
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah.

633
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,644
Excuse us. Excuse us.

634
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,521
Excuse us. Excuse us.

635
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:24,358
Prince Khozrow Mirza,

636
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,278
son of the future shah,
with his entourage.

637
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,823
- Do you know what is happening?
- <i>No.</i>

638
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:38,289
We're watching Nicholas I

639
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,168
as he receives an apology
from the Persian emissaries

640
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,880
regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.

641
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,631
Griboedov was one, I think.

642
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,216
Excuse us.

643
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,302
How interesting.

644
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,972
Are you able to see?

645
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,141
What uniforms.

646
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,479
Luxury. Empire.

647
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,607
Power.

648
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,860
Look over there. Up ahead.

649
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,029
Get up on your tiptoes.

650
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,907
Can you see?

651
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:16,827
<i>Yes, I see now.</i>

652
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:20,831
One must not trust this world.
You are right.

653
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,218
Beware.

654
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,554
Court officials are cunning.

655
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:38,349
Some of them are mediums.

656
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,185
They can sense your presence.

657
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:45,356
<i>Thank you for your advice.
We Geminis are curious by nature.</i>

658
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,860
I'll go ahead. Maybe I'll meet
some of my old acquaintances.

659
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,904
<i>Good luck. I'll find you later.</i>

660
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,920
He's so young.

661
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,477
"Mighty Sovereign Emperor,

662
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:10,441
the peaceful nature of Persia
and the sacred union that exists

663
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,902
among His Majesty and the shah
both were upset by evil.

664
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:17,531
Under the influence of this power,
a frenzied Tehran crowd

665
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,117
committed unheard of acts of evil.

666
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,078
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.

667
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:27,333
The honest heart of Fath 'Ali Shah

668
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,668
was horrified by the idea
that a handful of wrongdoers

669
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:32,212
might destroy our peace and union.

670
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:36,300
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson,

671
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:43,849
to request that you, Sovereign,
erase from memory this event.

672
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:48,729
Let the world know that,
despite this terrible event,

673
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,815
two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom,

674
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:55,027
speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.

675
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,489
With the greatest joy,
I stand before you,

676
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,825
Your Imperial Majesty.

677
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:05,037
I carry out my grandfather's will-

678
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,210
that we strengthen peace
between our two peoples."

679
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:36,360
"His Imperial Majesty

680
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,905
commands me to assure Your Excellence

681
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:46,036
of his pleasure at hearing your explanation,

682
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,960
as well as the righteous plea
of your sovereign."

683
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,140
I've been observing you.

684
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,100
Who let you in here?

685
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:53,187
- You have no business here.
- No business at all.

686
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:58,025
Then you must leave at once.

687
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,527
Off you go, sir. Away.

688
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,531
- I had no intention of staying.
- Away.

689
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:08,285
This ceremony will continue
for a few more hours still.

690
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,458
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.

691
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,295
A terrible boredom will set in.

692
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,005
A terrible boredom.

693
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,924
Leave me alone.

694
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,677
- And what is that?
- What did you say?

695
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,815
I adore luxury and regal splendor.

696
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:44,071
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.

697
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:49,368
He loved discipline,
but left space for breathing.

698
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,666
<i>We cannot stay here.</i>

699
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,502
<i>The ceremony will finish.
Then they will all come in.</i>

700
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,212
My God.

701
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:07,010
This is Svres porcelain.

702
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:08,762
My weakness.

703
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,223
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Yes, yes.

704
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,769
- It's inimitable.
- <i>Beautiful.</i>

705
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:22,109
This is the Cameo Service, isn't it?

706
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,652
Yes, it is.

707
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,909
Not so close, please.

708
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,713
What gold.

709
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:47,134
Sir, it's awkward setting the table
with you here.

710
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:52,222
You can admire it later
when you are seated.

711
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:53,932
What pure tones.

712
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:59,354
The blue and gold are enchanting.

713
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,233
And the wine sediment color.

714
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:07,446
Always such marvelous cooks
here in the Winter Palace.

715
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,282
<i>Do you recall the taste of food?</i>

716
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,117
No, I have forgotten.

717
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,744
<i>You've forgotten.</i>

718
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,331
Visit the other salons
while waiting for the dinner bell.

719
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,125
- That blue.
- Please, sir.

720
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,585
I beg you.

721
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,670
There's dancing. Come on.

722
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:25,547
I beg you. Please.

723
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:28,008
We beg you. Please.

724
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,684
We're getting out.
We're getting out.

725
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,978
<i>They chased us out.</i>

726
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,524
<i>It's so dark here.</i>

727
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,532
Heavens.

728
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,245
I see you have never seen a czar.

729
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:03,961
Nor emperors, nor grand princes
in all their magnificence.

730
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,297
<i>Monarchy is not eternal.</i>

731
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:10,133
You think I don't know that?

732
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:13,136
Don't I have the right to dream a little?

733
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,556
<i>We are free, you and I. Dream away.</i>

734
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,434
<i>There's someone here. Do you hear voices?</i>

735
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,572
<i>Sir, don't you hear them?</i>

736
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:36,076
No, I don't hear anything.

737
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:44,334
<i>Look. Someone is moving there.</i>

738
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,211
Where?

739
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,880
Where?

740
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:57,431
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?

741
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:03,687
You and my father know that
no insects can harm this throne.

742
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,523
- It's made of silver and treated oak.
- It's not the throne.

743
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,443
I'm very worried.

744
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,405
Look at that velour from Lyon.
It's completely worn out.

745
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:17,117
- We'll restore it. Be patient.
- You don't have the time.

746
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,162
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time at all.

747
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,541
You won't ever see him again.

748
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,169
Speak.

749
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:29,838
He's your son.

750
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:37,095
<i>What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable.</i>

751
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,806
What do you expect?

752
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,143
You descend from the heavens

753
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,937
and no longer know how to behave yourself.

754
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:50,567
Your son is the director of the Hermitage.

755
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,569
Like you and I before him.

756
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,072
The wars ahead- terrible wars.

757
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:58,742
But we managed to preserve all this
through the catastrophes.

758
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:03,080
I can't hear anymore. Can you hear?

759
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:07,084
<i>I can hear, but not very clearly.</i>

760
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,920
What are they saying?

761
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,339
<i>The elder Piotrovsky is asking</i>

762
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:17,427
<i>whether the director's telephone
is still under surveillance.</i>

763
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:20,388
<i>His son says, "Forget about that.</i>

764
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:26,019
<i>I'd rather talk to you
about the Hermitage cats.</i>

765
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,522
<i>The cats are still here."</i>

766
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,278
There are so many people
that I wasn't able to help.

767
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:37,030
Ten years have passed.

768
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,491
You know what I'm referring to.

769
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,120
But everyone speaks well of you.

770
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:46,456
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli too.

771
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,625
That's particularly admirable.

772
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:52,295
The dead weep with joy
when their books are reprinted.

773
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:56,216
Especially 37 years later, Mikhail.

774
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,718
Is something still troubling you?

775
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,513
Is it the authorities?

776
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,642
They want acorns without oak trees.

777
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,479
They are not interested in knowing
how to nurture the tree of culture.

778
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:12,399
But it will be their doom
if the tree falls.

779
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:15,569
Then there will be nothing left.
Can't they understand that?

780
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,821
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?

781
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:25,370
- I'm coming.
- Speak!

782
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:29,249
- Listen, Mikhail.
- Let him go.

783
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,001
You're completely alone.

784
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:42,012
They won't tell him anything.
I know. Ask me.

785
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,847
<i>I am asking you.</i>

786
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,142
I know. Everyone can see the future,

787
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,563
but no one remembers the past.

788
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:57,444
Look how handsome they are.
Such fine young men!

789
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:03,033
Beautiful uniforms,
even if I don't like the military.

790
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,871
<i>You didn't answer my question.</i>

791
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,634
<i>You don't know. You don't know anything.</i>

792
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:37,150
<i>Sir. Wait. Wait.</i>

793
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,361
<i>He doesn't hear me.</i>

794
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,364
<i>I must apologize.</i>

795
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,618
<i>They were talking about all sorts of things.</i>

796
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,871
<i>I could hardly hear them.</i>

797
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:54,376
<i>I made it all up- about Orbeli.
About Piotrovsky too.</i>

798
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,964
- Only God can judge you.
- <i>I made it all up.</i>

799
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:02,342
We are free, you and I.
You said it yourself.

800
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,599
<i>Please, don't run.</i>

801
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:16,022
Run. I can't keep up with you.

802
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,693
Little birds.

803
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,909
Children.

804
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,162
Anastasia, where are you going?

805
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:36,376
They are...

806
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,295
so light.

807
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,548
You're always watching me.

808
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,848
- I have a bad feeling.
- Don't be alarmed.

809
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,060
Pray. And I shall pray for you.

810
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,812
Did you hear that?

811
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,484
Did you hear shots?

812
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,612
Calm down. God is with you.

813
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:11,578
I think someone is following us.

814
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,080
Calm yourself, Alexandra.

815
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:17,334
- If only Alexis could run.
- Calm yourself.

816
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,837
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.

817
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,840
It's my fault.

818
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,967
Children.

819
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:30,305
- Children, behave yourselves.
- Sorry, excuse us.

820
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,683
Come here, Anastasia.

821
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,520
Where were you?
I looked for you all morning.

822
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:40,648
- We were playing.
- Let's go.

823
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,487
Where is Alexis?

824
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,710
- Thank you. I can manage.
- Of course.

825
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:03,922
- Are you in pain?
- I'm fine, Mother.

826
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,715
Move your chair forward.

827
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:07,634
You're very strong.

828
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,681
You're late for tea.

829
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:17,102
- What?
- Forgive me, please.

830
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,981
Shall we forgive her?
What do you think?

831
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,067
Anastasia won't do it again.

832
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:27,445
See, it's all over.

833
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,617
Good-bye.

834
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:42,210
Why are these doors open?

835
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:46,840
Fly away, fly away-

836
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:49,467
Fly away, my little angels.

837
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:13,283
And here's their cage.

838
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,455
They're all here, of course.

839
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:23,042
There haven't been so many guests
for a long time.

840
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,586
Good evening.

841
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:36,514
Look at that strange fellow.

842
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,159
<i>But...</i>

843
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:01,414
<i>where has my European gone to?</i>

844
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,085
<i>Where is he?</i>

845
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,399
<i>There he is.</i>

846
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,155
<i>He doesn't see me.</i>

847
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,825
<i>I should go up to him.</i>

848
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,913
<i>Otherwise he will be offended.</i>

849
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:09,148
<i>Sir! He can't hear me.</i>

850
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,402
<i>But I'll see him later.</i>

851
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:40,138
Wouldn't it be nice
to jump about like that?

852
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,111
You know,

853
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:59,782
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.

854
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:10,793
What a tiger. He could eat anyone.

855
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,753
Your mother has trained the servants well.

856
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:06,891
You're doing very well.
The thing about the mazurka is-

857
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,160
We had an agreement.

858
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,840
More! More!

859
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:44,984
The Great Nicholas Hall is ideal for dancing.

860
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:56,954
Thank you.

861
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:01,792
St. Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.

862
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:07,381
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.

863
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,181
There must be over 3,000 people.

864
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,351
Maybe less.

865
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:34,617
I've forgotten everything!

866
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,662
I dance so poorly.
I've forgotten everything!

867
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:49,131
But it's all coming back to me.

868
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:53,803
Good. Very good.

869
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,311
How beautiful.

870
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,461
Thank you. Thank you.

871
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,435
More! More!

872
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:29,125
<i>Where were you? I lost you.</i>

873
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,293
I'm here. Here I am.

874
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,631
<i>I lost you.</i>

875
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,346
<i>Lost you.</i>

876
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,974
<i>I'm sad.</i>

877
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,988
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- Where to?

878
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,990
<i>Where to? Forward.</i>

879
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:05,744
<i>Forward.</i>

880
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,750
What will we find there?

881
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,711
<i>What's there? I don't know.</i>

882
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,505
I'm staying.

883
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:28,726
<i>Farewell, Europe.</i>

884
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,617
<i>It's over.</i>

885
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:55,002
You might say I grew up here.

886
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:00,216
I'm not quite myself.

887
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,845
As if I were in someone else's house.

888
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:33,415
Listen up! Look here!

889
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:37,044
Listen up! Look here!

890
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:43,425
Poor man, your lady has gone away.

891
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:48,806
- Flown away like a bird.
- Gone.

892
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,478
In a flash.

893
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:12,621
Look around us.

894
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:15,374
The flower of Russian officers.

895
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:27,011
I have an idea. Shall we dine together?

896
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,804
Good.

897
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,391
I'll wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.

898
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,811
Have our coats brought up.
And don't lose them.

899
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:02,129
When we return to Kursk,
we must organize a ball.

900
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:05,299
Perhaps just before Lent.

901
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:30,783
We should invite your nephew,
as well as Vareneka.

902
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,743
Let him see her.

903
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,748
Nathalie!

904
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,293
It feels like we're floating.

905
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:28,901
Let me pass.

906
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:33,739
Sir.

907
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,994
Let me pass.
Let me pass.

908
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:49,481
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

909
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:54,861
<i>A pity you're not here with me.</i>

910
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:59,866
<i>You would understand everything.</i>

911
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:04,246
<i>Look.</i>

912
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,874
<i>The sea is all around.</i>

913
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,631
<i>And we are destined to sail forever,</i>

914
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,927
<i>to live forever.</i>
